1
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:36,632
Woo ri.

2
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:39,901
- Woo ri!
- Is he out of his mind?

3
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:42,072
- Hey.
- Woo ri.

4
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:46,472
Woo ri. I'm your father.

5
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:48,911
Dad?

6
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:51,242
- Let go.
- Goodness.

7
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:54,981
Yes, I'm your dad.

8
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,182
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:00,251
How could you be my dad?

10
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,452
Because I am. I am your father.

11
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:05,122
Mom, what's he saying?

12
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:08,432
Well, the thing is...

13
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,791
- You said dad passed away.
- I'm not dead.

14
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:12,902
I'm right here. Your dad is right here.

15
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,171
Mom.

16
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,001
Is he really my dad?

17
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,711
Yes.

18
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:27,981
Why? How?

19
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:30,982
You said dad passed away.
How could he be my dad?

20
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:32,882
Your mother lied to you.

21
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:36,822
She can no longer hide
the truth from you.

22
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,621
Eun ran, tell her the truth.

23
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:43,792
My goodness. I guess
you drank too much.

24
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,161
No, mother. I didn't have
a single drop of alcohol.

25
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:49,001
"Mother"? Grandma, you knew too?

26
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:50,072
What?

27
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:54,572
Yes, I only found out recently.

28
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:58,581
You all knew except for me?

29
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,952
I was the only one who didn't know?

30
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,161
Wait, woo ri.

31
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,792
Hey! You stay out of this.

32
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:20,732
Mom, what do we do? Can
you go talk to her?

33
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:22,431
She's your daughter.

34
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:24,072
And I'm your daughter.

35
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,771
What do you want me to do?

36
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:28,872
Well...

37
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,811
I should get going.

38
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:32,981
What?

39
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,381
All right.

40
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:43,521
What? What is it? Oh, right.

41
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:46,862
I... I should get going too.

42
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:48,761
Okay.

43
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:54,361
Bye.

44
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:35,842
Mom, what was dad like?

45
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:37,642
Was he handsome?

46
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,681
Of course.

47
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,812
He was very famous for
his handsome looks.

48
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:46,281
Everyone said...

49
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:48,292
He looked like Leonardo dicaprio
from "Romeo and Juliet".

50
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:51,661
And he was very athletic too.

51
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,062
He was a team captain.

52
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:57,062
What kind of team? Soccer? Baseball?

53
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:58,962
Basketball is cool too.

54
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:02,132
Yes, basketball. He was the
captain of a basketball team.

55
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:05,271
On top of that, he
even got good grades.

56
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:08,042
He won awards in math competitions...

57
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,371
And even participated
in writing contests.

58
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:12,011
Really?

59
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,751
Is that why I'm a good writer?
Because I take after dad?

60
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,621
I guess so.

61
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,121
Anyway, he was good at everything.

62
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:24,122
Maybe that's why.

63
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:27,462
The lord loved him so much that
he took him at such a young age.

64
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:33,461
Woo ri, what would you want to do
with him the most if he were alive?

65
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:35,502
Nothing special.

66
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:38,342
Just... you know.

67
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:42,172
The things that other
kids do with their dads.

68
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:43,942
All of it.

69
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,352
I envy you, mom.

70
00:04:49,552 --> 00:04:50,582
For what?

71
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:52,651
You've met dad.

72
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:58,521
Right, that's true.

73
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:09,802
I'm sorry, mom. I'll never
bring up dad again.

74
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:16,812
It's okay.

75
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,311
Why did you lie to me?

76
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:26,322
We didn't have to live with him.

77
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:28,922
You could've at least told me
that my dad was alive somewhere.

78
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:31,322
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,991
You robbed me of the person called dad.

80
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,992
Why did you lie? Why?

81
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:38,401
Then you should've
never let me find out.

82
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:40,801
Why tell me now? Just why?

83
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:44,002
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,672
I really hate you.

85
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:53,382
How am I going to face you from now on?

86
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:34,152
You're going to stay here with me?

87
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,692
Raphael thinks that your
parents live abroad.

88
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:39,122
He thinks that you have
no family in Korea.

89
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:41,992
What if he finds out that I'm here?

90
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:46,161
He won't know. I told him I
was staying with a relative.

91
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,902
I told you to just hold out
until we came up with a plan.

92
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:53,071
You see, I'm human too. How can
I stay there and hold out?

93
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,841
I got ahead of myself
and ruined everything.

94
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,411
It's all over! Happy now?

95
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:59,312
Mal ja. What? It's over?

96
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,982
If you're homeless and have
starved for a few days,

97
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:04,652
then you can tell me it's over.

98
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,321
You know what it's like
because we've been there.

99
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:09,451
Do you think I want to live like that?

100
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:11,662
I want to keep wearing
nice clothes like this,

101
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:13,822
and I want the star cafe building!

102
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,732
But it's just not working! Darn it...

103
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:24,801
I'll just get a job that pays decently.

104
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:27,642
Let's just live in peace.

105
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:34,182
I guess you've been
under a lot of stress.

106
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,381
Mal ja.

107
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,781
Look at me.

108
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:41,152
Mal ja.

109
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,562
Hey, what happened to your face?

110
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:52,801
Hello.

111
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:57,172
Hello, I'm the one who called.

112
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,701
You see, my husband...

113
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:02,871
My gosh, it looks bad.

114
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:04,781
Sir, please come with us.

115
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,942
Sorry? Me? Why?

116
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,752
We received a call regarding a
domestic violence incident.

117
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:10,752
- What?
- Come with us.

118
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,052
Hold on. Hey, Lee ma ri.

119
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:14,352
Are you out of your mind?

120
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,091
Did you just hit your daughter?

121
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:19,091
No, I did not. Your husband did.

122
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:20,561
What are you saying?

123
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:23,162
Get your act together!

124
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:25,262
This is our last chance!

125
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:27,662
Go to the hospital now
and call Raphael.

126
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:28,932
Call the police too.

127
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:32,072
Tell them that your husband
hit you during an argument!

128
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:33,901
My goodness.

129
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:39,741
Wait, ma ri. Hey!

130
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:43,781
Have you lost your mind?

131
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:46,052
I told you I wanted a divorce.
Why are you doing this?

132
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:49,852
What is it? You want more alimony?

133
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,661
I don't need money.

134
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:54,792
I only want one thing.

135
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:59,161
Your love. And us living
a happy life together.

136
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:01,432
What?

137
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:05,272
You think you can get what you want
by pressing charges against me?

138
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,311
I just want you to know
that I'm doing this...

139
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:12,782
Out of desperation because I
really don't want to lose you.

140
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:17,282
If rumors get out that you hit
me, it won't do you any good.

141
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:18,882
What if people at the
hospital find out?

142
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,251
And what if woo ri finds out?

143
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:24,622
Then she won't give you the baby.

144
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,161
So you need this resolved fast, right?

145
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:32,662
Is this a threat?

146
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,371
You're really messed up.

147
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:26,981
Mom.

148
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,552
Grandma.

149
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:31,122
- Do you want more bread?
- Sure.

150
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,361
- Okay. Mom, I need more bread.
- Here.

151
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:49,641
I really...

152
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:51,782
Have a dad.

153
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:06,392
You're here.

154
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:09,832
Yes, hi.

155
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:13,832
You know, my friend...

156
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,071
Is getting hitched. She sent
me her wedding invitation,

157
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,372
but the guy is nine years older.

158
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:21,941
He looks so old.

159
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:25,382
Even a 12-year age difference
is common these days.

160
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,751
By the way, what's that?

161
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:37,751
There's something going on at home,

162
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,362
so I need to stay here for a few days.

163
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:46,362
So she fought with Kang jae, and
even her family is against it.

164
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:52,772
Are you really going to be like this?

165
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:53,902
Does this make sense to you?

166
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:56,571
Be reasonable, for goodness' sake.

167
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,742
Be reasonable...

168
00:11:58,741 --> 00:11:59,981
What for?

169
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:01,781
Just agree not to get a divorce,

170
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:04,012
and I'll drop the charges right away.

171
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:05,522
Hey, this is considered a threat.

172
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:07,322
Must you stoop so low?

173
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,022
I heard ma ri packed up and left.

174
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,252
I'll call you back.

175
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:15,162
The housekeeper told me.
What's going on?

176
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:16,992
Must I hear about it from someone else?

177
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:20,502
Yes, it's true.

178
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:21,932
I'm getting a divorce.

179
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:23,572
Why are you at it again?

180
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:25,842
You've fully recovered.

181
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,742
Now, you two can live a happy
life together with the baby.

182
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:30,441
Why would you get a divorce?

183
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:32,282
It makes no sense.

184
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:35,711
Ma ri...

185
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:38,152
You see,

186
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,652
ma ri...

187
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:45,021
Forget it.

188
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:47,361
It's complicated and personal.

189
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:48,931
Should we just quit the
cosmetics business?

190
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,461
Do you know how many companies
we work with through her?

191
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:54,761
You said you'd take care of
managing the hospital too.

192
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:56,802
Do you not care about the hospital?
You can't get a divorce!

193
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:57,932
What?

194
00:12:58,132 --> 00:12:59,872
It's a personal matter.

195
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:03,071
Why are you trying to
link it to the hospital?

196
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:09,781
Do not talk back to me.

197
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:17,822
Darn it.

198
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,632
Gummy bear.

199
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:31,402
I feel like there's no one else in
the world but just the two of us.

200
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:43,212
Will seoung il like this?

201
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,381
Do you think he'll like this?

202
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,682
It's not touching or engaging.
It's about forgiveness?

203
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,192
Come on! That's too boring.

204
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,691
He must seek revenge.

205
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:53,292
Are you telling me to write scripts
just to please the actors?

206
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:57,092
The character can't suddenly change
his personality and do that.

207
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:59,361
This is the way it should be based
on chun sa da's personality!

208
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,131
Ms. yu.

209
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:02,671
Did you just yell at me?

210
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:04,432
This isn't your first drama.

211
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,342
Do you not know what the viewers want?

212
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:08,041
So you only care about the ratings.

213
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,372
You don't care about the
quality of the drama!

214
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:15,082
Please calm down.

215
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:18,682
Let's have this meeting
again some other time.

216
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:21,992
If you don't fix the
script, I won't shoot.

217
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:24,852
I won't shoot a single scene.

218
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,491
Has he lost his mind?

219
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,761
He can go ahead and shoot
without a script, then.

220
00:14:31,762 --> 00:14:34,132
They can say and do whatever
they want in the drama.

221
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:35,871
Director park... I can't believe this.

222
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,701
He was a mere staffer when we were
working on writer wang's drama.

223
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:42,472
He couldn't even talk
back to me back then!

224
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,382
Please, have some water.

225
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,921
Ever since she was
writer wang's assistant,

226
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:56,052
I've helped her out so much.

227
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,392
But she thinks she got to
where she is all on her own!

228
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:00,961
I should've never helped her.

229
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:03,362
All right, let's go.

230
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:06,402
That jerk.

231
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:08,671
Woo ri.

232
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:11,972
Mr. choi.

233
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:13,171
You must've been so surprised.

234
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,542
I bet you didn't get any sleep either.

235
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:19,341
Oh, dear.

236
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:22,152
Are you free this
evening by any chance?

237
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,982
I want to have a talk with you.

238
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:34,161
Sure.

239
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,931
- I'm free.
- That's great.

240
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:40,562
Then I'll text you where
and when to meet.

241
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:41,731
All right.

242
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:43,902
- Seoung il.
- Yes?

243
00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:45,672
Must you choose the hard path?

244
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:47,972
You don't care what others might say?

245
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,572
Did they change my lines?

246
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:53,242
- Let's go talk about your outfits.
- What?

247
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:54,742
Okay.

248
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:18,872
Hello.

249
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,711
Here, it's for you.

250
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:29,151
Thank you.

251
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,381
My daughter.

252
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,151
Let me give you a hug, just once.

253
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:45,302
Why did you want to meet here?

254
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:46,462
Oh, this place?

255
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,501
I used to put on shows in this theater.

256
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:51,801
Let's sit down.

257
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,711
This is where I spent
years in obscurity.

258
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:58,881
I worked really hard.

259
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:03,682
But I've found a reason to
work even harder from now on.

260
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:06,481
The reason is you.

261
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:08,652
My daughter.

262
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,302
Oh, right.

263
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:22,232
I heard you were on a
basketball team back in school.

264
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:24,101
I'm tall, but I was never
good at basketball.

265
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:27,571
You participated in math competitions.

266
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:30,142
No, I didn't get along
with my math teacher.

267
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,712
I gave up on math early on.

268
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,011
I never liked math.

269
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,581
Then what about writing?

270
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:37,251
I heard you won a prize
in a writing contest...

271
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:39,981
Writing contest? Oh, please.
I never even kept a diary.

272
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:43,591
You may not believe this, but
I was never good at anything.

273
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:44,922
So...

274
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:46,621
I had to work extremely hard...

275
00:17:47,662 --> 00:17:49,062
To come this far.

276
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:53,131
If I were to tell you everything
I've been through in life,

277
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:55,232
we'd have to stay up all night.

278
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,671
Check my social media page.

279
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:01,872
You'll find an interview I did,
which was split into five articles.

280
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:04,912
Just read that, and you'll get an idea.

281
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,981
You'll be moved to tears.

282
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:15,451
You're following me on
social media, right?

283
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:16,591
Yes.

284
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:18,092
My follower count is
about to hit a million.

285
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:19,862
Soon, it'll surpass a million.

286
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:22,562
Among all the middle-aged actors,

287
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,791
I have the most followers.

288
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:25,662
I see.

289
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:28,772
Enough about me.

290
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,831
Tell me.

291
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:34,302
I heard you did very well in school
and that you're such a sweetheart.

292
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,941
My gosh, no.

293
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,381
I wish...

294
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:43,012
I was around when you were growing up.

295
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:48,381
Then you would've grown up in
a much better environment.

296
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:51,421
A better environment?

297
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:52,561
Yes.

298
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:55,961
Well, I'm not saying you grew
up in a bad environment.

299
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,961
I just meant that it
could've been better.

300
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:02,571
Anyway, I heard you were
getting married soon.

301
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:04,302
Yes.

302
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:08,471
Thank goodness I met you like this
and can walk you down the aisle.

303
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:10,542
It makes me so happy.

304
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:12,812
And...

305
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:18,512
Here, it's for you.

306
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:21,522
No, it's okay.

307
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,992
Come on. You can't buy it even
if you wait in line all night.

308
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:27,162
It's the newest laptop model.
It's sold out everywhere.

309
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:28,662
Take it.

310
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:31,061
No, it's really okay.

311
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:34,201
I can buy you stuff like this anytime.
Just take it.

312
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:37,301
Thank you.

313
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:43,472
Woo ri.

314
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:47,612
You see, I'm getting old.

315
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:49,852
So...

316
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:53,622
I had almost given up
on having a child.

317
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:55,921
But all of a sudden,

318
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:59,161
there you are, my sweet child.

319
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,331
You have no idea how happy I am.

320
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:06,761
Woo ri...

321
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:12,902
Will you call me dad...

322
00:20:13,842 --> 00:20:17,372
Just this one time?

323
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:35,862
Da...

324
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:41,301
That's close enough.

325
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,741
Go ahead, eat.

326
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:49,241
You might have trouble digesting.

327
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:51,742
You said you needed
to get a new laptop.

328
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:53,612
Just use it.

329
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:56,612
It's just too much.

330
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:59,521
He probably wanted to do
something for you, that's why.

331
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:02,022
How was your father?

332
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:05,922
I don't know. This all
feels unreal, still.

333
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:08,861
I feel like someone's playing
a hidden camera prank on me.

334
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:11,332
Have you watched "the Truman show"?

335
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,201
Yes, of course. The
one with Jim carrey.

336
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:17,171
You're just not used to it yet.
It will get better.

337
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:18,841
He's just...

338
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:22,411
Not the father I imagined.

339
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,841
It's just awkward and uncomfortable.

340
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:26,012
He's just a stranger.

341
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:29,351
Besides, he pities me for
growing up without him.

342
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:32,821
Don't be too sensitive about it.

343
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:34,482
You can't be friendly all of a sudden.

344
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,551
Take it slow.

345
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:37,622
Take it easy.

346
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:41,422
By the way, is that
where you're sleeping?

347
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:43,231
Oh, dear.

348
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:44,791
Do you want to sleep at my place?

349
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,501
I'll just sleep in the night-duty room.

350
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:49,331
It's okay. I told you it was.

351
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:55,401
Woo ri, haven't you...

352
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:57,872
Called your mother yet?

353
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:01,412
Why should I, when she isn't?

354
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:04,351
What? Where do you think this is?

355
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:06,721
I even told you not to call.

356
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:09,522
I met with woo ri.

357
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:12,522
- I even had a meal with her.
- What?

358
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,491
Didn't you know that I met with her?

359
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:18,291
Woo ri is staying at her office.

360
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,572
She left home that day, then.

361
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:26,442
I should get her some
things at her office.

362
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:28,242
You?

363
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:30,171
She works with me.

364
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:32,882
And I've been to her
office many times before.

365
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:34,312
Eun ran,

366
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:37,951
because she's my daughter,

367
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:40,281
I get along with her so well.

368
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:47,362
Mom, I've decided to live
with dad from now on.

369
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:50,292
Since I lived with you for 29
years, I'll be back after 29 years.

370
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,761
I'll see you after 29 years.

371
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:54,731
Gosh, no.

372
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:55,801
What?

373
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:59,642
Don't you pressure her.

374
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,241
She's having a hard time
after the accident.

375
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,971
What is that accident
you've been talking about?

376
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:06,441
You can tell me now, don't you think?

377
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:09,481
Woo ri being pregnant...

378
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:11,481
Was medical malpractice.

379
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,181
What? Medical malpractice?

380
00:23:18,352 --> 00:23:20,122
Ms. an soo yeon.

381
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,662
Yes, I'm an soo yeon.

382
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:23,632
I told you already. How many
times do you have to ask?

383
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:26,562
It is not too much when it comes
to checking a patient's name.

384
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:27,961
- Wait, sir.
- Let me go.

385
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:29,871
- Why won't you let me in?
- Wait, no.

386
00:23:29,872 --> 00:23:31,872
- Why can't I come in?
- You can't come in here.

387
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:34,542
Are you the one who made her pregnant?

388
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,741
- Who are you?
- Who?

389
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:36,941
I've made many people pregnant.

390
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:39,282
How can you do that as a doctor?

391
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:41,081
I should. That's what
an ob-gyn doctor does.

392
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:42,182
- Ob-gyn...?
- Who are you?

393
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:43,612
Aren't you the actor
from that daily drama?

394
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:45,482
No, I'm not. You're mistaken.

395
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:47,552
You are the one who got her pregnant.

396
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,681
My precious oh woo ri.

397
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:50,222
- Gosh.
- Right?

398
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,751
- Don't you understand?
- Who are you?

399
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:54,521
Who do you think I am? Who am I?

400
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:57,561
I'm her uncle, I am!

401
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,101
- Sir, you can't do this in here.
- Don't touch me.

402
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:01,102
- What do you mean in here?
- Why don't you step outside?

403
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:02,673
- Let's step outside.
- The hospital director lives...

404
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:04,272
In cheongdam-dong.

405
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:06,941
This place should just disappear!

406
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:08,572
I want this place to disappear!

407
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,842
I hope there are no
such mistakes anymore!

408
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,821
- How is everyone?
- Hello.

409
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:25,452
- What brings you here unannounced?
- Well...

410
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,621
- Are those for me?
- Of course.

411
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:31,162
- Take a seat.
- I'll share it with woo ri.

412
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:33,232
Yes. What a day.

413
00:24:35,132 --> 00:24:36,832
What?

414
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:40,772
The laptop I got you
is in the corner...

415
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:43,412
He bought that for you?

416
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:47,382
No, it isn't. That's not it.

417
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:51,581
Don't you think you
come here too often?

418
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:53,822
You should converse with
the writer all the time...

419
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:55,752
So that we can make this a better show.

420
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:58,492
When do you finish work?

421
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,292
Why don't we have a meal together?

422
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,091
How about some eel?

423
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:04,332
Why don't you get some
stamina from eating eel?

424
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:05,432
Well...

425
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:09,931
You must have an occasion where
you need a lot of stamina.

426
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:11,901
How did you know?

427
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,602
I have a new profound life goal...

428
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:19,142
That differs from all the
things I had before.

429
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:24,352
Right.

430
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:26,152
You are already in that
stage of the relationship.

431
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:31,152
Woo ri, you should go alone.
I don't want to go.

432
00:25:31,152 --> 00:25:34,692
What? Why? You like eating eel.

433
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:36,662
I'm not going.

434
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:41,702
You must have had a difficult
time living with your mom.

435
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:44,132
Since I am around now,

436
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:46,772
I'll try my best to do the
things I can for you.

437
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,572
I'm sure you couldn't do
everything living by yourselves...

438
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,712
And making wrong decisions as women.

439
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,711
What are the things
that women can't do?

440
00:25:56,551 --> 00:25:58,011
For instance,

441
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:00,381
changing the light bulbs?

442
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:03,991
All three of us can do that well.

443
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:06,862
Of course.

444
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:09,132
But since I am around now,

445
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:12,332
I'm sure you'll have a lot to
discuss with me from now on.

446
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:14,302
Like what?

447
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:19,971
Right. I'll just go on and say it.

448
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:23,572
I heard you decided
to have the child...

449
00:26:23,572 --> 00:26:24,572
You mistakenly got pregnant with.

450
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:26,982
Won't you give it a second thought?

451
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:29,511
I think you made an emotional decision.

452
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:34,422
I don't think it's your
business to get involved in.

453
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:36,421
- It's my business.
- Of course, it is.

454
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:39,462
I'm only saying this because it's me.

455
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:41,361
But it makes no sense to me.

456
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:44,131
How come there was no
one stopping you...

457
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:46,402
From making such an important decision?

458
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:51,071
You should have at least come
and discussed it with me.

459
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:53,972
What do you know about me?

460
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,371
You don't know what books
I like, the songs I hate,

461
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,511
the reason why the cat I
had for 10 years died,

462
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:01,611
nor the name of that cat.

463
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:03,682
You don't even know whether
I like flowers or not.

464
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:08,021
What is there to discuss with
someone who knows nothing?

465
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:13,961
Right.

466
00:27:14,622 --> 00:27:17,862
We should gradually get
to know each other.

467
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:23,101
But being pregnant is an urgent matter.

468
00:27:23,902 --> 00:27:26,072
I don't want you to have that child.

469
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:30,311
What did you tell mom
when she got pregnant?

470
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:33,312
Did you tell her not to have it
like you are saying right now?

471
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:34,411
No.

472
00:27:34,811 --> 00:27:36,651
I never said such a thing to eun ran.

473
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,212
She said she wouldn't have the baby,

474
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,051
- and I thought it was fortunate...
- Fortunate?

475
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:43,121
Then, I must be a misfortune to you.

476
00:27:43,352 --> 00:27:45,452
That is not what I am saying right now.

477
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:46,491
Oh dear.

478
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:48,022
Gosh, my head.

479
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:52,662
Woo ri,

480
00:27:52,662 --> 00:27:55,662
your mom's situation and
yours are different.

481
00:27:55,662 --> 00:27:57,472
Don't get involved in my business.

482
00:27:57,701 --> 00:27:59,371
Don't do anything.

483
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:15,152
Woo ri, I'm working right now.

484
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:17,151
Is it something urgent?

485
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:20,292
No, it's nothing. I'm sorry.

486
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:31,932
Long time no see.

487
00:28:31,932 --> 00:28:33,572
How are you?

488
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,802
Let's go in. Cheers.

489
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:41,242
The gambling joint is full of people.

490
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:44,511
Captain, do you think it is
possible for shin mi young...

491
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,791
To appear at a private gambling
joint after committing a murder?

492
00:28:50,652 --> 00:28:52,092
It doesn't smell fishy.

493
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:53,821
Are you a German Shepherd?

494
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:55,321
Do you sniff around to investigate?

495
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:58,162
This is the place where
shin mi young...

496
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:01,762
Came in and out so often that
the shutters are worn out.

497
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,601
Gosh, I'm not a German Shepherd.

498
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:07,272
Chairman Kim seems to be
involved with the hospital.

499
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:09,742
Don't you think we should dig
into diamond medical foundation?

500
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:13,782
No man chul loaned
millions shin mi young.

501
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:15,341
It's quite clear that...

502
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:17,852
No man chul was killed
because of his debts.

503
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:19,722
Why are you the only one
talking about chairman Kim?

504
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:22,251
To see this as a simple
personal grudge is...

505
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:24,121
And it's suspicious
that she disappeared...

506
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:26,592
Right after the cctv was restored.

507
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:28,791
I think there are more
people involved in this.

508
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,691
Be quiet. Gosh, stop
thinking, will you?

509
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:32,902
Just listen to me.

510
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:36,571
Yes.

511
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:49,012
Hello.

512
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:51,152
Hello.

513
00:29:53,852 --> 00:29:56,692
I heard you were getting a divorce.

514
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:59,122
I have no intentions of doing so.

515
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:01,262
- Excuse me?
- I don't want that...

516
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:02,691
For the baby.

517
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:05,162
Then, is it Raphael?

518
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:09,202
I really hope someone would stop him.

519
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:12,171
Gosh, are you hurt?

520
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,171
Well...

521
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:18,072
- Hello.
- Hello.

522
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:19,841
It's nothing.

523
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:29,151
Did you hit Lee ma ri?

524
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:30,222
Excuse me?

525
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:31,721
Ms. oh.

526
00:30:35,162 --> 00:30:37,192
Look at me. Look into my eyes.

527
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:41,002
Do I look like someone who would
hit a woman and bruise her?

528
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:42,502
Can't you trust me?

529
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:47,271
Sir.

530
00:30:47,272 --> 00:30:49,172
Ms. Lee's assault charge case seems...

531
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:52,142
Shall I come back later?

532
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:57,711
No, I'll leave.

533
00:30:58,582 --> 00:31:00,882
Wait, Ms. oh.

534
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:08,692
How did it go?

535
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:11,132
It's going to be difficult to
sue her for false accusations.

536
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:14,262
And I don't think the police will
look for evidence on your behalf.

537
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:18,001
All right. I'll look
into it myself as well.

538
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,921
You are still in the office.

539
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:34,922
I didn't know you were still in.

540
00:31:34,922 --> 00:31:36,152
It's okay. Go ahead.

541
00:31:38,092 --> 00:31:40,162
I'm getting in your way
since I'm working late.

542
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,391
It's not a problem at all.

543
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:45,932
I'll finish up and leave quickly.

544
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:48,502
Isn't she your wife?

545
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:51,402
She was here alone that night.

546
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:57,642
You went to that restroom over
there that night, didn't you?

547
00:31:58,241 --> 00:31:59,441
You were on cctv.

548
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,151
So?

549
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:13,792
She worked for a long time here
in the janitorial department.

550
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,521
Ms. Lee soon hee.

551
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:17,232
Do you know her?

552
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:19,031
How am I supposed to know who she is?

553
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:20,861
She saw you in the restroom.

554
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:23,401
She saw that you had a
bruise across your eye.

555
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,901
Before you even met me.

556
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:28,502
That can't be it.

557
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:32,642
Are you making up a false witness?

558
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:36,351
Stop lying.

559
00:32:36,682 --> 00:32:38,012
Did you really see me?

560
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:39,481
Lee ma ri, stop.

561
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:43,452
Just sign the divorce
papers quietly, will you?

562
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:50,061
Darn it.

563
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:10,512
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:12,612
I'm really sorry.

565
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:13,722
It's okay.

566
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:15,552
The situation called for it.

567
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:17,521
Gosh.

568
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:21,662
I know that...

569
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:26,401
You think the baby should be raised
in a household with both parents.

570
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:30,101
That's why I thought carefully...

571
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:32,332
About getting back with ma ri.

572
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:33,941
But...

573
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:36,371
That wasn't right.

574
00:33:40,442 --> 00:33:43,352
I was prepared to die from cancer...

575
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:45,382
But got a new life.

576
00:33:46,622 --> 00:33:48,652
Yet, I wasn't sure...

577
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:50,751
How I should live.

578
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:53,861
I had no meaning in my marriage life.

579
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,161
And I still don't get
along with my father.

580
00:33:57,632 --> 00:34:00,062
I don't know why I'm working.

581
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:02,731
But...

582
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:05,071
If I think about the baby inside you,

583
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:10,341
I want to live a full life,
being grateful for every day.

584
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:11,971
I really do.

585
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:18,751
But I've found a reason to
work even harder from now on.

586
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,421
The reason is you.

587
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:23,921
My daughter.

588
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:27,221
Yes, I can understand.

589
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:31,432
I believe you'll be a good father.

590
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:35,232
I'll make sure you have
nothing to worry about.

591
00:34:35,461 --> 00:34:38,601
I'm sure you already have
a lot on your plate.

592
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:41,572
With your father and all.

593
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:44,312
Yes.

594
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:51,151
I grew up without a mother,

595
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:53,682
and you grew up without a father.

596
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:57,022
Don't you think we
have a lot in common?

597
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:00,261
Well...

598
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,691
Since...

599
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:05,692
I didn't have a mother
when I was younger,

600
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:09,531
I was jealous of those kids
who brought packed lunches.

601
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:11,031
What about you?

602
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:13,502
What were you jealous of?

603
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:19,341
I just...

604
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:23,452
Was it in middle school?

605
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:27,422
I competed in a choir
competition in middle school...

606
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:29,482
And made it to the finals.

607
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:33,261
There were so many people that
filled up the auditorium,

608
00:35:34,222 --> 00:35:37,662
and I couldn't find
my mom and grandma...

609
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:40,061
Because the light was so bright.

610
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:42,402
But my friends who had
their fathers come...

611
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:43,632
Could find them easily.

612
00:35:44,302 --> 00:35:46,672
Fathers are taller...

613
00:35:46,672 --> 00:35:49,472
So it was easy to find
them if they waved.

614
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:52,772
But I couldn't find my
family until the end.

615
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:55,312
I see.

616
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:59,451
Now that you have a father,

617
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:02,651
try the things...

618
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,622
You couldn't before.

619
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:15,501
Woo ri, have you seen this?
We're in trouble!

620
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,201
Why is seoung il being this way?

621
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:19,532
Call me right after you
finish watching this video.

622
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:22,102
- What do you mean in here?
- Why don't you step outside?

623
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:23,471
- Let's step outside.
- The hospital director lives...

624
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,912
In cheongdam-dong.

625
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:28,082
I saw him at the golf course...

626
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,081
I know the director from that
hospital and this hospital.

627
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:33,251
You achieved something you couldn't
even when you were on a variety.

628
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:35,681
You're all over the entertainment news.

629
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,122
"Choi seoung il video scandal."

630
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:41,391
"People are angry about
power-tripping at the hospital."

631
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:43,491
"Choi seoung il's bare
face was revealed."

632
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,031
Why did you do it?

633
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:49,331
Can't we sue for filming secretly?

634
00:36:50,802 --> 00:36:52,272
Public sentiment is not on your side.

635
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:54,971
We've barely stopped journalists
wanting an interview.

636
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:56,712
Why?

637
00:36:56,711 --> 00:36:59,411
Why did you do that to that doctor?

638
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:00,782
That wasn't it.

639
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:03,481
Don't make such a mistake.

640
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,551
Darn it.

641
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,381
Darn it.

642
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,261
600,000 followers.

643
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:17,062
- Forgive me, please.
- When I went to the sauna with...

644
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:18,831
- The director here...
- Sir.

645
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:20,331
Please, sir.

646
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:22,561
This place should just disappear!

647
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:24,231
No, sir.

648
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:27,141
I hope there are no
such mistakes anymore!

649
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:31,271
I don't think I've done
anything wrong here.

650
00:37:31,472 --> 00:37:32,472
What do you want me to do here?

651
00:37:32,473 --> 00:37:34,583
Malpractice itself is a mistake.

652
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:38,781
I haven't taken any
legal actions so far.

653
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:41,551
I even thought about
just letting it go.

654
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:43,421
But this is not right.

655
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:46,562
Explain clearly why
such a thing happened.

656
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:50,331
Woo ri,

657
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:52,362
you came.

658
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:57,101
What did you do at the hospital?

659
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:00,002
- Did you see it?
- Of course, I did.

660
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,941
Everyone in the country did.

661
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:05,411
Well, I just...

662
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,142
Wanted to help you.

663
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:09,241
What help?

664
00:38:09,342 --> 00:38:12,412
Letting everyone know that I am
pregnant, is helping me out?

665
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:15,252
I told you not to get
involved in my business.

666
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,491
I couldn't do anything
for you for so long...

667
00:38:17,492 --> 00:38:18,722
So I wanted to do something.

668
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:21,092
I told you to do nothing.

669
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:23,962
You didn't want me to be born, did you?

670
00:38:25,161 --> 00:38:27,601
Isn't that why you keep saying
such things about this baby?

671
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:30,302
No, that's not it, woo ri.

672
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:32,702
Stop interrupting my life after
suddenly showing up like this.

673
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:34,441
I...

674
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,741
Had a happy life without you.

675
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:40,841
Mom and grandma raised me well so far.

676
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,012
You think buying me such a thing...

677
00:38:44,581 --> 00:38:46,081
Is doing a father's duty?

678
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:47,981
I don't need this.

679
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:50,891
Don't you ever call me.

680
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:52,652
Let's live as strangers...

681
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:54,162
Like before.

682
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:59,032
Mr. choi, why don't you
make your response.

683
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:00,631
What happened in that
power-tripping video?

684
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:01,962
- Please comment.
- Sir.

685
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:04,631
Why don't we talk privately?
Let's leave here.

686
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:06,902
I don't think this is a small matter.

687
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:08,701
Who's that with him?

688
00:39:08,702 --> 00:39:10,172
Gosh, sir.

689
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:11,712
Why are you doing this?

690
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:13,711
- It's nobody. Just leave.
- Who is that?

691
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:16,011
Why are you meeting her discreetly?

692
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:19,012
- Please leave.
- Mr. choi, please a word.

693
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:22,151
Sir.

694
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:26,961
Sir,

695
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:28,661
your camera is so old.

696
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:32,161
I'll get you a new one.

697
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,901
You think I'll let this go?

698
00:39:34,532 --> 00:39:37,002
I'm going to reveal all this.

699
00:39:37,172 --> 00:39:39,402
"A date with a young
woman at the han river."

700
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:40,871
Sir,

701
00:39:41,302 --> 00:39:43,842
I don't care what article you write.

702
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:48,411
But her face cannot be exposed.

703
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:50,751
- Because...
- Seoung il,

704
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:53,012
stop.

705
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:55,221
Please, let me ask you for this favor.

706
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:59,452
I'll give you an exclusive interview.

707
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:01,491
Why don't you write
an article with that?

708
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:05,261
Her picture cannot be exposed.

709
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:06,831
She...

710
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:13,901
She can't get hurt because of me again.

711
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:33,052
What are you doing here?

712
00:40:34,092 --> 00:40:35,392
Didn't you read the news article?

713
00:40:36,222 --> 00:40:37,332
What article?

714
00:40:38,391 --> 00:40:39,861
Choi seoung il's article.

715
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:55,811
What is this? This is a huge scandal.

716
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:57,351
How fitting for the main
character of a soap opera.

717
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:58,611
He has a secret daughter?

718
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:00,682
He must have had her when he was young.

719
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:01,851
He must have had a wild life.

720
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:03,651
He knew he would be criticized.

721
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:07,461
To disclose that he had a daughter
when he never got married,

722
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:12,061
duk chil made a huge decision.

723
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:16,631
Woo ri. I'm sorry.

724
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:20,071
I don't want your apology.

725
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,001
Why did you lie to me?

726
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:23,471
You lied to me that he was dead.

727
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:25,912
He never got good grades
or was ever athletic.

728
00:41:26,072 --> 00:41:29,342
Because of all the lies you told
me, my life became a lie too.

729
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,651
We were never going to see him again.

730
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,582
I thought telling you...

731
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:38,491
That he was dead was better
than explaining all this.

732
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:42,162
Just to make your life easier?

733
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:44,431
Is that why you've been
lying to me all my life?

734
00:41:47,762 --> 00:41:48,902
Yes.

735
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:52,772
Duk chil never got good
grades or was ever athletic.

736
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:55,272
He wasn't even that handsome.

737
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,111
But...

738
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,581
The affection he showed me was so pure.

739
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,411
When I told him I was
pregnant with you,

740
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:06,982
he truly cared about only me.

741
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,592
Duk chil's mother found
out and came to me.

742
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:16,291
"Stay away from duk chil."

743
00:42:17,262 --> 00:42:19,092
"You'll ruin his life."

744
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:23,001
She treated me as if I
was some kind of virus.

745
00:42:23,902 --> 00:42:26,772
She dragged me to a clinic
to get the procedure done.

746
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:32,471
I was scared, so I ran away.

747
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:37,782
When I decided to have you,

748
00:42:39,112 --> 00:42:41,352
I swore I wouldn't see him.

749
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:44,292
I never told anyone...

750
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:47,461
Who your father was. Not
even to your grandma.

751
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:51,331
So he was dead to me.

752
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:57,531
Then you should've
never let me find out.

753
00:42:59,632 --> 00:43:01,842
You shouldn't have told me about him.

754
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,041
If you didn't work with
him for the same drama,

755
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,741
I would have never told you.

756
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:12,252
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

757
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:26,492
No.

758
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,932
No, mom. It's not your fault.

759
00:43:31,601 --> 00:43:32,901
I...

760
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:35,872
I didn't know the full story.

761
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,542
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

762
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:02,532
Goodness. Seriously.

763
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,001
Just 100,000?

764
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:08,971
I should just delete my account.

765
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:25,821
Hey, woo ri. What's up?

766
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:28,862
Are you...

767
00:44:30,762 --> 00:44:32,332
Okay?

768
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:38,301
Gosh, of course.

769
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:42,141
I had to overcome worse
situations than this...

770
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:44,411
To get to where I am now.

771
00:44:46,472 --> 00:44:49,082
I'm all right.

772
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:53,111
And things will get better than this...

773
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:55,622
Because I have you now.

774
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:01,291
I need to go and work out now.

775
00:45:01,362 --> 00:45:03,392
Let's talk later.

776
00:45:04,592 --> 00:45:07,362
Okay. Thank you for calling me.

777
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:24,881
Woo ri. This is amazing news!

778
00:45:24,952 --> 00:45:26,152
What?

779
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:29,222
Isn't seoung il your father?

780
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:31,791
How did you know that?

781
00:45:31,792 --> 00:45:34,062
Hey, the story went viral.
How could I not know?

782
00:45:34,061 --> 00:45:36,161
He has a 29-year-old daughter
who works as a writer.

783
00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:37,762
Isn't that you?

784
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:40,631
Yes.

785
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:43,161
What a relief that he's your father.

786
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:45,732
What a relief!

787
00:45:45,731 --> 00:45:47,171
Is it?

788
00:45:47,702 --> 00:45:49,742
I suddenly have a dad now.

789
00:45:49,742 --> 00:45:52,012
Yes. It's a relief!

790
00:45:52,012 --> 00:45:53,472
He was never married,

791
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:55,042
but because he has a secret daughter,

792
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,241
everyone is badmouthing him.

793
00:45:56,242 --> 00:45:57,552
How is that a relief?

794
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:00,722
Will he get kicked out of the drama?

795
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:02,422
No.

796
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,822
I accidentally impregnated Mr.
Choi's daughter.

797
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:08,091
I'm sorry.

798
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:09,962
Gosh. I was really worried.

799
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:12,961
The doctor posted a video
to apologize to you.

800
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:15,361
So everyone is on your side now.

801
00:46:15,362 --> 00:46:18,232
The doctor made the mistake. And
choi seoung il is the victim.

802
00:46:18,231 --> 00:46:20,031
He was a dad first before an actor.

803
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:22,372
We had to stay neutral for this.
You never know how it will end.

804
00:46:22,371 --> 00:46:24,171
Seoung il was just being himself.

805
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:27,481
Gosh. It would have been really bad
for you if she didn't post this.

806
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:29,782
- Your career could've ended.
- Really?

807
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:32,151
- Seoung il.
- Yes?

808
00:46:34,181 --> 00:46:35,881
Do you know how worried I've been?

809
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:37,492
I can't believe Ms.
oh is your daughter.

810
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:40,821
I can't believe Ms. oh
woo ri is your daughter!

811
00:46:41,222 --> 00:46:43,092
This is the best news ever!

812
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,432
So I won't be kicked out
of the drama, right?

813
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:48,461
Nonsense! You've been getting
many offers for commercials!

814
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:50,001
You didn't check your social media?

815
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:51,071
What?

816
00:46:54,802 --> 00:46:56,802
- Gosh.
- I have over one million followers.

817
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:01,982
Hey, Mr. Kim. Who should I
thank for this outcome?

818
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:03,011
Oh, please.

819
00:47:03,342 --> 00:47:06,582
I worked really hard to
control this situation.

820
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:10,522
Of course, your contribution
was the biggest.

821
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:11,822
No.

822
00:47:12,992 --> 00:47:14,162
This is...

823
00:47:14,961 --> 00:47:17,291
All thanks to my daughter, woo ri.

824
00:47:20,262 --> 00:47:21,832
I'm back.

825
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:24,571
Woo ri. Are you just getting home?

826
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:27,372
- Are you done with your work?
- Yes.

827
00:47:28,172 --> 00:47:29,872
Grandma, you haven't had dinner. Right?

828
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,771
I'm hungry. Let's have dinner.

829
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:34,341
Is that so? Should I cook
a delicious meal for you?

830
00:47:34,342 --> 00:47:36,812
- Yes!
- I want something spicy.

831
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:39,581
All right. You have a
spoonful of gochujang.

832
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:40,581
What?

833
00:47:40,582 --> 00:47:42,422
I want something spicy too.

834
00:47:42,782 --> 00:47:44,252
Octopuses are in season now.

835
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:46,221
How about spicy stir-fried octopus?

836
00:47:46,222 --> 00:47:48,022
- Sounds good!
- Is she the only one who will eat?

837
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:50,491
What about your own daughter?
Am I not going to eat?

838
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,832
- What am I going to do then?
- Whatever.

839
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:53,091
You do whatever you want.

840
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:55,702
Goodness. Did you adopt
me or something?

841
00:47:55,702 --> 00:47:57,632
Yes, I did. So what?

842
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:18,721
Woo ri. I'm here. You're all right.

843
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:35,342
Father,

844
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:38,912
I did my best to change his
mind about the divorce.

845
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,641
I even did something I
shouldn't have done.

846
00:48:42,282 --> 00:48:45,252
But I don't think there's
anything I can do now.

847
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:47,452
I'm really sorry.

848
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:52,651
Don't cry. Stop crying!

849
00:48:52,652 --> 00:48:55,262
You know what I did?
I drove him crazy...

850
00:48:55,262 --> 00:48:57,232
With my tears and cries.

851
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:59,031
Mom, aren't you proud of me?

852
00:48:59,032 --> 00:49:01,102
But still. That was too soon.

853
00:49:01,762 --> 00:49:05,132
Your father-in-law already
mentioned the star cafe building?

854
00:49:05,532 --> 00:49:08,442
Yes. If you give me a
good plan like this,

855
00:49:08,442 --> 00:49:10,512
I will push forward no matter what.

856
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:15,241
Ms. Lee. You have a visitor.

857
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:16,581
Who?

858
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:18,851
He said you guys studied
together in Sweden.

859
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:23,621
He studied with me in Sweden?

860
00:49:29,822 --> 00:49:32,192
Who are you?

861
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,901
Mal ja. Your husband is here.

862
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:42,101
What are you doing here?

863
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:44,241
Did you break out of prison?

864
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:47,112
What are you talking about? A nice
guy like me wouldn't do that.

865
00:49:47,282 --> 00:49:49,182
They let me out early
since I behaved well.

866
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:51,611
They released me on parole.

867
00:49:54,552 --> 00:49:56,982
Get out of here. Don't ever
show up in front of me.

868
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:58,091
Come on.

869
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:01,162
This is no way to treat
me when we just reunited.

870
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:04,131
Have you been too busy living as
Lee ma ri, a rich family's wife?

871
00:50:04,331 --> 00:50:06,531
Did you forget that you're
married to me as Lee mal ja?

872
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:09,061
Are you threatening me?

873
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:10,131
Threaten you?

874
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:12,671
Gosh. That sounds scary.

875
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:16,802
Only thugs like your mother
would threaten people.

876
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:22,542
Hey. Hold on. Stop it.

877
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:24,882
- Stop it.
- Come on.

878
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:27,921
This should be enough to
knock some sense into him.

879
00:50:29,782 --> 00:50:30,852
Right?

880
00:50:30,851 --> 00:50:33,151
Did you forget what you
did to my mother's legs?

881
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:47,172
Come on.

882
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:52,441
So I got out after I paid
for what I did. Okay?

883
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:55,311
We're even now. Right?

884
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:57,711
I want to start afresh too.

885
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:00,551
Since you're doing well,
help me out. Okay?

886
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:03,121
I just need one million dollars.

887
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:06,621
Do you think I'm crazy?

888
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:08,562
Why would I give you money?

889
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:10,631
You spent years setting
up your identity.

890
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:12,792
If I talk, all of your hard
work would go to waste.

891
00:51:13,561 --> 00:51:14,831
I think my price is reasonable.

892
00:51:17,132 --> 00:51:18,732
I'm here to say hello today.

893
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:20,701
Gosh.

894
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:26,811
See you around.

895
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:39,151
All right.

896
00:51:46,092 --> 00:51:48,732
Get in. I'm on a stakeout now.
Come on, get in.

897
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:51,171
Get in now!

898
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:57,641
So you found more of shin
mi young's belongings.

899
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:10,382
Is that all of it?

900
00:52:10,992 --> 00:52:12,722
You asked me to bring
you anything I found.

901
00:52:15,222 --> 00:52:17,432
Sure. Okay.

902
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:20,231
Right.

903
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:23,661
Detective Lee.

904
00:52:24,132 --> 00:52:25,402
Let me ask you something.

905
00:52:26,632 --> 00:52:28,402
Are you investigating my hospital...

906
00:52:30,641 --> 00:52:32,811
On your own based on your
personal feelings toward me?

907
00:52:32,972 --> 00:52:34,842
Because my father is the
chairman of the hospital?

908
00:52:34,981 --> 00:52:36,041
What did you say?

909
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,411
Are you taking your anger out
on me about Ms. oh's pregnancy?

910
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:41,351
Are you?

911
00:52:44,521 --> 00:52:45,991
Gosh. This is crazy.

912
00:52:46,722 --> 00:52:48,262
I can't tell you the details.

913
00:52:48,722 --> 00:52:50,392
But I'm investigating because
the hospital might be...

914
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:51,461
Connected to crimes.

915
00:52:53,231 --> 00:52:54,331
I see.

916
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:55,801
I hope you close the case fast,

917
00:52:56,302 --> 00:52:59,672
so the patients at my hospital
won't feel uncomfortable.

918
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:00,872
Bye.

919
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:04,511
- Seriously.
- Hey. Be careful. Gosh.

920
00:53:04,942 --> 00:53:06,042
Come on.

921
00:53:07,172 --> 00:53:10,512
He didn't even bring me important leads.
Seriously.

922
00:53:12,282 --> 00:53:14,382
I mean, isn't this obvious?

923
00:53:15,121 --> 00:53:17,651
How will I find any evidence
from items like this?

924
00:53:35,702 --> 00:53:36,802
Hello.

925
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:39,671
I'm mi young's college friend.

926
00:53:40,172 --> 00:53:41,442
Where is she?

927
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:45,052
Mi young. Did you call
your friend here?

928
00:53:46,382 --> 00:53:48,022
Hey, shin mi young!

929
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:49,321
No.

930
00:53:49,322 --> 00:53:50,792
- Ma'am. Let go of me.
- No.

931
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,951
- Let go of me.
- No.

932
00:53:51,952 --> 00:53:53,652
Mi young is a good girl.

933
00:53:53,652 --> 00:53:55,222
Ma'am. Come on.

934
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:04,932
I'm sorry.

935
00:54:05,172 --> 00:54:06,572
I lost her right in front of me.

936
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:08,842
She's her foster daughter.
They were very close.

937
00:54:10,101 --> 00:54:12,211
We thought she had no relatives
because she was orphaned.

938
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:13,441
We totally missed it.

939
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:15,212
We found her car.

940
00:54:15,342 --> 00:54:17,042
This is a secluded area, so
she couldn't have gotten far.

941
00:54:17,112 --> 00:54:19,282
Right. I'll take a look around.

942
00:55:11,072 --> 00:55:12,672
Shin mi young!

943
00:55:13,972 --> 00:55:15,142
Shin mi young!

944
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:31,291
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

945
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:34,761
Hey, this is my school.

946
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:36,961
Seoung il asked us to come here? Why?

947
00:55:37,262 --> 00:55:39,232
Woo ri, let's just go in and see.

948
00:55:39,231 --> 00:55:41,231
Right. Let's go and check it out.

949
00:55:43,702 --> 00:55:44,872
Welcome.

950
00:55:45,072 --> 00:55:46,132
Please sit here.

951
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,502
What's this about?

952
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:50,341
A chorus competition will begin soon.

953
00:55:50,672 --> 00:55:51,812
A chorus competition?

954
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,441
I was so worried that we
might have missed her turn.

955
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,211
- We're going to start with that?
- The one on top.

956
00:55:58,282 --> 00:56:00,152
- The light is on. Film her now.
- Here?

957
00:56:00,152 --> 00:56:01,252
- Is it working?
- Why did we do that?

958
00:56:01,251 --> 00:56:03,381
- It's starting. Hurry.
- Hurry.

959
00:56:04,391 --> 00:56:06,021
Mom, look for woo ri.

960
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:08,021
Hold on. Where is she?

961
00:56:08,121 --> 00:56:11,231
Between the leaves

962
00:56:11,862 --> 00:56:13,432
a blue street light

963
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:15,361
isn't that her? Is that woo ri?

964
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:16,902
- It's not her.
- It's not?

965
00:56:16,902 --> 00:56:18,602
No. She was right there.

966
00:56:19,532 --> 00:56:21,302
- Where is she?
- Look closely.

967
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:23,271
- She's not there either. No?
- No.

968
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:24,811
Where is she?

969
00:56:25,472 --> 00:56:26,712
My goodness.

970
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:28,641
They're all about the same height.
I can't find her.

971
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:30,911
Hey, she's all the way in the back.

972
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:32,951
- Check the back. Yes.
- All the way in the back?

973
00:56:32,952 --> 00:56:34,152
- Her.
- Where?

974
00:56:34,152 --> 00:56:35,752
- That's woo ri. Right?
- Gosh.

975
00:56:35,751 --> 00:56:37,791
- Yes.
- That's woo ri.

976
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:40,651
- There's woo ri.
- Film her.

977
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:45,561
A wave of people

978
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:50,461
- is summer already gone?
- Is summer already gone?

979
00:56:51,231 --> 00:56:55,501
- A breeze already hugs the street
- a breeze already hugs the street

980
00:56:55,842 --> 00:57:00,412
- seasons come and go so easily
- seasons come and go so easily

981
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:06,712
- but - but

982
00:57:08,652 --> 00:57:12,092
- how far - how far

983
00:57:13,492 --> 00:57:20,632
- must we go around?
- Must we go around?

984
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:27,331
- A soft star is seen
- a soft star is seen

985
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:32,372
- between the leaves
- between the leaves

986
00:57:33,442 --> 00:57:36,582
- and your small dream
- and your small dream

987
00:57:37,141 --> 00:57:42,051
- is seen under the stars
- is seen under the stars

988
00:58:27,262 --> 00:58:28,502
- What about Raphael?
- I see.

989
00:58:30,061 --> 00:58:31,601
I had to clean up afterward.

990
00:58:31,601 --> 00:58:32,771
- I see.
- Okay.

991
00:58:33,532 --> 00:58:35,542
- Be careful.
- Okay.

992
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:36,701
Go for it.

993
00:58:36,702 --> 00:58:37,972
You should debut as a singer.

994
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,642
Wasn't she amazing?

995
00:59:26,851 --> 00:59:28,161
It's about Kang jae.

996
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:29,621
He must have a lot on his plate.

997
00:59:29,621 --> 00:59:30,921
Did you pay for it, Raphael?

998
00:59:30,922 --> 00:59:32,432
Of course. I invited you out.

999
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:36,061
Let's not hide anything or
lie to each other. Okay?

1000
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:37,731
I want us to try again.

1001
00:59:37,802 --> 00:59:39,072
What if it doesn't work out?

1002
00:59:39,072 --> 00:59:40,972
My daughter will be hurt twice.

1003
00:59:40,972 --> 00:59:43,142
I can't gamble with
my daughter's heart.

1004
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:46,911
Your husband should watch
this touching moment too.

1005
00:59:47,112 --> 00:59:48,312
Let's talk inside.

1006
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:50,881
He always picked up my calls.

1007
00:59:51,012 --> 00:59:53,412
Lee Kang jae was the
one who put on a show.

1008
00:59:53,411 --> 00:59:55,821
You didn't know your
boyfriend helped me, right?

1009
00:59:55,922 --> 00:59:57,052
Woo ri.

1010
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:58,222
Why did you lie to me?
