1
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,080
How could you say that to me? I'm the baby's father!

2
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:19,120
I can raise this baby well even if I have to do it by myself.

3
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,130
Is that you, Woo Ri? You're home late.

4
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,158
- I'm home. - Come inside and rest up.

5
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,799
What are you doing over there?

6
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,040
Mom.

7
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,040
Grandma.

8
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:11,109
Woo Ri. What's going on?

9
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,180
I felt lost before.

10
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,210
But now, I know I can do everything.

11
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,849
- What? - What? Do what?

12
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,189
You and Grandma helped me become that person.

13
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,859
I can handle everything the world throws at me...

14
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,329
just like you guys did.

15
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,559
Woo Ri. What are you talking about?

16
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,100
What?

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,640
(Episode 12)

18
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,479
(Writer Oh Woo Ri)

19
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:58,249
Hey.

20
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,759
What? The police did what to my dad?

21
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:04,659
You admit that it's you in the photo. Right?

22
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,200
Yes. I said that was me in the photo.

23
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,229
I went there to get some fresh air.

24
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,039
This is a free country.

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,739
Is going for a drive after my meal a crime?

26
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,709
Exactly. Why did you go there?

27
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,739
We have evidence!

28
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,240
How much longer will you play innocent?

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,710
Play innocent?

30
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,149
Seriously. I'm trying to be civil with you!

31
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,749
You guys are really crossing the line!

32
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,520
I wasn't going to bring this up because it would make me look petty.

33
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,860
The plant.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,990
That plant over there you broke.

35
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,400
Your salaries won't be enough to pay for that plant.

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,099
But I generously let that go.

37
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,269
How dare you treat me like a murderer after my generosity?

38
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,870
Are you sure you can handle the consequence?

39
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,080
Kang Jae.

40
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,979
What? Hey.

41
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,719
What are you doing there?

42
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,819
Don't touch my precious plants.

43
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,080
Hey, this is...

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,729
You didn't find the murder weapon at the scene?

45
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,469
But the stab wound on the neck matches Chairman Kim's MO.

46
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,510
Father.

47
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,979
Dad.

48
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,408
I heard the police came by late at night.

49
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,750
What are you doing here?

50
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,820
They found the scalpel with the late doctor...

51
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,090
Lee Jong Gu's blood in his plant pot.

52
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,619
Lee Jong Gu?

53
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,960
The doctor at our hospital?

54
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,060
He's dead?

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,528
Dad. Did you...

56
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,469
Don't even ask me if I killed him.

57
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:29,770
I have a headache. Be quiet.

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,479
I want to be alone.

59
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,909
Tell Lawyer Jung to come already.

60
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,479
How much longer must I stay in here?

61
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,560
Captain, we found it in the seat of Lee Jong Gu's car.

62
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,020
The evidence he was going to give to us.

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,728
What's this?

64
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,299
Chairman Kim was indeed giving makeovers to criminals.

65
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:55,029
The three of them were hired because they gambled at the parlour.

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,330
No Man Chul would bring in the criminals.

67
00:04:57,429 --> 00:05:00,098
Shin Mi Young would get the drugs and facility from the hospital.

68
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,570
And Lee Jong Gu operated on them.

69
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:03,809
I bet he made a fortune.

70
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,839
But No Man Chul threatened Chairman Kim...

71
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,879
with the list of criminals who got plastic surgery.

72
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,149
And Chairman Kim used Shin Mi Young who had a lot of gambling debt...

73
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,778
to get rid of No Man Chul.

74
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,979
Then he tried to make it look like Shin Mi Young killed herself.

75
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,749
When Lee Jong Gu who saw everything...

76
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,249
tried to contact the police, Chairman Kim killed him.

77
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,289
And...

78
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,389
the person who could...

79
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,289
easily coordinate everything at the hospital...

80
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,890
was the chairman.

81
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,630
Hey, this is amazing! We caught Chairman Kim!

82
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:30,769
Hey. I'll go and get the warrant.

83
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,639
Let's raid Diamond Medical Foundation now...

84
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,799
and get all the evidence. Okay?

85
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,440
Good work.

86
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,548
What's wrong?

87
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:45,380
We finally caught Chairman Kim. Shouldn't you be happy?

88
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,750
The faceless drug king...

89
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,820
is Chairman Kim Duk Bae?

90
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,890
All the evidence is pointing to him.

91
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,299
Ms. Yu.

92
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,769
Well,

93
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,969
it might not be the perfect time to bring this up.

94
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:10,210
There's no such thing. Just tell me now.

95
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,739
- He proposed. - What?

96
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,950
Oh, no. Did you get piles again?

97
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:21,919
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm okay.

98
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,289
Go on. What did you say?

99
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,830
Well,

100
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,858
he didn't propose to me...

101
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,299
because he was certain I was the one for him.

102
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:36,770
So I said no.

103
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:40,599
Gosh. You kind of...

104
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,310
You've gotten strong.

105
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,539
So what did Raphael say to that?

106
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:50,779
Whatever.

107
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:55,080
We had an argument. And he hasn't called since then.

108
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,089
Hey, don't let your pride stand in the way.

109
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,689
Anyone can just make the call first.

110
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,390
Call him and discuss it calmly again.

111
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:08,099
The Raphael I know isn't that unreasonable.

112
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,569
(Writer Oh Woo Ri)

113
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,869
Sir.

114
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,178
You're the most popular doctor here.

115
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,408
And you've been with us since the beginning.

116
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:22,080
What do you mean you're resigning?

117
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:23,810
Please reconsider.

118
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,820
I'll get going.

119
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,750
Wait. Sir.

120
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,190
- Wait. - What brings you here?

121
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,560
Are you here to see me?

122
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:39,330
Ma'am. Hello. Please come in.

123
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,400
No. I'll see you next time.

124
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:54,909
(Police)

125
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,789
I trust that you're innocent.

126
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:06,459
The truth will come out.

127
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,129
Thanks. Only you're looking out for me.

128
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,759
Gosh.

129
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,899
My only son hasn't even come by to see me.

130
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,109
You startled me. Gosh.

131
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,119
You're here.

132
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,420
I want to talk to him in private.

133
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,960
You want me to leave too?

134
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,559
But I'm family.

135
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,430
You're not family. Get out.

136
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,869
Dad, the crimes that took place in the hospital.

137
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,139
You really have nothing to do with them?

138
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,479
Are you...

139
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,080
suspecting me?

140
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,549
You think I killed people?

141
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,820
The criminals...

142
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,660
have secretly been getting new faces at our hospital.

143
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,190
In that weird room.

144
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,690
This business generated a lot of profits.

145
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,229
But you had no idea about this?

146
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,398
You really think I did it?

147
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,969
Why did you go...

148
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,498
to the murder scene? You went there twice!

149
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:29,570
That...

150
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,509
I'll tell you later.

151
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:38,479
I'll tell you when the time is right.

152
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,119
Some people will know that I'm innocent.

153
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,019
I'm just sad that it's not you.

154
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,099
Dad.

155
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:58,899
If you are connected to these crimes in any way,

156
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,340
I...

157
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,739
I won't ever see you again.

158
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,210
And I'm trying to save the hospital.

159
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,450
So resign from your position.

160
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:25,090
I'll catch you myself and kill you.

161
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:26,930
Then it'll be all over.

162
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:30,099
Captain.

163
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,200
The chairman is probably faking his medical condition, right?

164
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,339
I can't let him get away with this cheap trick.

165
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,739
We can't let that happen.

166
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,710
Are you going somewhere?

167
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,349
To the hospital.

168
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,109
I need to get my meds.

169
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,619
I'll be back.

170
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,259
Lawyer Jung!

171
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,489
I pay you to do your job!

172
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,499
Who is he?

173
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,800
Who is this Chairman Kim guy?

174
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:09,469
Why did he try to frame me for the murder?

175
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,509
Why me?

176
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,410
I've been at this for days, but I still don't know.

177
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,950
My blood pressure is rising. Give me my meds.

178
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:35,330
Chairman Kim.

179
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,700
If the police can't catch him, I'll catch him.

180
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,139
I'll catch him and destroy him!

181
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,769
This jerk...

182
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,780
Why...

183
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:52,320
Why am I feeling...

184
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:56,550
Sir! Are you all right?

185
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,680
Hey! The chairman isn't here!

186
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,210
He disappeared.

187
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:28,479
My dad...

188
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,018
He looked into a boat to stow away.

189
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,248
If he flees now, that's a serious offence!

190
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,660
We must find him as soon as possible.

191
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:35,259
Any ideas on where he might be?

192
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,259
It's over.

193
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,590
What?

194
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,300
Why do you think he fled?

195
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:42,229
It's obvious.

196
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,369
Ms. Im!

197
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:20,599
Over here!

198
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,508
Who did this to me?

199
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:25,739
Untie me right now.

200
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,618
What are you doing?

201
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:35,180
Come on. Get me out of here.

202
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,989
Did you do this to me?

203
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,399
My necklace is gone.

204
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,599
I must have left it in the writer's studio.

205
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,800
Chairman Kim?

206
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,820
(Do what I say. Or you'll die.)

207
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:27,800
Cinderella lost her parents

208
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,910
At a young age

209
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,249
And she was bullied

210
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,119
By her stepmother and stepsisters

211
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,320
You...

212
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,559
It hurts

213
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,690
It hurts very much

214
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,960
- How long did she cry? - Bye.

215
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,199
It hurts

216
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,139
It hurts very much

217
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,739
In 1980

218
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:13,180
You...

219
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:18,989
You...

220
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:22,790
You...

221
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,290
You...

222
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:33,070
Hyun Sook!

223
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,810
You're Hyun Sook,

224
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:38,910
aren't you?

225
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,310
Bingo.

226
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:52,320
Your brain is working pretty fast in a dangerous situation like this.

227
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,589
But you had no idea...

228
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,989
for the past two years I worked for you.

229
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,999
You...

230
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,969
Are you doing this because you think I abandoned you?

231
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,709
Think about all the money I sent you.

232
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,479
I provided for you more than other kids ever wished for.

233
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,649
You have this all wrong.

234
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,180
Let's talk it out.

235
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:21,879
Talk it out?

236
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,119
My poor mother died because of you!

237
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,819
You cheated on her when she was sick!

238
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,089
You transferred the deed...

239
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,559
and took bribes!

240
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,729
What are you talking about?

241
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,299
Your mother received treatments...

242
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,869
at the best hospital even to her last day.

243
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,499
I spent a fortune on her treatments.

244
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,169
You think money can solve everything, right?

245
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:46,209
You stole her hospital.

246
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,810
It was my mom's hospital.

247
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,550
I'm going to get it back.

248
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,810
That's mine.

249
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,349
I grew it.

250
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:56,148
Without my help, it would've stayed a small hospital.

251
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,349
Fine.

252
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,619
You can think about that in your death!

253
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:03,790
When your bloated dead body floats up in the reservoir,

254
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,789
people will think Chairman Kim threw himself...

255
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,598
into the water on the run after getting caught.

256
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,599
What?

257
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,970
And I will take over the Diamond Medical Foundation!

258
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,609
Then...

259
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,709
everything will go back to its place.

260
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,209
Hey!

261
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,409
Diamond is mine!

262
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:25,847
No! It's mine!

263
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,349
Hyun Sook!

264
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,780
Hyun Sook!

265
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:30,919
Hyun Sook!

266
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,489
Kim Duk Bae hid in the laundry cart...

267
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,688
and left the hospital.

268
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,230
Whoever pushed the cart is his accomplice.

269
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,990
You haven't found any leads yet?

270
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,958
We can't let others catch him first.

271
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,330
We did all the work!

272
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,669
Captain.

273
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,070
He's not Chairman Kim.

274
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,339
You startled me. Why isn't he Chairman Kim?

275
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,079
He left his clothes and wallet.

276
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,379
And his passport is still at his house.

277
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,780
He didn't even take any of his money.

278
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,549
Isn't this really odd?

279
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,348
Why is it odd?

280
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:02,079
Do you think...

281
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,020
a criminal would use his passport to leave the country?

282
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:06,089
I'm sure he got a fake ID or something.

283
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,959
And he must have a slush fund.

284
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:10,929
Some things just don't add up.

285
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:12,800
We must consider the possibility of abduction.

286
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,559
If you want to investigate however you please,

287
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,230
what am I doing here? And what's this meeting for?

288
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,569
Do whatever you want.

289
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,598
Where do you think you can investigate this?

290
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,699
Okay.

291
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,109
I'll go back to Diamond and talk to Ms. Im Yoon Ju again.

292
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,408
That's insubordination, right?

293
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,119
(Writer Oh Woo Ri)

294
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,649
- Gosh. - Wait.

295
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,520
He doesn't want to see anyone.

296
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,090
Sir.

297
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,159
Come on in.

298
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:47,030
Please sit.

299
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,830
What is this about?

300
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,570
Well,

301
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,209
you see...

302
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,540
I don't know where to start.

303
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,550
Okay.

304
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,619
I understand why Dr. Song is leaving...

305
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,820
to join another hospital.

306
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,619
It's not about that.

307
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:12,389
Well,

308
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,959
I think the chairman has been wrongfully accused.

309
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,330
I didn't tell anyone.

310
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:24,669
And the chairman told me to take it to the grave.

311
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:27,899
The chairman...

312
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,010
loved me.

313
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,848
What do you mean?

314
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:41,749
Aren't you and Mr. Song known to be a devoted couple?

315
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,520
I'm not embarrassed even if the world doesn't recognize...

316
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,220
me and Mr. Kim.

317
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,330
That's for another time.

318
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,270
But it's nonsense that Mr. Kim killed someone and fled.

319
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,269
I heard he became a suspect for being near the murder scene.

320
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,740
But that was because he was on his way to see me.

321
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,980
Wait.

322
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,379
Then, is that why he didn't mention going out to the suburbs?

323
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:17,649
And were you two together when he went abroad?

324
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,759
Then, why did he run away?

325
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,090
No, that's nonsense.

326
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,229
We need to find him quickly.

327
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,560
I'll tell everything to the police.

328
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,730
Right. Ms. Im.

329
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,039
She knows about us as well.

330
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,269
She planned our dates,

331
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,869
made restaurant reservations, and everything.

332
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,240
Ms. Im?

333
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,080
You should be more careful.

334
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,289
You're pregnant.

335
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,790
It felt like a cold snake was touching me.

336
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,970
Right. Thank you.

337
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,020
- The person is not available... - Why isn't he answering the phone?

338
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,129
Kang Jae, I'm leaving a message since you're not answering.

339
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,800
I think the culprit that broke into our home is Ms. Im.

340
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,928
I followed her.

341
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,270
I think she's Chairman Kim.

342
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,909
Why are you doing this?

343
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,780
Everyone who knows that I'm Chairman Kim is dead.

344
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,220
I'm at the hospital parking lot.

345
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,320
Detective.

346
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,000
- Yes? - My Dad has an alibi.

347
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,868
When Shin Mi Young Lee Jong Gu died...

348
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,830
he was meeting someone.

349
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:14,740
She even said she would testify.

350
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,909
I was right. He was abducted.

351
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,340
Excuse me?

352
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,108
You have one new message.

353
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:28,980
Kang Jae, I'm leaving a message since you're not answering.

354
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,790
I think the culprit that broke into our home is Ms. Im.

355
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,970
Stop!

356
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,899
Stop!

357
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,060
Get out of the car!

358
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:16,830
Get out!

359
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:21,570
What are you doing with a gun?

360
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,869
What?

361
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,250
- No, you can't. - Step back.

362
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,128
Hang up. I need to call for backup.

363
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,769
No, wait. Don't hang up.

364
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,698
I'm chasing her.

365
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:31,470
Call the entire police department in the country if you have to.

366
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,138
Woo Ri is in trouble. She can't get hurt.

367
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:37,249
I know. Chase them from afar.

368
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,510
I'm coming right now.

369
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,590
Sir.

370
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:45,750
Yes?

371
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,089
Can you follow them from afar so that we won't get caught?

372
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,229
Of course. I've done this for 20 years.

373
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,059
What is it? Is she your wife? Is she cheating on you?

374
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,099
Excuse me?

375
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,019
Ms. Im Yoon Ju. She was Chairman Kim.

376
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,980
What nonsense are you saying?

377
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,719
Mr. Kim who fled is the suspect.

378
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,020
Ms. Im took Woo Ri as a hostage.

379
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,719
In front of my eyes.

380
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,128
What? Woo Ri was taken?

381
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:26,159
- Where are you? - I'm on the chase.

382
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,059
She left Gangnam and is moving towards the east.

383
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,698
All right. Kang Jae, you only pursue.

384
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:35,540
I'm on my way so don't do anything else until I get there. Got it?

385
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,908
Ms. Oh. Are you okay?

386
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:45,080
Why did you bring her here?

387
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,879
It was all my fault. Really.

388
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,888
I really regret it.

389
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:52,449
Don't hurt other people anymore.

390
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,990
I'm the only one that needs to die.

391
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,230
It's all my fault.

392
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,129
Please.

393
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,149
Hyun Sook.

394
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,429
Hyun Sook.

395
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:40,599
The next time I see you, you'll be dead.

396
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:43,740
Hyun Sook.

397
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:45,340
Hyun Sook!

398
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,379
No.

399
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:04,188
I sent you the location.

400
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,888
It's some kind of children's theater.

401
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:07,628
Right. I'll be there soon.

402
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:10,570
The police are on their way. Don't move until I get there.

403
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:12,000
All right.

404
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,540
Hyun Sook.

405
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:16,939
What was that?

406
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,980
Hey, how did you get here?

407
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,879
Dad?

408
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:28,250
What are you doing in there? Come out, quick.

409
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,419
Do you think I want to be in here?

410
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,590
What?

411
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,090
Gosh.

412
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,290
What is this?

413
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,790
Darn it.

414
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,000
There.

415
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,399
Woo Ri. Are you okay?

416
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,070
Wait. Wait a second.

417
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,169
What do I do with this?

418
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,289
I'm here. I'm going in.

419
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,090
No. You can't go in there alone.

420
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,119
We'll be there in five minutes. No, three.

421
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:10,530
Wait!

422
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,398
Freeze. This is the police.

423
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,069
Gosh, that's scary.

424
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,039
I know you're the police. Detective Lee Kang Jae.

425
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,599
Put your hands up and turn around.

426
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,010
Congratulations. You finally caught Chairman Kim.

427
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:31,249
But Kim Duk Bae will die if you catch me.

428
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,050
Put your hands up and turn around.

429
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:36,519
Kim Duk Bae will die and his son will die...

430
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,720
along with his grandchild.

431
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,188
Oh, right!

432
00:28:40,189 --> 00:28:42,060
And you need to save your girlfriend, don't you?

433
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,230
Shut up. Stay where you are.

434
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,760
Where is Oh Woo Ri?

435
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,629
You're running out of time.

436
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,740
Kim Duk Bae will drown, and Oh Woo Ri will get electrocuted.

437
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,510
Will you be able to save any one of them?

438
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,209
Don't move or I'll shoot.

439
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,619
Make your choice.

440
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,619
Are you going to arrest me or save Oh Woo Ri?

441
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,119
Bok Rae. Listen to me.

442
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,790
Leave me.

443
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,530
It's dangerous here.

444
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,629
Take Ms. Oh and get out of here, quickly.

445
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,030
Bok Rae!

446
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:01,369
Look at my face!

447
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,040
Look at me!

448
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:07,879
I...

449
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:11,823
I should have been better to you.

450
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:17,093
I've been harsh on you...

451
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,494
as I felt bad for your mom dying so soon.

452
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:22,704
I'm sorry.

453
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:25,274
I've been a fool.

454
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,243
Please.

455
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,514
Please stop saying such meaningless things!

456
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:53,764
Woo Ri, you must have been startled.

457
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:55,862
Kang Jae. Help Mr. Kim.

458
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:57,602
Detective Lee!

459
00:30:57,603 --> 00:30:59,133
Please help with this.

460
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,613
Stop.

461
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:11,514
You can't break that.

462
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,082
What do you mean?

463
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,883
My Dad's going to die.

464
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:17,853
There's high voltage electricity all around.

465
00:31:24,764 --> 00:31:26,093
What do you do here?

466
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:27,764
What do I do?

467
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,464
Is this it?

468
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:37,542
There.

469
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:38,944
Move! Get out of the way!

470
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,403
Dad.

471
00:32:08,504 --> 00:32:10,274
Dad.

472
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:11,914
- Dad, are you okay? - Woo Ri.

473
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:13,372
Are you all right?

474
00:32:13,373 --> 00:32:15,184
It's okay now.

475
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:18,754
Dad.

476
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:22,653
Woo Ri.

477
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:25,053
Kang Jae.

478
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:27,424
Woo Ri.

479
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:50,313
What is it?

480
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,214
Wait.

481
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,153
Are you crying?

482
00:32:56,754 --> 00:32:57,823
No.

483
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:03,893
I really thought you were going to die.

484
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:15,343
I'm the one who almost died. So why are you crying?

485
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:19,643
I called you a murderer.

486
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:21,113
I've been...

487
00:33:21,684 --> 00:33:22,914
harsh on you.

488
00:33:25,484 --> 00:33:29,053
I needed to tell you I was wrong.

489
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:34,363
And that I'm sorry.

490
00:33:36,694 --> 00:33:38,593
I really thought I was losing you.

491
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:42,934
It's okay. It's not your fault.

492
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:46,233
It's all my fault.

493
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:49,503
I'm the one who taught you that way.

494
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:08,863
I'm sorry.

495
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:11,834
I've done wrong.

496
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,934
I didn't know Chairman Kim was a woman.

497
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,874
I thought she was a man since she had this on.

498
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:24,443
I'll find her.

499
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,382
Chairman Kim never revealed her identity before.

500
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:32,253
Would she hide now that we know her face?

501
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:33,853
What if we don't catch her forever?

502
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:35,684
I'd rather it happens that way.

503
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:38,023
Excuse me?

504
00:34:38,394 --> 00:34:39,724
I mean...

505
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:42,264
there shouldn't be more people getting hurt.

506
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,263
By the way,

507
00:34:45,264 --> 00:34:47,334
I heard Woo Ri was done with her check-up at the hospital.

508
00:34:49,863 --> 00:34:51,003
Woo Ri.

509
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:53,232
Kang Jae.

510
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:54,573
Are you okay?

511
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:56,442
Did the doctors say you're all right?

512
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:58,514
Yes. I'm okay.

513
00:35:00,784 --> 00:35:02,382
Why did you chase after the criminal?

514
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:04,112
You only needed to call it in.

515
00:35:04,113 --> 00:35:06,284
What if something happened to you?

516
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:08,354
Why did you do such a thing?

517
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:10,084
I'm sorry.

518
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:11,523
Calm down. Don't get angry.

519
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:15,724
All right.

520
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:19,664
Thank you, Kang Jae.

521
00:35:21,403 --> 00:35:24,974
I've never seen you this angry.

522
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:27,044
Well...

523
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,773
I'm sorry. Get home well.

524
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:32,744
I need to get back to the station.

525
00:35:33,744 --> 00:35:34,843
So I'll be off.

526
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:36,584
Okay. Bye.

527
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:50,334
Woo Ri.

528
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,894
Sir.

529
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:55,704
I was at the hospital and they said you went home after the check-up.

530
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:00,303
You must have been startled.

531
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:02,704
I'm okay.

532
00:36:03,173 --> 00:36:04,874
How's Mr. Kim? Is he okay?

533
00:36:06,974 --> 00:36:10,483
You risked your life to save my Dad.

534
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:12,084
Thanks to you, his name is cleared.

535
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:14,684
Thank you.

536
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:18,394
I came to say this.

537
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:20,463
It's okay.

538
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:23,894
I hope things will be cleared.

539
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:35,002
If I force myself to get married, lying to myself about my feelings,

540
00:36:35,003 --> 00:36:36,573
will that make the baby happy?

541
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:37,744
Woo Ri.

542
00:36:40,843 --> 00:36:44,113
I better head in now.

543
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:48,523
You should.

544
00:36:54,023 --> 00:36:55,923
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

545
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,144
Father!

546
00:37:10,843 --> 00:37:11,942
Are you all right?

547
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:14,343
- Gosh. - Are you hurt?

548
00:37:14,644 --> 00:37:16,083
How did you get kidnapped?

549
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:17,712
Isn't this crazy?

550
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,613
You're being too loud. My head hurts.

551
00:37:20,923 --> 00:37:22,454
I'm sorry.

552
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:25,153
I was so surprised.

553
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:29,693
It was you, Ma Ri.

554
00:37:30,363 --> 00:37:32,564
Yes. Yes?

555
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:35,303
Whenever something happened to me...

556
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:39,133
you were beside me.

557
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:44,612
Of course, it's you.

558
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:45,814
Good.

559
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:48,483
Since you're here, everything's good.

560
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:52,483
You should get back now.

561
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:55,784
Don't you have a lot to take care of at the hospital?

562
00:37:56,523 --> 00:37:58,593
Yes. I'll be back in the evening.

563
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:04,064
Thank you for coming.

564
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:18,874
Father.

565
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:23,483
Ms. Oh Woo Ri.

566
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:25,613
The baby's mother broke up with Raphael.

567
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:28,653
What? Why?

568
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:30,422
They were seeing each other because of the baby.

569
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:32,153
It must have not worked out.

570
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:37,593
Father, what if I make Raphael come back to me?

571
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:40,264
And what if we raise the baby as well?

572
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:43,503
Then, isn't it a good thing they broke up?

573
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:48,558
Good morning, Ms. Yu.

574
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,058
Ms. Yu?

575
00:38:55,397 --> 00:38:56,828
Are you okay?

576
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,660
We need to work on the script.

577
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,021
Are you really okay?

578
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:05,691
Let's work.

579
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:09,230
Quick. Let's go to the hospital.

580
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:10,429
Let's go to the hospital.

581
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,001
I can't be this way. I need to write the script.

582
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,240
Gosh. Ms. Yu.

583
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:18,540
Ms. Yu!

584
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:20,040
Wake up.

585
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,211
Don't shake me.

586
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,780
Don't shake me.

587
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,751
It's okay. I'll keep this a secret.

588
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:28,950
I'll tell the director that you have a herniated disk.

589
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:30,651
Don't worry.

590
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,291
You're the best.

591
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,090
But what about the script?

592
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,330
Ms. Yu!

593
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:41,429
Director, we're here.

594
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,069
My gosh! What happened? Ms. Yu!

595
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,171
Oh, no. What happened? Are you all right?

596
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,171
- Look at me! - You can't do that.

597
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,371
This patient needs absolute rest.

598
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,239
Don't do that. It'll aggravate her haemorrhoids.

599
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,381
She has haemorrhoids?

600
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,650
What's wrong with her?

601
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:07,461
Well, it's pretty serious at the moment.

602
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,260
She'll be hospitalized for two months.

603
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,561
Then what about our shoot?

604
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,631
Who will write the script?

605
00:40:26,211 --> 00:40:27,640
Is your shoulder bothering you again?

606
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,110
Go see a doctor.

607
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,750
What's the point?

608
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:32,081
Doctors say the same thing all the time.

609
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,990
My gosh. Mom! What's wrong?

610
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:41,791
Right here, you see that the cartilage has worn down.

611
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,160
I suggest you stop working.

612
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,601
If you don't, you'll require surgery soon.

613
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,171
You have to take it easy from now on.

614
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:03,311
My gosh, Director. Mr. Choi.

615
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,581
Woo Ri, do you think you can write the rest?

616
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:08,420
Pardon? What are you talking about?

617
00:41:08,421 --> 00:41:10,950
Our script, what else? The script for "Mask of Desire".

618
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,860
There's about a month left. Can you fill in and write the rest?

619
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:17,331
- Oh, that's... - Woo Ri.

620
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:19,190
Other than Ms. Yu,

621
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:21,929
you're the only person who knows what has happened so far...

622
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,370
and how the story is supposed to unfold.

623
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:27,199
Well, that is true. But...

624
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,240
Can you do it or not? You can't do it?

625
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,609
Well... It's...

626
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,510
I'm confident that you can do it. Let's do it.

627
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,651
Let's give it a shot.

628
00:41:50,831 --> 00:41:53,260
Writer Wang! What brings you by?

629
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:55,200
Everyone is here.

630
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,170
Writer Wang, are you sure? For real?

631
00:41:59,171 --> 00:42:02,541
Yes. My former apprentice has to drop out due to health reasons.

632
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:04,610
Of course, I should help out.

633
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,210
Then I'd be more than grateful.

634
00:42:07,211 --> 00:42:08,910
Hurrah!

635
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:22,860
Mom, you said Chun Sam wanted to go to Jeju Island with you.

636
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,230
You should go.

637
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:27,061
Come on. I can't. I have to make cutlets.

638
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:29,299
Did you not hear what the doctor said?

639
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,731
If you keep this up, your shoulder will get worse. Careful.

640
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,240
From now on, I'll make all the cutlets.

641
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,740
You should get some rest.

642
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,680
Come on. I'm stepping in to relieve you so you can go on dates.

643
00:42:42,941 --> 00:42:44,650
Ask Chun Sam to take you to nice places.

644
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:46,251
I can't trust you with the restaurant.

645
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:50,651
Besides, I can't even walk a lot because my legs hurt.

646
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:52,590
I know, exactly.

647
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,490
You should've travelled more when you were younger.

648
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,660
I'm the breadwinner of this family.

649
00:42:57,961 --> 00:43:01,759
A breadwinner must put her family before her own self.

650
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,330
Are breadwinners not allowed to have fun at all?

651
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,970
Are they not allowed to enjoy life?

652
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:08,970
I couldn't because I felt bad.

653
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,570
For whom?

654
00:43:11,311 --> 00:43:12,910
Your dad.

655
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,280
He was truly devoted to the two of us, you know.

656
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,581
He was only worried about us until the day he breathed his last.

657
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:25,151
I started this little family with him.

658
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:28,291
And he did his absolute best to protect our family,

659
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:31,061
so I wanted to do the same.

660
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,831
Mom.

661
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,800
You've been working hard as the breadwinner of the family,

662
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,139
and you've managed to protect this happy life that Dad built,

663
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,840
so it's about time you retired. Just travel and have some fun.

664
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,840
I'll take care of everything.

665
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,981
You'll take care of what?

666
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:53,210
I'll be the breadwinner of the family...

667
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:54,680
and run the restaurant too.

668
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,851
What's gotten into you?

669
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,390
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

670
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,791
I'm done chasing my dream of becoming a singer.

671
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:08,430
So it's time you retired from being our breadwinner.

672
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,831
I will be the family's breadwinner until Woo Ri can take over.

673
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,200
Eun Ran.

674
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:21,740
Mother, I heard you went to see a doctor... Oh, your arm!

675
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,739
What happened? Are you okay?

676
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,211
I'm fine. Actor Choi, are you busy today?

677
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:30,120
Stay for dinner. I'll grill some beef.

678
00:44:30,121 --> 00:44:33,190
Beef? Is it some kind of special day?

679
00:44:33,191 --> 00:44:34,760
No, not at all.

680
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:38,461
I think that life is a party every day.

681
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,530
So we're throwing another party today!

682
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:49,200
Hey, what are you doing here? How did you get in?

683
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,481
Can't you see what I'm doing? I fixed dinner for you.

684
00:44:55,211 --> 00:44:56,509
Let's have dinner together.

685
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,510
You never did this even when we were married.

686
00:44:59,211 --> 00:45:00,410
What's up with you?

687
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:04,021
Right?

688
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,961
I realized it too late.

689
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,360
Now that I've had a chance to see you from a distance,

690
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:19,371
I can see that what you wanted and needed was a normal family.

691
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,410
I made soybean paste stew for you to show you that I truly care.

692
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,811
Ma Ri, I...

693
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,081
I won't pester you anymore.

694
00:45:35,081 --> 00:45:38,590
I will wait quietly until you can see that I am being sincere.

695
00:45:39,021 --> 00:45:40,651
While taking care of Father...

696
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,461
and helping you with the business. I'll wait for you.

697
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:49,515
Today, let's just have dinner together.

698
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:07,464
I don't want to.

699
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,345
Why not?

700
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:14,913
I'm only asking you to have dinner with me.

701
00:46:14,914 --> 00:46:16,044
Ma Ri.

702
00:46:17,214 --> 00:46:18,944
Stop trying.

703
00:46:20,084 --> 00:46:22,484
This won't work out, ever.

704
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:27,655
- Why are you being like this? - Fine.

705
00:46:28,754 --> 00:46:32,564
Since you can't seem to move on, I'll just tell it like it is.

706
00:46:33,995 --> 00:46:36,164
Why do you think I asked for a divorce...

707
00:46:36,495 --> 00:46:39,405
as soon as I recovered from a near-death situation?

708
00:46:41,805 --> 00:46:44,845
You see, I had an inkling from the get-go, so I asked around.

709
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:50,245
I had so much time on my hands while undergoing treatment.

710
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:56,685
You conned me.

711
00:46:57,785 --> 00:47:01,095
What? What are you talking about?

712
00:47:01,894 --> 00:47:03,393
What do you mean I conned you?

713
00:47:03,394 --> 00:47:05,825
You lied that you were pregnant so I'd marry you.

714
00:47:06,064 --> 00:47:07,524
You schemed with the doctor...

715
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:10,564
and lied to me that you were pregnant.

716
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:13,564
I knew about it all along.

717
00:47:16,905 --> 00:47:20,373
Honey, that's... I was that desperate to...

718
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:24,514
Forget it. Let's end this once and for all.

719
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:27,584
I didn't tell Dad because of the hospital.

720
00:47:28,814 --> 00:47:33,155
I'm really sorry, but leave now.

721
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,825
It's not what you think.

722
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:38,094
Hear me out, please.

723
00:47:38,095 --> 00:47:40,794
No, I don't want to listen to what you have to say.

724
00:47:43,095 --> 00:47:45,604
Forget it. I'll leave.

725
00:48:04,484 --> 00:48:07,724
Kang Jae, I'll come by and see you soon.

726
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:08,825
I have something to tell you.

727
00:48:09,925 --> 00:48:13,265
Woo Ri and Raphael broke up.

728
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,955
Ma'am, you should go home and sleep.

729
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:15,124
No, it's fine.

730
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:18,925
Oh, boy. How far along are you?

731
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,264
I'm almost done,

732
00:49:21,265 --> 00:49:23,934
but I'll need you to go over it once.

733
00:49:23,935 --> 00:49:24,964
Really?

734
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:27,305
You're fast.

735
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:30,503
All right, then. I'll go home and get some sleep.

736
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:32,245
Call me when you're done, okay?

737
00:49:32,644 --> 00:49:34,414
Yes, ma'am.

738
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:38,515
Get home safely.

739
00:49:48,794 --> 00:49:49,894
("Mask of Desire")

740
00:49:52,581 --> 00:49:54,581
Writer Wang, I was worried for nothing.

741
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:56,952
It's 50,000 times better than Ms. Yu's scripts.

742
00:49:57,012 --> 00:49:58,581
You never let me down, Writer Wang.

743
00:49:58,722 --> 00:50:00,182
All hail Writer Wang! You're the best!

744
00:50:00,421 --> 00:50:01,651
I'm glad you like it.

745
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:03,020
Did you stay up all night?

746
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:04,321
How did you get it done so quickly?

747
00:50:04,322 --> 00:50:07,161
So we now have some time to spare, right?

748
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:08,230
Yes, sure thing.

749
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:11,461
Then let's visit Ms. Yu together at the hospital.

750
00:50:11,662 --> 00:50:12,932
Okay, sounds great.

751
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:24,912
Gwi Nyeo.

752
00:50:25,342 --> 00:50:27,912
Are you really going to upload this on the Internet?

753
00:50:28,012 --> 00:50:29,781
These days, video content is more popular...

754
00:50:29,782 --> 00:50:31,552
than photos or written posts.

755
00:50:31,622 --> 00:50:33,321
I need to get with the times.

756
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:34,722
I know that,

757
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:38,392
but who'd want to watch someone patching up holes in socks?

758
00:50:39,722 --> 00:50:41,561
I'm sorry to interrupt.

759
00:50:41,861 --> 00:50:44,291
My goodness. Look who's here!

760
00:50:44,861 --> 00:50:45,961
Hello.

761
00:50:46,061 --> 00:50:47,501
Are you making a video of something?

762
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:49,671
No, I'm just playing around. Anyway...

763
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:53,472
Hey, what brings you here?

764
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:57,611
Grandma, the thing is...

765
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,342
I heard.

766
00:50:59,842 --> 00:51:02,282
I actually thought of visiting you.

767
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,352
What happened?

768
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:07,822
It's my fault that we broke up.

769
00:51:08,992 --> 00:51:10,251
I regret it so much.

770
00:51:11,492 --> 00:51:13,122
I want to undo what happened,

771
00:51:13,561 --> 00:51:16,061
but I don't know how. It's killing me inside.

772
00:51:16,831 --> 00:51:19,461
I'm here because I wanted to get your advice.

773
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:31,242
- Writer Wang. - My goodness.

774
00:51:33,242 --> 00:51:36,211
You came all the way here, but I can't even greet you properly.

775
00:51:37,111 --> 00:51:38,282
I'm sorry.

776
00:51:38,381 --> 00:51:40,021
Gosh, it's okay.

777
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:41,952
You need to take care of yourself.

778
00:51:42,222 --> 00:51:45,961
How hard did you work that you ended up with haemorrhoids?

779
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:48,162
Don't worry about the drama. Just focus on your recovery.

780
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:50,691
Writer Wang helped us out, so all's been taken care of.

781
00:51:50,992 --> 00:51:52,561
We already have the next script ready.

782
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:54,231
It worked out for the best.

783
00:51:56,032 --> 00:51:57,302
Well...

784
00:51:58,001 --> 00:51:59,342
Writer Wang.

785
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:01,742
Thank you so much...

786
00:52:02,211 --> 00:52:04,311
for stepping in to help us out,

787
00:52:05,682 --> 00:52:07,381
but I think...

788
00:52:07,782 --> 00:52:11,751
we can have Woo Ri take care of the rest.

789
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:15,691
Ms. Yu, what are you doing?

790
00:52:20,021 --> 00:52:23,032
You see, I worked with Woo Ri for years.

791
00:52:23,492 --> 00:52:25,361
She's emotionally delicate and sensitive.

792
00:52:25,861 --> 00:52:28,130
I can see that there's a lot inside,

793
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:31,032
but she doesn't really know how to share it with others.

794
00:52:31,242 --> 00:52:32,771
And she prefers to stay in the shadows.

795
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:37,771
Right, she used to be like that.

796
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:40,541
But she's grown a lot.

797
00:52:41,782 --> 00:52:42,952
And she's becoming a mother.

798
00:52:44,352 --> 00:52:46,751
Ye Ri, Director Park. Listen carefully.

799
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:50,221
There are quiet ones who you don't notice.

800
00:52:50,222 --> 00:52:53,122
But if you take a closer look, they are actually very talented.

801
00:52:53,392 --> 00:52:54,630
As seniors in the industry,

802
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:57,662
we must guide them so they can flaunt their talents.

803
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:59,501
I say this because...

804
00:53:00,631 --> 00:53:01,831
I am...

805
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:05,242
I mean, I was one of them too.

806
00:53:07,572 --> 00:53:08,842
Woo Ri.

807
00:53:09,512 --> 00:53:12,642
You're talented. You've got all the nuts and bolts.

808
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:16,852
I'm here to make sure you wouldn't let this opportunity pass.

809
00:53:18,222 --> 00:53:19,452
Writer Wang.

810
00:53:21,052 --> 00:53:22,951
I came here to get Ye Ri's permission,

811
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:24,791
but she was thinking the exact same thing.

812
00:53:26,691 --> 00:53:27,892
Director Park.

813
00:53:28,432 --> 00:53:30,992
I didn't write a single word in the script you read.

814
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:34,401
It was all Woo Ri.

815
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:37,631
Seriously?

816
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,472
Woo Ri, you wrote it?

817
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,771
You're good, Woo Ri.

818
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:43,271
Be polite.

819
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:46,440
From now on,

820
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:47,881
call her Writer Oh.

821
00:53:52,722 --> 00:53:55,122
- Congratulations, Woo Ri. - Congratulations, Woo Ri.

822
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:56,452
Thank you.

823
00:53:56,751 --> 00:54:00,222
Our dear Woo Ri is finally making her début as a drama writer.

824
00:54:00,262 --> 00:54:01,330
A drama starring me.

825
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:03,061
My gosh, I'm over the moon right now.

826
00:54:03,592 --> 00:54:05,161
I'm only filling in.

827
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:06,702
I'll do my best though.

828
00:54:07,262 --> 00:54:09,900
My dear daughter, all your dreams will come true.

829
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:11,271
I'm always rooting for you.

830
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:13,041
Thanks, Mom.

831
00:54:13,572 --> 00:54:15,372
Hold on. He should be here any minute now.

832
00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:17,441
Someone else is coming?

833
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:20,241
Yes.

834
00:54:20,242 --> 00:54:21,351
Who?

835
00:54:21,352 --> 00:54:22,811
I invited someone too.

836
00:54:23,452 --> 00:54:24,722
He should be here any second now.

837
00:54:24,881 --> 00:54:26,322
What? Who?

838
00:54:40,168 --> 00:54:41,608
Hi, Lee Ma Ri.

839
00:54:43,439 --> 00:54:45,338
No, you are Lee Mal Ja.

840
00:54:46,209 --> 00:54:47,338
You...

841
00:54:47,479 --> 00:54:49,209
What the heck are you doing here?

842
00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:51,008
I came to retrieve what belongs to me.

843
00:54:51,278 --> 00:54:52,778
Here you go.

844
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:56,148
It's an important list. You should take it.

845
00:55:01,389 --> 00:55:02,528
Fine.

846
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:04,559
It's all over now.

847
00:55:07,298 --> 00:55:09,198
The Diamond Medical Foundation...

848
00:55:09,968 --> 00:55:11,269
and Raphael too.

849
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,898
It really is over now.

850
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:17,769
I want them all out of my sight.

851
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:20,838
What is this now?

852
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:23,179
Don't you dare put on an act in front of me.

853
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:26,648
I know that you've been sticking by the chairman's side...

854
00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:27,948
to get a building out of it.

855
00:55:28,548 --> 00:55:30,349
Right, that's how it all began.

856
00:55:32,019 --> 00:55:35,389
I was a crazy fool for thinking that things could work out with Raphael.

857
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:37,128
Really?

858
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:38,798
It's not going well, right?

859
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:43,298
Ma'am.

860
00:55:43,398 --> 00:55:45,338
Since you've retrieved the list, please leave...

861
00:55:46,298 --> 00:55:48,209
I mean, we'll just disappear quietly.

862
00:55:49,608 --> 00:55:52,778
You know that we can't even call the police.

863
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:01,889
Lee Mal Ja.

864
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:03,448
Do you...

865
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:06,218
want to be the boss?

866
00:56:07,588 --> 00:56:08,729
What?

867
00:56:08,758 --> 00:56:09,988
I can make you...

868
00:56:10,528 --> 00:56:13,258
the chairwoman of the Diamond Medical Foundation.

869
00:56:37,749 --> 00:56:39,189
All right.

870
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:43,988
They're both here to congratulate Woo Ri,

871
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,967
so let's celebrate together by making a toast.

872
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:49,768
Here's to Woo Ri. Cheers!

873
00:56:49,769 --> 00:56:50,798
Stop.

874
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:54,939
I'll just eat my food quietly.

875
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:04,309
Are you leaving?

876
00:57:04,718 --> 00:57:06,418
Sit down. Where are you going?

877
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:11,988
Woo Ri.

878
00:57:13,218 --> 00:57:14,389
Spare me a moment.

879
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:18,528
Woo Ri.

880
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:21,668
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

881
00:57:22,068 --> 00:57:23,499
I thought long and hard.

882
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:26,468
When we broke up,

883
00:57:27,168 --> 00:57:29,008
I was wrong about so many things.

884
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:33,179
Spending some time apart taught me...

885
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:36,309
that you're all I need.

886
00:57:37,648 --> 00:57:38,849
I just need you,

887
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:41,488
and I don't care about anything else.

888
00:57:42,218 --> 00:57:43,788
No, wait!

889
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:45,258
Stop! Wait!

890
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:47,789
Sorry. I startled you, didn't I?

891
00:57:49,628 --> 00:57:50,789
Darn you.

892
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:55,398
Woo Ri.

893
00:57:56,898 --> 00:57:58,568
I was wrong.

894
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:00,668
- What... - I'll be mindful of your pace.

895
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,607
I don't need anything else.

896
00:58:02,608 --> 00:58:03,909
I'll only think about the two of us.

897
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:08,008
I hope you know that I mean it.

898
00:58:11,249 --> 00:58:12,648
- Please... - Let's start over!

899
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:18,088
- Date me! - Date me, please!

900
00:58:56,505 --> 00:58:59,514
(Woori the Virgin)

901
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:00,627
Woo Ri, which one?

902
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:02,369
Raphael or Detective Lee?

903
00:59:02,398 --> 00:59:04,499
I want to start over with you.

904
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:07,338
Will you give me another chance?

905
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,338
Who should I choose?

906
00:59:09,709 --> 00:59:11,479
I am the first man she kissed.

907
00:59:11,909 --> 00:59:13,579
I know you the best.

908
00:59:14,778 --> 00:59:16,208
If I can't have it,

909
00:59:16,209 --> 00:59:17,978
I must get rid of it.

910
00:59:17,979 --> 00:59:19,349
I'll get it out of your sight.

911
00:59:19,418 --> 00:59:22,518
If it's for Woo Ri and Bok Dol, I can do anything.

912
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:24,088
Woo Ri, raise the baby with me.

913
00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:25,358
To tell you the truth,

914
00:59:26,218 --> 00:59:27,659
I've already made up my mind.
