1
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:07,398
What's this?

2
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:09,937
Throw it out.

3
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:16,578
Then this list will make us money.

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,507
You keep the list with you.

5
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:22,078
Give the necklace to someone.

6
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:23,977
Oh Woo Ri?

7
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:26,218
How are the scripts coming along?

8
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:28,047
They are great.

9
00:00:33,788 --> 00:00:36,528
Gosh. This is a set.

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,998
Goodness.

11
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:48,437
I put the necklace in her bag.

12
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:50,778
- No one saw you, right? - No.

13
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:53,747
You're sure nothing will happen to her, right?

14
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:55,517
Like what?

15
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:58,718
They'll scare her a bit and take the necklace from her.

16
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:01,618
Go to the hospital...

17
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:04,457
and spread the word Oh Woo Ri has the necklace,

18
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:06,657
so Chairman Kim knows.

19
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:08,058
Okay.

20
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:11,257
I should mention it here and there, so it won't look obvious. Right?

21
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:13,627
You don't have time for that.

22
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,597
Do it in one go.

23
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:18,266
- Hello. - Hello.

24
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,707
- Hello. - Hello.

25
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:24,078
You guys are working so hard, so I brought some coffee for you.

26
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:26,608
Thank you for the coffee.

27
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:29,516
How are things going? Do you need any help?

28
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:31,888
What? No.

29
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:34,118
Please have some coffee.

30
00:01:43,497 --> 00:01:45,467
Oh, no. My necklace.

31
00:01:45,568 --> 00:01:46,997
What about your necklace?

32
00:01:47,698 --> 00:01:49,598
My necklace is gone.

33
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:52,807
I must have left it in the writer's studio.

34
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:56,337
I left it in the assistant's seat. So she must've taken it. Right?

35
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:58,207
The assistant writer?

36
00:01:58,348 --> 00:02:00,547
I'm sorry. I don't follow you.

37
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,877
You know, her name is Oh Woo Ri.

38
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:04,647
I'm sure the assistant writer took it.

39
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:06,486
It was a present to me.

40
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:08,246
An artisan handmade the necklace.

41
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:11,087
He told me not to lose it, but I forgot it there.

42
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:13,288
I should get it from her later.

43
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:15,027
From Assistant Writer Oh Woo Ri.

44
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:18,797
Hello.

45
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,736
Were you trying to broadcast your chitchat?

46
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:29,337
I'm sorry. When did this happen?

47
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:31,638
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:33,948
Guys, let's go home now.

49
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:37,078
If you keep staring at it, your eyes will get bad.

50
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:39,547
You already checked everything before.

51
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:41,716
If Na Hee is right and there is a list,

52
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:43,318
where would that be?

53
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:46,158
The list of card transactions.

54
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:48,258
I'm reviewing every single document.

55
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:52,267
What? A necklace workshop?

56
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,026
What do people do here?

57
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:56,038
Hey. I went to one with my girlfriend.

58
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:58,607
You can pay and make a necklace you want.

59
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:01,306
Right. There are a lot of handicraft workshops these days.

60
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:02,378
Hold on.

61
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:06,908
You will be able to make the necklace however you want.

62
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:08,478
Right.

63
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:11,888
- What's this? - Your necklace.

64
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:15,457
You submitted it as evidence before. And I'm returning it to you.

65
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:18,017
Gosh. The one who gave it to me is dead now.

66
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:19,926
No Man Chul gave this to you?

67
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:23,427
He gave it to me and nagged me to wear it every day.

68
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,797
He was so sensitive when I didn't wear it.

69
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,227
- Darn it. - Where are you going?

70
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:29,967
- Where are you going? - Kang Jae!

71
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:33,068
Sir, do you remember this necklace?

72
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,638
I remember this.

73
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,677
A client custom-ordered this necklace.

74
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:40,377
He asked me to make a small gap in the necklace,

75
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:41,707
so he could insert a memory card.

76
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:47,788
I'm sure there's a list that shows their before and after photos.

77
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,657
- Thank you. - Sure.

78
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:54,928
(Lee Ma Ri, Team Leader at Diamond)

79
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:18,587
Mom.

80
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,618
Mom!

81
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:23,357
Mom!

82
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:24,957
Mom!

83
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,787
Mom.

84
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:29,227
Mom!

85
00:04:33,068 --> 00:04:35,868
Mom!

86
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:38,767
Mom. Are you all right?

87
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:42,238
What did you say?

88
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:46,048
Okay. I got you.

89
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:56,057
- Why didn't you answer your phone? - How did you find me here?

90
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,717
Where's the necklace from No Man Chul?

91
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:00,888
- I don't know! - I must find it.

92
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:03,498
It's not here!

93
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:07,267
Where is it then?

94
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:08,897
Oh Woo Ri has it!

95
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,337
Where's the necklace?

96
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:44,667
What necklace?

97
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:22,438
Grandma!

98
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:33,787
Woo Ri!

99
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:38,758
I'm a cop.

100
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,128
- Grandma. - Police.

101
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:51,298
Drop your knife

102
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:58,878
Please don't hurt my grandmother.

103
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:02,748
Chairman Kim?

104
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,748
Please don't hurt my grandmother.

105
00:07:14,357 --> 00:07:16,758
Don't move. Drop it.

106
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:22,938
Kang Jae!

107
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:25,808
Mom.

108
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:37,818
Fine.

109
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,048
Please let her go.

110
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,638
Grandma!

111
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,938
Grandma!

112
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,138
Grandma.

113
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:07,607
Grandma.

114
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:11,318
Oh, no. Grandma.

115
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:28,198
(Sungho Hospital)

116
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:40,908
Ma'am.

117
00:08:51,987 --> 00:08:53,357
Mom.

118
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:00,967
She has no external injuries.

119
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,038
They did a CT scan and examined her.

120
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:05,937
She had a concussion,

121
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:08,606
but due to her age, her vitals are a bit shaky.

122
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,938
When will she wake up?

123
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:13,648
She might wake up tomorrow or in a few days.

124
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:15,717
But they can't guarantee anything.

125
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:19,747
But she will wake up, right?

126
00:09:19,948 --> 00:09:21,117
She will.

127
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:23,886
They have to examine her brain...

128
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:27,058
once she wakes up to know if her brain had been damaged.

129
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:28,798
Okay.

130
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:34,068
You guys went through a lot without me.

131
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,097
Are you all right, Woo Ri?

132
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:38,237
Are you hurt? Should we get you a doctor?

133
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:39,607
No.

134
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:40,938
I'm fine.

135
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:44,408
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,684
She's hurt because of me.

137
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,015
Why is this your fault?

138
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:49,855
Had I gotten there sooner...

139
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,154
No.

140
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:55,794
I couldn't have done anything without Kang Jae. I was so scared.

141
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:58,725
Thank you, Kang Jae.

142
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:11,635
I have to go back to the scene.

143
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,205
Okay.

144
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:14,904
Thank you. You should get going.

145
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,615
Hey.

146
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:18,745
Woo Ri.

147
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,814
You must have been scared.

148
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,654
I'll catch the culprit.

149
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,194
He took the necklace.

150
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,554
He was looking for the necklace.

151
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,365
I had a necklace I didn't even know I had.

152
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:36,135
How did he know?

153
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,400
And his voice sounded like it was altered through a machine.

154
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,369
Where's the necklace?

155
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,569
It...

156
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,540
reminded me...

157
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,705
of a cold snake.

158
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,901
I'll take care of this right away.

159
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,831
Until then,

160
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:55,771
you must be careful and don't be alone. Okay?

161
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:56,901
Okay.

162
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,740
I'll get going now.

163
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:01,041
Call me if there's anything.

164
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:05,510
Kang Jae.

165
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:10,880
Thank you.

166
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,901
- There's Kang Jae. - That's Detective Lee.

167
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:23,171
So Chairman Kim was here?

168
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:24,472
What makes you think so?

169
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,911
The scalpel.

170
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,942
Chairman Kim took No Man Chul's necklace.

171
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:32,151
I'm sure the plastic surgery list of criminals was in the necklace.

172
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:33,951
Any evidence?

173
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:36,051
He's about 175cm tall.

174
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:37,492
And his build...

175
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:41,492
His shoulders were broad. And that's pretty much it.

176
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,761
It was dark, and he was covered up. He wore gloves too.

177
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,361
We found out his shoe size is 270mm from the footprints.

178
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:48,932
And that's everything the forensic team found.

179
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:50,801
Not even a fingerprint or a strand of hair.

180
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:53,072
This will be tough.

181
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:57,371
Gosh. This guy is meticulous.

182
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:06,082
Chairman Kim broke into Woo Ri's house.

183
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:08,222
But I lost him right in front of me.

184
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:10,182
I'll do whatever it takes...

185
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:12,352
to find him.

186
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:26,801
Just pack the necessities.

187
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:28,541
We'll be away for a few days.

188
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:31,271
You think Park Du Pal won't come back after a few days?

189
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:36,011
How did he get out of the chains?

190
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:40,151
If he wanted to harm us, he would have done it by now.

191
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:44,822
Considering everything he's done, he can't come after us.

192
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:46,920
Mom.

193
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:48,821
Weren't you scared when you were taped up like that?

194
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:50,791
Why would I be scared?

195
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:52,561
He'd better not show up.

196
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,401
I'm going to...

197
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:57,972
That startled me.

198
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,771
What are you doing here at this early hour?

199
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:06,212
The necklace.

200
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:08,612
Why did Woo Ri have that?

201
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:12,482
Do you know what's inside the necklace?

202
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:17,191
Something is inside the necklace?

203
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,492
Why did Woo Ri have that?

204
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:26,761
Did you give it to her on purpose?

205
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,301
Why would I give that to her?

206
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:31,370
I was carrying it because I didn't want to wear it.

207
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:33,231
But I remembered that I left it in her seat...

208
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:34,842
when I went there for a meeting.

209
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:37,102
Is that a crime?

210
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:39,871
You really...

211
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:42,982
don't know anything about the necklace?

212
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:45,410
I told you.

213
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:47,551
I didn't like it because No Man Chul gave it to me.

214
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:50,421
Did something happen?

215
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,891
Someone was after the necklace.

216
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,362
Who?

217
00:13:58,131 --> 00:13:59,692
We're investigating, so we'll find out.

218
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,641
You should go home. You need to go to work.

219
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,311
I'm not going to work.

220
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:19,911
I'll stay by her side.

221
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:22,921
Then go home and change your clothes.

222
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,051
Let's take turns.

223
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:26,151
I can't go.

224
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,291
I want to stay with her.

225
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,791
Woo Ri. Go and come back.

226
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:34,901
Go and bring me some clothes too.

227
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:36,602
You should bring back what you need as well.

228
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,041
The rosary.

229
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,571
The rosary?

230
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,072
We need her rosary.

231
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,611
She prayed with the rosary for important occasions.

232
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:51,910
And her prayers were answered.

233
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:54,322
The rosary she had ever since I was a kid.

234
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,881
I'll be back, Mom.

235
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,492
(Funeral Hall, Basement 2)

236
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:21,482
Hello?

237
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:23,242
Woo Ri. Did you go to work?

238
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:24,781
Raphael.

239
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:27,421
Woo Ri. What's wrong?

240
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,781
Is something wrong?

241
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:31,121
My grandma is unconscious.

242
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:32,952
What?

243
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:34,421
Sir.

244
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,591
The buyers from China have arrived early.

245
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:40,192
Something urgent came up. I'll be back soon.

246
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:41,332
What came up?

247
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:43,462
What's more urgent than our guests from China?

248
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:53,541
Sir, I'm really sorry. But I'm in a hurry.

249
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:54,742
I need to get there fast.

250
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:56,982
I wish I could help you too.

251
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,852
But it's not like I can fly. This is too bad.

252
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:07,621
What?

253
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,131
Why didn't you tell me about this?

254
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,531
I'm a teacher too. A teacher at a singing school.

255
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:16,901
So I'll be the perfect teacher of the day.

256
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:18,901
What will you teach us?

257
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,531
Singing.

258
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:22,170
Trot.

259
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:23,541
Mom. Please.

260
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:28,281
Woo Ri. What's wrong?

261
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:29,881
Is something wrong?

262
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:32,411
Nothing, Grandma.

263
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:34,822
I should pray too.

264
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:37,321
Do you want to borrow my rosary?

265
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:38,791
I have one too.

266
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,050
Woo Ri,

267
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:42,122
this rosary is special.

268
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,492
All the prayers are answered when you pray with this rosary.

269
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:49,101
I save it only for important occasions.

270
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:51,831
- Really? - Yes.

271
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:54,641
A long time ago when I was young,

272
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:56,570
at my first Communion,

273
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:58,040
my mother...

274
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,472
So your great-grandmother gave this to me.

275
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:02,682
From mother to mother.

276
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:04,611
It's been in our family for generations.

277
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:07,521
It seems like you have something on your mind.

278
00:17:07,882 --> 00:17:09,682
I'll let you borrow it this once.

279
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,091
What do I do?

280
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:22,001
I didn't tell her about the teacher of the day event.

281
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:25,701
I can't tell her because if I do,

282
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:27,402
I'm going to hurt her feelings.

283
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:33,341
I don't want her to act silly at school.

284
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:35,982
I think I'm going to be...

285
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:40,281
really embarrassed by my mom.

286
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,031
Where is it?

287
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,011
(Teacher of the Day Program)

288
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:15,652
Here is your sauce.

289
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,152
- Thank you. - Eat a lot.

290
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:18,750
Let me know if you need more.

291
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,121
Woo Ri, your mom is the best!

292
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:22,391
This is so good!

293
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,132
Woo Ri, your mom is so pretty. She looks like a celebrity.

294
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,501
Here.

295
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:32,202
Here's your rosary.

296
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:34,972
Okay. Did you pray with it?

297
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,511
Was your prayer answered?

298
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:38,972
Yes.

299
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:40,712
This rosary is the best.

300
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:42,941
Woo Ri.

301
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:44,952
Do ask me again.

302
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:47,921
When there's a prayer you want to be answered,

303
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:51,251
ask me if you can borrow my rosary again.

304
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:53,751
And then pray. Okay?

305
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:57,462
Grandma.

306
00:18:58,331 --> 00:19:00,232
Woo Ri.

307
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:50,581
Dry skin, combination skin, oily skin,

308
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:55,221
triple care, tone-up care, whitening care, and anti-ageing.

309
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:56,652
In total, we have seven types in our skincare line.

310
00:19:56,952 --> 00:20:00,091
Now, we'll take a look at the details in order.

311
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,521
Chairman Kim went into Woo Ri's house.

312
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:05,162
He was looking for a necklace.

313
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:07,090
He even altered his voice.

314
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:09,902
Altering his voice means that he's someone we were in contact with.

315
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:13,300
We need to check yesterday's alibis of the Diamond Foundation people.

316
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:16,242
We can't poke around the hospital without proper evidence.

317
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:18,040
We won't even be issued a search warrant.

318
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,741
You're not in the right mind because Woo Ri's house was robbed.

319
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:22,481
Let's calm down and respond.

320
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:26,010
Captain, Woo Ri's grandmother is hurt. How can I calm down?

321
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,152
Kang Jae.

322
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:29,851
I'll be going to a Patrol Division next year.

323
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,691
While I was working in the Violent Crimes division,

324
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:35,122
five got hurt badly and one died.

325
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:37,192
You are not in your right mind right now.

326
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:39,392
Big accidents happen in such a time.

327
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,531
People should no longer get hurt.

328
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:44,432
Get a hold of yourself first.

329
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:57,851
- Mom! - What is it?

330
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,482
You said we should take turns sleeping.

331
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,651
I dozed off.

332
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:09,661
Are you seriously sleepy in this situation?

333
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:11,392
Darn it.

334
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,961
He won't come here.

335
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:16,500
How would Park Du Pal know we are here?

336
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:18,632
You are the one who suggested the night watch.

337
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:21,401
I'd rather go home than do the night watch.

338
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:22,501
Wait!

339
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:25,271
Can't we just let everything go?

340
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:28,912
What if we get hurt or something?

341
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:33,251
I heard that he started to look for the necklace.

342
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:36,652
What if something really happens?

343
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:41,860
Mal Ja, that list in the necklace...

344
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:43,491
is definitely worth something.

345
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:46,692
Otherwise, they wouldn't have moved so fast to look for it.

346
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:51,472
We still need to wait. Okay?

347
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,682
(Device has been connected.)

348
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:17,491
I have the list that you want.

349
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:19,731
Don't even think about hurting me like No Man Chul.

350
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:21,830
If something happens to me,

351
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:24,501
the list will automatically be delivered to the police.

352
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,742
If you want it, make a payment.

353
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:35,442
You have a new message.

354
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:41,651
(You said this would be over when you got the list.)

355
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,350
(You said no one would get hurt. What's going on?)

356
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:44,791
(Reply back quickly before I put you away.)

357
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:48,921
(If I get caught, you'll be done for as well.)

358
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:50,520
(Just listen to me until the job is done.)

359
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:51,932
(Message sent.)

360
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:57,232
- Your son is here. - Okay.

361
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:01,541
What brings you all the way here?

362
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:04,770
I can't get a hold of Eun Ran since the morning.

363
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,111
I'm getting a little worried.

364
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:09,281
Is Ms. Seo Gwi Nyeo here?

365
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:12,051
I can't get a hold of her either.

366
00:23:18,892 --> 00:23:20,791
(Eun Ran)

367
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:31,472
Stop making me cry...

368
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:34,541
and wake up.

369
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:37,501
Mom,

370
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:41,412
the last thing I said to you was...

371
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:46,781
When we were fighting over Hyung Sik,

372
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:51,081
I told you I didn't want to be your daughter.

373
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:56,361
If you don't wake up like this,

374
00:23:57,492 --> 00:23:59,662
I will hate you forever.

375
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:03,261
I'll be the daughter...

376
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:07,372
that was spiteful to her mother because of a man.

377
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:22,351
Hello? Eun Ran.

378
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:24,122
Duk Chil.

379
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,051
Why? What's wrong?

380
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,291
Mom collapsed.

381
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:30,290
She won't wake up.

382
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:32,692
What? Mother is ill?

383
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:35,431
What do I do if she doesn't wake up?

384
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,801
What are you saying? She'll wake up.

385
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:39,232
Which hospital is she at?

386
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:43,402
I'm sorry, but I have a full schedule today.

387
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:45,810
It's okay. You are busy.

388
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:49,081
I'll call you back later. You take care of her.

389
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,551
You can't be weak. All right?

390
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:54,482
Okay.

391
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:04,461
Please take care of the rest.

392
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,531
- Where are you going? - Something urgent came up.

393
00:25:07,392 --> 00:25:08,530
What urgent thing?

394
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:12,431
We need to show our guests around the hospital and have dinner.

395
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:13,472
- Right? - Okay.

396
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:20,810
I'm sorry Woo Ri, I just left. Are you at the hospital?

397
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,711
I'm on my way to the hospital with a few things from home.

398
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,381
All right. I'll go and pick you up.

399
00:25:26,382 --> 00:25:29,021
No, it's okay. I think I'll get there faster if I take the taxi.

400
00:25:29,452 --> 00:25:31,122
Okay, then. I'll see you at the hospital.

401
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:45,601
- Woo Ri. - Kang Jae.

402
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:51,541
Isn't that the rosary that you borrowed from your grandmother...

403
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:55,781
every time something came up because it answers your prayers?

404
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:58,111
Yes, it is.

405
00:25:59,152 --> 00:26:00,882
Your grandmother will really like that.

406
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:04,692
What made you come back?

407
00:26:04,751 --> 00:26:08,061
I heard from Mother. I told you not to stay alone.

408
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:11,021
You must be really busy.

409
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:13,291
I feel bad about it.

410
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,261
It's okay.

411
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:20,472
Even if it's not for you, Grandmother did so much for me.

412
00:26:22,702 --> 00:26:25,071
Her soy sauce braised beef was so good.

413
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:27,771
It'll be difficult to taste it from now on.

414
00:26:28,182 --> 00:26:30,340
What? What do you mean by that?

415
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:31,982
Why are you saying such a thing?

416
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:34,952
I don't mean that.

417
00:26:36,452 --> 00:26:38,952
I mean since we broke up.

418
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:40,821
Right.

419
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:44,961
Right, last year...

420
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:47,132
Last winter when I was on a stakeout for a few days,

421
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:49,761
Grandmother came over with a packed meal.

422
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,872
It was so good, I still remember it.

423
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:55,402
Soy sauce braised beef and quail eggs were the best.

424
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:57,942
It must have been her sincerity, right?

425
00:26:58,912 --> 00:27:00,770
You know it takes a long time to make it.

426
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:02,840
It's difficult to peel the shells of each quail egg.

427
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:05,182
She uses the peeled ones.

428
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:10,851
Right.

429
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:16,820
Woo Ri, don't worry about it too much.

430
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:18,392
She'll wake up soon.

431
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:21,432
She's one of the strongest people I know.

432
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:23,132
That's right.

433
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,372
She'll wake up soon.

434
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:55,561
Grandma, your rosary...

435
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,560
It's just a rosary.

436
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:59,932
She collapsed because of me.

437
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:02,571
- Stop saying ridiculous things. - Grandma...

438
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,912
Grandma.

439
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:12,181
What's happening? What's wrong?

440
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:14,781
We'll tell you after we treat her. Please step outside.

441
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:16,251
Quick.

442
00:28:42,882 --> 00:28:46,011
Woo Ri, drink something warm.

443
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:41,541
I'm sorry I'm late.

444
00:29:42,872 --> 00:29:44,041
Woo Ri,

445
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,311
don't worry anymore.

446
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:48,111
I'm here now.

447
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,891
They said her vitals were off a little,

448
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:07,691
but they came back to normal quickly.

449
00:30:07,692 --> 00:30:09,401
So you don't have to worry too much.

450
00:30:09,402 --> 00:30:12,172
Why won't the doctors explain things clearly?

451
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:14,771
Emergency rooms are a bit like that.

452
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:16,372
They must have been busy, and things must've been hectic.

453
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:18,510
They said they didn't have any rooms and told us to wait in the ER.

454
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:19,511
But they moved us here.

455
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:22,581
It turns out that I had some people I knew at the hospital.

456
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,142
So I asked them for a favour.

457
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:25,652
They'll take care of her more from now on.

458
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:27,482
Thank you.

459
00:30:27,652 --> 00:30:28,781
No, it's nothing.

460
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:31,251
I should've come earlier.

461
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:33,591
Mr. Choi.

462
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:36,320
Didn't you say you have work? How did you make it here?

463
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:38,831
I cleared up my schedule. How is she?

464
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:46,531
She'll wake up soon. You can stop crying now.

465
00:30:48,172 --> 00:30:49,742
Only think good thoughts from now on.

466
00:30:55,212 --> 00:30:56,382
Detective.

467
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:03,051
I heard you missed the culprit at the scene.

468
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:07,591
I told you there was a criminal hiding in your hospital, didn't I?

469
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:11,692
- Yes. - That guy broke into Woo Ri's home.

470
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:13,961
Who is that man?

471
00:31:13,962 --> 00:31:15,202
I'm looking for him.

472
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:17,662
I'm going to catch him.

473
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:19,902
I'm never going to let this happen...

474
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:23,071
to Woo Ri and her family.

475
00:31:25,972 --> 00:31:27,142
I'll take care...

476
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:29,942
of Woo Ri.

477
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:44,791
This happened because of the culprit hiding in your hospital.

478
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,962
Two people died...

479
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:50,331
and I ran around to solve this.

480
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:54,771
But you were only concerned about the Foundation's image.

481
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:17,422
Hello? Hi. How are you?

482
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:18,932
It's been a long time.

483
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:20,491
Well...

484
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:23,301
didn't you say you had a person who caught an industrial spy?

485
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:25,972
Right. A private investigator.

486
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:35,682
Ms. Lee.

487
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:37,712
Are you feeling better?

488
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,212
You said you couldn't come in today.

489
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:42,652
Mr. Kim was looking for me, that's why.

490
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:44,952
We also have that PPL meeting later.

491
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:47,021
That meeting has been cancelled today.

492
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:50,192
There was a break-in at the assistant writer's home.

493
00:32:51,732 --> 00:32:53,692
- At Oh Woo Ri's home? - Yes.

494
00:32:53,992 --> 00:32:56,462
Someone in her family got hurt and is in the hospital.

495
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:01,202
(Sungho Hospital)

496
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:28,861
Woo Ri.

497
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:30,831
Yes?

498
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:33,232
Grandma's rosary.

499
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:37,541
She said it was a secret and told me not to tell you.

500
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,912
What secret?

501
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:42,642
Didn't she sound like...

502
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:45,752
that there's a long history with the rosary?

503
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:47,651
Grandma was lying.

504
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:50,981
Didn't she say it listens to your prayers?

505
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:52,921
That's also a lie.

506
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:56,992
Your grandmother...

507
00:33:57,461 --> 00:33:59,261
is a great liar.

508
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:04,932
Whenever you had concerns, you prayed with her rosary.

509
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:06,932
Every time you prayed...

510
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:09,642
she eavesdropped on your prayers...

511
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:11,702
and helped you behind your back.

512
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:20,952
I don't want her to act silly at school.

513
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:27,392
I think I'm going to be really embarrassed by my mom.

514
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:31,061
You said you'd do a singing lesson for Teacher of the Day, right?

515
00:34:31,062 --> 00:34:32,361
Yes, why?

516
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:33,961
You should change the subject.

517
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:35,432
What do you mean?

518
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:37,662
You should change it.

519
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:40,401
Is this the right thing to do?

520
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:42,571
Wouldn't a singing lesson be better?

521
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:43,671
Gosh.

522
00:34:43,742 --> 00:34:45,912
Do you want to teach students trot songs?

523
00:34:46,312 --> 00:34:48,510
I mean it doesn't have to be trot songs.

524
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:49,741
Just listen to what I say.

525
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:51,742
Everyone loves food.

526
00:34:53,452 --> 00:34:54,551
This is so tiring.

527
00:34:57,452 --> 00:34:58,491
Enjoy.

528
00:34:58,492 --> 00:34:59,690
Enjoy.

529
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:01,050
(Teacher of the Day Program)

530
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:02,091
Did you all get one?

531
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:03,921
You guys are eating well.

532
00:35:07,432 --> 00:35:08,702
Mom.

533
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:09,901
Thank you.

534
00:35:10,102 --> 00:35:12,702
Grandma was my guardian angel.

535
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:16,542
Thank you, Grandma.

536
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:21,242
I'll be your guardian angel from now on.

537
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:25,111
I'll take care of everything,

538
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:27,781
from what you want to want you need.

539
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:30,881
Just as you did for me.

540
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:32,591
I'll take care of it.

541
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:36,461
So Grandma,

542
00:35:40,562 --> 00:35:42,901
stop sleeping and wake up.

543
00:35:50,242 --> 00:35:51,372
This way.

544
00:35:53,772 --> 00:35:55,881
You must be worried...

545
00:35:56,341 --> 00:35:58,682
since this happened so suddenly.

546
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:00,851
According to the test results,

547
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:02,722
she doesn't have any serious external injuries.

548
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:06,191
And since she moved to the ward, her vitals are back to normal.

549
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:09,062
I don't think you need to worry much now.

550
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:10,721
Doctor,

551
00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:12,591
when will she wake up?

552
00:36:13,832 --> 00:36:15,062
Well...

553
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:18,901
that's the most difficult part to say.

554
00:36:19,131 --> 00:36:21,872
I heard you said that she was a strong woman...

555
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,472
and that she'd wake up.

556
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,312
Then, she'll definitely wake up.

557
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:30,511
She'll wake up soon.

558
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,852
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

559
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:37,852
It's the first time I heard something good since I got here.

560
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:42,121
I apologize for not being able...

561
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:45,162
to care for each patient and their families like we want to.

562
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:47,531
You must have been so startled.

563
00:36:49,102 --> 00:36:51,301
Many who work as a doctor...

564
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:53,171
are still quite young.

565
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:55,171
They can't sleep...

566
00:36:55,602 --> 00:36:57,242
and work frantically.

567
00:36:58,242 --> 00:37:00,912
Let me apologize on their behalf.

568
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,142
It's okay.

569
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:04,881
Thank you, doctor.

570
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:06,412
It's nothing.

571
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:10,082
It's only natural for your family.

572
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:12,452
- Thank you. - Thank you.

573
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:13,591
Thank you.

574
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:15,522
Let's have a meal together next time.

575
00:37:40,451 --> 00:37:41,621
Mom.

576
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,074
You said no one would get hurt.

577
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:07,191
You know how many people rushed over because you collapsed?

578
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:10,092
I'm so jealous.

579
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,861
You attracted enough attention...

580
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:18,231
so please wake up.

581
00:38:19,102 --> 00:38:21,102
I think I'll be annoyed if you keep this any longer.

582
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:24,811
Mom.

583
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:28,282
Please open your eyes now.

584
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:30,151
Stop making me cry.

585
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,651
Mom.

586
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:41,361
I really regretted saying those words to you because of a man.

587
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:44,361
I'm sorry.

588
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,802
I must have been crazy. He's not that important.

589
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:51,901
You are a lot more important to me.

590
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:54,771
Please forgive me.

591
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:57,512
Mom,

592
00:38:57,872 --> 00:38:59,512
I'll break up with Hyung Sik.

593
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:04,311
As long as you wake up, I'll break up with him.

594
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:06,682
I promise.

595
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:08,822
So...

596
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:11,452
you just need to wake up.

597
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:28,541
Grandma.

598
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:29,972
Mom.

599
00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:31,441
Gosh, Mom.

600
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:34,681
- Mom, you woke up! - Are you all right, Grandma?

601
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:36,781
Stop...

602
00:39:36,782 --> 00:39:38,722
- What did you say, Mom? - Goodness.

603
00:39:38,822 --> 00:39:41,251
Stop shaking me like that!

604
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:43,852
Mom, do you remember who I am?

605
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:46,691
- You? - Yes, who am I?

606
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:51,691
You are...

607
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:56,072
my troublemaker daughter who never listens to me.

608
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:01,341
- Grandma... - Mom.

609
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:02,642
Woo Ri.

610
00:40:04,742 --> 00:40:06,182
Oh, she regained consciousness.

611
00:40:06,342 --> 00:40:07,781
Mother, are you all right?

612
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:11,411
What? What are you doing here?

613
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:13,480
What do you mean? You collapsed.

614
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:15,521
Of course, I should be here.

615
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:17,791
You must be busy though.

616
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:20,461
I'm okay. I'm totally fine now.

617
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:22,790
I'll tell them to run some tests on you right away.

618
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,762
You're here too.

619
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:27,802
Yes. I'm so glad that you woke up.

620
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:30,071
Everyone is here.

621
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:31,901
Are we throwing a party or something?

622
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:36,142
Kang Jae. Where is Kang Jae?

623
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:37,411
Why are you looking for Kang Jae?

624
00:40:37,412 --> 00:40:41,781
Some burglars broke in, and Kang Jae came to my rescue.

625
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:45,751
That's right, Grandma. Kang Jae carried you here.

626
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:49,352
Hey, Kang Jae. It's me.

627
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:51,421
Yes, Grandma woke up.

628
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:54,190
You were the first person she asked for.

629
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:55,830
Is she okay?

630
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,992
- Hold on. - Thanks.

631
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:03,371
Kang Jae, I heard you saved me.

632
00:41:03,372 --> 00:41:06,941
No, Grandma. I'm so relieved that you woke up.

633
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:09,671
You saved my life.

634
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,711
Thank you, Kang Jae.

635
00:41:14,512 --> 00:41:17,282
Grandma...

636
00:41:22,552 --> 00:41:23,952
Don't cry.

637
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:30,831
- Are you okay now? - I'm fine.

638
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:38,231
Hey, are you all right?

639
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:42,242
Yes!

640
00:41:49,512 --> 00:41:50,581
Hey, Kang Jae.

641
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:53,452
I heard Woo Ri's grandmother regained consciousness.

642
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:57,651
- Yes. - Thank goodness, seriously.

643
00:41:57,992 --> 00:41:59,521
- Captain. - Yes.

644
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:02,860
There's something that exactly overlaps...

645
00:42:02,861 --> 00:42:04,361
with the two years that Chairman Kim was gone.

646
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:06,360
Let's think it over before we tell Captain.

647
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:08,161
No. What is it? Tell me.

648
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:10,730
Raphael's battle with cancer.

649
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:11,871
What?

650
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:13,471
Raphael was battling cancer...

651
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:15,441
during the two years that Chairman Kim was gone.

652
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:17,540
As soon as he recovered and returned to work,

653
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:18,912
Chairman Kim came back too.

654
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:23,012
Kang Jae, do you think you're Detective Conan or something?

655
00:42:23,581 --> 00:42:26,020
- Sorry? - Investigate!

656
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:27,682
Stop speculating.

657
00:42:28,052 --> 00:42:30,121
The chairman of Diamond is close to the higher-ups.

658
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:31,721
It's already making my life difficult.

659
00:42:31,722 --> 00:42:34,060
And what? You're after his son now?

660
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:36,290
If you snoop around without solid evidence,

661
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,961
we'll be on the chopping block before we catch the culprit.

662
00:42:39,961 --> 00:42:42,371
Well, since when did we care so much about the higher-ups?

663
00:42:42,372 --> 00:42:44,702
You already went there and caused trouble!

664
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:47,671
You see, the higher-ups are vying for a chance to teach you a lesson.

665
00:42:48,811 --> 00:42:50,810
Stop talking nonsense.

666
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:53,041
Anyway, I'm relieved.

667
00:42:58,711 --> 00:43:00,322
You have a new message.

668
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,451
(Lee Kang Jae is coming too close.)

669
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:03,822
(I'm struggling to keep him in check.)

670
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:07,520
(We should send him on vacation. I'll help you.)

671
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:08,521
(Message sent)

672
00:43:10,162 --> 00:43:12,331
Kang Jae, this came for you.

673
00:43:12,702 --> 00:43:14,801
What is this? Who sent it?

674
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:17,031
The courier left it out front.

675
00:43:17,032 --> 00:43:18,071
The conscripted officers brought it in.

676
00:43:18,072 --> 00:43:20,572
Goodness. They should've checked.

677
00:43:22,242 --> 00:43:25,171
(To Lee Kang Jae)

678
00:43:26,111 --> 00:43:27,111
What is this?

679
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:32,981
Isn't this for a safe?

680
00:43:33,722 --> 00:43:35,521
Where did I see this?

681
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:39,222
What? This is...

682
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:57,540
See? I told you.

683
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,440
Home is much safer than some motel.

684
00:43:59,441 --> 00:44:02,012
You won't run into Park Du Pal at work.

685
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,381
Just listen to me and...

686
00:44:10,421 --> 00:44:13,061
Hey, Park Du Pal.

687
00:44:13,662 --> 00:44:16,791
Don't do this. If you want money, I'll give you however much you want.

688
00:44:17,392 --> 00:44:19,431
- Don't do this, okay? - I don't need money.

689
00:44:19,432 --> 00:44:21,761
Then what do you want?

690
00:44:21,762 --> 00:44:23,572
I'll give you whatever it is that you want.

691
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,472
Just put the knife down, and we'll talk it out.

692
00:44:27,342 --> 00:44:28,671
What can you do for me?

693
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:32,282
You see, I wanted to get a decent job...

694
00:44:33,242 --> 00:44:35,041
and live a happy life with Mal Ja.

695
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:38,581
I had decided to devote myself to making her happy.

696
00:44:39,521 --> 00:44:40,581
But...

697
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,421
you beat me up just because we registered our marriage.

698
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:48,822
That's why I caused the accident, and I'm an ex-con now.

699
00:44:50,831 --> 00:44:52,461
You two ruined my life.

700
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:55,730
I just want to end everything now.

701
00:44:55,731 --> 00:44:58,671
If you want to end your life, go ahead.

702
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:01,101
But please let my daughter go.

703
00:45:01,102 --> 00:45:02,171
No.

704
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:06,440
I need someone to keep me company.

705
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:10,552
Hey, you're... You're still so young and can turn things around.

706
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,052
Why would you end your life?

707
00:45:13,452 --> 00:45:14,552
Put that down.

708
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:18,421
I said, put it down.

709
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,691
Put it down.

710
00:45:22,061 --> 00:45:23,830
Mom, do something!

711
00:45:23,831 --> 00:45:26,661
Hey, don't... Don't die.

712
00:45:26,662 --> 00:45:28,601
Do something!

713
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:31,330
Du Pal. I mean, sir!

714
00:45:31,331 --> 00:45:34,871
Sir! Please forgive me. I'm really sorry.

715
00:45:34,872 --> 00:45:37,941
Please... Please forgive me.

716
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:40,941
Lee Mal Ja.

717
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:45,822
I loved you.

718
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:49,852
Let's meet again in our next life.

719
00:46:02,932 --> 00:46:04,072
Mom...

720
00:46:06,602 --> 00:46:09,242
Mal Ja!

721
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:17,012
Mal Ja!

722
00:46:18,912 --> 00:46:23,221
Mal Ja!

723
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:25,352
No, Mal Ja...

724
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:29,553
Mom.

725
00:46:42,412 --> 00:46:44,782
Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?

726
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:48,267
Mom, I see that you can walk.

727
00:46:56,236 --> 00:46:59,537
Why were you in that wheelchair for the past three years? Just why?

728
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,006
To make me obey everything you say?

729
00:47:02,307 --> 00:47:03,477
Is that it?

730
00:47:04,346 --> 00:47:05,976
I only did it out of love.

731
00:47:05,977 --> 00:47:07,616
I don't want to hear it!

732
00:47:08,546 --> 00:47:11,116
You deceived me for three years!

733
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:15,756
You scumbag!

734
00:47:16,526 --> 00:47:19,997
What on earth have you done?

735
00:47:25,537 --> 00:47:26,767
I need to talk to you.

736
00:47:27,236 --> 00:47:29,006
Hear me out, okay?

737
00:47:31,636 --> 00:47:34,906
I'll take my hand off. Don't scream, okay?

738
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:44,756
Hey, your mom can walk!

739
00:47:48,187 --> 00:47:49,256
What?

740
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:52,296
Last but not least, I need to say this.

741
00:47:54,796 --> 00:47:56,466
She doesn't love you, Mal Ja.

742
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:02,966
So you don't love yourself either.

743
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,977
I could see it so clearly.

744
00:48:07,307 --> 00:48:09,207
So as a man who loved you, it broke my heart.

745
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:37,307
Don't worry, Raphael. I'm okay now.

746
00:48:37,636 --> 00:48:38,836
Thank you.

747
00:48:38,837 --> 00:48:41,006
Okay, go inside and get some rest.

748
00:48:41,176 --> 00:48:43,506
I'm so glad you could come home soon.

749
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:45,116
Thank you for everything.

750
00:48:45,377 --> 00:48:47,616
Visit us sometime. I'll make you dinner.

751
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:49,746
May I?

752
00:48:49,747 --> 00:48:51,386
You're always welcome at our house.

753
00:48:51,957 --> 00:48:53,116
Thank you.

754
00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:57,087
We'll see you inside.

755
00:48:57,596 --> 00:48:59,226
What? Wait.

756
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,457
- Good night. - Bye.

757
00:49:06,096 --> 00:49:09,037
You must've been really worried and scared today.

758
00:49:09,267 --> 00:49:12,307
You should go inside and rest up.

759
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:14,807
Raphael.

760
00:49:15,846 --> 00:49:19,276
Thank you so much, for real.

761
00:49:19,946 --> 00:49:21,017
I really mean it.

762
00:49:22,517 --> 00:49:26,155
Gosh, I didn't even do anything.

763
00:49:26,156 --> 00:49:28,186
Then why don't you let me take you out on a date?

764
00:49:28,187 --> 00:49:30,727
And please call me when you have some time.

765
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:35,061
I'm off tomorrow.

766
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:37,331
So am I. Then we should hang out tomorrow.

767
00:49:37,332 --> 00:49:38,901
I can see you tomorrow, right?

768
00:49:40,131 --> 00:49:41,242
Yes.

769
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:52,381
What? That was so quick.

770
00:49:52,582 --> 00:49:54,480
We left you two alone so you could talk.

771
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:56,122
I'm going to see him tomorrow.

772
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:58,690
Grandma, go inside and get some rest.

773
00:49:58,691 --> 00:49:59,851
Why are you still here?

774
00:49:59,852 --> 00:50:01,792
She's full of energy now.

775
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:03,820
I'm still a little dizzy,

776
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:06,432
but I'm trying not to show it because I don't want to worry you.

777
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:07,901
Grandma.

778
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,801
Your rosary broke.

779
00:50:12,332 --> 00:50:13,531
Oh, no.

780
00:50:13,772 --> 00:50:15,042
I wonder if it can be fixed.

781
00:50:16,941 --> 00:50:19,111
From now on, I'm your guardian angel.

782
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:21,012
My guardian angel? Why?

783
00:50:21,412 --> 00:50:24,181
You've been my guardian angel all my life,

784
00:50:24,182 --> 00:50:25,881
so I'm going to protect you from now on.

785
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:27,280
Right by your side.

786
00:50:27,281 --> 00:50:29,480
My gosh.

787
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:31,691
You're such a sweetie.

788
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:34,162
What about you?

789
00:50:34,892 --> 00:50:36,460
Me? What about me?

790
00:50:36,461 --> 00:50:38,090
When I collapsed, did you think of...

791
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:40,531
doing anything for me like my sweet granddaughter here?

792
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:43,602
Mom.

793
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:45,972
I'm going to stop seeing Hyung Sik.

794
00:50:46,272 --> 00:50:49,972
Why? You neglected me and went on about your boyfriend.

795
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:53,611
And I was wrong.

796
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:55,981
- I should break up with him. - Really?

797
00:50:56,312 --> 00:50:58,452
Then can I continue seeing Chun Sam?

798
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:00,952
By all means.

799
00:51:37,182 --> 00:51:38,292
What?

800
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:39,751
This jerk.

801
00:51:40,452 --> 00:51:43,091
My gosh. How many passports does he have?

802
00:51:45,392 --> 00:51:47,231
US dollars, the Japanese yen...

803
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:52,231
Here it is.

804
00:52:20,332 --> 00:52:22,360
When you're fixated on something, you go on about it like this.

805
00:52:22,361 --> 00:52:23,960
Honestly, I'm sick of it now.

806
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:25,832
Kang Jae, we can't be sure yet.

807
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:27,300
We have to look further into it.

808
00:52:27,301 --> 00:52:30,041
You're fixated on the fact that Raphael was fighting cancer...

809
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:31,411
during the two years that Chairman Kim was gone,

810
00:52:31,412 --> 00:52:32,741
so you're making this up.

811
00:52:32,742 --> 00:52:34,070
Come on. I've known you long enough!

812
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:35,812
I swear, I'm not making it up.

813
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:38,051
We just need a warrant. Then it's game over.

814
00:52:38,852 --> 00:52:40,011
Please.

815
00:52:40,012 --> 00:52:42,222
- Trust me just this once. - That's enough!

816
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:43,980
I feel drained now because of you.

817
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:46,251
Gosh, I'm exhausted. I need to go eat something.

818
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:47,921
Wait, Captain.

819
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,562
What?

820
00:52:56,332 --> 00:52:57,531
You saw it?

821
00:52:58,102 --> 00:53:00,941
I saw it, with my own two eyes.

822
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,251
What is this place? Is it a castle?

823
00:53:18,751 --> 00:53:20,051
This is so cool.

824
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,501
What is this place?

825
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,031
It's a restaurant.

826
00:53:34,872 --> 00:53:36,401
- Please leave. - What is going on?

827
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:38,111
- Hey! - What now?

828
00:53:41,682 --> 00:53:42,881
We have a warrant.

829
00:53:42,981 --> 00:53:44,412
We need you to open the safe for us.

830
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:48,852
Where is Raphael?

831
00:53:49,821 --> 00:53:50,992
He's off today, sir.

832
00:53:51,452 --> 00:53:53,150
The safe? Why? What's in it?

833
00:53:53,151 --> 00:53:54,222
Just open it.

834
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:56,661
And you'll see.

835
00:53:56,662 --> 00:53:58,662
He's not here, so how can I open it? I don't know the password.

836
00:54:00,762 --> 00:54:01,961
Oh, that's...

837
00:54:02,631 --> 00:54:04,001
We brought some tools for that.

838
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:06,372
- Right? - Yes.

839
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,001
Please cooperate.

840
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:11,642
Move aside.

841
00:54:14,412 --> 00:54:15,481
Thank you, sir.

842
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:20,582
Let's see. It was somewhere around here.

843
00:54:22,821 --> 00:54:25,492
- Captain, cover me. - I got you.

844
00:54:25,691 --> 00:54:26,892
Let's see.

845
00:54:26,992 --> 00:54:28,062
Six, four, seven, one...

846
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:29,722
- Four. - Four?

847
00:54:40,332 --> 00:54:41,501
Hey, what is this?

848
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:43,142
What? Where did everything go?

849
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:47,272
Lee Kang Jae, you're in deep trouble now.

850
00:54:47,941 --> 00:54:49,682
What? The necklace was right here.

851
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:51,912
I swear, I saw it last night.

852
00:54:52,352 --> 00:54:54,181
What are we going to tell the chairman now?

853
00:54:54,182 --> 00:54:55,921
You got it open. So what's in the safe?

854
00:54:58,392 --> 00:54:59,550
Well...

855
00:54:59,551 --> 00:55:01,191
We must've been mistaken.

856
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:02,821
Listen, you cops.

857
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,832
Must you keep this up?

858
00:55:05,062 --> 00:55:06,831
Are you going to keep doing this to us?

859
00:55:06,832 --> 00:55:08,730
I clearly told you I wouldn't just sit back and watch.

860
00:55:08,731 --> 00:55:10,130
We're just trying to investigate...

861
00:55:10,131 --> 00:55:11,301
Get out!

862
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:12,671
Get out, all of you.

863
00:55:12,832 --> 00:55:14,231
Where is Raphael? Call him now.

864
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:15,742
The thing is, sir.

865
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:17,570
He told us not to contact him today.

866
00:55:17,571 --> 00:55:18,571
Why not?

867
00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:20,841
He's out on a date.

868
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,281
He said he wouldn't pick up.

869
00:55:40,496 --> 00:55:41,606
Do you like it?

870
00:55:42,457 --> 00:55:43,617
Yes.

871
00:55:50,756 --> 00:55:51,827
What is it?

872
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:54,597
We're the only ones here.

873
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,566
I guess the restaurant isn't doing so well.

874
00:55:58,307 --> 00:55:59,406
But it's nice here.

875
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:01,707
Oh, that's...

876
00:56:07,546 --> 00:56:08,576
I know, right?

877
00:56:08,577 --> 00:56:09,617
I guess they don't get many customers.

878
00:56:12,486 --> 00:56:14,656
Sir, it's ready.

879
00:56:15,656 --> 00:56:16,816
Thank you.

880
00:56:18,827 --> 00:56:20,286
What is it? Is something up?

881
00:56:20,287 --> 00:56:21,426
No.

882
00:56:21,926 --> 00:56:23,026
Just a moment.

883
00:56:40,546 --> 00:56:41,647
There's...

884
00:56:42,477 --> 00:56:44,176
a lady I like.

885
00:56:45,687 --> 00:56:48,156
Lately, she's been having a hard time.

886
00:56:48,586 --> 00:56:49,656
So I hope...

887
00:56:50,316 --> 00:56:51,827
this will entertain her even if it's brief.

888
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:08,606
No way.

889
00:57:09,577 --> 00:57:10,736
That can't be.

890
00:57:15,046 --> 00:57:16,446
Don't tell me...

891
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:18,316
No way.

892
00:57:34,937 --> 00:57:36,966
Has he been watching old-school dramas?

893
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:40,537
Don't sing.

894
00:57:41,776 --> 00:57:43,006
Seriously, don't.

895
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:52,787
The door opens

896
00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:56,156
And you enter

897
00:57:56,187 --> 00:57:58,926
The moment I first saw you

898
00:57:59,426 --> 00:58:01,156
- Woo Ri! - I knew

899
00:58:01,296 --> 00:58:02,656
Woo Ri.

900
00:58:03,097 --> 00:58:05,065
- Kang Jae. - Detective Lee, why...

901
00:58:05,066 --> 00:58:06,425
Let's go.

902
00:58:06,426 --> 00:58:07,496
- What? - Hey.

903
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:09,267
- What's wrong? - Detective Lee!

904
00:58:10,097 --> 00:58:11,105
What's the matter?

905
00:58:11,106 --> 00:58:12,106
Come on. Let's go.

906
00:58:12,107 --> 00:58:14,037
Why are you being like this, all of a sudden?

907
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:18,247
Detective Lee, what's going on?

908
00:58:19,606 --> 00:58:21,247
You can't be with this man!

909
00:58:59,386 --> 00:59:02,386
(Woori the Virgin)

910
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,556
Just sleep here.

911
00:59:03,557 --> 00:59:05,025
I'm so excited about the next three days.

912
00:59:05,026 --> 00:59:06,827
You can't do this knowing we're under the same roof.

913
00:59:06,886 --> 00:59:08,356
Raphael, let's set a date.

914
