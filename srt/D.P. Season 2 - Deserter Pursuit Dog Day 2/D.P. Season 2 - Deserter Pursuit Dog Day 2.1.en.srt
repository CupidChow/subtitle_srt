[soldier 2] That asshole Gi-yeong
needs a good beating.

Hey, take care of him, okay?

180

-[soldier 3] Yes, sir.
-[soldier 2] Was that prick? Damn.

Who are you to salute to us?

185
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,691
-What?
-Hey.

186
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,776
-Yeah?
-What are you doing?

187
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,696
Who are you talking to right now?

Why is this stuff on the floor?

Hey, you see a ghost or something?

00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,414
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

194
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:32,543
Now… look over there
and say "motherfucker," okay?

195
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,796
-[soldier 3] Uh…
-[soldier 2] Just say it, bastard.

196
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,382
What? What is it, huh?
Cat got your tongue?

197

-[soldier 3] Yes, sir.

Good work running that errand.

212

Sir, it was no problem.

213
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,092
[Du-gwan] Ah, well… My wife is just
so serious over our son's education.

214
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,512
It's really a pain.

215
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,057
Right then.

216
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,478
Also, what is his name?
The original D.P. team leader?

217
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,856
-Han Ho-yeol was the team leader.
-[Du-gwan] Right.

218
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,527
How does he spend more time
in the hospital than over here?

219
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,737
Has it been three months now?

220
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,948
Is he faking it or something?

221
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,282
Well, anyway.

222
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,911

Hmm?

00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,541
Speaking of which,

225
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,044
Jun-ho, since you're such
an experienced ace,

226
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,921
you should take over as leader.

227

I, um…

282

Somebody said to me, uh…

283
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,130
we could speak informally
when we're out, so…

284
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,846
I'm sorry, sir! Never mind!

285
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,182
Okay. Speak informally.

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,779
Which month, though?

289
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,325
Since it's your first time in,
I'll just explain the basics.

290
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,119
Wow, okay.

291
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,873
It's not hard, but if you
have questions, just ask.

-Thanks.

So as the name suggests,

That's what the team is about.

-Hmm.
-Uh…

-[keyboard clacking]
-[Jun-ho] Okay.

301
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,943
Deserters will normally use their log-ins
to play a game,

302
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,071
or so they can email their girlfriends.

303
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,239
But hey, Jun-ho…

304
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,328
I don't really need
to know all this, okay?

305
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,289
What?

306
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,000
I felt cooped up,
and so I asked to be sent out here.

307
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,294
The Captain already handled things
through my father.

308
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,506
I heard how you D.P. soldiers
leave every morning after roll call.

309
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,758
You live a sweet life
since you get to leave.

310
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,553
Now you get to come out like this as well,
every day until you're released.

311
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,347
Isn't that amazing? [chuckling]

315
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,066
How much ice?

316
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,776
You do drink it iced, right?

317
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,445
You seem like an iced coffee
kind of guy. You just look like one.

318
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,947
And what about the deserters?

319

When it's time to go home [sucks teeth],
it doesn't really matter if I catch them.

321
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,122
My time won't be extended
or get shorter either.

322
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,290
And to be honest,
let's say I go out there,

323
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,210
arrest somebody who might want to get
some type of revenge, you know.

324
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,503
What happens after that?

325
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,255
Who's responsible then?

326
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,841
[inhales]

327
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,592

00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,471
Yeah, sounds about right.

[Se-ung laughing]

337
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,466
Yeah. Really, you know, in here, just…

338
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,719
All I have to do is act and play the fool

339
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,846
to have everybody just eating
out of my hand.

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,181
[laughter continues]

341
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,475
Yeah, that's right. [chuckles]

342
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,397
Yeah, I mean I have an immediate senior

343
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,691
but I buttered him up a little,
and he fell for it.

344
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,651
-That weak bastard, honestly.
-[Jun-ho sighs]

345
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,570
I'm really gonna take him down a notch.

346
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,698
I will, but damn,
I'm just feeling things out right now.

Hey. Aren't you on duty?

[Il-seok] What?

414
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,928
Why did you beat up Corporal Heo Gi-yeong?

[chuckles] Ah, you saw that?

416
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,477
Then can you tell me
why you just got hit by me?

417

Jesus, there's just no hope
for this worthless piece of trash.

418
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,566
Hey.

419
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,488
You must think you're some kind of
special and distinguished bastard, right?

420
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,700
But you're a measly soldier
doing grunt work same as everyone,

It's just I don't really know anything,

534
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,392

that way last night.
