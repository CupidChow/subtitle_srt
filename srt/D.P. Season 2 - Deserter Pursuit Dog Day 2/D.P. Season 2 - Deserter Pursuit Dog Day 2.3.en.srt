into a risk like that?

An award?

[Ho-yeol] Should I just get discharged
for medical hardship?

87

179
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,615
Uh, do you feel sick?

180
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,366
I'm fine.

181
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,956
When my heart feels
so completely without burden,

182
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,916
I get amazingly calm. [clicks tongue]

183
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,127
I'll take your word for it.

184
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,670
That's the truth.

185
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,631
[Jun-ho] Okay.

186
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
[Ho-yeol] Yoohoo.

187
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,383
[man] We've been here all day.

188
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,469
-[overlapping chatter]
-This man is driving me crazy.

189
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,512
[detective] What? I can't hear you?

190
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,847
Hello? Hello?

191
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,058
I'm hanging up, okay? I can't hear you.

192
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,393
-Jeez, honestly now.
-[indistinct shouts]

193
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,479
Hey! Be quiet, you bastards!
For god's sake!

194
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,231
-Eat this, huh?
-Hey, damn it. That's enough.

195
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,817
Will you be quiet? You bastards!

196
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,985
I mean, honestly.

197
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:55,988
Jesus!

198
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,741
You probably don't want to eat that.

199
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,243
It's over a week old. [laughs]

200
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,828
Well, anyway.

201
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,164
We happened to discover this.

202
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,417
We managed to bring in a petty criminal.

203
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,503
Ah, wait… Here.

204
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,548
Anyway, that petty criminal's
the type who messes around

205
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,009
in all kinds of illegal things,
down to the most trivial.

206
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,845
Like a private detective agency
or a kind of service center.

207
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,391
Jang Sung-min's name turned up
on his list of clients.

208
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,269
That's the deserter
you're looking for, right?

209
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,440
-What was his service request?
-[detective] Oh.

210
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,318
Well,  I'm not sure.

211
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,154
Which is the reason why the two of you
will have to meet him.

212
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,324
It will be exciting for the two of you.

213
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,495
-Uh…
-The three of us, right?

214
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,080
-You guys, two D.P.'s.
-Yeah.

215
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,082
-A joing operation?
-[Jun-ho] Yes.

216
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,334
-Oh,  me too? [laughs]
-Yeah, the three of us.

217
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,836
-Right?
-[detective] Oh, well…

218
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,297
We would really like that. But just look
at this pathetic state of affairs, huh?

219
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,258
We've barely got our heads on. Okay?

220
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,261
Our holding cell isn't big enough
for a group that size. No space.

221
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,388
-But I'm not familiar with Itaewon.
-Just a moment.

222
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,224
-[man crying]
-Hey, that man, what's he doing here?

223
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,769
Hey, sir. Stop crying to the police
and call a lawyer.

224
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,229
A lawyer!

225
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,898
You can't just keep coming in here.
Call a lawyer.

226
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,276
Come on! It…

227
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,405
[Ji-seop] So the person who stabbed
Ho-yeol was Jang Sung-min?

228
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,910
Wasn't he an actor in the Film Department
or something? Hmm…

229
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,328
He had good grades, too.

230
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,456
At a high school festival,

231
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,041
he was nominated for a best actress award.

232
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,502
Oh, best actress? Huh?

233
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,467
For the role of Nina
in Chekov's <i>The Seagull.</i>

234
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,469
Heartbreaking female character.

235
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,263
The name of the play itself
refers to Nina.

236
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,057
Wow, Sergeant! How do you know
so much about theater?

237
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,395
It was my dream once.
I was in the high school drama club.

238
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,189
Hamlet ring a bell?

239
00:12:59,153 --> 00:12:59,987
Huh…

240
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,239
If you check the web,

241
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,785
there are three legendary long-term
deserters from the army, you know.

242
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,038
Number one's an officer
who embezzled government funds

243
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,372
who's been gone for eight years,

244
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,417
then Jang Sung-min
who stabbed Sergeant Han.

245
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,794
He's been running for five years.

246
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,296
Who's number three, then?

247
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,964
An old guy from the Korean War.

248
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,966
Nobody's concerned about him.
Have some dumplings.

249
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,553
Hey, Gi-yeong.
You have a real knack for this.

250
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,431
It could be a career there.

251
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,310
To become the fourth long-term deserter?

252
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,647
-Such a punk.
-Ow.

253
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,359
Ow.

254
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,905
-File an anonymous complaint.
-[Beom-gu] Mm-hmm.

255
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,242
[Jun-ho] So Jang Sung-min
was in Itaewon this whole time?

256
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,078
There wouldn't be any better place
for Sung-min than here.

257
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,872
Anyway, the meeting's all set up, right?

258
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,167
Yeah. And he definitely
didn't suspect anything either.

259
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,545
-[Ho-yeol] Okay. Perhaps.
-[broker] You the guys who called?

260
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,630
[light music playing]

261
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,925
We spoke, yeah?

262
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,762
[Ho-yeol] Uh…

263
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,181
[broker sucks teeth]

264
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,272
TIGER SERVICES

265
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,481
The password.

266
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,151
Roar, roar?

267
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,156
Come with me.

268
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,119
Jeez, how did you know? How'd you know?

269
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,912
[Jun-ho] The company name
has "Tiger" in it?

270
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,372
[Ho-yeol] Honestly, that's amazing.

271
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,416
-Oh, damn.
-I guess. Hurry up.

272
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,294
[cat meowing]

273
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,553
Ah, jeez. This feels pretty weird.

274
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,054
For me too, you know.

275
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,931
On those unsolved crime shows,

276
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,351
a car like this always appears
right before someone loses an organ.

277
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,732
[inhales sharply]
Let's come back some other time.

278
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,067
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Just be natural and leave.

279
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,277
[car door opening]

280
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,951
[Jun-ho gulps]

281
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,454
[inhales sharply]

282
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,039
[exhales]

283
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,749
[coughs]

284
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,501
So, what are you doing here?

285
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,296
Well, we're looking for a guy.

286
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,464
A guy?

287
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,926
-Yes. [laughs nervously]
-Yes.

288
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,511
Meow, meow.

289
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,596
Tweet, tweet.

290
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,140
-What?
-Mm…

291
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,268
The password is "meow, meow," assholes.

292
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,067
[silly music playing]

293
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,985
[Ho-yeol sighs]

294
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,779
-[car door opens]
-[gasps]

295
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,156
[tense music sting]

296
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,324
Meow.

297
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,492
Get out.

298
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,577
[thug 1] Good evening, friends.

299
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,913
So good to see you.

300
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,166
[thug 2 sighs] You're in
for an impressive beating today.

301
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,169
[thug 3] What an easy job. Lucky day.

302
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,130
-You're hardworking men.
-[thug 1] Beat 'em good.

303
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,007
-Commendable.
-[broker slams car]

304
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,386
-What do you bastards do? With the police?
-[thugs laughing]

305
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,180
-Us, police? No way.
-Ah, no, no, that's not us. No way.

306
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,431
You assholes.

307
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,600
Hey, go for it.

308
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,686
-[thug 4] All right.
-[thug 5] Oh, come on.

309
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,104
[gate opening]

310
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,563
[detective] Everyone, freeze!

311
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,774
[thug 1] Huh?

312
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,027
-Don't you move, assholes!
-Hey. come in.

313
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,779
You two okay?

314
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,698
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Here, here!

315
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,491
[detective] You bastards,
every move we make,

316
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,243
-you'd get a whiff of us.
-Fucking shithead.

317
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,495
Ah, shit.

318
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,830
Just wait.

319
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,749
-Catch them all.
-[thugs screaming]

320
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,918
[detective] Stop them! Stop them!

321
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,169

[yelping] Oh, God! Oh, God! Okay!

328

Look, over there. Look!

00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,813
[fighting grunts, shouts]

[Jun-ho and Ho-yeol panting]

331
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,360
Out of my way! Out of my way!
Damn it, move!

332
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,904
-[women scream]
-[man] Hey!

333
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,698
Stop following me, you fucking bastards!

334
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,907
Move out of the way!

335
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,701
I'm sick of this shit.

336
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,202
-Oh, for god's sake.
-Go away!

337
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,245
[screams]

338
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,997

Oh!

343
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,464

Get on. We're following him.
