353
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,601
They planned on covering
their tracks on this one quickly?

354
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,313
Being on the frontline puts the GP
in their own league.

355
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,689
Okay?

356
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,651
I was serious about things
not getting out.

357
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,361
I'm not sure I like how it shook you.

Sorry.

it's not working again, every time.

00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,692
Sorry, it'll be rough like this.
I apologize.

372
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,695
What was that just now?

373
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,489
Ah! It's to prep for the North Koreans.

374
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,117
Courage training.

375
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,413
The doghole you saw on your tour.

376
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,708
Yeah, that was made during the Korean War.

377
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,502
When the war was over,

378
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,963
the North Korean soldiers
would sneak across

379
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,507
and kill a lot of soldiers here at the GP.

380
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,843
What to do? Huh?

381
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,763
Just take it laying down?
We captured their soldiers.

[clanking]

383
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,600
We stuffed them in barrels,
set them on fire.

384
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,687
Operation Barbecue, they called it, right?

385
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,272
Good God.

386
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,066
That's the way it is here, I guess.

387
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,151
[Tae-san laughing]

388
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,235
Lieutenant Heo.

389
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:01,987
[Tae-san] Yes?

[Ji-seop sighs]

391
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,618
You've been getting on my nerves
since we arrived.

392
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,915
As a superior, I would urge you to stop
with this strange welcome.

393
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,295
Furthermore, I came here because
questionable things have happened.

394
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,341
And I will get to the bottom
of every one of them so watch it.

395
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,344
Even if you…

396
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,556
knew the truth,
it wouldn't change anything.

397
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,599
Care to repeat that?

398
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,809
Captain.

399
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,272
I go on leave tomorrow.

400
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,025
So I suppose this is goodbye.

401
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,319
Get some rest, sir.

I'm on leave, my last one!

406
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,420
Hey, Mom, I haven't eaten all day.
I waited to eat with you.

407
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,173
I'd love dried squid.
I've been craving that!

408
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,178
I guess I'm talking to thin air.
[chuckles]

409
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,391
If she moved, she should have told me.

There's a soldier,
he kept confronting his Sergeant,

427
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,813
and was about to get transferred away.

428
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,315
The commander was Sergeant Na.

429
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,443
The soldier was Shin A-hwi.

Do you mean Shin A-hwi
that Sergeant Na saved from the mine?

432
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,371
They were at odds with each other?

433
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,916
Exactly. There's something there, right?

00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,961

[Jun-ho clears throat]

437
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,721
[Jun-ho] According to the information
we gathered,

438
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:38,477
you and Staff Sergeant Na
were not on, um… very good terms, right?

439
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,145
Ah…

440
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,898
That worn-out conspiracy again.

441
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,525
The theory…

442
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,155
that the GP soldiers had something to do
with what happened that night.

443
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,034
So we created a story about it
to cover it all up?

[Jun-ho sighs]

445
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,789
[Jun-ho] We just want to hear about
the circumstances of that day again.

446
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,791
The circumstances, huh?

447
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,295
Could you be any more vague?

448
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,924
That depends on who you ask.

Would you want
to keep reliving that memory?

I want you to take a look
at this document.

Go ahead.

457
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,994
That night, you and Sergeant Na
were the only two who entered

458
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,373
the restricted area
where the landmine was, right?

459
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,586
And?

460
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,050
I have an alternative explanation.

[Jung-seok] Oh, no, no, but…

00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,078
Was there something you want to say?

You're feeling the stress of being
a commander so young. But…

00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,601
You like this one?

530
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,520
Yeah, the kids will like it.

531
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,064
[Min-u] That didn't sound very sincere.

532
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,568
[Beom-gu] Why did you ask me here?

533
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,405
Colonel Seo gave Captain Lim
the thumb drive, didn't she?

534
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,705
-Thumb drive? I have no idea--
-[Min-u] You're a really bad actor.

535
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,334
Bring it to me.

536
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,130
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking…

537
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,222
That drive has classified
military information.

538
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,476
This one should do the trick.

539
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,568
Colonel Seo is trying to mess with us
since she got fired, that crazy bitch.

540
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,861
But she should know the limits.

541
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,279
-This one, please.
-Yes, sir.

542
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,658
-[scanner beeps]
-[Beom-gu] I don't know what's on it.

543
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:30,036
But I wonder what could get you to go
to these lengths. You're threatening me--

544
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,371
[Min-u] You wonder what's on it?

545
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,414
It has the cases we manipulated.

546
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,000
-I also had something on hold, ma'am.
-[clerk] Okay.

547
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,796
What?

548
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,882
Your move.

549
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,718
What will you do?

550
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,681
Do you think you can expose us?

551
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,977
What kind of a goddamn fool
do you take me for?

552
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,688
But you're not alone, are you?

553
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,441
Do your son and wife like living in Jeju?

554
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,194
And your mom still lives in your hometown.

555
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,196
Huh?

556
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,242
Here you go.

557
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,079
You bastard, just take the toy, Jeez!

558
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,499
You're not curious?

559
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,877
Why we would send your team

560
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,672
way up to the GP, all of a sudden?

561
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,134
[unsettling music playing]

562
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,888
Get out here.
Tell him yourself, would you?

563
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,732
[tense music building]

564
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,443
[Beom-gu] <i>Han Ho-yeol, it's an emergency!</i>

565
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,029
I think something has happened
to Captain Lim and Jun-ho.

566
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,242
The GP is out of cell phone range.

567
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,243
[Ho-yeol] <i>Yes, sir!</i>

568
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,037
<i>-I'll head out right now!</i>
-Stop shouting.

569
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,414
Come as fast as you can, okay?

570
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,249
[sighs]

571
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,461

[lighter clicks]

580
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,556
[Ji-seop] There's a bastard like that
at every base.

581
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,728
A person who rips apart
his fellow soldiers and commanders

582
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,188
they see as weak.

583
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,319
I guarantee he gave Jung-seok
the same attitude, right?

584
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,613
Huh?

585
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,410
Captain, I don't blame you
for being upset,

586
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,454
and I see what you're saying
but you can't just--

587
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,372
It isn't.

588
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,166
I know it's that bastard.

589
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,628
-But, Captain--
-Look.

590
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,924
While he was defying a superior,
Jung-seok died by accident.

591
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,678
All of these sons of bitches
covered it up from here.

592
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,472
These assholes knew
they'd be dead if it got out.

593
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,266
[Jun-ho sighs]

594
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,935
It's just it's a possibility
that's how it happened, but…

595
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,813
-[Ji-seop groans]
-Nothing is certain yet.

596
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,524
-We need to look at this in a more calm--
-Calm down?

597
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,068
Are you defying me as well?

598

600
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,245
We have to be certain.

601
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,539
Right?

00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,250
[unsettling music playing]

603
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,210

Captain! Please don't.

611
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,433
I just want to be certain, okay?

612
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,810

-[Ji-seop exhales]
-[Jun-ho] Open up!

-[door banging]
-Unlock the door!

619
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,699
But your expression's changed.

620
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,911
-You hear me? Open the door!
-[door banging]

621
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,120
It really has.

622
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,207
I'd never have fucking guessed it.

[A-hwi grunts]

624
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,338
All right, what now?

625
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,549
It's always the powerless commanders
that talk shit.

Last chance before I tear you apart,
you motherfucker!

Sergeant Na Jung-seok…

636
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,033
He was a very close friend of mine, okay?

637
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,995
All right? And he was
a really good soldier, too.

[Ji-seop exhales sharply]

639

00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,052
How close are you?

645
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,888
If there's a road block,
break through, and I'll--

[Ji-seop exhales sharply]

652
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,795
Take that dick out of your mouth
and speak up.

653
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,589
Is that a trick
that your mother taught you?

654
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,758
Fucking talk, you bastard!
What's wrong with you? Hmm?

655
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,051
[A-hwi chuckles]

657
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,642
Why does it matter?
You won't even believe me.

658
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,562
So why keep asking me?

659
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,317
I'll believe it when I decide to,
you stupid son of a bitch!

660
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,068
Huh?

661
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,822
[Ji-seop exhales]

662
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,200
[A-hwi] That story… [sighs]

663
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:48,915
Tell me.

664
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,001
-You know…
-What?

665
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,546
The barbecue story.

666
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,887
It started when men defected
to the North from the South

667
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,972
because of the propaganda broadcasts.

668
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,435
They dug a hole under the fence to catch
the Northern soldiers to set an example.

669
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,355
Aren't you getting tired
of this dumb story?

670
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,689
You keep telling it.

671
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,857
But…

672
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,692
[sighs]

673
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,487
The stupid commanders,

674
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,782
they kept the tunnel we made open and…

675
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,576
[exhales]

676
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,122
That night they celebrated their kills,

677
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,917
and they got so drunk
that they passed out cold.

678
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:38,214
The North Koreans appeared
with a flamethrower.

679
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,050
After that…

680
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,553
you couldn't recognize the bodies.

681
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,973
There was charred human flesh
on the floor.

682
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,933
They covered lockers.

683
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,394
The ceiling.

684
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,980
Everywhere.

685
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,191
Everywhere.

686
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,613
[Ji-seop] That was fun.

687
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,326
That was the funnest version by far.

688
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,661
Hmm?

689
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,414
But why tell that old story?

690
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,499
[sighs]

691
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,629
You wanted to know.

692
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,799
The circumstances.

693
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,470
[Ji-seop] What do you expect me
to do? Hmm?

694
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,764
[exhales] Here.

695
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,601
Let me see up close. Show me.

696
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,854
Show me, you asshole!

697
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,647
Hey, why are you showing me this?

698
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,357
What's this all about?
Let me see. Come on!

699
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,568
Let me see! Oh, you want me
to burn you some more?

700
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,486
-[grunts]
-Is that what you want? What is it?

701
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,696
-Come on!
-[sobs] Fuck!

702
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,740
-What? What? What is it, huh?
-[screams] Fuck!
