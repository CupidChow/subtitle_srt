00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,106
Okay. I didn't mean to offend you.

175
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,567
See you around.

176
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,614
[phone buzzing]

177
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,493
[buzzing continues]

178
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,082
Go ahead.

179
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,750
[Jun-ho] <i>Ms. Shin Hye-yeon?</i>

180
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,126
Yes, that's correct.

181
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,378
<i>I have a tip for you.</i>

182
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,588
<i>The information</i>
<i>about the Kim Ru-ri incident--</i>

183
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,131
And who am talking with?

184
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,092
<i>I'll tell you in person.</i>

185
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,179
We have procedures here.
First, email the information to me…

186
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,431
<i>The cause of death for Jeong Hyeong-beom…</i>

187
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,062
was hypoglycemic shock.

188
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,691
It was excessive bleeding.

189
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,901
If they'd been fast…

190
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,489
No, if they'd taken action
even within an hour, he could have lived.

191
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,991
[somber music playing]

192
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,076
[inhales sharply]

193
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,287
Well, if you want to seem credible,
you can't just…

194
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,749
-And if this is just a prank--
-[Jun-ho] <i>Daejeon Memorial Park.</i>

195
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,669
What?

196
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,965
The columbarium. That's where we'll meet.

197
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,466
And how do you know…

198
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,719
[Jun-ho] <i>I'll call you again with a time.</i>

199
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,097
-[telephone clanks]
-[coin clinks]

200
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,181
[line disconnects]

201
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,148
[Gi-yeong sighs]

202
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,527
Still can't contact him?

203
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,739
Jun-ho's family… Have you been calling?

204
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,202
There's nothing coming up
after the bus terminal.

205
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,457
And he gave fake numbers
for his whole family.

206
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,006
So, should I… call Captain Lim about this?

207
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,634
He's on vacation for right now.

208
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,680
He's been handling a lot
so leave him alone. [sighs]

209
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,435
Pack your bags
and go home already, Mr. Civilian.

210
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,856
Don't make any stupid decisions.

211
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,568
The Military Service Act says,

212
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,446
the discharge of an active duty serviceman
may be postponed

213
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,784
in order to participate in exercises
or important trainings.

214
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,914
You mad bastard.

215
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,665
-[chair clattering]
-[sighs]

216
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,793
[exhales]

217
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,505
If Jun-ho has actually deserted,

218
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,300
who else can track him down?

219
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,261
I have to agree with him.

220
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,141
[sighs deeply] Shit.

221
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,523
-[Su-jin] I mean, this is way too much.
-[door opens]

222
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,191
How many times are you going to call?

223
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,072
[sighs] I said I don't know.

224
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,909
How many times do I have to say it?

225
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,077
I really don't know.

226
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,330
It doesn't matter if he's my brother.

227
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,833
I keep trying to tell you, I don't know.

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,585
Stop calling me.

229
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,009
Hey, Mom, have you spoken to him?

230
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,430
[Su-jin sighs] Seriously, Jun-ho deserted?

231
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,307
What's his problem?

232
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,809
What a thoughtless bastard.

233
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,019
Your brother is not a thoughtless person.

234
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,396
[Su-jin] Mom!

235
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,439
Are you taking my brother's side?

236
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,776
[sighs] Gosh, I wish I was born first.

237
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,486
-Come on.
-[doorbell rings]

238
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,031
-[Su-jin] Again?
-[ringing continues]

239
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,074
[Su-jin sighs]

240
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,243
Let me answer it.

241
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,036
[doorbell ringing]

242
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,372
[door opening]

243
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,545
[Jun-ho's mom] I've been waiting for you.

244
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,757
And not anyone else.

245
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,140
Since you're his friend.

246
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,938
I'm very sorry.

247
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,357
[Beom-gu] Jun-ho…

248
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,945
We need to bring Jun-ho back.
I think that will be safe.

249
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,823
So if Jun-ho happened to call you--

250
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,575
Tell me something first, then.

251
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,913
Did Jun-ho…

252
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,249
do something really wrong?

253
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,210
[inhales deeply]

254
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,254
[exhales]

255
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,547
Uh, no.

256
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,008
He hasn't done anything bad.

257
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,594
[somber music playing]

258
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,054
[Ho-yeol] But the thing is…

259
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,391
he could be in danger.

260
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,979
We can't let him be in danger.

261
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,652
[Jun-ho's mom] Jun-ho came by here.

262
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,238
Did he? You spoke with him, then?

263
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,116
[tense music playing]

264
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,419
MOM, I'M OKAY
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO DO

265
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,004
I'LL GET IT DONE AND THEN GO BACK

266
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,965
[Ho-yeol sighs] Just as we expected.

267
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,635
What we were afraid of.

268
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,638
[Beom-gu] What is he trying to do?

269
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,682
[Ho-yeol] I'll just make one call.

270
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,935
[line ringing]

271
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,647
Gi-yeong, hello.
We talked with Jun-ho's mother.

272
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,191
And Jun-ho did come by here.

273
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:29,571
[man on TV] <i>Yeah. If you look closely,</i>
<i>this male is a lot larger than the female.</i>

274
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,991
[Beom-gu] Ma'am,
try not to worry too much.

275
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,952
-[Jun-ho's dad exhales]
-We'll do everything we can to find him.

276
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,544
Mmm. Mmm…

277
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,755
I have missed eating beef.

278
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,717
-Mmm…
-[Min-u] Well, eat up.

279
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,302
After all, this is your tax money.

280
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,224
[beef sizzling]

281
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,228
[Jun-ho's dad] You have such a nice way
of putting things.

282
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,648
Ah! A meal with no pressure?

283
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,527
Sounds good to me. Okay, yeah. [chuckles]

284
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,198
[utensil clattering]

285
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,455
It's tax money, yeah?

286
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,999
No pressure once again.

287
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,212
It feels pretty absurd
to be saying this here,

288
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,548
but your son's a…

289
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,133
-[woman] Sit.
-…pitiful bastard.

290
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,302
Don't worry about another man's son.

291
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,556
-But you, I'm worried about.
-[woman] Yes, one moment.

292
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,602
Just because I tell you things,
you think you can capture my son?

293
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,687
Hmm? [laughing]

294
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,731
[man] Uh, can we have some more sauce?

295
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,900
Let's hear what you got for me.

296
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,612
[intriguing music playing]

297
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,074
[Ja-woon] <i>It seems An Jun-ho is trying</i>
<i>to leak the information on the USB drive.</i>

298
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,493
It could influence the lawsuit.

299
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,329
We have to take care of it,
no matter what.

300
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,791
But the USB can't be copied,
so as long as we catch him, we're good.

301
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,127
Wait a minute.

302
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,714
I thought of somewhere to go.

303
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,467
For certainty.

304
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,930
Keep on checking the list of classmates
and all the locations from his mother.

305
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,058
-And track his location.
-His cards, keep checking his debit cards.

306
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,560
And stay on top of that fake email too.

307
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,104
The IP should be traceable.

308
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,106
Yes, okay.

309
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,524
Hey, but…

310
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,444
You think any of this
will help us find him?

311
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,405
I don't. Only because
he was trained by the best.

312
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,533
Little shit.

313
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,578
Then do the other thing.

314
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,082
-I'm sorry, sir?
-You know, your method.

315
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,500
Do that Hollywood thing.

316
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,795
Oh, you want me to do an embodiment?

317
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,922
Yeah, so we can get into his head.

318
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:53,757
[chuckles]

319
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,554
If I were him, then…

320
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,807
then I'd be calling me, right now.

321
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,434
[laughs] Are you insane?

322
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,229
Calling a D.P. as you're deserting?

323
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,982
[phone buzzing]

324
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,735

<i>Is it just the two of you?</i>

330
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,839
It's just us.

331
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,800
Hey, Jun-ho.

332
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,762
Well, obviously,
I don't understand your motivations.

333
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,348
-That USB--
<i>-Sir, did you know about this?</i>

334
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,309
What about it?

335
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,021
If you'd seen what was on the USB…

336
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,025
you'd have done the same thing as me.

337
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,326
Hey, Jun-ho.

338
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,830
About the contents,

340

[Beom-gu] I won't say something pathetic
like, "Some things can't be helped."

341
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,545
All right?

342
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,589
But we…

343
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,134
It is our duty to keep you safe.

00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,638
This isn't something you can handle, punk!

345
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,723
Don't be a savior.

-What?

00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,064
If it just can't be helped, after all,

348
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,567
If that's the problem…

349
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,656
then who the hell
is gonna deal with it, huh?

350
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,325
Hey, Jun-ho, why is this your business?

351
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,413
Jun-ho, I'm going to capture you.

352
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,290
I really have to.

353
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,755
I know you have to.

354
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,091
[Ho-yeol] <i>You just wait and see.</i>

355
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,598
[sighs]

356
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,728
[pensive music playing]

357
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,774
[Jun-ho breathing deeply]

358
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,833
[Jun-ho groans]

359
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,635
[Suk-bong] Seriously, why?

360
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,638
[exhales deeply]

361
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,517
Why does it have to be you?

362
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,148
I don't know either.

363
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,611
[Suk-bong] Do you think
you'll be at ease if you do this?

364
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,577
[unsettling music playing]

365
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,580
[breathes deeply]

366
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,840
Do we have his location yet?

367
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,842
Let me check.

368
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,220
[line ringing]

369
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,141
[Gi-yeong] <i>You know how good I am, right?</i>

370
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,144
It's a café near Gwangmyeong Subway.

371
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,896
If he's at a station,

372
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,648
it looks like he's trying to go somewhere.

373
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,486
Call Gwangmyeong Subway and ask them
for cooperation, then report back to us.

374
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,403
No, no.

375
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,366
What you suspect, just go with it.
Report to me later.

376
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,993
Sir, I'll meet expectations.

377
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,746
You heard that?

378
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,209
[keyboard clacking]

379
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,378
Yes, I'm already expediting, sir!

380
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,214
Yes, very good.
You're becoming more like me.

381
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,343

383

Hello, this is Corporal Heo Gi-yeong.

384

[Du-gwan] <i>Hey, Gi-yeong.</i>
<i>Come to my office for a minute.</i>

385
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,020
[Gi-yeong] Right now, sir?

386
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,271
[Du-gwan] <i>Yes, right now.</i>

387
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,524
-Just hearing that from you is an honor.
-[knock on door]

388

[men laughing]

389
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,071
Hello, sir, Corporal Heo reporting
to Commander's Office for…

390
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,364
[Du-gwan] Gi-yeong!

391
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,658
What took you so long to get here?

392
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,161
[huffs]

393
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,501
So you're Corporal Heo?

394
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,045
[breathing nervously]

395
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,173
[Ja-woon] Have you found
An Jun-ho's location?

396
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,801
[grandfather's clock ringing]

397
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,638
[ringing continues]

398
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,017
[suspenseful music playing]

399
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,353
Attention!

400
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,688
[soldiers] Attention!

401
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,027
An Jun-ho of the 103rd Division D.P. Team
has deserted.

402
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:11,074
An officer tasked by the
Ministry of Defense to capture deserters

403
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,993
has become a deserter himself,

404
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,037
after stealing classified documents
 on a thumb drive.

405
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,957
I want you to think
about what a grave threat

406
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,876
to national security we could be facing.

407
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,836
[soldiers] Yes, sir!

408
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,214
This has not been reported officially yet.

409
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,011
Currently, you're the only ones
with knowledge about this incident at all.

410
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,139
First principle is?

411
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:38,059
If you can't stop it, be sure
to make it so that it never happened.

412
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,520
Make sure to bring him in.

413
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,774
And whatever happens today,
you won't be on the hook for it.

414
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:46,985
That's it.

415
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,236
[all] Sir!

416
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,406

00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,833
[Hye-yeon] <i>I'm an hour away.</i>

418
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,002
You're going to be there as well?

419
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,756
[Jun-ho] <i>Yes. I'll be there on time.</i>

420
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,595
Please check once more
that nobody's following you.

421
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,014
<i>We're familiar with this kind situation.</i>

422
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,808
<i>But if what you told me is true,</i>

423
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,812
this could potentially be
our lawsuit's biggest weapon.

424
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,066
So you should be careful as well.

425
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,903
Okay.

426
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,239
We'll meet soon.

427
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,616
One question.

428
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,872
How could you have known
about that columbarium?

429
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,127
[woman on PA] <i>Passengers taking</i>
<i>the KTX 203 train to Daejeon,</i>

Well, uh…

433

I'll tell you all about that
when we meet as well.

[tense music playing]

438
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,764
That's him, right?

439
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,358
We've located him, sir.

440
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,904
There's video footage of him
purchasing a train ticket for Daejeon.

441
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:55,822
Yes.

442
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,325
I understand.

the KTX train number 201.

What?

Wouldn't you agree, huh?

480
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,541
The two of us can capture him
