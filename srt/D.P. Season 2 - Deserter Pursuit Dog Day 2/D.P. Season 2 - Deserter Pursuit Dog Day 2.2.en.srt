[inhales]

177
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,561
I'm so sorry.

178
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,604
-[Hyeong-beom's mom sobs]
-I'm so sorry.

179
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,277
[Ru-ri's mom] But listen,

180
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,698
I know Ru-ri has done
something unforgivable.

181
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,202
But they pushed him too far…

182
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,666
They all would say he was a "fat-ass."

183
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,713
And he said they took insecticide
and sprayed his face!

184
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,506
-[Ru-ri's mom sobs]
-My god, you're crazy.

185
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,300
You've completely lost it.

186
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,303
They tortured my boy!

187
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,430
They cursed and beat him!

188
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,474
Were you listening? My son is gone!

189
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,310

-Killed by your son!

191
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,354
[police] Stop!

192
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,274
Bring my son back!

193
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,275
That's enough!

194
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,277
-[clamoring]
-[Jun-ho grunts]

195
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,779
[Jun-ho] Get back!

196
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,990
-My son!
-That's enough!

197
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,451
He killed my son! Do you get it?

198
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,369
-[sobbing]
-[screaming]

199
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,580
I'll never see my boy again!

200
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,040
Enough!

201
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,875
-[Hyeong-beom's mom] Bring him back!

[people clamoring, shouting]

204
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,212
Oh, shit.

205
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,054
-[police] Let go of her now!
-[Hyeong-beom's mom] He killed my son.

206
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
[police] I don't want to use force.

207
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,433
[officer] Hold the line!
Get in front of them!

208
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,643
Is that you, Corporal?

209
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,187
[people clamoring]

210
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,649
RU-RI'S COUNTRY CHICKEN

211
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,150
MURDERER

212
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,869
Are you mad at me
or something, Corporal Han?

213
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,580
When you were in the hospital,
you never reached out.

214
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,383
JUN-HO! I'M A SERGEANT NOW!

215
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
Why are you…

216
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,308
What's that about?

217
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:32,983
SORRY, I'M NOT ABLE TO SPEAK RIGHT NOW

218
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,576
Why'd you come here then?
You should've stayed in the hospital.

219
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,707
I KNOW YOU NEED ME BY YOUR SIDE

220
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,795
[sighs] Are you serious?

221
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,673
Was that pre-written?

222
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,760
YES

223
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,512
NO

224
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,264
I'M NOT A WEIRD PERSON

225
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,141
[silly music playing]

226
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,936
WHAT CAN I DO?

227
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,567
[Ho-yeol chuckles]

228
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,988
[giggles]

229
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,454
[rain pattering]

230
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,418
[Eun] The general is in the middle
of a trial, right?

231
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,335
[Min-u] Yes.

232
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,006
Colonel Eun, did you mean
to provoke Kim Ru-ri

233
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,591
earlier today at the briefing?

234
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,343
You need to provoke to install fear.

235
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,180
The hope is that it will prevent others
from helping him.

236
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,224
I'm concerned about the timing.
Even if we apprehend Kim Ru-ri--

237
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,102
I've been speaking with the general.

238
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,938
I know what he wants.

239
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,776
Our military should be free
of a tragedy like this.

240
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,444
But when it does happen…

241
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,281
we must quickly quiet things down.

242
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,788
[Ji-seop] Yes, I'm from the 103rd Division
and we're going in there.

243
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,624
-[soldier] I'm sorry--
-Let me in. Get out of my way, kid.

244
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,294
-Now's not a good time, sir. You can't--
-The hell I can't. [clicks tongue]

245
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,799
It's all right.

246
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,343
[Ji-seop sighs]

247
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,887
Colonel Seo Eun.

248
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,847
[door closes]

249
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,558
So Warrant Officer Oh
was in here with you, huh?

250
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,312
If it's about something private,
there's the door.

251
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,147
Or you'd better change your tone.

252
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,319
I mean, you just had to go and say
you'd shoot to kill if he's found.

253
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,029
You barely tried to hide it.

254
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,364
So that's what you heard.

255
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,825
I guess you've come here
to defend the shooter?

256
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,994
Uh, no, not at all, ma'am.
Our approach is to--

257
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,287
[Ji-seop] Sergeant Park.

258
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,290
Have a seat, please. Yeah, it's okay.

259
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,000
-Okay.
-[Eun] Who are you?

260
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,378
Salute.

261
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,547
Sergeant First Class Park Beom-gu,
Military Police.

262
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,549
Wasn't this man under investigation?

263
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,758
Why is he here?

264
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,386
D.P.'s are usually involved
in the mission.

265
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,805
-They're going to provide assistance.
-Yes.

266
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,892
[breathes deeply]

267
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,063
Private Kim Ru-ri
has always been a soldier

268
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,982
who couldn't mingle with other people.

269
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,068
His addiction to brutal animations
meant he couldn't separate reality.

270
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,736
from his warped mind.

271
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,155
What's more,
when he first transferred to the unit,

272
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,157
he was classified
as a special care soldier

273
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,617
and entered into a green camp.

274
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,705
Normally, a soldier would leave
after two weeks, but he stayed for five.

275
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,915
-Sound right?
-[Ji-seop] Animation?

276
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,211
You're trying to build this narrative
out of nowhere.

277
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,671
Aren't you?

278
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,216
It just seems like
you haven't thought this through.

279
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,720
After an incident like this,
you don't want to push him into a corner.

280
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,804
Don't you see?

281
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,184
Here we go. Your narrow attitude.

282
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,062
The one that's always
straddling the fence.

283
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,024
What's this about?

284
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,694
Would you prefer that someone get hurt
like with Cho Suk-bong?

285
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,612
Watch your mouth!

286
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,405
No, you watch your mouth.

287
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,407
[exhales sharply]

288
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:17,124
Don't end up with these
fucking regrets like I did. Okay?

289
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,419
On a side note,

290
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,838
don't call the kids anymore.

291
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,757
Just meet them on your appointed days.

292
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,802
Yeah, right! They're the ones calling me
saying they can't stand being around you!

293
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,805
Now I know why they hate you,
your arrogance.

294
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,307
Thanks, Captain, that's all.

295
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,977
Lim Ji-seop, you're dismissed.

296
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,146
[Beom-gu sighs]

297
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,274
[clicks tongue]

298
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,612

-[door slams shut]
-[sighs]

301
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,915
[Beom-gu] <i>Yeah, got it.</i>

302
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,833
-Did you meet up with Ho-yeol?
-Go to hell.

303
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,710
-[Jun-ho] <i>Yes, but there's an issue.</i>
-What?

304
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,880
-[Jun-ho] <i>Well, he can't… he can't speak.</i>
<i>-</i>Oh, great, why not?

305
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,049
He must be joking, right?

306
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,009
<i>-I don't think so, sir.</i>
-What is this?

307
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,053
<i>And I'm not sure if he won't or can't but…</i>

308
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,763
[Ji-seop] Sergeant Park, look.

309
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,681
[soldier] Hurry!

310
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,058
-[Ji-seop] Get over here.
-Well, I have to call you back.

311
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,852
-That's crazy,
-Uh-huh.

312
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,522
-Hey!
-[man 1] He's completely lost it.

313
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,190
[man 2] The killer is filming himself?

314
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,025
This is creepy.

315
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,403

00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,840
<i>I only shot them because I thought</i>
<i>they'd kill me first.</i>

322
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,094
<i>They kept saying unspeakable things</i>
<i>about my mother.</i>

323
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,889
<i>They used to shoot bug spray in my eyes.</i>

324
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,183
- He's trying to use the media?
-[Ru-ri] <i>And would hit me.</i>

-What the hell?
<i>-I really thought they're gonna kill me.</i>

329
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,654
<i>I shot them in self-defense.</i>

330
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,740
[man 3] This is unbelievable. [chuckles]

00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,452

526
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,447
He has to show up now.

527
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,866
And we'll be ready for him.

528
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,661
How could you do something like this
when you're a mother?

529
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,788
You can't be serious?

530
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,165
I explained to you,

531
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,667
if someone dies
or gets hurt in this situation…

532
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,420
We should make sure Kim Ru-ri
doesn't get hurt either.

533
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,214
That's just as important.

534

[Eun sighs]

535
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,262
[Eun] You call yourself soldiers.

536
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:25,101
And yet here you are defending Kim Ru-ri,
who murdered fellow soldiers.

537
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,813
He could throw a grenade
at innocent people any moment.

538
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,653
Continue to wait in here.

539
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,323
[Beom-gu] I met him before all this.

540
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,582

we couldn't do anything about it.

546
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,363
I'm asking for one more chance,
to see if we can persuade him.

547
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,242
It's worth a try, ma'am.

Our only play left
is with your cell phone.

557
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,830
So what's your plan now?

558
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:14,377
If Kim Ru-ri decides to show up
to an angry mob, they'll put him down.

559
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,923
We can't allow it.

[Ja-woon] If it was that hard on him,
he should have just deserted.

Why shoot all those people?

567
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,960
And if he was going to do that,
he should have just died with them.
