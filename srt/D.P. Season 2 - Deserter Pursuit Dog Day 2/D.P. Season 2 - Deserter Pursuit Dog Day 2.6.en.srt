00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,780
Does Park Beom-gu agree
with this course of action?

180
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,450
[Min-u] What about An Jun-ho?

181
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,536
Jun-ho's feelings on this are immaterial.

182
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,707
All I care about is keeping Jun-ho
safe from harm.

185
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,432
[Sung-woo] So, what's it feel like
being in cuffs?

186
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,683
Just shut up.

187
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,478
[Sung-woo chuckling]

188
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,939
Jun-ho, you're going to military prison.

189
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,234
It makes that little jail
on the base look like a resort.

I'm transporting the prisoner now.

[Min-u] <i>Turn the car around.</i>
<i>Come back to the office.</i>

194

-Repeat that, please?

195
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,250
<i>The arrest warrant wasn't issued.</i>

196
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,086
Is there a problem, sir?

197
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,046
I thought you said
transport him to prison

198
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,882
-and then go to Yongsan to find the USB--
-<i>Staff Sergeant Park Sung-woo.</i>

-Sorry, sir. Hello?

202
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,020

How many people have you put under arrest?

208
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,120
What?

209
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,332
I wonder if you've cuffed anyone before?

210
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,669
What the fuck are you going on about now?

211
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,046
You've got a big head.

212
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,006
Little Jun-ho's…

213
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,134
a big boy now.

214
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,596
No, it's not that.

215
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,559
I've cuffed a lot of people.

216
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,356
I've found these can break.

00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,181
Sir, there's someone here
looking for Jun-ho.

245
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,308
What?

246
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,185
Jun-ho's still missing.

247
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,648
Yes, she said if not him,
that maybe, um, the two of you could meet.

248
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
You and I have met before…

249
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,002
[Hye-yeon] …when my little brother
was in the hospital.

250
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,504
[somber music playing]

251
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,392
There's something I need to hear.

252
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,981
Or maybe there's something
you need to tell me.

253
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,863
EVIDENCE
ITEM USED TO COMMIT SUICIDE

254
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,198
[Hye-yeon] A while ago,
a man came to pay his respects,

255
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,326
he said he was my brother's junior.

256
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,830
[sighs] Jun-ho.

257
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,379
Jun-ho wasn't your brother's junior.

258
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,426
He's the D.P. who pursued your brother.

259
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,139
[Beom-gu] I'm sorry.

260
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,816
[Hye-yeon] There's no way
I can forgive him.

261
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,319
For all that's happened.

262
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,660
[Beom-gu] I can't say
that I understand it either.

263
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,708
But I know Jun-ho
was going to tell you the truth later.

264
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,420
To take the responsibility.

[shattering]

-Stop!

but for Jun-ho, especially.

276
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,629
[Hye-yeon] What are you saying?

277
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,676
That's all just bullshit and you know it.

[exhales deeply]

279
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,099
Well, you're not wrong.

Around here,

[Hye-yeon inhales]

283
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,280
[exhales] Listen to you…

284
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,116
Like nothing can be done about it.

to that question… [inhales]

290
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,055
and it cost my family…

[Hye-yeon sniffling]

293
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,158
Do you believe that Private Kim Ru-ri
deserves the death penalty?

294
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,037
Corporal Jeong Hyeong-beom
was shot in the thigh.

295
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,123
He didn't receive medical attention
for over an hour.

296
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,377
He died due to blood loss.

297
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,423
The USB that An Jun-ho
wanted to give to me

298
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,093
had evidence that supported that.

299
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,097
You're saying it was the military
that made Corporal Jeong die?

300
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,809
-That could be a stretch.
-Yes!

301
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,062
However, they have a duty.

302
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,857
A promise to our soldiers.

303
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,444

You're right.

307
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,415
Sometimes I think…

00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,587
about how the military is,
and I don't know if…

309
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,925

[Jun-ho's mom sighs]
The man said to please call.

326

He said he was your superior.

The man who called me,

328
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,337
he sounded desperate, son.

[store employee sighs]
How many times do I have to tell you?

330
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,265
He took the original.

-Cut me some slack, all right?
-[keyboard clacking]

Such a jackass.

Sir, I only need a little information.
It would really help me.

I really don't remember anything.
I'm telling you.

Sergeant Park, if you're gonna try
and stop me--

[Beom-gu] <i>No.</i>

341

<i>Let's do as you said. Find the USB</i>
<i>and hand it over to Gu Ja-woon.</i>

00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,431
What made you suddenly
change your mind, though?

343
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,476
While taking Jun-ho, he ran away.

<i>With how this has played out,</i>

345
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,274
<i>we have to catch him first</i>,
<i>and hand over the USB.</i>

<i>That's our best play.</i>

347

[sighs] It's not my top choice,

348
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,658
but we can't let him go to prison.

<i>Don't miss him.</i>

351
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,876
[Ho-yeol] Yes, sir.
I'll catch him no matter what.

00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,087
[people protesting]

353
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,380
[reporter] Today is the day.

354
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,924
The trial for the lawsuit
of the Military Human Rights Center

355
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,218
has brought upon the government
for compensation…

356
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,346
"OUR SON" WHEN HE ENLISTS
"YOUR SON" WHEN HE GETS HURT

357
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,139
Here in front of the courthouse,

358
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,476
people from the Human Rights Center
are demanding state compensation,

359
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,187
while the victims' family members
are protesting against the lawsuit

360
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,022
-and protection of the criminals.

361
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,107
[tense music playing]

362
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,071
Colonel Seo.

363
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,742
[sighs]

364
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,954
[Ja-woon] Excuse me…

365
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,249
-Attorney Seo.
-[Eun chuckles]

366
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,379
Thanks to a certain someone.

367
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,674
There he is.

368
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,014
You're waiting for him, right?

369
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,770
Your star witness here,

370
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,481
I wouldn't bank on him saying too much.

371
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,193
[whispers] I'm so sorry.

372
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,412
Are you really that desperate?

373
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,957
Not only are you representing yourself
in the trial,

374
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,792
you're silencing the witness.

375
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,086
Jeez, how unimpressive.

376
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:45,465
Ma'am, say what you will.
But what's relevant here,

377
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,676
is that you have
no material witness today.

378
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,845
[Ji-seop] How are you the best judge
on whether she has

379
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,263
a material witness or not?

380
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,021
[Ji-seop exhales]

381
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,316
-You--
-We're down 100 points and…

382
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,320
losing the testimony of Kim Ru-ri
is just another point.

383
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,698
Consider yourself warned.

384
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,784
This woman fights till she breaks.

385
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,370
[laughs]

386
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,788
Great.

387
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,461
So as a husband and wife,
you will break together.

388
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,882
[Ja-woon chuckling]

389
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,595
-Jesus.
-So if we're…

390
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,681
101 points down…

391
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,767
how do you expect we win?

392
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,771
He's on the way.

393
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,318
We stall them until the USB arrives.

394
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,778
I spoke with him on the phone.

395
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,951
[tense music playing]

396
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,665
[gavel banging]

397
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,708
[bailiff] All rise.

398
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,468
[bailiff] Please be seated.

399
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,144
We will now begin the trial
for compensation for damages,

400
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,062
PLAINTIFF

401
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,314
filed by the Military Human Rights Center,
the plaintiff,

402
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,232
DEFENDANT

403
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,983
against the State, the defendant.

404
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,787
You will see that these cases
and evidence of this trial,

405
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,790
were put together for show
by the plaintiff.

406
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,710
Shall we examine one?

407
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,839
One case in question

408
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,592
involves a senior officer
beating an unruly soldier.

409
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:56,221
The junior officer fought back
and assaulted the senior officer.

410
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,682
This case has already been to trial.

411
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,351
The lawsuit claimed
that the military was negligent,

412
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,562
and the situation lacked proper oversight.

413
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,522
The verdict was decisive.

414
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,568
The fight was an impulsive
violent eruption

415
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,195
that the commanding officers
could not have foreseen.

416
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,073
Our state supervisors
and officers who were there

417
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,325
could not be held responsible.

418
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,619
[Eun inhales]

419
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,787
And now,

420
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,624
Kim Ru-ri here impulsively
started shooting fellow soldiers,

421
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,376
a tragedy no one could have predicted.

422
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,712
The comparison
of Kim Ru-ri's case to this one

423
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,589
is unfair and cannot serve as precedent.

424
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,842
In the case of Kim Ru-ri, he suffered
constant verbal and physical abuse

425
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,844
while he was honoring his service.

426
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,888
Even though administrators
witnessed instances of abuse,

427
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,891
it seems that they overlooked
and condoned this behavior.

428
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,063
Do you have any intention
of substantiating these claims?

429
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,276
There is a case where compensation
was awarded to a soldier

430
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,070
-who attempted suicide due to depression--
-The soldier with depression

431
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,989
-did not shoot his fellow soldiers.
-Yes.

432
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,033
Nobody else was shot, that's true.

433
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,578
The point is, one of the main factors
was the lack of action by the State,

434
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,538
which is why they were found responsible.

435
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,416
That is why this case
should serve as precedent.

436
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,502
The defendant should not use
inappropriate precedents

437
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,796
to denounce the claims
made by the plaintiff.

438
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,844
To get to the case at hand,

439
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,929
the one central
to the plaintiff's lawsuit,

440
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,514
Kim Ru-ri's case,

441
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,810
it happened at 22:07 hours,
on the 4th of April.

442
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,104
Private Kim finished guard duty.

443
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,066
[Ja-woon] <i>When he entered</i>
<i>the barracks, he was still armed.</i>

444
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,194
<i>He then fired 14 rounds of live ammunition</i>

445
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,571
at unarmed soldiers
resting in their barracks.

446
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,864
[all gasping]

447
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,991
-As a result…
-[man] Is he crazy?

448
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:44,079
eight soldiers were wounded,
and two were murdered in cold blood.

449
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:48,458
Your Honor, unlike the plaintiff,
this is not just a claim.

450
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,251
This is the simple truth.

451
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,961
The investigation shows the facts,

452
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,297
which are backed up
by the forensics of the crime scene

453
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,091
and Kim Ru-ri's own confession.

454
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,344
This means the government fulfilled
its responsibilities.

455
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,637
Objection, Your Honor.

456
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,598
In terms of Jeong Hyeong-beom's death,
it's still unclear whether he died

457
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,643
-immediately due to the shooting--
-Do you have evidence to prove this claim?

458
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,770
Also, if Jeong Hyeong-beom's death
wasn't immediate,

459
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,607
is he not still responsible?

460
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,111
If nothing was done when he could
have been saved, it's neglect.

461
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,654
You heard her say "if," didn't you?

462
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,658
Even the plaintiff's counsel
is confused about their main argument.

463
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,911
The facts are simple.

464
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,957
Private Kim Ru-ri came in
and shot down his fellow soldiers,

465
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,458
showing no remorse!

466
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,087
Fourteen rounds of ammunition!

467
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,047
[breathing shakily]

468
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,468
Who could do such a thing,
to their friends in arms.

469
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,971
Yet somehow…

470
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,807
it's the State who's responsible?

471
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,478
Your argument makes no sense.

472
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,483
I'm curious to know
what you all think about it?

473
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,569

[breathes deeply]

479
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,409
You want to be the hero
and throw the last punch, huh?

480
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,080
Beom-gu sent me.

481
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,459
You've done all you can.

482
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,419
Let's stop this now.

483
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,090
I don't believe I've done all I can.

484
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,971
Just give me the USB.

485
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,308
I need it, or you'll end up going to jail.

486
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,559
[Jun-ho] Remember Suk-bong?

487
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,563
Back then…

488
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,652
we did all we could then, right?

489
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:26,866
Uh-huh.

490
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,912
In any case, it doesn't matter.

491
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,751
I have to put you into custody,
just until the trial is over.

492
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,462
[Sung-woo] Wow, fuck.

493
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,757
The camaraderie is touching.

494
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,219
Oh, is this some kind of D.P. reunion?

495
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,556
Sorry, Ho-yeol, but Jun-ho is mine.

496
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,352
I found Jun-ho, sir.

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,239
Getting revenge.

528
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,661
Beating me up makes the anger go away?

529
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,912
Shut up, asshole!

530
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,040
You don't know what I've been through!

-[Sung-woo grunting]
-[choking]

532
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,878

533

-to ease your guilty conscience. [choking]
-[struggling grunts]

534
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:48,925
Shit.

538
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,767
[Sung-woo] Fuck.

539

[tense music playing]

540
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,991
The storage lockers in the station,
meet me there.

541
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,246
Plaintiff, do you have
any evidence to submit?

542
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,331
If you don't, uh…

543
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,668
Wait. Wait, you requested
that a witness give testimony.

544
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,129
Then come,

545
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,214
-Kim Ru-ri, please take the stand.
-[Eun] Your Honor…

546
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,717
I would like to request
a different witness.

547
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,302
-[inhales sharply]
-[audience murmuring]

548
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,975
Plaintiff calls Captain Lim Ji-seop
to the stand,

549
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,852
an officer of the Military Police.

550
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,398
Captain Lim was not only involved
in the Kim Ru-ri incident,

551
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,483
but also with the case
concerning Cho Suk-bong,

552
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,445
which likely influenced
the Kim Ru-ri incident.

553
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,822
He was the officer in charge
of the platoon.

554
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,740
That is a reach.

555
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,325
And nobody had more access
to this than the Captain.

556
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,870
I would urge this court

557
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,330
to listen to what the captain has to say

558
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,208
and form their own conclusions

559
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,253
about who is really accountable.

560
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,548

[judges mumbling]

563
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,558
Now, now…

564
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,812
I will allow the request.
Take the stand, please.

565
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,399
[audience murmuring]

566
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,111
[judge] Captain Lim Ji-seop,
please come forward.

567
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,369
You D.P. bitches!

00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,355
[Jun-ho] Enough.

[Sung-woo grunting]

577
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,570
Park Sung-woo.

578
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,032
What?

579
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:18,991
I…

580
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,203
[whimpers] I'm sorry…

581
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,665
[inhales sharply]

582
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,166
…about everything.

583
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,462
Don't fucking apologize,
you son of a bitch!

584
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,424
Did you think I knew
that bastard would die, huh?

585
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,927
Huh? How could I?

586
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,971
I never knew he would kill himself.

587
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,180
[Jun-ho wheezing]

588
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,516
Hey, you son of a bitch!

589
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,935
Sung-woo, fucking stop it now, please!

590

591
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,608
[Sung-woo] Fuck the D.P.

592
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,734
[Ho-yeol] Jesus.

593
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,988
It's over, okay? Shit!

594
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,201
[whimpering]

595
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,413
[pants, groans]

596
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,957
[Ho-yeol] Jun-ho, let's go, okay?

597
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,625
[Jun-ho moans]

598
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,002
[Ho-yeol] Please, I'm asking.

602
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,223
I'm so sorry.

603
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,810
Just hand it over, asshole!

604
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,896
-Stop.
-[Ho-yeol grunts]

605
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,192
Come here. Give it to me, damn it.

606
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,986
Give it to me.

607
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:38,946
[Jun-ho] Damn it.

609

611
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,915
Jesus! Give it to me, you bastard!

612
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,835
I do solemnly swear to tell the truth,

613
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,298
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

614
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,800
under pains and penalties of perjury.

615
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,598
[judge] Plaintiff's counsel,
you may begin your questioning.

616
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,350
[Ji-seop exhales, clears throat]

617
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,644
Yes. Witness.

618
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,521
Can you tell us and the court

619
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,274
any information you know
related to this case?

620
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,110
[soft whispers]

621
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:30,331
One thing that I know that I believe
Attorney Seo already stated,

622
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,542
is in the case of Corporal Jeong,

623
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,128
he was shot in the thigh
during the first round of shots

624
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,588
that Kim Ru-ri fired.

625
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,301
The arrival of the rescue helicopter
was delayed, and he was…

626
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,308
alive for approximately
an hour and a half.

627
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,476
[audience gasping]

628
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,811
[woman] What is he saying?

629
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,522
[audience exclaiming, murmuring]

630
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,274
[exhales sharply]

631
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,025
[Ja-woon] Your Honor.

632
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,027
Objection.

633
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,571
He is making unsubstantiated claims--

634
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,533
You would know if you are a part
of the Korean Military, as I am,

635
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,785
that what I'm telling you
right now can happen

636
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,578
and is not impossible at all.

637
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,579
[judge] Please.

638
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,000
As a witness, only say
what you can substantiate.

639
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,959
Okay.

640
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,090
Till now… [sighs]

641
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:27,305
during my tenure, as a captain serving
in the Republic of Korea Army,

642
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,350
I have never seen anything
as terrible as this before.

643
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,855
[Ji-seop exhales deeply]

644
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:43,612
So then what on earth are we
supposed to do in that situation?

645
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,744
[sobs]

646
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,998
What could we have done that could be
considered the right response?

647
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,590
It's a simple answer.

648
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,761
[sighs]

649
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,890
We wait for an order to come in.

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,354
[Hyeong-beom] Please save me.

[Ji-seop] <i>And we all know…</i>

["Shine in Your Blue" by Kriz playing]

670
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,986
We all know that at times those
in higher command are not there

671
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,571
so they don't grasp the urgency

672
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,574
and there is a delay before we get
an official to give us permission.

673
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,954
Does that make it okay
for a person to kill

674
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,872
because he was brutally abused?

675
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,707
No, I don't believe it does.

676
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,377
Does a person deserve to die
because he abused someone?

677
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,462
No, I don't believe they do.

678
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,756
So what is your point then?

679
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,050
Here's the point I'm trying to make.

680
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,886
Nobody should have to die waiting,

00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,432

the order from a superior to save them.

[inhales sharply]

689
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,499
It's because of the systems we created.

690
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,627
Those are your opinions.
We've heard enough.

691
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,965
It's the individual
that is at fault in all those--

692
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,926
Then why do all those individuals
happen to be lumped together?

693
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,222
[Ji-seop] For what reason
did they join the military?

694
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,768
To protect this country,
that's why they all joined the military.

695
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,941
They all lived together,
and one of them tried to kill the others.

696
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,194
The State's somehow not responsible?

697
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,237
There's no proof or direct correlation?

698
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,782
Can you tell me what these soldiers
signed up to defend

699
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,784
and what kind of country is behind it?

700

[locker clanking]

706
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,348
I guess you came to find the USB?

707
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,020
[metal clanking]

708
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,941
I'm sorry, Sergeant Han.

709
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,905
I don't have the USB anymore.

710
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,620
What's that mean?

711
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:22,998
[Eun] <i>Your Honor.</i>

712
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,751
I would like to submit evidence

713
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,504
that will substantiate
Captain Lim Ji-seop's testimony.

714
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,089
Corporal Jeong's autopsy report

715
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,841
and a second about Kim Ru-ri
that tracked his bullets.

716
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,264
It is evidence that proves
that it was not an immediate death.

717
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,349
[audience chattering indistinctly]

718
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,184
-[Eun whispers] Well done.
-[Beom-gu pants]

719
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,982
This is the initial report
before any revisions were made.

720
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,569
The source of that evidence is unknown.
That evidence is inadmissible.

721
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,070
[Beom-gu] I am the source.

722
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,822
[exhales]

723
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,325
Military Police, Sergeant Park Beom-gu,
Your Honor.

724
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,536
You're Military Police.

725
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,913
Now remember who you are!

726
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,707
[breathing deeply]

727
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,167
You're welcome, sir.

728
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,130
[Jun-ho] <i>Sergeant Park,</i>

729
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,631
it's me, An Jun-ho.

730
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,012
My mother said you wanted me to call you.

731
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,724
<i>Hello, this is Shin Hye-yeon.</i>

732
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:22,725
[inhales sharply]

733
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,437
<i>I heard the whole story.</i>

734
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,398
<i>About what happened back then.</i>

735
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,986
<i>And what it was</i>
<i>that you wanted to tell me.</i>

736
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,029
[Jun-ho sighs]

737
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,615
[Jun-ho] <i>I'm sorry.</i>

738
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,993
[breathing deeply]

739
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,578
You don't need to be sorry.

740
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,958
For you and I…

741
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,296
what matters is tomorrow.

742
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,891
I'll be the one to deliver the USB
to the court tomorrow.

743
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:08,020
<i>During the trial, Captain Lim will drag</i>
<i>things out by testifying as a witness.</i>

744
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,815
Wait, I'm confused.
What do you mean by that?

745
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,029
Sung-woo, Oh Min-u, and Ho-yeol
will chase you and Ms. Shin.

746
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,532
<i>You and Hye-yeon</i>
<i>need to create a distraction.</i>

747
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,371
-Sir, what do you mean…
<i>-Just listen, you punk. It's okay.</i>

748
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,373
<i>Trust me.</i>

749
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,334
Jun-ho…

750
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,628
The USB, where is it?

751
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,339
[Ho-yeol] <i>Hang on.</i>

752
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,008
This was all a distraction to buy time?

753
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,845
[inhales] Hey, dumbass, don't you see?

754
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,265
Beom-gu tricked the both of us.

755
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,606
Did you think exposing them
would be that easy?

756
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,109
[unsettling music playing]

757
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,781
[judge] I will now announce
the verdict taking into account

758
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,241
the plaintiff's evidence.

759
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,786
The judicial assessment and verdict

760
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,039
concerning the compensation due
in this lawsuit,

761
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,169
that was filed by the plaintiff,
the military victims and related persons,

762
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,380
against the defendant, the State,

763
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,757
is as follows.

764
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,384
[quiet sobs]

765
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:22,886
Verdict.

766
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,056
The court accepts the plaintiff's claim

767
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,810
in regards to compensation against
the State, which includes the military.

768
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,980
It also includes commanders,
prosecutors, and investigators.

-However…
-[scoffs]

773
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,870
the acknowledgement includes some cases.

774
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,830
As for the other cases,

775
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,833
it was decided
that some evidence is needed.

776
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,878
Therefore, the ruling would be delayed.

777
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,380

Great work.

796

[sighs] You too.

797
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,219
[Ja-woon] I guess this counts as a tie?

[chuckles]

799
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,559

[Beom-gu sighs]

804

Sergeant First Class Park,

805
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,211
you are charged with leaking
classified information and violating…

[Beom-gu sighs]

812
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,099
Let's have a smoke, then we'll go.

Why…

816
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,369
Why… Why did you do that, Sergeant Park?

817
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,205
I'm the one who started this.

818
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,002
Think about what you've done.
You didn't see this coming?

819

Hey, D.P.'s.

Enjoy life when you're on the outside.

And don't slack off too much, you punk.

827
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,283
Okay. [sniffles]

828
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:03,458
After your stint in jail, continue to
work hard and serve with integrity

Understood?

Is this a joke?

848
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,504
See, didn't I say that this would be
taking things a bit too far?

849
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,174
You were so creative
getting yourself into prison,

850
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,926
I thought you'd like to eat creative too.

851
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,385
You bastard, I swear…

852
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,096
No problem, I'll eat it.

853
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,682
Give it here.

854
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,022
Well done.

But, sir, will this be worth it?

856
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,986
You're locked up in here, sir,

857
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,531
and we didn't even win--

858
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,865
[Beom-gu] Did we lose, then?

Stop saying dumb crap,

-But smoking's not allowed.

[Ho-yeol] All right.

Come on.

Hmm?

874
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,549
You've taken all the blame.

875
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,261
Well, if someone has to lose his job,

876
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,305
it's better it's a lowly sergeant
than the captain.

877

879
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,814
You had to stay. Someone needs

Sergeant Park Beom-gu.

881

You know…
