1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:01,900
Som, let’s go home.

2
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:10,831
Well? How do we look?

3
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:11,868
Som is gorgeous.

4
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,023
Chadjen, the way you’re staring at Som-O…

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,023
It’s like you’re getting back together.

6
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:18,899
Watch your mouth, you nerd.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,305
Bye, Chad.

8
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,503
Will you marry me?

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,425
Prepare the information for me.

11
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:38,069
Please keep me posted about his condition every eight hours.

12
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:40,102
Send me the full report at 10 am tomorrow.

13
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:44,725
Chad, is your shift over?

14
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,155
Yes.

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,407
I got a wedding invitation from Khao and New.

16
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:51,979
Chadjen, who are you going to the wedding with?

17
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:56,053
Why don’t you ask Som-O?

18
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:59,007
I don’t think she wants to go with me.

19
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,105
Chad, you are good at everything but you always blunder in this.

20
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:14,508
Can I ask you something?

21
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,208
Is love that hard?

22
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,808
All you need to do is be honest with yourself.

23
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,577
Then everything will be fine.

24
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:23,877
Trust me.

25
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:33,804
Chadjen.

26
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:39,402
I’m rooting for you. Okay?

27
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,601
It’s so hard to set a meeting in your packed schedule.

28
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:07,063
I want to have a swimming race with you

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,170
Right now?

30
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:11,176
Yes.

31
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:13,822
Go find another training partner.

32
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:17,979
I proposed to Som.

33
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:29,068
You are too late.

34
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:36,620
So?

35
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:38,705
Will you compete with me?

36
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,506
Why would I compete with you?

37
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:43,665
You already won.

38
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,537
(Pay attention in class. I’m worried about you.)

39
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,390
(You can do it. Chadjen ♡ Som-O)

40
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:48,510
(I’m rooting for you. I miss you.)

41
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:50,650
(Good luck with your exam. I’m always waiting for you.)

42
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,186
Dad.

43
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:44,508
Yes.

44
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:51,367
It’s refreshing.

45
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:55,124
This is your lucky red envelope.

46
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,801
I’m happy that you have been taking care of each other until you have today.

47
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:03,666
It’s because you are meant to be together.

48
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,502
I wish you a long, happy, and prosperous marriage.

49
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:13,869
New, you need to work hard so you will have many kids.

50
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,257
I am working hard, Dad.

51
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:19,068
Great.

52
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,414
I’m working hard for my career.

53
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,309
What? Will you be able to have kids?

54
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:27,979
Khao, please take care of my son.

55
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:31,694
Sure. When he’s with me, he always listens to my words.

56
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:32,669
Good.

57
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:37,405
I’m living abroad most of the time.

58
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:39,106
Please take care of Khao for me.

59
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,477
Yes.

60
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:45,610
My daughter is boyish. She doesn’t know how to act cute.

61
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,210
Please forgive her.

62
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:48,795
Mom.

63
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,653
Dad, Mom, don’t worry.

64
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,977
Khao is the cutest woman in my eyes.

65
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,795
He got that from me.

66
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:04,075
I’ll do my best to take care of Khao.

67
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:07,666
You are too confident about that.

68
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:40,404
Oh, is this Som, the millionaire illustrator?

69
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:42,758
You are overstating.

70
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:44,694
I saw your work for Tao’s book.

71
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,979
It’s so good.

72
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,035
The book posters are everywhere.

73
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,125
The book is bestselling. Our classmates envy you.

74
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,613
It’s all thanks to Tao.

75
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:58,208
If he didn’t nominate me, I wouldn’t have had the chance to do it.

76
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,465
I’m proud of you.

77
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:07,979
So what is going on between you and Tao?

78
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:11,712
Your relationship has been public for three years.

79
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,712
Will you be the next one to send out a wedding invitation?

80
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:17,711
Go back to your table.

81
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,568
What? I’m just asking.

82
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:20,502
Go.

83
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:32,702
Som-O, here you are.

84
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,528
Hey.

85
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:36,628
Where is…

86
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,383
Nam?

87
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,019
- Yes. - She’s busy.

88
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:41,074
So there are only two of us.

89
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:43,074
You are prettier.

90
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,631
- I haven’t seen you for a long time. I miss you.
- You are so sweet.

91
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:46,514
How are you doing?

92
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:48,389
I’m doing well.

93
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:49,817
Don’t forget to take the souvenir.

94
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:51,877
Thank you.

95
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:53,549
Som.

96
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,508
Lily.

97
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:01,106
Stop making that face.

98
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,974
But Mhog…

99
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,400
I came here to congratulate Khao.

100
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,360
I heard about Chadjen and Sue.

101
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,016
It was nonsense.

102
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:19,075
Som-O, you don’t need to overthink.

103
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:23,857
Sue is always like that. She often does strange things.

104
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:27,213
It doesn’t matter anymore, Lily.

105
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:29,515
Chadjen and I were over.

106
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:31,979
Som. Som-O.

107
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,620
Come and take a picture with us.

108
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:37,434
Lily, let’s go take a picture with them.

109
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:39,980
You go first. I’ll sign the wedding guest book first.

110
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,613
You are so pretty, Khao.

111
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,811
- Let’s take a picture. - Come on.

112
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,051
You look handsome.

113
00:10:58,213 --> 00:10:58,906
Lily.

114
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,520
Lily.

115
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:02,927
Fahsai. Min-min.

116
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,811
I miss you.

117
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:08,398
We haven’t seen each other for almost ten years.

118
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:10,117
Since we graduated high school.

119
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:11,974
Who is with you?

120
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:15,979
This is my boyfriend, Mhog. He was a senior at our school.

121
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:18,896
- Hello. - Hello.

122
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,407
Lily, you’re showing off your boyfriend.

123
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:25,977
Friends.

124
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,171
The reception is about to start. Let’s go inside.

125
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:31,875
Let’s go inside.

126
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,776
I’ll go in to take care of things.

127
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,811
We’ll follow you.

128
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:44,317
Yes.

129
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:45,571
See you.

130
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,705
We’ll be right after you.

131
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:56,955
Firstly, I would like to welcome everyone who came to celebrate the wedding today.

132
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,752
Please welcome the groom and the bride, New and Khao.

133
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:28,469
I have a special guest who will make a toast for the couple.

134
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:31,051
Please welcome Shark Tao.

135
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,605
The superhot athlete.

136
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:40,269
Thanks, buddy.

137
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,712
I want to thank the groom and bride for giving me the honor of making a toast.

138
00:12:56,527 --> 00:13:00,411
I’m so happy to be a part of my best friends’ wedding.

139
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,980
We have known each other for a long time.

140
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:05,561
We are very close.

141
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:06,905
Am I right, nerd?

142
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:07,800
Yes.

143
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:16,911
But there are not only three of us.

144
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:25,565
There is another friend that I want to talk about.

145
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:35,974
This friend is precious to me.

146
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:41,413
When I look back on my childhood, this friend always pops into my memory.

147
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,414
Today.

148
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,306
I want to help this friend do something.

149
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:57,014
It’s the most important thing that I can do for this friend.

150
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:00,801
This friend is…

151
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:09,761
Chadjen.

152
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,475
Don’t waste this chance.

153
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:47,365
Hello.

154
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,708
The love of this couple.

155
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:56,308
It started in high school.

156
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:01,608
Their love reminds me of a woman.

157
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:09,293
I thought…

158
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:14,605
I didn’t have any feelings for her.

159
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,699
But actually…

160
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:24,506
I can never forget her.

161
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:39,807
The message she wrote on my student uniform “Let’s go to the college together.”

162
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:51,299
Even if she didn’t write that, I was still ready to go with her.

163
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,714
The heart sculpture she made for me.

164
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:02,204
Many people said it looked scary.

165
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:05,765
But for me,

166
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,008
The heart gives me strength every time I feel down.

167
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:21,007
The mechanical pencil she gave me, I used it until I was in college.

168
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,711
I used it until it was broken.

169
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:30,610
I repaired it again and again

170
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,102
until it was broken beyond repair.

171
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:40,158
There was one time…

172
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:46,502
she bought tickets for us to watch a concert together.

173
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,300
But her tickets were fake.

174
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,167
So we listened to the music in front of the venue.

175
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,802
But for me,

176
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:13,370
that was the best concert in my life.

177
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:25,469
The letter that she drew my picture on it.

178
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:31,974
She probably thought it was lost.

179
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,262
Actually, I still have it.

180
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,309
I wanted to reply to her.

181
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:40,727
But I was too coward to do it.

182
00:17:42,254 --> 00:17:46,229
Now, I may have lost that chance for good.

183
00:17:56,385 --> 00:18:00,703
Every time I feel nervous, I always do this.

184
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,311
Many people may wonder why I do that.

185
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:08,921
It’s not just because I feel nervous.

186
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,263
It’s also because I miss her voice.

187
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,204
The voice that woke me up every morning since we were young.

188
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,712
When I feel confused, hesitant, or lack of confidence,

189
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,524
her voice makes me feel…

190
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:39,909
that I still have her by my side.

191
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:44,361
I want to hear her voice every day.

192
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,108
In reality, she no longer talks to me.

193
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:56,604
But I still think of her.

194
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,305
I haven’t heard that voice for three years.

195
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:04,768
How dare you come here?

196
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:08,108
You had your chance but you screwed it.

197
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,540
What kind of man makes his woman cry?

198
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:14,911
Chadjen, I think you should leave.

199
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:16,454
You should come back another time.

200
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,914
There won’t be another time.

201
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:19,207
Don’t ever come here again.

202
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,303
Get out.

203
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,814
I miss her so much.

204
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,309
Not only her voice,

205
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:36,804
but I miss everything about her.

206
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:47,109
If I had another chance,

207
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:56,767
I would have written a letter to her first.

208
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,202
I would have run after her.

209
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,205
I wouldn’t have run away from her.

210
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:13,109
She wouldn’t be tired from running after me.

211
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,120
I don’t know if she…

212
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:13,808
Som.

213
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,405
Why are you telling me everything now?

214
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:28,752
Som.

215
00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:33,859
Can we go back to where we were?

216
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:36,820
It’s not that simple, Chad.

217
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:40,505
I spent three years to forget you.

218
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:42,097
Three years!

219
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,613
I almost erased all of our memories.

220
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:50,315
Don’t be so selfish.

221
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:02,111
You would never understand how scared I was that day.

222
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:09,001
I had to hear you say you were tired of dating me.

223
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,503
Hello.

224
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:43,976
(Som, I’ll make you smile one last time.)

225
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:46,810
(I’ll leave you alone for good.)

226
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,838
(Listen to the voice message I’m sending you.)

227
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:54,408
(Listen to it with Chad.)

228
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:02,808
I’ll listen to it.

229
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:18,305
I proposed to Som but she rejected me.

230
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:25,801
Where have you been in the past three years?

231
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:31,816
When Som laughed,

232
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:34,417
when she cried,

233
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,417
when she got sick,

234
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,108
where were you?

235
00:23:39,343 --> 00:23:40,515
When she was…

236
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:42,604
she was harassed by King,

237
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:44,808
it was a terrible day for her.

238
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:46,708
But you weren’t there for her.

239
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:48,866
You always took her for granted.

240
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:58,214
That day was the first day…

241
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,905
I joined a surgery with my professor.

242
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:09,602
I lost my first patient.

243
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:18,014
I didn’t know what to do.

244
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,453
I couldn’t shake it off my head.

245
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,905
I kept asking myself.

246
00:24:33,785 --> 00:24:35,008
What did I do wrong?

247
00:24:38,942 --> 00:24:39,979
A guy like me,

248
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:46,468
can I really love Som-O?

249
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:53,025
Can I really be a doctor?

250
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,317
Can I take responsibility for my patient’s life?

251
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:02,404
You’re always worried about things that have not happened yet.

252
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:05,001
You never thought about the things that are right in front of you.

253
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:06,511
That is Som.

254
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:09,601
Som-O believes in you,

255
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,979
more than she believes in me.

256
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:14,416
That’s why she’s still waiting for you.

257
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:21,980
I know that you have been taking care of her.

258
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,902
Her dad’s medical fees, you paid it.

259
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,278
Our classroom’s common fund, you found it.

260
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,278
The race, that was also you.

261
00:25:31,943 --> 00:25:32,762
Why?

262
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:34,019
Why?

263
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,859
Huh?

264
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:37,281
Because I loved her.

265
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:40,611
I love her so much.

266
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:48,410
I can’t lose her to anyone.

267
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:57,168
Why are you telling me now?

268
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,708
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

269
00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:06,368
I’m sorry.

270
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,314
For the past ten years, that’s all you can say?

271
00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:19,124
How can I make it clear to you?

272
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:29,112
How do you feel about me?

273
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,718
Say it clearly.

274
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:43,466
You can solve hard cases and save patients’ lives.

275
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,697
Is it that hard to say your honest feelings?

276
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:54,940
Then I have nothing else to say.

277
00:27:57,324 --> 00:27:58,822
I love you, Som-O.

278
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:07,106
Oh baby it’s you, baby it’s you

279
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:11,361
Whispering I love you in my mind

280
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:14,078
But I’m not ready to say this line

281
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:19,614
Baby it’s you, my whole world is you

282
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,034
Secretly loving you

283
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:27,383
But I don’t know how to say

284
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,674
It’s better to just keep it this way

285
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:41,405
What about you, Som?

286
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:46,614
Do you love me?

287
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,348
I love you too.

288
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,666
Don’t go anywhere again.

289
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:57,911
Tao, you did the right thing.

290
00:29:58,678 --> 00:29:59,706
You are a good man.

291
00:30:01,057 --> 00:30:02,602
But this good man doesn’t get anything.

292
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:05,976
How about this?

293
00:30:06,294 --> 00:30:10,934
I’ll give all my merits to you and pray that you will find your soulmate soon.

294
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:13,798
Amen.

295
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,454
What are you two doing here?

296
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,505
You should go greet your guests.

297
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:21,979
Alright.

298
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,428
Don’t worry about me.

299
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Don’t overthink.

300
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:26,512
Let’s go, Khao.

301
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,157
Som, will you marry me?

302
00:30:44,754 --> 00:30:45,902
I’m sorry, Tao.

303
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,299
I never love you that way.

304
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,992
Tao, look at that.

305
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:29,300
The flamingo tube is so old that its neck is hanging down.

306
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,654
It’s just like me.

307
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:35,434
I’ve been waiting for you for so long that I feel down.

308
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:41,979
It happened a long time ago.

309
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:45,906
I don’t get it.

310
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:48,567
Why can’t I forget you?

311
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:01,908
You don’t need to forget me.

312
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:03,982
We are friends.

313
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,232
Chad.

314
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:41,315
You scared me.

315
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:42,315
What are you doing?

316
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:45,158
You have been working since the morning. You haven’t finished it?

317
00:32:45,357 --> 00:32:46,077
Yes.

318
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:48,303
It’s almost the fan meeting day.

319
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,762
I’m worried that I won’t finish it in time.

320
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:57,909
Hello.

321
00:32:58,232 --> 00:33:00,059
There is a postal package for you.

322
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:02,090
Come on in.

323
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:04,411
Why is it so big?

324
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:11,645
Your name is on it.

325
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:13,038
How is it not yours?

326
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:17,517
I don’t know.

327
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,807
Som, why don’t you open it?

328
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:21,440
Here.

329
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,614
What’s going on?

330
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:08,259
What is this, Chad?

331
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,284
Surprise.

332
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:13,675
What surprise?

333
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:18,988
It’s like you stole my heart

334
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:24,057
Oh you’re the guy who steals my heart

335
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:28,906
I love you with all my heart

336
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:33,488
I didn’t prepare myself for disappointment

337
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:38,508
It’s okay if I get hurt from loving you

338
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:42,305
I still want to give it a try

339
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:10,514
Will you marry me?

340
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:13,614
You should have asked me a long time ago

341
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:17,305
I’ll tell you I love you

342
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:24,047
I’ll let you know that I love you with all my heart

343
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:26,517
I’ll confess my love to you

344
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,983
You may be confused by it

345
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:33,632
Love ya, I need ya ahh

346
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:41,973
If I am too reserved or shy, it may be too late

347
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:45,317
I’m afraid that you may fall in love with someone else

348
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:49,394
I’m afraid it may be too late

349
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:55,708
How can you stop your eyes from blinking?

350
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,611
Looking at you,

351
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,743
I can do it all day long.

352
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:06,115
Are you crazy?

353
00:36:07,477 --> 00:36:08,170
You’re crazy.

354
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:27,911
Chad.

355
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:37,914
What’s wrong?

356
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,355
If we do a staring contest,

357
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:46,706
you will lose anyway.

358
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:52,155
Chad.

359
00:36:54,577 --> 00:36:57,022
Are you sure you want to marry me?

360
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:00,045
I am sure.

361
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:13,469
What if you find another woman who is prettier, taller, and more caring than me?

362
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:17,672
Som.

363
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:20,705
I have met hundreds of people.

364
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,336
So what?

365
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:42,760
You are my first and only love.

366
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,112
You are…

367
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,259
getting better with your words.

368
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:53,054
How far you will go to please me?

369
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:55,828
How far?

370
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:57,974
This far.

371
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,520
There aren’t many visitors.

372
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:48,917
But it’s okay.

373
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:52,666
Thank you for publishing my work.

374
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:56,220
Goodbye.

375
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,312
Som-O, can you sign it for me?

376
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:05,437
I love your book.

377
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:06,282
Sure.

378
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,613
What’s your name?

379
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,408
Sunny.

380
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:10,915
Sunny.

381
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:18,164
Done.

382
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:18,859
Here.

383
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:19,762
Thank you.

384
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:30,708
Thank you so much.

385
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:33,007
- Here. - Thank you.

386
00:39:33,322 --> 00:39:34,506
Don’t forget your pen.

387
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,309
Right.

388
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:18,608
Som-O.

389
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:23,102
Didn’t you say you couldn’t come?

390
00:40:24,228 --> 00:40:26,158
We are your fans.

391
00:40:27,832 --> 00:40:28,909
Can you sign it for us?

392
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:37,811
But…this is your book signing.

393
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,364
Why are there only us here?

394
00:40:42,872 --> 00:40:43,708
Stop it.

395
00:40:44,524 --> 00:40:45,429
I’m joking.

396
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:49,102
Som, I can buy all your books.

397
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:50,622
Nerd.

398
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:52,957
- Yes. - Should I buy a publisher?

399
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,798
That’s a good idea.

400
00:40:55,297 --> 00:40:56,229
I shouldn’t do that.

401
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:57,320
Why?

402
00:40:57,342 --> 00:40:58,659
My character in her book doesn’t look good.

403
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,551
Where does it not look good?

404
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:02,613
Point it out.

405
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:05,108
You look great.

406
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,131
Right here?

407
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:07,823
You mean his face?

408
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:09,257
Khao.

409
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:11,828
Tao’s character doesn’t look good.

410
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:14,274
If I don’t look good, neither do you.

411
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,810
(Let’s make a promise. No matter what happens, we will befriend forever.)

412
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:30,192
Those two.

413
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,976
Come here.

414
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:34,632
Come on.

415
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:37,564
What?

416
00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:41,016
Let’s race.

417
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:42,112
Three.

418
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:43,423
Two.

419
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:44,471
One.

420
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:46,511
Hey.

421
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:49,002
Wait for me.

422
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:54,709
I love you with all my heart

423
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:59,388
I didn’t prepare myself for disappointment

424
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:04,514
It’s okay if I get hurt from loving you

425
00:42:04,845 --> 00:42:08,195
I still want to give it a try

426
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:10,931
I’ll tell you I love you

427
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:17,715
I’ll let you know that I love you with all my heart

428
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:20,216
I’ll confess my love to you

429
00:42:20,368 --> 00:42:22,294
You may be confused by it

430
00:42:22,312 --> 00:42:27,365
(I ask myself why it has to be you and you only.)

431
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:35,982
(As years passed, I realized it’s useless to question our love.)

432
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,677
(There is a simple reason for it.)

433
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:47,320
(It’s because you are my first, only, and true love, Chadjen.)

434
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,976
This is my new friend.

435
00:43:57,077 --> 00:43:57,819
His name is Lune.

436
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,687
This is Jewel.

437
00:43:58,764 --> 00:43:59,715
This is Ivy.

438
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,888
This is Star.

439
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:04,527
Don’t look at me like that.

440
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:06,395
I look strange, don’t I?

441
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:08,303
You look cute.

442
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:10,724
Star is so cute.

443
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:12,217
I have a secret to tell you.

444
00:44:12,863 --> 00:44:13,874
I like Star.

445
00:44:15,974 --> 00:44:17,511
Do you think our friends are acting strange?

446
00:44:17,525 --> 00:44:18,551
Lune and Star?

447
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:19,977
I knew it. I’m not the only one who noticed it.

448
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:21,459
I don’t want to hurt White’s feelings.

449
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:23,980
Why don’t we keep our relationship a secret in the meantime?

450
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,318
How could you do this to me?

451
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:28,229
This is why you never had friends.

452
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,410
TO ALL LOVES.

453
00:44:30,848 --> 00:44:33,863
If you are not sure how you feel, why don’t you make it clear?

454
00:44:34,468 --> 00:44:36,561
It’s best for us to be friends.

455
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:40,400
Lune and I, we promised we would get married when we grew up.

456
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,490
TO ALL FRIENDSHIPS.

457
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,250
YOU CHERISH IN YOUR HEART.
