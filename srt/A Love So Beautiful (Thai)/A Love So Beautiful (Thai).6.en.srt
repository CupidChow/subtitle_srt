1
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:03,625
Who is this, Tao?

2
00:00:04,023 --> 00:00:04,585
She’s a friend of mine.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,191
I told you girls will only distract you.

4
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:08,859
You’re not mad at me, are you?

5
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:09,856
I’m not.

6
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:14,582
Happy New Year!

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,308
(Som-O)

8
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:17,970
I want you guys to write it in a piece of paper
(Som-O)

9
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,656
I want you guys to write it in a piece of paper

10
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:22,408
who the first person you want to see on New Year’s Day is.

11
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:23,503
I’m sorry, Som.

12
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:24,789
It’s okay.

13
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,921
I won’t think about it again now that you apologized.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,050
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,410
(Grade 12)

16
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:05,808
Everyone, take your old seat. So It won’t be confusing.

17
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,254
Ms. Vice President, why are you ordering us around?

18
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:13,705
Chad who is the president doesn’t say anything about this.

19
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,219
Get up. This is my desk.

20
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:23,897
I got it.

21
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:30,522
A lot of people skip class on the first day of school.

22
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:31,760
Look.

23
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:34,565
Tao probably has a swimming practice.

24
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,859
The other kids probably study at home by themselves.

25
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:38,970
There are only three of us today.

26
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:40,457
Why don’t we go study together after school?

27
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:50,121
Chadjen, do you want to study with me?

28
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:52,663
There are many questions that I don’t understand.

29
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:54,460
Can you explain them to me?

30
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:57,140
Me?

31
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:58,325
Yes.

32
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:00,108
Chad is unavailable today.

33
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:02,656
He has a plan with me and Som.

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,862
That’s right.

35
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:08,708
Khao and Som-O, are you going to apply to med school?

36
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,016
Khao, aren’t you going to apply to the faculty of science?

37
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,666
Som, you are not going to apply to a med school, are you?

38
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:19,536
Sorry.

39
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:22,485
I forgot that I have another plan today.

40
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:28,413
It’s okay. Maybe next time.

41
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,108
Right.

42
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,678
Lily can solve all the questions. She doesn’t need you…

43
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,481
If there are any questions I can’t solve, I’ll ask you.

44
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,614
Go.

45
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:54,204
Tao.

46
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,176
You look fitter.

47
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:02,905
But your physical condition had been better.

48
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,749
You need to get back on a diet.

49
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:06,709
Yes.

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,506
What are you going to do about college?

51
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:10,299
Did you decide where you are going?

52
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,614
I’m waiting to see which college my friends will choose.

53
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,863
Your future doesn’t depend on your friends.

54
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:19,420
You can get admission through sports quota.

55
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,665
You can choose any college you want.

56
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:23,863
You should have made up your mind by now.

57
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:25,663
Why do you need to wait for your friends’ decision?

58
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:27,410
Go back to practice.

59
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,511
Yes, Dad.

60
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:51,213
Khao.

61
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,453
Why are you alone?

62
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:54,365
Why don’t you go home?

63
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,204
I’m working on a project for my college portfolio.

64
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,592
Portfolio?

65
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:00,202
You have been doing it since last year.

66
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,549
Does your house still have space left to store them?

67
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,623
Nonsense.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,232
You are practicing every day to get the sports quota.

69
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:12,140
I need to grow my portfolio to get college admission as well.

70
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,260
When they interview me, I will have a better chance.

71
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:18,908
Are you alone?

72
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,663
Where are the others?

73
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:22,305
Where are New, Chad, and Som?

74
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,420
Chad and Som went home together.

75
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:27,979
New didn’t come to school today.

76
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:29,814
I guess he is studying at home.

77
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,613
That’s impossible.

78
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:34,179
If you said he was playing games, it would be more believable.

79
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:37,982
You are crazy. We are in Grade 12. Everyone is focusing on study.

80
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,020
Really?

81
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:42,318
I don’t think so.

82
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:49,102
I heard you are talking about that nerd.

83
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,682
It’s not hard to find him.

84
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:53,614
He’s probably at the game arcade in the mall.

85
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:54,619
The one we saw him.

86
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,308
I knew it.

87
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,789
I thought he was focusing on study.

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,096
I’ll find him.

89
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:11,091
I really attended a seminar.

90
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,585
I sent the photos to you.

91
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,921
The photos only showed the seminar signage and break-time snacks.

92
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:17,305
You were not in any of the photos.

93
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,817
How can I be sure that you were at the seminar?

94
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,336
Of course, I was there.

95
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:23,605
Don’t you trust me?

96
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,066
Som.

97
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:30,208
Yes.

98
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:32,657
What, Mom?

99
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:34,309
How are you doing at school?

100
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:35,656
Tell me.

101
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,019
About what?

102
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:39,702
Your teacher called me the other day.

103
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,530
She said she wanted to talk to me about your grades.

104
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:46,660
It wasn’t a big deal, Mom.

105
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:48,463
Why was it not a big deal?

106
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:51,111
If it was not, then why did she call your mom?

107
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:55,208
Your grades must be so bad that your teacher needs to talk to us.

108
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,939
It’s because you never paid attention to her.

109
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,727
I’m working every day. It exhausts me.

110
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,857
You’re a stay-at-home mom.

111
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:06,075
Why don’t you pay closer attention to her?

112
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:08,057
How did you let her have such a problem?

113
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:10,407
You can’t blame everything on me.

114
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:14,445
She is our daughter, not just mine.

115
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:16,130
I’m tired from work.

116
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:18,296
You should have given her advice.

117
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:23,367
(This is such a warm welcome. Come home to see my parents arguing.)

118
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:26,802
Forget about her issue. Let’s talk about you.

119
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:27,441
Where were you?

120
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,807
I was at a seminar.

121
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:56,050
(What are you doing?)

122
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,305
I know that you’re home.

123
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,450
Fine if you don’t want to answer me.

124
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,232
(I’m studying.)

125
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:33,208
Studying?

126
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:43,117
Let’s study math.

127
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:53,979
(You are not the one who can study.)

128
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:57,423
(Just wait and see. I’ll get good grades just like you.)

129
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:28,482
Gewalin.

130
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:29,072
Yes.

131
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:33,515
Did you choose the college you want to attend?

132
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:37,466
Som-O, don’t be afraid.

133
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,108
Tell Ms. Oh what you want to study.

134
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:44,337
Ms. Oh suggested that we should get you a tutor.

135
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:46,820
We need to know what tutoring class you need.

136
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:50,265
We are discussing my college plan only.

137
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,010
Nothing else, right?

138
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:55,782
Yes, that’s what we want to know.

139
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:03,108
(Lily, you scared me for nothing.)

140
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,189
Gewalin.

141
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,804
Yes.

142
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,988
Did you decide what college you want to attend?

143
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,506
So you can tell your parents.

144
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,238
Oh…

145
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,700
I’m still unsure.

146
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,114
I like art and PE classes.

147
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:23,460
I’m really good at running, Dad.

148
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:27,404
You like art and PE classes.

149
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:30,240
The faculty of communication arts may be a good choice for you.

150
00:10:30,702 --> 00:10:33,179
What about business administration?

151
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,303
Business administration sounds good, Ms. Oh.

152
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,768
Many of my colleagues’ kids also study in this field.

153
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,303
Right, Som-O?

154
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,752
I’m not sure.

155
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:49,204
Som, you are in Grade 12 but you still can’t choose what you want to study.

156
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,122
Then how can your dad and I help you?

157
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,174
Business administration is not a bad choice.

158
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,014
There are many career paths you can pursue.

159
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,457
If you still can’t make up your mind, then do what your mom said.

160
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,841
So we can get it over with.

161
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:02,022
But…

162
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,435
How about this?

163
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:06,220
Let’s give Gewalin some time to decide what she wants to do.

164
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:07,817
We still have time.

165
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:12,339
When she makes up her mind, we can meet and talk again.

166
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,860
If there are any updates, I’ll keep you posted.

167
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,602
Thank you.

168
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:22,514
Thank you two for cooperating with the school.

169
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:23,831
Thank you.

170
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,897
May we be excused?

171
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:26,751
Sure.

172
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:29,853
Thank you.

173
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,198
Gewalin.

174
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:33,705
Please stay.

175
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:36,191
Gewalin’s parents, you can leave.

176
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,302
I need to talk to you.

177
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:40,491
Have a seat.

178
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:52,222
Khao.

179
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:54,222
Why isn’t Som back yet?

180
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:56,515
She will be right back.

181
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:57,711
Why do you keep asking about her?

182
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,568
Tao, where are you going?

183
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:07,939
He’s asking for trouble again.

184
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,020
Hello.

185
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,111
Tao got admission through sports quota.

186
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:22,066
He can choose any college that he wants.

187
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,823
But he’s too attached to his friends.

188
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:27,503
That’s why he still can’t make up his mind.

189
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,157
I know that he is very close to you.

190
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:35,417
He hasn’t chosen his college because of you.

191
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:38,800
Let me be honest with you.

192
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:41,868
Don’t ruin his future.

193
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:47,730
Dad.

194
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:50,768
Tao.

195
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:53,262
How can you say that to her?

196
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:56,407
Why are you treating me like I’m a child?

197
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,405
I can make my own choice.

198
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,804
It has nothing to do with Som-O or anyone.

199
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:03,921
Don’t blame her for this.

200
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:06,511
Calm down, Tao.

201
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,745
Then let’s talk, Tao.

202
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:15,066
Do you want me to be on the national team?

203
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,309
Yes.

204
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:18,641
Fine.

205
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,976
I wonder if athletes don’t practice,

206
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:25,405
will they still be selected to join the national team?

207
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:27,908
Tao.

208
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:28,807
Tao.

209
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:30,306
Tao, come back.

210
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,183
- Tao. - Tao.

211
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:33,428
Tao.

212
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,011
Calm down.

213
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,807
Tao.

214
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:42,761
It’s not Som-o’s or anyone’s fault.

215
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:58,312
I think Coach did that because he loves and is worried about you.

216
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:01,697
You need to calm down and go back to practice.

217
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:03,776
That’s not true.

218
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,497
He did that because he loves himself.

219
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,882
Your words are too harsh, don’t you think?

220
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:12,920
No, it’s not, Khao.

221
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:17,114
He didn’t get into the Olympic team.

222
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,859
So he expects me to fulfill his dream.

223
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:27,955
I get how you feel, Som-O.

224
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:34,413
How hard it is, not knowing what you like.

225
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,708
Should we send Som to study abroad?

226
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,712
She barely gets through school here.

227
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:48,420
Will she be alright if she studies abroad?

228
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,708
What should we do?

229
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:56,672
What should we do, Dad?

230
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,411
If her grades were higher, there would be no problem.

231
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:05,604
Som-O.

232
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:08,054
Sit down. We need to talk.

233
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,512
Som-O.

234
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:12,617
Dad.

235
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:13,706
What?

236
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:17,435
Just let her go. Give her some time.

237
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:23,059
If your office told you that you were terrible at your job,

238
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:24,891
how would you feel?

239
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:27,185
Stop it. I got what you mean.

240
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,170
(Are you going to this concert?)

241
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,690
(Yes.)

242
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:06,170
(Can I go with you?)

243
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,650
(I haven’t bought the ticket yet. I’m saving up the money for it.)

244
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:13,170
(What ticket do you want to buy?)

245
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:19,674
Are you serious?

246
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,408
(3,000 baht?)

247
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,521
(The most expensive ticket. 6,000 baht for two tickets?)

248
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,177
(Where do I get the money?)

249
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,650
(Khao, does your mom’s restaurant want to hire a new server?)

250
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:14,010
(No.)

251
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:24,850
(Do you know anyone who wants to hire a tutor? Please let me know.)

252
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,605
(Do you need money? Why are you suddenly asking about part-time jobs?)

253
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:36,450
(I’m saving up money to buy concert tickets.)

254
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:39,930
(Who are you going with?)

255
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:46,700
(Anyway, if you know of any part-time jobs, please let me know.)

256
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:55,965
You finally came to your senses.

257
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:00,857
Now, work hard on your practice and get your spot on the national team.

258
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:06,466
Where are you going?

259
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,465
I’m in the pool and complete my practice period.

260
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,768
Are you kidding me?

261
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,254
Coach, you told me to get in the pool and I did.

262
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,192
Oh!

263
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:45,143
Khao, what are you doing here?

264
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:47,143
You don’t go to school.

265
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:49,143
I went to your home but you weren’t there.

266
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:52,503
I thought you were studying hard by yourself.

267
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,019
But you came to spend time here again.

268
00:18:55,894 --> 00:18:58,140
I’m bored.

269
00:18:58,711 --> 00:18:59,346
Bored?

270
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:02,114
Everyone is working hard on their college portfolio.

271
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,306
How can you have time to feel bored?

272
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:23,500
Then let’s play until you are no longer bored.

273
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:55,454
Khao, wait for me.

274
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:58,619
You love this game, don’t you?

275
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:02,731
Now, I’m taking the lead.

276
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:11,106
Tao hasn’t chosen his college?

277
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,358
He’s so lucky that he’s an athlete.

278
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:17,866
He’s waiting for us to choose our colleges.

279
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:20,441
I get how he feels.

280
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:22,985
If I can choose, I want to go to the same college as my friends.

281
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,416
Som-O is acting strange.

282
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:29,416
She suddenly wants to go to a concert.

283
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:31,608
She tries to find a job to buy the ticket.

284
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:34,657
What?

285
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:39,077
Som-O wants to see a concert. So she tries to find a part-time job.

286
00:20:58,562 --> 00:20:59,240
Excuse me.

287
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:01,097
Are you hiring?

288
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:02,407
Wait a sec.

289
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:04,247
Are we hiring?

290
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:06,405
No, we are not hiring.

291
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,780
We are not hiring. Sorry.

292
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:11,527
Okay. Thank you.

293
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:23,007
Hello.

294
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:25,099
Do you want to take photos? Please come in.

295
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:27,367
No, I’m looking for a job.

296
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,140
Are you hiring?

297
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,428
We are not hiring at the moment.

298
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:33,139
Really?

299
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:35,059
Can’t you hire one more staff?

300
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,761
No, we are not hiring. I’m sorry.

301
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,848
Alright.

302
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:40,822
Thank you.

303
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,308
Really?

304
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:50,407
If I have to guess, I think she’s saving up money to buy the ticket for Chadjen too.

305
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:53,980
I think I’m going to help Som-O.

306
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,281
Two tickets.

307
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:57,921
That will cost several thousand baht.

308
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:02,007
You said you’re going to help Som-O.

309
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:03,219
How?

310
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:06,617
I’ll save up money to give her.

311
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,308
I need to pay her back.

312
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:11,025
She pitched in to help me buy the necktie for my dad.

313
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:16,360
I’ll help her too.

314
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:18,413
Really?

315
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:21,697
That’s great.

316
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,441
Can you keep it for me?

317
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,262
I don’t trust myself. I’m afraid that I will spend it all.

318
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:34,288
Take it.

319
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:39,026
(Khao trust me this much?)

320
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,425
(I’m touched.)

321
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,625
Please go back to practice.

322
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:57,300
Can you be a good example for other teammates?

323
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,148
If you want to wait for your friends’ decision, that’s fine.

324
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,274
Can you go practice like you used to?

325
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,463
You know that I’m doing everything for your future?

326
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:10,155
For me?

327
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,909
Or for yourself?

328
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:15,805
You wanted to compete in the Olympic Games.

329
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:18,628
Yes. I know.

330
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,419
But it’s also your dream.

331
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:24,114
My dream?

332
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,702
You may think that I’m forcing you to do these things.

333
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,909
But you are happy when you spend time in the pool.

334
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,216
You smile when you touch the wall,

335
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,072
when you receive the medals,

336
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:39,429
when your friends congratulate you.

337
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:44,402
If you didn’t enjoy it, you would have walked away a long time ago.

338
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:51,632
Swimming was all I had in the past.

339
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,902
Now, I have friends.

340
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:58,908
If you promise that you will let me spend time with my friends,

341
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:01,755
I promise that I will not disappoint you.

342
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:04,970
You know if you are on the national team,

343
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,567
you won’t have much time to spend with your friends.

344
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,207
That’s all I want.

345
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:15,706
I just want to be with them a bit longer.

346
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:20,014
If that’s what you want,

347
00:24:23,426 --> 00:24:24,120
I’ll let you do it.

348
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,005
But I have one condition.

349
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:29,352
You need to work harder than before.

350
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:30,758
You have to make it.

351
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:33,333
Sure, Dad.

352
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,700
I promise. I won’t disappoint you.

353
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:51,610
Go have your breakfast.

354
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,752
Goodbye.

355
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:08,838
What should we do?

356
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:14,714
It’s almost the day that we are going to meet Ms. Oh.

357
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:26,997
Hello, Ms. Oh.

358
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,648
This is Gewalin’s mom.

359
00:25:53,493 --> 00:25:54,562
What’s wrong, New?

360
00:25:56,957 --> 00:25:57,828
Nothing.

361
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:03,777
What happened to your mouth?

362
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:08,802
It’s nothing.

363
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,019
Are you going to tell me or not?

364
00:26:12,148 --> 00:26:13,022
If you don’t tell me,

365
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:17,408
I’ll tell Ms. Oh that you skipped school to play at the game arcade.

366
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:20,604
What are you going to do?

367
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:23,571
I…

368
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:26,121
What?

369
00:26:27,826 --> 00:26:29,801
Okay, I’ll tell you.

370
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:35,668
I…

371
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:41,072
Hurry up.

372
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:44,899
I met the friends who play games with me.

373
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:49,010
They often mug other kids.

374
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:52,571
So you got mugged?

375
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,822
They took everything including your money.

376
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:01,414
Why did you have Khao’s money?

377
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:09,407
I’ve been playing games with them for a long time.

378
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:12,518
They were the only friends I had.

379
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,780
They stole my money every once in a while.

380
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:17,780
The amount was not much.

381
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:19,968
Today, they seemed to need money.

382
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:22,934
Stop hanging out with them.

383
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,216
They are leeches, not friends.

384
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,668
Tao is right.

385
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,604
You have us. Don’t worry.

386
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:33,700
Are they still around here?

387
00:27:35,077 --> 00:27:36,690
Yes.

388
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:39,302
I just got mugged in front of the school.

389
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:53,205
Khao and New don’t come to school today?

390
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:56,266
I don’t know.

391
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:57,814
Right.

392
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,708
Normally, they would have arrived by now.

393
00:28:00,816 --> 00:28:01,588
Where are they?

394
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:04,108
Chadjen.

395
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,705
Are you going to see the concert this evening?

396
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,971
The tickets are sold out.

397
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:13,920
I won’t go.

398
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:16,514
It’s okay.

399
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,219
Do you want to go with me?

400
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:23,413
One of my friends may not be able to attend it.

401
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,540
It’s okay.

402
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,948
Okay, okay. Maybe next time.

403
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:32,948
I’ll ask you again next time, okay?

404
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:34,410
Bye.

405
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:39,068
Som.

406
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:40,112
Yes.

407
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:41,182
What’s wrong?

408
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:43,785
Nothing.

409
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:45,491
Nothing?

410
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:47,605
You are sighing dozens of times.

411
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,605
You can always tell me.

412
00:28:52,312 --> 00:28:55,168
I’m stressed about many things.

413
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:57,008
About school?

414
00:28:57,562 --> 00:29:00,899
If it’s about school, you can choose your own path.

415
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:02,558
Look at me.

416
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:04,903
I kept standing my ground until my dad gave in.

417
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:07,505
You can do it too.

418
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,210
I’m rooting for you.

419
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:20,158
(Ms. Gewalin Assarattana, Grade 12 Class 2, please go meet Ms. Oh in the faculty room.)

420
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:37,105
Give me more.

421
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,360
200 baht.

422
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,155
Let’s go play games together.

423
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:42,120
We can share the rest of the money then. We also a 500-baht banknote.

424
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:43,924
Then you pay for the games.

425
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,022
Hey, dirtbags.

426
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:51,130
It’s you, nerd.

427
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:53,690
Did you mug New?

428
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,788
Give it back right now.

429
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,139
I’m so scared.

430
00:29:58,226 --> 00:29:59,370
I won’t give it back.

431
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:02,004
Nerd gave it to me.

432
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,737
Am I right, nerd?

433
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:11,007
Damn it.

434
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,260
Give it back right now.

435
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:15,807
Hurry up.

436
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:20,500
Go line up.

437
00:30:21,105 --> 00:30:22,614
I already gave you the money.

438
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,820
What else do you want from us?

439
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,954
You need to pay the interest.

440
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,223
Just give it to her.

441
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:37,902
New, hit each of them on the head.

442
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:40,860
What?

443
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:44,709
Did you just tell that nerd to hit us?

444
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:47,072
That nerd?

445
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:51,702
Do you want me to use this?

446
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:01,262
Yes.

447
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:06,822
I’m sorry.

448
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:17,419
If you hit them like that, I’ll do it.

449
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:19,708
I’m sorry.

450
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Mark my words. If you mug New again, I’ll go after you.

451
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,025
Yes.

452
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:39,271
Let’s go, New.

453
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:40,500
Yes.

454
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:46,160
We want our daughter to choose what she wants to study.

455
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:48,468
She can’t make up her mind right now.

456
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:50,503
If we give her some time,

457
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,565
I’m sure she will figure out what she wants to study.

458
00:31:54,902 --> 00:31:55,746
Alright.

459
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:58,761
Do we still have time for it?

460
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:05,090
Yes, but some colleges calculate GPAX from only five semesters.

461
00:32:05,478 --> 00:32:09,008
So this is her last semester to get her grades up.

462
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:14,223
The criteria vary for each college.

463
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:17,075
We need to know what college she wants to attend.

464
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:20,970
Hello.

465
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:22,751
Hello. Gewalin, have a seat.

466
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:28,915
Did you decide what you want to study?

467
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,805
I’m thinking about it.

468
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:41,124
The minimum GPAX should be around 3.00 out of 4.00.

469
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,105
If she wants to have many options to choose from.

470
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:45,905
3.00!?

471
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,905
Is that possible?

472
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,082
Yes.

473
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:55,825
But she needs to get straight A's for all classes in the last two semesters.

474
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,414
If you think it’s possible, I’ll try my best.

475
00:33:00,085 --> 00:33:01,325
You can do it.

476
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:05,053
But you need to start by stopping falling asleep and paying attention in class.

477
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,020
I’ll help you.

478
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,477
She fell asleep in class?

479
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:14,616
The class hadn’t started yet, Dad.

480
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,192
I’m sorry, Som-O.

481
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:27,706
I was so busy with work that I didn’t have time for you.

482
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:32,724
I’m sorry that I didn’t take good care of you.

483
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:36,066
I get it.

484
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,862
I know you would understand us.

485
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:43,521
You understand how the world is.

486
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:48,125
From now on, if you want anything, you can tell me.

487
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,745
Anything?

488
00:33:52,045 --> 00:33:54,737
Yes, anything. I’ll give it to you.

489
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,808
Can you buy two concert tickets for me?

490
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:00,139
Concert tickets?

491
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:02,413
Who are you going with? When?

492
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:05,167
I’m going with Chadjen. The show starts at 7 pm today.

493
00:34:05,354 --> 00:34:06,705
You are going with Chadjen.

494
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,328
Today?

495
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,918
Are the tickets still available? Aren’t they sold out already?

496
00:34:12,331 --> 00:34:13,918
Wait a sec.

497
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:15,219
Let’s see.

498
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,853
I’ll buy them at the venue. My friend said they are available.

499
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:29,720
When I took your mom to a concert, I also bought tickets from a scalper.

500
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:33,007
What? You bought the tickets from a scalper?

501
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:38,197
The price was higher but I got to watch it with you.

502
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,272
Honey.

503
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:41,515
Yes.

504
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,859
We should go to watch a concert together again.

505
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:45,960
You are sweet.

506
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:47,299
Khao.

507
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,783
Where did you get the gun?

508
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:51,521
It’s a fake gun.

509
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:53,900
You scared me.

510
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:57,360
We will be punished tomorrow.

511
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:00,130
We need to take it because we did wrong.

512
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:01,822
I’m sorry.

513
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:06,312
Because I lost your money, you couldn’t help Som-O buy the tickets.

514
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,745
It’s okay.

515
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:12,509
I’ll make it up to you next time, Som.

516
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,179
You did well today when you hit them.

517
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:21,180
Next time, you cannot be soft and weak like this.

518
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,709
You can’t let them do this to you again. Do you hear me?

519
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:31,223
But I don’t know how to fight.

520
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,706
I’ll take you to work out with me.

521
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:40,263
So you will have the skills and your body will be fitter.

522
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:44,102
If you think it’s a good idea, I’m okay with it.

523
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:47,182
Can you say it like you mean it?

524
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:50,068
Yes, I’ll go.

525
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,937
Now, let’s go comfort Som for missing the concert.

526
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:01,405
Khao.

527
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,062
Can you put the gun away first?

528
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,200
You are scared of a fake gun?

529
00:36:12,697 --> 00:36:13,656
Wait for me.

530
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:25,041
I’m going to be late.

531
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,717
- I speeded up for you. - I am late.

532
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:30,915
Here, Tao.

533
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:32,819
Som.

534
00:36:33,395 --> 00:36:35,591
I thought you were going to ask me to go with you.

535
00:36:39,884 --> 00:36:40,645
Can I buy…

536
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:41,565
The tickets are sold out.

537
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,980
They are just sold out.

538
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,066
Are they completely sold out? Not a single one left?

539
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:46,758
I only need two tickets.

540
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,000
They are sold out. I’m sorry.

541
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,177
They are sold out.

542
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:52,229
Alright.

543
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:09,143
Can you take a picture for me?

544
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:14,392
Do you want to take a picture with me?

545
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,462
Are you looking for tickets?

546
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,462
I have the most expensive tickets.

547
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:23,518
How much for two tickets?

548
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:25,099
9,000 baht.

549
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,317
(He’s scalping the price. The original price is only 6,000 baht for two tickets.)

550
00:37:29,471 --> 00:37:30,608
(This is a fraud.)

551
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:31,977
7,000 baht.

552
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:32,777
8,000 baht.

553
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:33,611
7,500 baht.

554
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,226
Okay. 7,500 baht.

555
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:37,657
Two tickets?

556
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:38,373
Yes.

557
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,457
Here.

558
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:45,146
Thank you.

559
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:03,401
Hello.

560
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,459
Chad, did you get the tickets?

561
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,903
I’m bargaining.

562
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:09,817
Are you at the stadium?

563
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,340
I got the tickets.

564
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,334
Really?

565
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:17,208
Som-O, where are you? I’ll go meet you.

566
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:20,859
I’m near the ticketing booth and the big poster.

567
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:23,342
Do you see me? I’m waving.

568
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:24,751
Chad.

569
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:27,145
Wait a sec.

570
00:38:31,954 --> 00:38:32,613
Two tickets.

571
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:36,868
Where have you been?

572
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:38,662
Here.

573
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:42,537
The tickets are fake.

574
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,168
Huh? Really?

575
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:46,745
I paid over 7,000 baht for them.

576
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,312
Huh? The price is only 6,000 baht for two tickets.

577
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,165
The tickets are sold out so I bought them from a scalper.

578
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:58,028
I think you are scammed. Take them back.

579
00:38:58,355 --> 00:39:02,644
Can you check them again? I came all the way here. Can’t you let us in?

580
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,391
Please, please let us in.

581
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,391
If I let you in, I’ll be in trouble.

582
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,768
Anyone can tell your tickets are fake.

583
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,986
- I can’t let you in. - But I really want to watch the concert.

584
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,783
Please let us in. We’ll stand over there.

585
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:13,557
Please, I’m begging.

586
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,509
I can’t let you in.

587
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:15,094
Som-O.

588
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:17,435
Where are we going? We came all the way here.

589
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:18,282
No.

590
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:19,431
- Please. - Som.

591
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:20,711
Please, I like him.

592
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:26,231
Why are you stopping me? We came all the way here.

593
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:26,760
Som.

594
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:29,469
I want to watch it.

595
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:36,912
Why are we sitting here?

596
00:39:42,665 --> 00:39:44,108
I’m going to rip them into pieces.

597
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,152
Som.

598
00:39:46,422 --> 00:39:48,422
Why are you stopping me? They are useless.

599
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:49,807
I’ll rip them.

600
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:51,016
Som.

601
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:05,906
Can I keep them?

602
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:09,420
Yes.

603
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:18,542
Let’s go home.

604
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,207
We can’t hear much anyway even if we sit here.

605
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:27,140
Sit down.

606
00:40:28,311 --> 00:40:29,020
What?

607
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,509
Keep it for so long

608
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:40,225
This secret hidden deep inside

609
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,007
And there’s no day or night

610
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:52,762
I’d let you know the truth I’m denying

611
00:40:53,657 --> 00:40:56,272
That I love you so much

612
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:59,303
That I miss you, it’s true

613
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:05,514
And every time you stand so close

614
00:41:06,158 --> 00:41:09,223
I wish you knew

615
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:13,354
That every corner of my heart

616
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,195
Belongs only to you

617
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:24,490
Oh baby it’s you, baby it’s you

618
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,786
Whispering I love you in my mind

619
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,588
But I’m not ready to say this line

620
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:37,121
Baby it’s you, my whole world is you

621
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:39,373
Secretly loving you

622
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:44,343
But I don’t know how to say

623
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:50,288
It’s better to just keep it this way

624
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:53,062
I don’t want our story

625
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:59,125
To change just because of words I say

626
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:07,860
I have to hold it back, or be the one to pay

627
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:15,022
Oh baby it’s you, baby it’s you

628
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:19,490
Whispering I love you in my mind

629
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:22,125
But I’m not ready to say this line

630
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:27,402
Baby it’s you, my whole world is you

631
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,013
Secretly loving you

632
00:42:30,379 --> 00:42:35,250
But I don’t know how to say

633
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:43,453
It’s better to just keep it this way
( Oh baby it’s you, baby it’s you )

634
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,677
Whispering I love you in my mind

635
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:50,522
But I’m not ready to say this line

636
00:42:50,545 --> 00:42:55,903
Baby it’s you, my whole world is you

637
00:42:56,444 --> 00:42:58,447
Secretly loving you

638
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:03,897
But I don’t know how to say

639
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,422
Even though my heart knows

640
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:09,217
How was the concert last night? Did you enjoy it?

641
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:14,902
Excuse me.

642
00:43:17,774 --> 00:43:19,854
We can use it in our paper.

643
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,306
Chad, why don’t you take a picture of it?

644
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,503
Where? Let me see it too.

645
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:24,680
Do you see Som-O?

646
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:25,497
I’m not sure.

647
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:26,411
Chad.

648
00:43:28,456 --> 00:43:31,207
Boys these days grow up fast.

649
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:32,702
They are impulsive and handsy.

650
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:34,585
You need to be careful.

651
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:35,779
What are you talking about?

652
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:37,674
Som-O, are you dressed as a slave?

653
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:38,543
Can you take a photo for us?

654
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:43,263
Khao, I knew you would come.

655
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:44,536
Hello, Mhog.

656
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:46,536
I’ll wipe it off.

657
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:53,705
New.

658
00:43:54,437 --> 00:43:54,977
New.

659
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:58,308
When will my son wake up?

660
00:43:59,394 --> 00:44:01,459
I can’t tell.

661
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,557
We need to see his brain scan result first.
