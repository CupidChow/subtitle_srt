1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,909
Today is our last day at school.

2
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:05,420
This may be our last chance to go to the same school.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,211
I told her that she could attend another school.

4
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:10,438
It’s alright if she attends an open admission college.

5
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:12,057
But she doesn’t listen to me.

6
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,257
You can choose another school.

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,143
Don’t worry.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,693
I’ll help you with your study.

9
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:20,508
You said you’ll help me. Don’t forget it.

10
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:21,893
Yes.

11
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:23,973
Promise me.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

13
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,466
Wow.

14
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,771
Do you have to dress up so neat and proper on your first day?

15
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:52,971
But on a closer look, it suits you.

16
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,531
You look so mature.

17
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:58,774
I can’t believe you’re all grown up now.

18
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:02,377
Why are you up so early?

19
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:06,694
No reason.

20
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:07,847
What?

21
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:10,379
Can’t I get up early to see my friend off to college?

22
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:16,825
Wait. Wait, Chad.

23
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:20,139
What about…

24
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:21,019
Helping you study?

25
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,822
I’ll get to that in a bit.

26
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:26,405
I have to sort things out about the dorm for a few days.

27
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:27,299
Okay?

28
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:29,674
Yeah.

29
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:31,482
Fine.

30
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:34,752
Bye.

31
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:53,933
But who’d help me study now?

32
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,250
Don’t you have to go to class?

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,617
It’s your first day of college, right?

34
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:08,727
They let me take the time off to focus on getting into the national team.

35
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,102
Guess I don’t have to go to class like everyone, per usual.

36
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,037
But it’s a good thing I’ve only got practice.

37
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,004
Now I can help you with your study.

38
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:19,829
Yeah.

39
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:28,311
But I think we should switch up and focus on studying for GAT?

40
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,791
I’m better at that.

41
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:32,608
Sure.

42
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,549
We’ve been stuck on this one question for two hours now anyway.

43
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:37,130
Let’s switch things up.

44
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:38,939
Let’s do it.

45
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:39,714
Yeah.

46
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:41,714
Let’s start with this.

47
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,904
(I might not be as bright as Chadjen.)

48
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:47,914
(But as long as I get to be around Som-O,)

49
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,604
(I’m sure I can help her with something.)

50
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:52,762
Let’s do it.

51
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:53,696
Let’s!

52
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,753
What does… this checkmark mean?

53
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,105
I think…

54
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,108
It means…

55
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:16,185
Why can’t we be tested on swimming instead?

56
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,500
I’d teach you to get the perfect score for that.

57
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:20,868
Yeah, I’d be top of the class.

58
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:26,211
But this is really hard, right?

59
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:27,860
Who’d even be able to do it?

60
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:28,684
True that.

61
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:36,085
Let’s say goodbye here.

62
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,364
You should hurry to class before you’re late.

63
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:38,828
Of course.

64
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:41,106
Here’s your meds.

65
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:43,810
I labelled each one pretty clearly.

66
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,810
Careful with them and make sure you take them on time.

67
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,672
See you at lunch.

68
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:52,605
Yes, of course, Khao.

69
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:54,137
That sounds like sarcasm.

70
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:55,367
It wasn’t.

71
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:56,906
I wouldn’t dream of it.

72
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:59,142
Go. Go to class.

73
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:00,054
Don’t be late.

74
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:03,142
And make sure you walk carefully. Don’t trip and fall, alright?

75
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:04,048
Yes, ma’am.

76
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,002
That’s nice.

77
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:14,814
You meant that?

78
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:17,616
Chadjen!

79
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:19,355
You really got into this school!

80
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,020
Congrats.

81
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,220
I knew you would get into this school.

82
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:27,651
Congratulations.

83
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,515
Listen up, first-year medical students.

84
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,290
(Faculty of Medicine)

85
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,687
Line up.
(Faculty of Medicine)

86
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:35,530
(Faculty of Medicine)

87
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,207
I’m home.

88
00:05:46,274 --> 00:05:47,165
She’s back.

89
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:52,253
How was it, dear?

90
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:54,642
I’m so tired.

91
00:05:58,146 --> 00:06:01,900
I’ve never used my brain so much in my life.

92
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,645
I’m both hungry and sleepy.

93
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,702
I don’t even know what to do first.

94
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:12,376
What is it, Mom?

95
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,180
Your Dad has something to tell you.

96
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,010
What?

97
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,105
Well…

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:28,608
Your mother and I think you need Plan B, C, and probably D in just case.

99
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:29,832
In case of what?

100
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,097
Well, in case of this and that…

101
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:36,056
In case you don’t get into the same school as Chadjen.

102
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,909
Oh, that.

103
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,005
I’m pretty confident with this exam, though.

104
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,668
But looking for a backup school wouldn’t be a bad idea, right?

105
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,272
There are so many other schools with the faculty you want to get in.

106
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:47,940
Look.

107
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,755
If you really want to study art, how about abroad?

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,537
Well, I’m thinking just in case.

109
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:02,254
No way. That’s too expensive. I’m staying here.

110
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,859
I have a friend in the US.

111
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:05,607
Should we call him?

112
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,099
Maybe he can help us.

113
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:09,402
I’m not sure.

114
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:13,337
I think we should call my relatives in Canada first.

115
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:15,642
Oh? Canada doesn’t sound bad.

116
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:16,875
- Right? - Hold on, hold on.

117
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,761
What’s with you guys?

118
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,460
Tell me what’s wrong.

119
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:25,703
I don’t want to see you disappointed if you miss your chance again.

120
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:29,208
I don’t want to see you put so much pressure on yourself.

121
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:33,979
I know where you’re coming from.

122
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:35,600
But let me try this one more time.

123
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,364
Whatever it turns out to be, I’ll accept it.

124
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:41,099
Believe in me.

125
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,263
I’ll do it.

126
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,349
Alright. Let’s do it.

127
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:50,368
If you’re confident, I’ll support you.

128
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:51,945
Now we’re talking!

129
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:54,228
Let’s do it.

130
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,219
Together.

131
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,099
I’m starving, Mom.

132
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:02,807
Here.

133
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:04,094
Eat.

134
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,820
What’s wrong, Som?

135
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:25,204
Now that you have new friends…

136
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,102
Are you going to leave me?

137
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:32,460
You silly.

138
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:35,302
Friends aren’t trash I can just throw away, you know?

139
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:42,097
Listen.

140
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:44,905
You’re my best friend.

141
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,425
I have never been so close to anyone like you.

142
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:49,808
I won’t ever leave you.

143
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:56,917
What are you doing?

144
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,407
Taking in the smell of friendship.

145
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,013
It’s so sweet.

146
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:05,601
Don’t even think I’ll ever abandon you because that day will never come.

147
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:07,762
You promised, alright?

148
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,297
If you throw me away, I’m exposing all of your deepest secrets.

149
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:17,205
If you leave me, I’ll tell the whole world your secrets as well.

150
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,142
The world?

151
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:25,709
Oh… Where is New?

152
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:26,811
Why isn’t he with you?

153
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:28,706
You’re typically inseparable.

154
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,204
I don’t know.

155
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,614
Just forget him.

156
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,214
New.

157
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:37,465
New.

158
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:41,217
Why don’t I meet you guys in class later?

159
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:42,469
Alright. We’ll be there.

160
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,168
Right.

161
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,922
Khao.

162
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:47,917
Your medicines.

163
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:49,364
I’ve labelled it, like usual.

164
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:51,114
Take them on time.

165
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,257
Right. Thank you.

166
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:58,100
But you… don’t have to show up here, you know?

167
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:06,503
Do I embarrass you?

168
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,641
Oh, it’s…

169
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:12,207
You could have just told me I’m too much trouble for you.

170
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:15,322
Khao, it’s not like that.

171
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:17,195
Khao.

172
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:20,522
And here I was worried about him.

173
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:23,851
He’s sick. He needs someone to look out for him, right?

174
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,251
Yeah.

175
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:27,534
But to this point?

176
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,173
Yeah, just forget it.

177
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:35,337
What about you and Chadjen, though?

178
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:37,906
What? Me?

179
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:42,865
I mean, you said you asked him to tutor you, right?

180
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:43,971
How has it been?

181
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,364
Oh…

182
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:52,171
He bailed on me.

183
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,210
Good thing Tao is helping me out instead.

184
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:56,816
What? Tao is tutoring you?

185
00:10:58,675 --> 00:10:59,810
This won’t do, Som.

186
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,411
I think you’re better off taking an art class.

187
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,577
That might be better.

188
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,967
You need to have an artist’s emotion to study art.

189
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,466
Emotion, you said?

190
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:17,171
Got it?

191
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:19,610
Yeah.

192
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,050
(Cashier)

193
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:30,056
…if there’s more, you need to talk to the patient before deciding.

194
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:31,268
Alright.

195
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,047
Then I’ll see if I can—

196
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,899
Oh, Chad.

197
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,171
Oh, New?

198
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,608
Are you here for your prescription?

199
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,758
Where’s Khao?

200
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,309
Do you have a moment?

201
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:46,905
Yeah.

202
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:51,518
The thing is…

203
00:11:52,602 --> 00:11:54,362
There’s been a misunderstanding.

204
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:57,808
Khao thought I was embarrassed by her when she came to give me my medicines.

205
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,607
She hasn’t been replying to my texts after that.

206
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,205
She doesn’t pick up her phone.

207
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:05,088
She ignores me when I go to see her.

208
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:09,703
What do you think I should do?

209
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,211
I don’t know.

210
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,111
That’s all you have to say?

211
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:18,525
But…

212
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,909
I know Khao really worries about you.

213
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:26,614
When you were in the hospital in our senior year,

214
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,328
she went to see you every day.

215
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:34,740
Even during finals week, she was studying right next to you.

216
00:12:36,225 --> 00:12:38,005
I don’t think the chair was all that comfy to sit on for that long.

217
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:40,911
She could have just studied at home like the rest of us.

218
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:45,711
Sometimes she stayed up all night.

219
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:59,842
She’s really worried about me and I went ahead and made her feel bad.

220
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,266
I’m really an idiot.

221
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,946
I’ll go and apologize to her.

222
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:15,161
Thank you.

223
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:20,908
Oh, how are things with you and Som-O?

224
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,971
I haven’t seen her in a while.

225
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:24,712
Oh?

226
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:29,762
I heard from Khao that you were going to help Som-O study.

227
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:32,948
I thought you would tutor her like you used to do.

228
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:39,614
But I guess the first year at medical school must be really busy.

229
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,908
Oh, they even have snacks?

230
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,515
The teacher said we need more fruit.

231
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:35,102
Alright. I’ll arrange something.

232
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:44,557
Here?

233
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:45,291
Hi.

234
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:46,706
Hey.

235
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:49,312
Let’s put it here.

236
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:51,671
That’s nice.

237
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,712
We’re supposed to draw that.

238
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:55,362
Let’s sit here.

239
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:01,767
Oh, they’re here.

240
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:03,358
Hi.

241
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:05,077
Hey.

242
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:05,920
How are you?

243
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,370
You look cute today.

244
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:30,017
Don’t think art is easy.

245
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,214
Art is life.

246
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:34,417
Life is art.

247
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:40,103
Without art in your life, you won’t ever understand art.

248
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:44,804
Living an artful life… what is that?

249
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:45,945
Oh…

250
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:54,065
Do you think these fruits are living an artful life?

251
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:56,011
I don’t know.

252
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,174
Look.

253
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:01,007
Fruits are colorful.

254
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:03,059
Colors are art.

255
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:05,059
Art is nature.

256
00:16:07,162 --> 00:16:08,057
What the hell?

257
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,189
I don’t get it.

258
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,007
I saw you take a bite of this apple.

259
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,296
Didn’t you?

260
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:19,182
Yes.

261
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:26,404
That means you have art inside of you.

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,819
Be aware of that.

263
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:32,164
What’s your name?

264
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:34,044
Som-O.

265
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:36,539
Som-O.

266
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:37,614
That’s a fruit.

267
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:39,045
You’re artful. You ate an apple.

268
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,376
It suits you.

269
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:44,077
That means you really are full of art from the very beginning.

270
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:45,017
Well done.

271
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:46,810
Alright, guys.

272
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:50,231
Show me the art you have inside you.

273
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:51,962
Don’t just sit there. Draw it.

274
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:53,921
Do it.

275
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:56,063
Go for it.

276
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:13,287
Are you alright, sir?

277
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,074
Look at it.

278
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,002
Look at what?

279
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:21,918
You didn’t just make art.

280
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,634
You put life into it, too.

281
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,484
You have it in you.

282
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:30,217
Not enough, though.

283
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,210
Sorry?

284
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:34,062
I mean, you need practice.

285
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:35,274
Right?

286
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,063
Everything is all about practice.

287
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,576
When you do it often enough, you’ll get good at it.

288
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,106
Do your best, Watermelon.

289
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:45,613
My name is Som-O.

290
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:46,280
Is it?

291
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:47,616
It’s all fruit to me so it’s fine.

292
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:49,343
Som-O, Watermelon, whatever.

293
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:50,663
Thank you, sir.

294
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:51,257
Sure.

295
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,800
I’ll do my best.

296
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:53,814
Good.

297
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,019
- Do your best. - Truly thank you.

298
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:56,280
I will.

299
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:57,583
Do your best, Watermelon.

300
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,407
It’s Som-O!

301
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:01,783
Thank you.

302
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:08,102
Well?

303
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:10,410
You enjoy the watermelon shake I got you?

304
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:12,874
You know me so well.

305
00:18:19,903 --> 00:18:21,306
How have you been, Tao?

306
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:23,072
Do you have to practice a lot these days?

307
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:24,706
These days?

308
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:28,205
The practice is getting harder and harder, yeah.

309
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:30,807
I have to practice with the university coach soon.

310
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,955
They’re already running trials for the national team.

311
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:37,311
Look.

312
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:41,482
If I win a gold medal, trade your banner with my gold.

313
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,605
Is that a good idea?

314
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:46,736
Yeah.

315
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:48,905
Get some banners ready for me, alright?

316
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:52,515
How was the art class today, though?

317
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:54,902
The teacher liked my drawing.

318
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:56,004
Really?

319
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:58,118
Right from the first class?

320
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:07,419
What’s that?

321
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,721
A heart.

322
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:10,804
What?

323
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:12,370
It’s a heart.

324
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,678
Do you even understand drawing it like that?

325
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:16,392
Give it to me.

326
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,001
It just needs a little adjustment.

327
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:23,512
Draw the blood vessels a little longer.

328
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,220
That makes it easier to understand, right?

329
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:38,362
Here.

330
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:44,699
Very pretty.

331
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,899
You mean me?

332
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:53,023
What?

333
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:54,611
Which one is prettier?

334
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:01,361
- What?
- I need to study.

335
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:07,514
Yes.

336
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,936
He said I didn’t just make art, but I made life!

337
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:17,825
That’s nice.

338
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,705
If you studied as hard as you chit-chat,

339
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,419
you would have gotten into university.

340
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:36,983
I really didn’t have to worry about you.

341
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:41,663
Chad, where are you going?

342
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:43,478
What’s his problem?

343
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:46,182
I asked him to come, you know?

344
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:49,512
You asked him to come?

345
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,499
Yeah.

346
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,499
I thought it would be better with more people tutoring you.

347
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:17,620
Wait, wait.

348
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:18,817
Sit down. Sit down.

349
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:20,299
What is it, Dad?

350
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:21,001
Just sit down.

351
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:24,620
Tao.

352
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:25,871
Yes?

353
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:29,339
You got into the national team!

354
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:31,706
For real?

355
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,915
Yeah, for real!

356
00:21:33,268 --> 00:21:34,362
You’re not joking, are you?

357
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,425
I’m not. You’re in!

358
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:37,820
Well done, kid.

359
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:49,777
I’m really proud of you.

360
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,502
Good job.

361
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,574
Enough of that.

362
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,431
Hurry up and do what you want to do for now.

363
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,715
You’ll have to practice hard soon.

364
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,109
Right.

365
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:13,970
Congratulations, Mr. National Team Athlete.

366
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:20,868
Thank you, Mr. National Team Coach.

367
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:29,579
I’m finally in the national team!

368
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,106
What are you doing here?

369
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:52,160
I need to talk to you.

370
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,114
About what?

371
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:55,297
About Som.

372
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:03,007
I want you to help Som-O study.

373
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:07,613
But you’re already doing it.

374
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:11,611
I won’t be able to after this.

375
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,521
And actually…

376
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:22,315
The person who was supposed to tutor her was you, not me.

377
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:26,007
She really wants to get into our university, you know?

378
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:28,761
She needs an amazing teacher for that.

379
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,420
You were there when she didn’t get in.

380
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:35,616
She was really disappointed.

381
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:41,980
Do you like Som-O?

382
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:50,463
Yes.

383
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,140
I like her.

384
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,416
Did you understand that class at all?

385
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:17,665
A little.

386
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,300
I think the next class will probably clear things up.

387
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:25,371
Chad, eleven o’clock.

388
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,746
Don’t make it obvious.

389
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:29,204
I said don’t make it obvious, dude!

390
00:24:30,118 --> 00:24:31,204
You spooked them now.

391
00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:32,810
They’re walking toward us.

392
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:34,810
Excuse me.

393
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:38,038
Are you guys medical students?

394
00:24:38,964 --> 00:24:39,625
Yes.

395
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:43,210
I took the exam, too, but didn’t get in.

396
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:45,709
You mind if I ask for your contact so I can ask for some tips later?

397
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:48,157
Give it to her.

398
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:51,917
I’m not a tutor.

399
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:55,140
Ugh, you think you can be a jerk just ’cause you’re handsome or what?

400
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:57,731
Chad, what the hell?

401
00:24:58,128 --> 00:24:59,274
Wait.

402
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:00,265
Hey, wait up.

403
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:01,574
Stay away, old man.

404
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:04,493
“Old man”?

405
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,308
What the hell was that, man?

406
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,425
You scared her away.

407
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:13,471
She was right in your hand, bro.

408
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:19,109
I have to go.

409
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:20,327
Hey, hey.

410
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:21,712
Wait.

411
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:23,820
My friend left me.

412
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:25,371
And a girl called me an old man.

413
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:34,942
Hello?

414
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:36,008
What’s up?

415
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:37,666
What are you doing?

416
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:39,708
I’m walking.

417
00:25:42,438 --> 00:25:43,893
Uhh…

418
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:45,337
What?

419
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:47,066
I…

420
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:51,777
Nothing.

421
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:55,109
Well, let’s talk later.

422
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:57,011
I’m going home to study some more.

423
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:03,419
She hung up on me?

424
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:33,514
Tao.

425
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:34,161
Yes?

426
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:34,896
Someone’s here to see you.

427
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:38,312
Hey, Som.

428
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:46,614
Coach…

429
00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:51,660
Do you remember that game we played on New Year's Day?

430
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,918
Yeah.

431
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:55,860
I wrote your name.

432
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,106
The first person I wanted to see on New Year’s Day was you.

433
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:05,263
Som.

434
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:13,112
I don’t have much time.

435
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,545
I’m not very bright, either.

436
00:27:16,371 --> 00:27:17,708
I hardly even go to class.

437
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:24,706
But I wanted to be around you so I volunteered to tutor you.

438
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:29,918
I just wanted to tell you this.

439
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:32,014
I don’t want anything.

440
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:39,302
I just got into the national team.

441
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:42,114
My first tournament will be the SEA Games.

442
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,813
If I win that, I’ll be going to the Asian Games.

443
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,112
Then the Olympics.

444
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:50,711
If I can do it, that is.

445
00:27:53,765 --> 00:27:57,771
But that means I won’t see you as often as I would like from now on.

446
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:05,139
Just come by if you’re tired of practice.

447
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:07,139
I won’t run anywhere anyway.

448
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:08,434
Won’t you?

449
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:09,448
Yeah.

450
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,562
Good.

451
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:15,811
You have to let me know if someone hurts you, alright?

452
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:18,460
What? Are you going to kick their butt for me?

453
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,090
Good.

454
00:28:20,238 --> 00:28:21,514
You’ll be the first to know.

455
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:25,122
Som.

456
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:29,942
But… why are you here to see me?

457
00:28:31,183 --> 00:28:32,613
I need a favor.

458
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:36,013
I…

459
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:38,739
I want to take you somewhere.

460
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:43,965
(Oh, crap, my heart…)

461
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:45,844
Where?

462
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,937
Come on, Tao.

463
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,306
Everyone’s waiting.

464
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,122
Congratulations!

465
00:29:05,297 --> 00:29:05,939
Som…

466
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,942
Is this the favor you need?

467
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:09,709
Yep.

468
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:12,360
Thanks, guys.

469
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:25,370
Sit here, Tao.

470
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:27,469
Right, nerd.

471
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:31,417
I just wanted us to meet up, but since Tao is on the national team now…

472
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,782
There is a cause to…

473
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:36,942
Celebrate!

474
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:41,888
Come on.

475
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,440
To Tao, the rising star of our national team.

476
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,440
Cheers!

477
00:29:50,543 --> 00:29:53,050
Cheers!

478
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,105
It’s so fizzy.

479
00:30:06,078 --> 00:30:07,371
Who wants to go first?

480
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:08,645
Nerd does.

481
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:09,762
No, I don’t.

482
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:10,771
I volunteer.

483
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,536
No.

484
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:15,308
You sure this is a good idea?

485
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:16,768
Why not?

486
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:18,404
Som, just sing.

487
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,607
I look forward to it.

488
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,191
Alright. I’ll sing for you all.

489
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,066
Well?

490
00:30:59,743 --> 00:31:01,066
You wanted to hear her sing, didn’t you?

491
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:03,902
She would make a perfect vocal in a girl group…

492
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:06,367
if it wasn’t for the part where she doesn’t listen to the music at all.

493
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,410
She really doesn’t.

494
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,635
- It’s finally over! - Good job, Som!

495
00:31:28,694 --> 00:31:29,377
Really?

496
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,174
So good.

497
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,657
Let’s take a break.

498
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:43,217
Khao.

499
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,650
I won’t be an idiot like that again.

500
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:52,299
Will you please talk to me?

501
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:13,946
What are you doing?

502
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:17,419
I’m trying to make up.

503
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:20,819
Please accept it.

504
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:27,820
You know why I did that, right?

505
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:29,616
Yes.

506
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:32,342
Because you’re really worried about me.

507
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:35,139
I get it now.

508
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,401
If you get it, then make good on your words.

509
00:32:44,748 --> 00:32:45,404
Yes.

510
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,274
I won’t do it again.

511
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:52,665
Are we…

512
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:55,851
Are we good now?

513
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:57,570
Yeah.

514
00:32:58,844 --> 00:32:59,570
Really?

515
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,134
Really?

516
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:04,825
Sorry.

517
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:07,718
You guys made up now?

518
00:33:10,102 --> 00:33:10,912
Congrats.

519
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:12,308
Thank you.

520
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:18,223
Hey, guys.

521
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:21,457
Don’t we have another surprise for Tao?

522
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:23,448
- Right! - That’s right.

523
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,496
Sit here.

524
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:26,007
Sit down.

525
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:26,677
There’s more?

526
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:27,274
Yes.

527
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,848
Hurry up and sit down.

528
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:31,306
What’s going on?

529
00:33:31,817 --> 00:33:33,888
Please don’t sing Auld Lang Syne.

530
00:33:33,902 --> 00:33:35,056
I don’t want to hear it.

531
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:36,211
No!

532
00:33:36,896 --> 00:33:37,736
What, then?

533
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:44,576
I’ve seen how much effort you put into your sport.

534
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:48,303
This isn’t a reward for the great only,

535
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:52,979
but it’s also a reward for the people who are determined and diligent.

536
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:55,536
You deserve it more than anyone.

537
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:57,862
Thanks, Khao.

538
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:01,835
My turn?

539
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:08,419
I remember you telling me when some guys extorted my money

540
00:34:08,762 --> 00:34:11,536
that those people aren’t my friends.

541
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:14,734
Because my friends are all here.

542
00:34:15,032 --> 00:34:17,146
Oh, that was touching, nerd.

543
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:18,288
Thank you.

544
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:22,054
Your turn, Chadjen.

545
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,902
Take it.

546
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:34,927
Congratulations.

547
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:38,742
That’s it?

548
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:40,315
Oh?

549
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,536
I think that’s the best he can do.

550
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:46,131
I get it.

551
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:47,543
Thanks, Chad.

552
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,737
Your turn, Som.

553
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,131
Right.

554
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,271
I already said something.

555
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:57,653
When?

556
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:00,053
Did you talk to him one-on-one?

557
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:02,540
That’s not fair.

558
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,094
Why don’t we toast one more time?

559
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:08,699
Pick up your glasses, guys.

560
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:14,900
To Tao the Shark, our very own national team athlete!

561
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:23,400
To celebrate my win…

562
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:24,060
Yes?

563
00:35:24,085 --> 00:35:25,896
I want to hear you sing, nerd.

564
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:28,041
Me, too!

565
00:35:28,171 --> 00:35:28,795
Don’t you?

566
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,020
What? What’s with your heart?

567
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,118
New! New! New!

568
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:34,336
New! New! New!

569
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:35,485
New! New! New!

570
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:36,902
New! New! New!

571
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:37,974
Quickly.

572
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,284
Which song should he sing?

573
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,130
Here. I’m typing.

574
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,760
B-U-Z-Z-K-I-L-L.

575
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:48,008
Hey, good one.

576
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:49,220
I like that song.

577
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,551
Sing it for me, nerd.

578
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,506
Then why don’t you do it?

579
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:52,863
I don’t know the lyrics.

580
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:54,408
Hurry up.

581
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,268
- Do it. - Sing! Sing! Sing!

582
00:35:58,204 --> 00:35:59,231
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

583
00:35:59,245 --> 00:36:00,217
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

584
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:00,991
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

585
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:04,158
One, two, three, go!

586
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,453
Khao.

587
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:16,531
I…

588
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:21,709
If I don’t tell you now,

589
00:36:22,508 --> 00:36:24,404
I don’t know if I’ll get the chance again.

590
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:29,373
But I can’t just let time go by like this anymore.

591
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,317
I like you, Khao.

592
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,028
No…

593
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:49,312
I love you, Khao.

594
00:36:51,714 --> 00:36:53,213
I love you very much.

595
00:37:10,957 --> 00:37:12,760
Are you asking me out?

596
00:37:22,192 --> 00:37:22,939
Hey, what’s wrong?

597
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:27,530
What?

598
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:30,571
You’re taking care of my heart.

599
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:32,808
I have nothing to worry about.

600
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:36,524
Oh, you.

601
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:39,111
You’ll let me take care of you, then?

602
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:52,548
Shall we go?

603
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:57,165
What about Som and Chad?

604
00:37:57,722 --> 00:37:58,974
I bet they left.

605
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,022
Tao?

606
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:03,648
Probably went to pay.

607
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,757
What about New? Where is he?

608
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,008
I’m right by your side.

609
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:10,333
I see.

610
00:38:51,577 --> 00:38:52,474
I’m so sleepy.

611
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:55,951
Khao and New already left.

612
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:58,140
Just let me sleep.

613
00:39:04,062 --> 00:39:04,665
Som.

614
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:08,413
Leave me be.

615
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:28,263
Are we home yet?

616
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:29,914
Almost.

617
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:39,659
We’re here.

618
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,613
We are?

619
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:46,899
You alright?

620
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:47,820
Of course.

621
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:48,761
I am—

622
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:49,514
Watch out!

623
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:06,065
Why are you so mean?

624
00:41:13,586 --> 00:41:15,976
You really won’t help me study, huh?

625
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:30,488
Kept it so long

626
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:36,005
This secret hidden deep inside

627
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:42,822
And there’s no day or night

628
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:48,496
I’d let you know the truth I’m denying

629
00:41:49,435 --> 00:41:52,029
That I love you so much

630
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:55,102
That I miss you, it’s true

631
00:41:56,745 --> 00:42:01,251
And every time you stand so close

632
00:42:01,946 --> 00:42:04,862
I wish you knew

633
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:09,137
That every corner of my heart

634
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:13,946
Belongs only to you

635
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:20,262
Oh baby it’s you, baby it’s you

636
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,789
Whispering I love you in my mind

637
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:27,823
You’ll be away from home now.

638
00:42:28,056 --> 00:42:32,022
If you have a boyfriend, don’t sleep with him.

639
00:42:33,232 --> 00:42:34,828
Hello.

640
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:35,823
My name is Khao.

641
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,614
I’m the dorm manager.

642
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:39,748
Outsiders are not allowed at all cost.

643
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:42,001
Do you understand, Som-O?

644
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:43,555
Are you really getting that surgery?

645
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:45,111
I’m really scared.

646
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:47,299
I think I won’t tell Khao.

647
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:49,712
“I’ve always had a crush on you, Khao.”

648
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:51,336
“Can I have your number?”

649
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:55,179
Chad, your friend is cute.

650
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:58,244
She’s an underclassman of mine.

651
00:42:58,545 --> 00:42:59,515
She’s been a fan of yours.

652
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:00,672
Talk to her.

653
00:43:01,022 --> 00:43:03,376
What? Another girl who likes Chad?

654
00:43:03,888 --> 00:43:06,345
Khao, you’re beautiful and cool.

655
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:08,136
Will you marry me?

656
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:12,512
Don’t ever joke about that.

657
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,816
I told you guys to hurry up.

658
00:43:14,832 --> 00:43:16,016
You’re late.

659
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,321
Hey, what’s your problem?

660
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:19,140
I don’t have one.

661
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:20,968
Stop mumbling!
