1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,940
Will you marry me?

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,539
How could you joke about a proposal?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,023
I’ll get the surgery while Khao is still mad at me.

4
00:00:06,152 --> 00:00:07,337
What if you die?

5
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:09,137
You won’t get to say goodbye to Khao.

6
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:10,414
Can you help me with drawing?

7
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:14,379
Didn’t you tell me earlier that you didn’t need my help?

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,765
If you have anything I can help, let me know.

9
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,597
Didn’t you say that?

10
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:23,068
This is for you.

11
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,204
How is it? Does it look good?

12
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,853
(This kind of moment, it happens again.)

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

14
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:45,330
You didn’t get enough sleep?

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,108
You have bags under your eyes.

16
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:51,970
How ungrateful of you!

17
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:55,117
I stayed up drawing for you all night and you have the nerve to ask about my eyebags?

18
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:57,909
You need me to get on my knees with gratitude or what?

19
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:01,106
Hey, where are you taking my notebook?

20
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:03,349
What? You gave it to me, didn’t you?

21
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,111
I…

22
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:14,417
Som. Som.

23
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:18,425
Where have you been?

24
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,825
I’ve been calling you and you didn’t pick up the phone.

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,768
Oh, Im, this is Chadjen.

26
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:26,613
Chad, this is Im, a friend of mine.

27
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,500
I see.

28
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:34,709
Chadjen.

29
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:36,250
Som-O.

30
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:41,586
And is Chadjen your… what now?

31
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:42,512
Friend.

32
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:44,534
He’s a friend.

33
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:46,416
We’re friends…

34
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:48,459
What do you study, Chad?

35
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:50,308
Medicine.

36
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:52,979
Chad is actually a second year.

37
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,980
Oh, hello, Chadjen.

38
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,342
Sorry I called you by your nickname just now.

39
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:01,562
It’s no big deal.

40
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:03,106
Som.

41
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:05,339
Your…your name tag.

42
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:08,788
The tag! The tag…

43
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:11,010
I think I forgot to bring it.

44
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:14,817
No.

45
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:18,145
If you don’t have it, the upperclassmen are going to go ballistic.

46
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:20,165
Let’s go back and grab it.

47
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:21,222
No way!

48
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:22,094
I’m not going back.

49
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:24,219
It’s just a name tag.

50
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:27,801
Are you taking me back to the hazing?

51
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:29,857
Of course.

52
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:34,103
If you don’t show up, they’re going to punish the rest of us.

53
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,509
This is ridiculous, Im.

54
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,663
They should punish me if I don’t go.

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,560
Why would they punish everyone else just to make me feel bad?

56
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,528
No, I’m not going.

57
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:44,682
But, Som-O—

58
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:45,848
I’m not going!

59
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:48,456
You don’t have to go, either.

60
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,281
This could end very easily if everyone just didn’t participate.

61
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:52,619
No, you can’t.

62
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,020
You have to go.

63
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,712
Please, Som.

64
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,462
Just go!

65
00:03:58,124 --> 00:03:58,931
Come with me.

66
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:01,260
Please, Som-O!

67
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,829
Som, come with me.

68
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,213
Please.

69
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:13,808
Fine.

70
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:15,721
Whatever.

71
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:26,637
Don’t even say anything.

72
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,207
I didn’t.

73
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:32,237
Why did you pull my pants, though?

74
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:39,703
Why did you cough, then?

75
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:48,714
You alright?

76
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,565
Yes, Dad.

77
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:54,413
Oh.

78
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,210
Hello.

79
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:56,317
Hi.

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,432
Good thing you’re here.

81
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,299
New, stay with Chad for now.

82
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,408
I’ll be handling the document.

83
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:03,103
Alright.

84
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:07,862
You ready?

85
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,503
I have to be even if I’m not, don’t I?

86
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:14,671
Did you tell Khao?

87
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:24,013
Are you sure you’re not going to tell her?

88
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:27,774
Please, Chad.

89
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:30,767
Don’t tell her.

90
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:35,614
Alright.

91
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:40,517
I’ll do what you ask.

92
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,706
Don’t be afraid, Dad.

93
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:55,669
Of course I’m not.

94
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:05,211
Right.

95
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:09,413
I’ll be strong.

96
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:13,309
I’ll be right back.

97
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:33,908
As I’ve discussed with you, we’re making this patient a case study,

98
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:37,515
so I’ve brought some medical students with me.

99
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,111
Of course.

100
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:40,306
Please.

101
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,823
Excuse me.

102
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,657
Professor, here’s the test result you asked for.

103
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,706
They asked me to give it to you.

104
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:55,438
Oh?

105
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,208
Do you know him?

106
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,414
He’s an underclassman of mine.

107
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,857
Get well soon.

108
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:12,114
Don’t worry.

109
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,394
Excuse me.

110
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:17,782
Goodbye.

111
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:18,660
Bye.

112
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:24,042
Som-O, please come to the hazing today.

113
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:26,365
Please.

114
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,315
I beg.

115
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:29,928
Do it for the rest of us.

116
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:31,425
Please, Som-O.

117
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:33,862
- Please. - I haven't said anything.

118
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:35,709
Please?

119
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,010
Fine. I’ll show up.

120
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,509
Really?

121
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:41,428
Yeah.

122
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:42,866
Can I get a hug?

123
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:44,188
Sure.

124
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:46,508
Yeah!

125
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,171
Good job not being late today!

126
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:53,684
Give yourself a round of applause.

127
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:02,702
Where is your name tag?

128
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:04,817
Where is your name tag?

129
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:06,626
Where is your name tag?

130
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,134
I forgot it.

131
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:11,223
Hurry up!

132
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:13,620
Go, go, go!

133
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:14,804
Hurry up.

134
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,047
Keep going.

135
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,528
Quickly!

136
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,709
Faster!

137
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,731
Fasten your pace, you there!

138
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,531
Get up there!

139
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:29,444
Run.

140
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:32,822
See? Nothing good about showing up.

141
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,321
At least they didn't make us sing today.

142
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:37,120
You jinx.

143
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,728
Did you just call your friend a jinx?

144
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,007
Five more rounds for all of you.

145
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:43,971
When does this stop, Im?

146
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:47,379
The hazing?

147
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:50,008
I think it goes on until the upperclassmen are happy.

148
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:53,460
Win them over, you mean?

149
00:08:55,878 --> 00:08:57,266
Like, everyone’s disciplined,

150
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,831
everyone shows up,

151
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:03,242
and just follows orders.

152
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,312
Is there no other way?

153
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:13,822
Are you ready for surgery?

154
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:14,814
Yes.

155
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:18,808
Hold on, Doctor.

156
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:35,571
Dad.

157
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:47,903
Hair band?

158
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,075
Does it belong to Khao?

159
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:52,817
Yes.

160
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,074
Can you give it to her when you can?

161
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,072
You have to be the one to give it back to her.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,205
I won’t do it for you.

163
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:16,109
Dad.

164
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,217
Please give it back to her.

165
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:28,063
Alright.

166
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,186
I promise.

167
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:31,420
I’ll give it back to her.

168
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:34,210
Thank you.

169
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:38,068
I hope she doesn’t lash out at you.

170
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,308
You stubborn boy.

171
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:53,423
I’m ready now.

172
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:24,477
I love you, New.

173
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:40,001
Chadjen!

174
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,708
Chad!

175
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,191
Chadjen!

176
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:45,819
Chadjen, how could you keep this from me?

177
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,708
New is getting surgery!

178
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,682
What were you thinking?

179
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:52,185
Khao told me over the phone just now and I rushed here.

180
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:53,706
Good thing the hazing was over early today.

181
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,118
What?

182
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:56,711
Khao knows this, too?

183
00:11:57,887 --> 00:11:59,139
No thanks to you!

184
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,259
Why did you keep it a secret?

185
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,235
You should know there is no such thing as secrets.

186
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:12,653
Oh, I don’t mean to offend you, Uncle.

187
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:15,524
It’s alright.

188
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:16,551
I understand.

189
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,979
Chadjen, you...

190
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,817
I promised New I wouldn’t.

191
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,771
I don’t know what this means.

192
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,337
But New wants you to have this, Khao.

193
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:24,503
Hey, don’t worry.

194
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:29,506
The surgeon who’s operating on New is very good.

195
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:32,915
No matter how good she is,

196
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,376
there’s still a chance that something might go wrong, right?

197
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,405
Yes, but it’s not likely.

198
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:47,801
Do you guys think New would forgive me?

199
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,208
He’s the one who needs forgiving.

200
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:53,909
What did you even do, Khao?

201
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,000
Will you please talk to me?

202
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,626
What are you doing?

203
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:21,220
Khao, you are pretty and cool.

204
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:26,579
Will you marry me?

205
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:33,405
How could you joke about a proposal?

206
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,957
I always lash out at him.

207
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:48,616
I lashed out at him about this hair band, too.

208
00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:53,937
He’s always treated everything as a joke.

209
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:57,408
But life is no joke.

210
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:03,595
Our time is very precious.

211
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:09,010
And I don’t even know how much time I have left.

212
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:12,411
And now he…

213
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:14,102
New is…

214
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,602
Now he’s…

215
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:39,705
Khao…

216
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:54,536
Take it easy.

217
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:00,506
I can’t do this.

218
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,007
You got this.

219
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,309
Don’t worry, Khao.

220
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,629
New will be here soon.

221
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:20,198
He will.

222
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:49,411
New!

223
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:53,847
- New! - New.

224
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,411
Oh, hello, Chadjen.

225
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:56,798
New.

226
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:57,537
Hello.

227
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,034
He’s a friend of mine.

228
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,287
Oh, I see.

229
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:04,139
Well, good news.

230
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,139
The surgery was a success.

231
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,677
The patient made it safe and sound.

232
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:10,136
He’ll wake up from the anesthetics soon enough.

233
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:13,657
I’ll leave your friend in your care, Chadjen.

234
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:15,505
Of course.

235
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:18,666
Thank you, Professor.

236
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:32,379
How are you doing with the case study the Professor asked you to see?

237
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,808
I’m still studying.

238
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:39,210
But I think I’ll understand in a few weeks.

239
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:40,337
Good job.

240
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:41,111
Thanks.

241
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:44,225
Are you alright?

242
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:46,016
I’m sorry.

243
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:50,109
Oh, Chadjen.

244
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:51,419
Im.

245
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:53,139
Hello, Chadjen.

246
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,745
Yeah, hi.

247
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,779
Im, this is Chad.

248
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,517
You don’t have to be so respectful.

249
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,305
He’s a second year student, just like you.

250
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:03,497
This is Im, my sister.

251
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,607
She’s here to have her leg checked up.

252
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:09,000
She’s been made to take a jog around the building for days.

253
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:16,337
You…

254
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,066
I’ll call you later.

255
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:24,336
What?

256
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,475
Hey, don’t you tell anyone that I’m—

257
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:33,220
You’re an imposter.

258
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,059
Shh!

259
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:35,808
Am I right?

260
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:37,899
Not so loud.

261
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,505
If the upperclassmen know, they’re going to give me an earful.

262
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,711
More importantly, do not tell Som-O, at all costs.

263
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,668
You want me to just do nothing?

264
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:58,364
Will you?

265
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,136
Please.

266
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:06,158
Please, Chadjen.

267
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:08,201
Please, please, please.

268
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:08,897
Please.

269
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:09,891
Please.

270
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:10,962
Please.

271
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:12,429
Fine.

272
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,776
But you have to help me with something.

273
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:20,321
Help you?

274
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:22,607
With what?

275
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:40,782
Has New come to, Uncle?

276
00:19:41,936 --> 00:19:42,782
So far, no.

277
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,405
Would you mind keeping him company for a bit, Khao?

278
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,114
I’ll go get something to eat.

279
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:51,665
Do you want anything?

280
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:53,198
No, thank you.

281
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:02,614
Khao.

282
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,305
I think New would be really happy

283
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:09,293
if you’re the first person he sees when he opens his eyes.

284
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,213
Wake up already.

285
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:37,619
May I come in?

286
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:39,657
Sure.

287
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,925
How is, uh…

288
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:42,819
New.

289
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:43,631
Right.

290
00:20:44,124 --> 00:20:45,297
How is he doing?

291
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,361
He’s still sleeping.

292
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,091
I talked to the Professor who’s taking care of him.

293
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:57,502
I just want to be helpful to you, Khao.

294
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,902
Sorry?

295
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,305
Actually, I came here because I wanted to see you.

296
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:12,201
Would you mind having a meal with me?

297
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,706
We can do it this morning, this afternoon…

298
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:20,706
Or tomorrow?

299
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:29,066
Please?

300
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:33,171
I’ll tell you what the Professor told me.

301
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:44,777
How should I take care of him once he wakes up?

302
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:46,724
I don’t really know.

303
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,105
I haven’t started making the rounds like the fourth and fifth years.

304
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:53,699
But the Professor said he has cardiac arrhythmia.

305
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,109
He’ll probably need an echo test to see how his heart is doing.

306
00:21:58,194 --> 00:22:00,317
New’s daily life will probably change.

307
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:03,272
He has to exercise more to make his heart stronger.

308
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:10,862
Kh–Khao?

309
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:14,259
Khao?

310
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:17,162
Khao.

311
00:22:20,902 --> 00:22:21,620
Sorry?

312
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:24,373
It’s nothing.

313
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:31,644
It’s just… you haven’t stopped asking about New since we came here.

314
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:36,500
I’m… sorry.

315
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,709
No, don’t be. I wasn’t calling you out or anything.

316
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:43,908
I was just going to say that you’re such a great friend.

317
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:48,634
Oh, well, the thing is New and I—

318
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:52,063
Oh, Khao, I have something to tell you.

319
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:55,442
Well…

320
00:22:56,205 --> 00:23:00,402
We’ve known each other since high school.

321
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,810
I thought it wouldn’t be appropriate back then,

322
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,205
but now that we’re all grown up,

323
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:09,509
I guess I can be honest with you now.

324
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:12,014
Sorry?

325
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,515
I like you.

326
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,730
(Is nerd awake yet?)

327
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,850
(No. But I’ll go see him tomorrow.)

328
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,050
(Hope he gets well soon.)

329
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:29,247
Stop!

330
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,208
Everyone, get up!

331
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:37,745
Let me borrow your precious time.

332
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:40,540
Someone is trying to mess with our faculty.

333
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:43,906
Our banner has been destroyed.

334
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,605
It was kept in a locked room.

335
00:24:47,131 --> 00:24:48,506
There is no way this is an outside job.

336
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:49,880
It’s gotta be one of us.

337
00:24:50,494 --> 00:24:52,069
Who? Who did this?

338
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,817
Is it you? Or you? Or you?

339
00:24:58,048 --> 00:24:59,014
Excuse me.

340
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,539
We need the banner by this evening.

341
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:04,262
If we keep looking for who did it, we’ll never get to use it.

342
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:08,810
I think it’s better if we make a new one.

343
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,810
Easier said than done!

344
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,903
Who would be able to make a new one in time?

345
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:20,010
What are you doing?

346
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:22,220
Painting.

347
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,752
Ann, just paint this whole thing.

348
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:29,405
Can someone grab me a brush?

349
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,896
Som-O.

350
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:32,398
Hmm?

351
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,512
Is this the color you want?

352
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:34,142
Yeah.

353
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,817
Shouldn’t that one be pink?

354
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:56,007
Thank you for accepting my invitation today.

355
00:25:59,936 --> 00:26:01,663
Thank you for asking.

356
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:04,508
I feel like I’m imposing on you, though.

357
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:07,060
Don’t.

358
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:09,404
I want to see you.

359
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:16,008
But I know…

360
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:22,014
You’re here because of New.

361
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,115
You don’t actually want to see me.

362
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,616
You really like New, don’t you?

363
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:43,617
Yes.

364
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:49,875
That’s why I feel like I’m imposing on you for asking so much about him.

365
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,405
Thank you.

366
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,005
Well…

367
00:26:59,438 --> 00:27:01,306
I really do like you, though.

368
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,374
And I thank you for that.

369
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:19,303
They’ll like it.

370
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,517
Don’t worry.

371
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:29,411
Let me see the banner.

372
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,582
If this doesn’t live up to our faculty’s name, you are all punished.

373
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,330
(Let’s Go, Faculty of Fine Arts.)

374
00:27:40,346 --> 00:27:41,548
Who made it?

375
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:50,222
It’s beautiful.

376
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,328
Good job.

377
00:27:55,949 --> 00:27:56,620
Som-O.

378
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,872
Som-O, Som-O, Som-O.

379
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,290
Som-O, Som-O, Som-O.

380
00:28:02,342 --> 00:28:03,404
Hold on.

381
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:08,804
It was a team’s effort.

382
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:11,976
Everyone helped draw and paint it.

383
00:28:15,957 --> 00:28:16,960
I did it.

384
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,417
What?

385
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:19,813
What do you mean?

386
00:28:20,484 --> 00:28:21,700
We all helped.

387
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:23,623
No.

388
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:26,361
I mean I destroyed that old banner.

389
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:34,154
Chadjen asked me to do it.

390
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,573
Look. Som-O drew this.

391
00:28:40,328 --> 00:28:41,154
Som-O did?

392
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:42,616
Yep.

393
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:44,084
Wow!

394
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:46,674
That’s beautiful.

395
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:49,300
She’s like a pro.

396
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,466
She drew this in a few days, no less.

397
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:55,927
She’s a genius.

398
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,171
It’s so detailed.

399
00:29:00,968 --> 00:29:02,505
And in so little time.

400
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:05,813
I didn’t think she was such a great artist.

401
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:09,106
Yeah, that’s exactly what I want to ask your help with.

402
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:17,714
Chadjen.

403
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:24,924
You look so funny.

404
00:29:25,576 --> 00:29:26,573
You look like Sailor Moon a bit.

405
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:28,934
No, I’m Justice Pao.

406
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:30,411
But you have a wand.

407
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,906
Here.

408
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:40,620
Today’s the last day of hazing.

409
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:42,897
You all have been amazing.

410
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:45,497
And we’d like to say thank you to all of you

411
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:49,222
for letting us act all rough and tough these past few days.

412
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,506
Thank you.

413
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:05,939
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

414
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:08,663
And another thank you to these people who have been helping us out.

415
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:11,416
Stand up.

416
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:18,422
Im?

417
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:22,008
Oh, dear. I’ve said so many bad things to you.

418
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,620
Did I do a good job?

419
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,389
Please.

420
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:37,610
Since it’s our last day,

421
00:30:38,056 --> 00:30:41,305
we’d like to apologize for always yelling at you…

422
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,899
By doing the grilled chicken dance.

423
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:47,817
Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!

424
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:49,346
Sing for us!

425
00:30:49,992 --> 00:30:51,645
Grilled chicken, grilled chicken

426
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:55,263
It’s getting skewered, it’s getting skewered

427
00:30:55,743 --> 00:30:59,023
First on its left, then on its right

428
00:30:59,303 --> 00:31:01,988
It’s getting hot in here, hot in here, hot here

429
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,268
Hey, what are you all waiting for?

430
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:04,536
Get up and join us.

431
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:15,368
It’s getting hot in here, hot in here, hot here

432
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:18,696
Grilled chicken, grilled chicken

433
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:22,100
It’s getting skewered, it’s getting skewered

434
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:24,697
First on its left, then on its right

435
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,257
It’s getting hot in here, hot in here, hot here

436
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,774
Grilled chicken, grilled chicken

437
00:31:29,842 --> 00:31:32,266
First on its left, then on its right

438
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,745
It’s getting hot in here, hot in here, hot here

439
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:51,219
Where’s Uncle?

440
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:53,728
I let him take a break and grab some food.

441
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:55,911
He’ll come back to keep New company at night.

442
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:02,899
Chad.

443
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:04,601
Is this normal?

444
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,004
It’s been two days.

445
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:08,626
It is normal.

446
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:16,856
(Shark Tao just claimed a gold medal for our nation a few hours ago.)

447
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:18,311
(Let’s talk to him.)

448
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,528
Oh, it’s Tao.

449
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,625
(A friend of mine is currently unwell…)

450
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:31,826
(Nerd, get better soon.)

451
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:33,705
(I’ll come see you when I can.)

452
00:32:37,847 --> 00:32:38,606
(And…)

453
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:40,976
(Som-O.)

454
00:32:44,517 --> 00:32:47,161
(This gold is yours.)

455
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:02,370
I have to study.

456
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:26,268
What should I do?

457
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:28,687
Should I?

458
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,238
Tao, you jerk.

459
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,213
Chad.

460
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:40,222
Chadjen.

461
00:33:40,773 --> 00:33:41,423
Chad.

462
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:46,134
What?

463
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:50,170
Is something wrong?

464
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:53,499
No. Everything’s fine.

465
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:57,622
Is it… because of Tao?

466
00:33:58,668 --> 00:33:59,768
Tao?

467
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:01,114
What about him?

468
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,614
Well…

469
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:07,511
It’s about that gold.

470
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,629
Isn’t it?

471
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:13,914
It certainly isn’t.

472
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:16,557
I’m going to study.

473
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:19,918
Chad.

474
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:23,826
Thank you for today.

475
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:25,457
About the banner, I mean.

476
00:34:31,758 --> 00:34:32,416
Sure.

477
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:49,814
I’m sorry, New.

478
00:34:54,622 --> 00:34:56,417
I went to see Mhog today.

479
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,106
He’s probably the guy you hate most in the world.

480
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:07,457
But I only went to see him to make him stop liking me.

481
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,314
I was a bit of a jerk.

482
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:18,457
He said he still liked me, though.

483
00:35:20,874 --> 00:35:26,608
That’s why I told him that I used to like him,

484
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:31,869
but not anymore,

485
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:35,810
and I don’t think I ever will.

486
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:44,318
Because the only person I like…

487
00:35:47,848 --> 00:35:48,903
is you.

488
00:36:01,186 --> 00:36:01,911
New.

489
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:51,075
I’m sorry I threw it away.

490
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:30,611
New.

491
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:33,373
New.

492
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:34,762
Khao.

493
00:37:49,908 --> 00:37:53,428
What… What did you hear?

494
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:56,617
Everything.

495
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:03,511
I’m back, Khao.

496
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,365
Khao, how are we doing?

497
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:49,835
Oh?

498
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:50,894
My son!

499
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,317
- New! - My son is alive and well!

500
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,841
Oh, sorry.

501
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,977
Som-O is here.

502
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:57,720
Are you in pain?

503
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:00,096
I’m fine now.

504
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,460
He’s back now. Don’t cry.

505
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:06,400
How are you feeling?

506
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:08,179
Good.

507
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:12,228
What’s next on our schedule?

508
00:39:12,862 --> 00:39:13,757
This.

509
00:39:14,044 --> 00:39:16,216
Oh, the difficult class.

510
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,712
Hey, did you see that interview with Shark Tao just now?

511
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,010
He goes to our university, right?

512
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,392
I did see it.

513
00:39:22,598 --> 00:39:24,514
Who is Som-O anyway?

514
00:39:24,768 --> 00:39:25,617
I don’t know.

515
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:26,628
His girlfriend, maybe?

516
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:28,444
But it’s so damn romantic.

517
00:39:28,456 --> 00:39:29,979
He really said that on national television, huh?

518
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:31,918
Now the whole country knows.

519
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:33,768
It’s on everyone’s social media feed, I bet.

520
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:34,816
Adorable, isn’t it?

521
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,122
The elevator is here.

522
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:39,940
Are you coming?

523
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:42,214
Please go ahead.

524
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,850
(Female Student Dormitory)

525
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:04,019
- Tao, what are you doing here? - Som.

526
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:06,149
We were just watching you on TV.

527
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:08,149
Did you teleport here?

528
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:10,100
I flew back as soon as the match was over.

529
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:15,420
I’m here to give you the gold.

530
00:40:21,474 --> 00:40:22,853
A bit much, don’t you think?

531
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,807
Is this all the reason why you’re here?

532
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:28,220
Of course not.

533
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,805
I’m here to see nerd, too.

534
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:32,914
Oh, he’s awake!

535
00:40:33,574 --> 00:40:34,314
He is?

536
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:35,814
I have to see him soon.

537
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:41,414
But I’m here to see you as well.

538
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:47,311
Take it.

539
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:49,608
It’s my thanks to you.

540
00:40:52,722 --> 00:40:57,109
Without you, I wouldn’t have the drive I need to compete.

541
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,814
You’re always so over the top.

542
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,808
I’ll give you another one if I win.

543
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:01,968
You don’t have to.

544
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,317
You’re a great athlete.

545
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,847
You won because you’re amazing.

546
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:13,306
I have nothing to do with it.

547
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:15,506
Thank you, Som.

548
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,324
Thank you for everything.

549
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:30,229
Gold, huh?

550
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:32,737
You’re talented.

551
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,361
Of course.

552
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:37,708
Isn’t it pretty?

553
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:39,002
Yeah.

554
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,334
Gold, really?

555
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:48,576
Chad.

556
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:51,099
Chadjen!

557
00:42:52,075 --> 00:42:54,130
I asked you what’s wrong.

558
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:56,142
Let me know so I can apologize.

559
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:57,862
What did I do to him?

560
00:42:58,013 --> 00:42:58,765
Do you have any ideas?

561
00:42:58,857 --> 00:43:00,425
What’s with you and him?

562
00:43:00,438 --> 00:43:02,112
I can smell something brewing between you two.

563
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:05,311
I think I should move in with you, New.

564
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,019
Your Dad would probably be okay with that.

565
00:43:08,597 --> 00:43:09,808
This is hardly a stroll.

566
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,208
It’s like you’re walking away from me.

567
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:12,694
It’s exhausting.

568
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,856
Are we still talking about the stroll?

569
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,930
We’re talking about my being in love with you.

570
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:25,374
Some people say

571
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:28,211
if a couple can ride a bike across this bridge together

572
00:43:28,488 --> 00:43:31,014
without their feet touching the ground once,

573
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:32,626
they’ll stay together for a really long time.

574
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:33,960
It means it’s true love.

575
00:43:34,368 --> 00:43:37,811
Tao, Chad and I are dating.

576
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:41,656
I’m moving out of the college dorm.

577
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:42,503
Som?

578
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:43,921
Do you want to move in with me?
