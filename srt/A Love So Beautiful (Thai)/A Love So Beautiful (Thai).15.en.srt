1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:04,168
Let’s prove to my parents that we are serious about this relationship.

2
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:11,106
If you feel bad, you should realize whom you need to care about, me or your dad.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,354
If you go comfort her,

4
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:13,946
when she makes up with her boyfriend,

5
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:14,915
they will forget about you.

6
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:19,100
After I make the calendar, I feel even sadder.

7
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:23,460
It’s clear to me that I’m only a tiny part of your life.

8
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:26,429
What the…

9
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:30,016
(What is happening with your life, Som-O?)

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,090
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

11
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:36,804
Here.

12
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,251
Got something for you.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,023
I’m not trying to rub it in or anything.

14
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:46,842
I’m just worried about you, Som.

15
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,299
We’ve been friends for years, you know?

16
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:51,158
Is that so?

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,204
Have you been seeing Chadjen at the hospital lately?

18
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:03,168
People have been talking about how Chadjen is seeing—

19
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,404
—that he’s very close with that nurse, Dao.

20
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,533
All you do is gossip so there’s no way I’d believe you.

21
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:14,623
Take it back.

22
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:16,096
Fine.

23
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:21,106
If you don’t believe me, just go and see it for yourself.

24
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:29,506
You have to make sure everyone at the hospital knows you’re his girlfriend.

25
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,640
Got it?

26
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:36,262
If I don’t get this man, you have to.

27
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:37,385
No one else.

28
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,663
You hear me?

29
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:40,816
Fight for it, Som.

30
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:42,125
Just believe me.

31
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,957
Okay?

32
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,205
(How was your exam?)

33
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:52,804
It was okay, Mom.

34
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:55,798
Got some compliments from the professor, too.

35
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:57,317
Really?

36
00:02:57,623 --> 00:02:59,702
You wanna come home today?

37
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:02,634
I’ll make you all your favorite dishes to celebrate.

38
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:06,005
I can’t go today.

39
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:10,660
I still have to work on the painting for the exhibition

40
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:12,610
and it’s not going anywhere at the moment.

41
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:13,709
(Is that so?)

42
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:15,942
When is the exhibition?

43
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:21,311
Don’t forget to tell us so we can go.

44
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:23,512
Will Dad come?

45
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:26,912
Of course he will.

46
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:28,814
I’ll make sure of it.

47
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:33,408
Mom.

48
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,992
I haven’t seen Chad in days.

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,459
He’s probably busy with school.

50
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:43,130
You just need to be there for each other.

51
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:46,709
Right.

52
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,306
I have to go.

53
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:54,514
Call me when you have time, alright?

54
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,299
Got it.

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,451
Why are you still up?

56
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:25,306
I need to fix the bug in my game.

57
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,102
But it’s bedtime.

58
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:31,937
I just want to get it over with.

59
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,825
If you can’t do it, maybe you need help?

60
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:37,937
I’ll talk to Dad.

61
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:41,514
He’s got some connection with someone abroad who works in IT.

62
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,514
Maybe he can help you, New.

63
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:46,311
No. I can do it myself.

64
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:47,297
You sure?

65
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:48,567
Yes, Khao.

66
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,416
I need to prove it to my father.

67
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:55,120
You need to start by getting some sleep.

68
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,210
(Chadjen / Som-O)

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,050
(Do I have to become a patient to get to see you?)

70
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,050
(I miss you, you know?)

71
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,211
- Hello. - Hello.

72
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:40,208
Are you living in Room 4303?

73
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,002
Yes.

74
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:42,757
Someone asked me to pass this to you.

75
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,420
Oh, thank you.

76
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:45,114
My pleasure.

77
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,370
(Eat your fill and be ready for school, dear.)

78
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,090
(This one is for Chadjen.)

79
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:14,708
Thank you.

80
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,905
Keep me updated before tonight.

81
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,331
- Sorry. - I’m so sorry.

82
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:40,909
Oh, Chadjen. I’m sorry.

83
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:42,210
It’s alright.

84
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:43,219
Are you hurt?

85
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:52,853
I’m fine.

86
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:04,248
Chadjen, what are you doing?

87
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:05,561
Nothing?

88
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:08,011
You don’t have to keep it a secret, you know?

89
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,105
I just broke up with my girlfriend to be with Lily, too.

90
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,709
Hey.

91
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:15,010
Don’t talk like I was the reason you broke up with her.

92
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:19,053
No, I mean, dating outside of our circle is hard, right?

93
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,417
It’s a headache when you’re too busy for them, you know?

94
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:23,521
You know what I mean?

95
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:24,773
I agree.

96
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:28,416
Excuse me.

97
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,410
(I got you some food. Let’s meet soon. Do your best, Chadjen.)

98
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,160
(Let’s meet soon. Do your best, Chadjen.)

99
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:23,018
(Waiting.)

100
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:24,200
(Still waiting.)

101
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,273
(Tell me when you’re home.)

102
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:26,730
(I miss you.)

103
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,163
(I miss you.)

104
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:29,090
(Let’s have coffee.)

105
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:29,990
(I want to hang out with you.)

106
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,190
(You’re taken.)

107
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:32,330
(Chadjen x Som-O)

108
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,770
(I’m at the studio on campus today.)

109
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:42,022
Careful, Khao.

110
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:46,097
Som!

111
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:48,376
Oh, Khao. New.

112
00:11:58,088 --> 00:11:59,417
Wow.

113
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:02,472
Congratulations. You did it.

114
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:07,500
I’m so happy I don’t have to pull another all-nighter.

115
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:08,614
I agree.

116
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,565
The bags under your eyes look terrible.

117
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:13,214
I can tell you’ve been staying up all these times.

118
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:20,509
Did you do this all by yourself, Som?

119
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:22,207
Of course.

120
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,807
From start to finish.

121
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:25,317
It’s beautiful.

122
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,654
Where’s Chad? Isn’t he here?

123
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:35,611
He said he would come so I guess he probably will.

124
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:38,872
Congratulations.

125
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,010
Here’s your gift.

126
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:43,401
You really didn’t have to.

127
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:44,521
Thank you.

128
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:58,217
Who is this, though?

129
00:12:58,703 --> 00:12:59,511
I won’t tell you.

130
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,102
I think it’s… me.

131
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:08,475
You’re so delusional.

132
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,367
It isn’t me?

133
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:12,380
- It could be— - Surprise!

134
00:13:14,632 --> 00:13:15,705
Congrats, Som.

135
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:17,321
Tao?

136
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:20,102
When did you get back here?

137
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:21,712
I landed this morning.

138
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:22,522
Here.

139
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:24,016
Congrats.

140
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,299
Thank you.

141
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:30,306
Wow!

142
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,601
How much would you sell this?

143
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:34,816
I’d like to buy it.

144
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:35,937
Hold on.

145
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:39,900
Are you an athlete or a billionaire now?

146
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:41,736
Oh, Miss Khao, ma’am.

147
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:44,005
It’s an investment, you know?

148
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:48,912
Once Som-O’s become famous, I’d no doubt turn a profit.

149
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:50,622
Is that what you’re aiming for?

150
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,045
It’s really beautiful.

151
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,666
But that was such a good reason to buy it.

152
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:58,105
Since we’re all here, should we take a photo?

153
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,468
Alright.

154
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:01,051
Let’s take a selfie.

155
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:02,102
Make sure you get the painting.

156
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,373
Of course.

157
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,004
It stands out more than we do.

158
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:07,210
Ready?

159
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:09,013
One, two, three.

160
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:11,764
You really didn’t have to get me this, you know?

161
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:15,060
It’s your first exhibition.

162
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:16,717
I kinda think this is an understatement, actually.

163
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:19,709
I can always count on you to be so over the top.

164
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,614
Are you Shark Tao?

165
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:26,571
Yes.

166
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,637
Can I get a photo, please?

167
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:28,349
Of course.

168
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:29,622
Take it for me, alright?

169
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:34,872
Take one for me, too.

170
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,008
Sure.

171
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:39,442
One, two, three.

172
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:40,808
One more.

173
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:42,380
Thank you.

174
00:14:42,411 --> 00:14:46,010
Please stop by to check out my friend’s artwork, Som-O.

175
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,607
Please.

176
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:48,678
Thank you.

177
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:51,432
Hey, Tao, stop it.

178
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:53,496
I don’t need you to promote my work.

179
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:56,382
But it’s so amazing.

180
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,708
When is your next competition?

181
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:04,863
In two days.

182
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:06,611
In two days?

183
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:08,697
Will you make it back in time?

184
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:09,605
Of course.

185
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:11,065
I’ve got everything planned.

186
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,115
I still have so many hours with you.

187
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,108
Don’t tell me you flew all the way back for this.

188
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,198
Tao?

189
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,105
Of course not!

190
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:27,557
I’ve got some errands to run as well.

191
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:29,708
I just stopped by to see you.

192
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,125
Fine.

193
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,404
Because if you actually flew back here just for me,

194
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:35,912
I’d have told you to go back right away.

195
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:39,005
Don’t go lagging in your practice, Tao.

196
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:40,623
Yes, Coach Som.

197
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,505
Stop it.

198
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:50,893
Stop messing with it, honey.

199
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,539
- Is it good enough? - It was just now.

200
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:56,610
But I don’t get to put something so fancy on often enough these days.

201
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,543
I don’t feel very comfortable in it.

202
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,506
Stop dawdling.

203
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:01,782
Your daughter is waiting.

204
00:16:02,205 --> 00:16:04,324
But, honey, this is…

205
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:05,266
Oh!

206
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,700
Dad! Mom!

207
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,321
- Hello. - Hello.

208
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:17,911
I thought you guys wouldn’t be able to come.

209
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:22,099
How could we not show up to your graduation, Som?

210
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:27,208
Give her the bouquet.

211
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:29,103
Flowers for you.

212
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,588
Thanks, Dad.

213
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:35,373
Where is Chad?

214
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:38,512
He… will probably be here soon.

215
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,820
He’s a bit tied up at the hospital.

216
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:47,106
Why don’t you guys have lunch with us after the exhibition?

217
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:48,548
All of you.

218
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:50,065
It will be our treat.

219
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,961
Let’s celebrate Som’s graduation.

220
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:54,263
Of course.

221
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:56,506
I really miss Thai food.

222
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,111
Then I really must impose.

223
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:00,302
Please do.

224
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:02,560
Som.

225
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:03,482
Yes?

226
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:06,734
Now that your project is done and you’ve graduated.

227
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,903
Feel free to come home.

228
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:14,705
But, Dad…

229
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:17,365
Don’t worry.

230
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,865
Your father is just putting up appearances to look intimidating.

231
00:17:22,426 --> 00:17:25,303
Well, I’ll think about it.

232
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,081
I understand.

233
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:31,814
But if it gets lonely, you’re always welcome at home, honey.

234
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:33,511
Alright?

235
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,508
Alright, Mom.

236
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:52,106
Dad, I painted that.

237
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,013
You like it?

238
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:55,211
It’s fine.

239
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:57,899
“Fine?”

240
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,112
Som, he’s clearly holding back.

241
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,998
Yes.

242
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,986
It’s beautiful, honey.

243
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:12,361
Come on here, nerd.

244
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,602
We need to talk.

245
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:14,574
What about?

246
00:18:14,654 --> 00:18:16,613
What exactly is the matter with Som-O and Chadjen?

247
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:18,401
She seemed normal just now when I talked to her.

248
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:22,130
Don’t “shhh” me.

249
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,005
You really are clueless sometimes, Tao.

250
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:29,702
You know about this?

251
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:41,512
And they said men don’t gossip.

252
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:51,915
Don’t tell me you flew back here to be her rebound.

253
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,573
You’re exaggerating, Khao.

254
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,139
I wouldn’t do that.

255
00:18:57,362 --> 00:19:00,305
But what will she do?

256
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:02,205
I don’t know.

257
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,866
She hasn’t talked to me about it, either.

258
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:12,367
I think what’s as important as this is what Chadjen will do.

259
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:13,611
Right?

260
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:17,814
He should be here on such an important day like this, but he's a no-show.

261
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:30,768
Excuse me.

262
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,608
Would you happen to know who painted this piece?

263
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,303
This one?

264
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:37,982
It’s mine.

265
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:39,611
You painted this?

266
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:41,908
I did.

267
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,207
I think your work is—

268
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:46,460
Uhh, you are…

269
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:48,605
I’m Gewalin.

270
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:50,349
But please call me Som-O.

271
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,256
I’m King.

272
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:57,114
Hi.

273
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,751
Can I be honest?

274
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,148
Of all the artwork in this entire exhibition,

275
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:08,706
none impresses me like yours does.

276
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:12,161
Thank you.

277
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,918
How about this?

278
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,874
I’ll leave my business card with you.

279
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:21,580
If you ever want to work with me, please give me a call.

280
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:23,311
We can talk.

281
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:24,762
Here.

282
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:26,155
Of course. Thank you.

283
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:28,579
Very pretty.

284
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:30,960
I mean, the painting.

285
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,195
Thank you.

286
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:34,659
Som.

287
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:37,413
Tao, there you are.

288
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,906
Tao, this is King.

289
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:41,871
King, this is my friend, Tao.

290
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,937
King said he likes my work so we got to talking a bit.

291
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:51,659
Are you Shark Tao?

292
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:52,328
Yes.

293
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:54,709
I’m in the presence of a celebrity.

294
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:56,920
My name is King.

295
00:20:57,777 --> 00:20:59,311
I’m an art curator.

296
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:00,730
Right.

297
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:05,308
Well, I’ll be taking a look around.

298
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:06,810
Of course.

299
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,361
It’s nice to meet you, Som-O.

300
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:11,662
Likewise.

301
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,331
Let’s do it for 12 hours, Mom.

302
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,419
What did you get her?

303
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:23,411
Why?

304
00:21:23,674 --> 00:21:25,357
It’s a surprise for Som-O.

305
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:26,906
Don’t tell him.

306
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:29,340
You guys are made for each other, for real.

307
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,471
Thank you for coming, guys.

308
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,602
Especially you, Tao.

309
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,813
Thanks for flying all the way here.

310
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:42,213
Som.

311
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,718
Should we tell Chadjen we’re going to have a meal together?

312
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:49,906
I–I’ll call him.

313
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:13,125
He’s probably busy.

314
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:15,314
I can’t reach him.

315
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:18,410
It’s alright.

316
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:26,154
Mom. Dad.

317
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:29,656
Can I sleep at home tonight?

318
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:32,407
Of course.

319
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:36,161
Are you really okay with it, Dad?

320
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:37,805
Sure.

321
00:22:38,872 --> 00:22:39,903
You sure?

322
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:40,792
Yeah.

323
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:43,652
Let’s go, guys. You must be hungry.

324
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,272
- I am. - Follow me.

325
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:46,530
You haven’t had anything to eat?

326
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:47,810
Not at all.

327
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,010
Hang in there.

328
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,804
It’s been a while since I saw you here.

329
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,020
Are you going somewhere?

330
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,760
I’m going home, Chad.

331
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,308
I don’t want to be alone anymore.

332
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:24,308
You were busy today as well, were you?

333
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,700
I’m sorry.

334
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:33,355
It’s okay.

335
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:38,605
Just do your things.

336
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,964
I’m just…

337
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,911
I’m just a tiny part of your life anyway.

338
00:24:55,712 --> 00:24:56,364
Chad.

339
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,462
Do you know how many years I’ve been waiting for you?

340
00:25:08,522 --> 00:25:13,106
You probably never count each passing second like I always do.

341
00:25:21,725 --> 00:25:22,511
That’s…

342
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:27,266
That’s how I waited for you.

343
00:25:32,437 --> 00:25:33,266
I just…

344
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,160
I just wanted to see you on important days like this.

345
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,266
I just wanted a bit of your time.

346
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:53,957
But even that was too much to ask for.

347
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:01,472
Can you say something?

348
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:04,814
Maybe you can change my mind.

349
00:26:13,493 --> 00:26:14,594
I…

350
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:17,808
I’m tired, Som.

351
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,863
Tired?

352
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:30,026
Are you tired of dating me?

353
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:38,013
I am the one tired.

354
00:26:40,562 --> 00:26:43,638
All I do is run after you.

355
00:26:45,242 --> 00:26:46,106
I think…

356
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:53,219
I think I made a mistake when I left everything I had to be with you.

357
00:27:03,611 --> 00:27:04,604
But the two of us…

358
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,321
We don’t have to be tired anymore.

359
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:51,115
Get another gold in your next match.

360
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,985
Honey, don’t go putting pressure on him like that.

361
00:29:55,551 --> 00:29:56,808
It’s okay.

362
00:29:57,448 --> 00:30:00,020
Pressure is a form of motivation, too.

363
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,312
Am I right, Som?

364
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,619
Right.

365
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,502
Tao is probably used to it.

366
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,503
He’s been under pressure his whole life.

367
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:12,017
You have an interview today, right?

368
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:13,911
Do you want me to put you under some pressure, too?

369
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:15,534
Mom!

370
00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:20,605
But I have an appointment with King today.

371
00:30:21,814 --> 00:30:23,312
I’ll show him my artwork.

372
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,880
Is it that famous hipster guy?

373
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:27,900
Yes.

374
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,810
It would be great if you get the job like you hope.

375
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,908
Work is hard to come by these days.

376
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,700
Som.

377
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:39,814
I’ve got some errands today as well.

378
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,960
You need a lift?

379
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,807
It’s okay, Tao.

380
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:44,720
Just take care of your things.

381
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:47,484
You’re nice, aren’t you?

382
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:50,262
You even stop by to see her when you’re so busy.

383
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:52,666
What are you saying, sir?

384
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,468
It’s not Som I came here to see.

385
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,410
I came here to see you.

386
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,702
Drop by again next time you’re in Thailand.

387
00:31:02,868 --> 00:31:06,980
I’ll cook you your favorite dishes so you have the energy to win more gold medals.

388
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,442
You need to power up.

389
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:11,213
Here.

390
00:31:11,297 --> 00:31:12,560
Thank you.

391
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:15,297
- Eat lots, kid. - Your food is amazing.

392
00:31:15,828 --> 00:31:17,515
(I kept my promise.)

393
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:24,801
(I came back when you have no one.)

394
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,828
Please.

395
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:30,721
Thank you.

396
00:31:32,942 --> 00:31:34,431
Welcome, Som-O.

397
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:36,647
Right.

398
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:40,968
Your office is huge.

399
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,402
What kind of painting do you want me to do?

400
00:31:45,442 --> 00:31:46,816
Why don’t we go talk over there?

401
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:48,709
- Please. - Of course.

402
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:57,576
Just make yourself at home.

403
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,804
Thanks.

404
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,906
Some of the artwork here is mine.

405
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,300
But the rest is an investment.

406
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:14,607
Well, should we begin the interview?

407
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:17,005
I have something prepared.

408
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:25,494
Som-O, do you realize these paintings don’t feel like you?

409
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:32,211
They are all so… unlike you.

410
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,965
Pardon?

411
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:37,200
Here.

412
00:32:47,914 --> 00:32:48,602
Oh…

413
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:51,497
I…

414
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,946
Have a drink.

415
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:57,801
Just take a sip.

416
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:01,705
Cheers.

417
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,899
You’re not much of a drinker, I take it?

418
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:16,260
I only drink every once in a while with my friends.

419
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:24,973
Are you seeing anyone right now, Som-O?

420
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:30,810
King, that has nothing to do with work.

421
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,315
I think we should focus on business..

422
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:36,936
I asked that because I wanted to know

423
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:39,699
if you’ve got a partner to share your opinions with.

424
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:43,274
I want to curate your work at my gallery.

425
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,274
It’ll be a solo exhibition,

426
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:47,019
and it will be all yours.

427
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:48,607
Really?

428
00:33:49,214 --> 00:33:51,211
What do I need to do?

429
00:33:52,804 --> 00:33:54,505
You’re right about one thing.

430
00:33:55,444 --> 00:33:59,106
Everything I said is going to happen won’t be possible…

431
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,500
If you don’t give me something in exchange.

432
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:04,414
Sorry?

433
00:34:11,743 --> 00:34:12,315
Stop it.

434
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,297
Hold on, Som-O.

435
00:34:15,773 --> 00:34:16,472
Wait.

436
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:19,408
Is it your first time?

437
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,241
This is how it’s done in this industry.

438
00:34:23,515 --> 00:34:24,973
What stupid industry are you in, you jerk?

439
00:34:26,558 --> 00:34:27,320
Som-O.

440
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,257
Being a woman in this business, you need to learn how to behave.

441
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,068
Let go!

442
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,180
Let me go!

443
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:36,241
Hold on, Som-O.

444
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:37,466
No!

445
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:38,185
Come on here.

446
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,263
I said let me go!

447
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,262
I’ll help you—

448
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:41,856
Som-O!

449
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:47,145
Som-O!

450
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:48,874
Damn it!

451
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:04,303
When you said “soon,”

452
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:07,608
how many long years did you mean?

453
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:09,312
Huh?

454
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:12,534
I think you should give up on this project.

455
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:15,518
I can get you an easier job.

456
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,256
I’ve got connections everywhere.

457
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:23,900
I must apologize, Dad,

458
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,915
and to you as well, Khao, for putting you through this.

459
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:30,271
New.

460
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,260
That was your father’s idea.

461
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:34,407
You never put me through anything.

462
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:35,899
I never complain.

463
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:42,312
I was afraid that by the time you said something, I’d already lose you.

464
00:36:06,853 --> 00:36:07,653
Thank you.

465
00:36:08,142 --> 00:36:09,639
You eat more, too. You work so hard.

466
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:09,863
(Som-O)
You eat more, too. You work so hard.

467
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:12,930
(Som-O)

468
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:14,573
Take the call.

469
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:21,217
Tao?

470
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,905
Tao, help me.

471
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:24,817
(Som, where are you?)

472
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:29,539
(Som, are you alright?)

473
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:36,408
(Som.)

474
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:38,013
(Som!)

475
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,508
Don’t worry, Chadjen.

476
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:12,525
Pull yourself together and do your job.

477
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:15,208
And about that job offer in the countryside,

478
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:17,524
when can you give us an answer?

479
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:22,928
There are so many places that want you to work for them.

480
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,911
Opportunities like this don't come by for everybody, Chadjen.

481
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:31,605
Can I give you an answer later?

482
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,260
I’m not ready right now.

483
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:42,755
Hurry up and decide before that opportunity is gone.

484
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:45,416
Yes, sir.

485
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:02,454
Som?

486
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:03,305
Tao.

487
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,583
- Tao! - Som!

488
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:05,804
Som, what’s wrong?

489
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:06,885
Calm down.

490
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:08,580
Tao.

491
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:10,518
Tao.

492
00:38:11,779 --> 00:38:12,937
Som, it’s okay now.

493
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:15,408
It’s okay.

494
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,863
Get in the car, Som.

495
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:20,019
You’re alright now.

496
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:28,164
Are you alright?

497
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:30,968
It’ll be okay.

498
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,690
(Som-O)

499
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:03,708
(The number you have dialed is not available at the moment.)

500
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:13,957
(The number you have dialed is not available at the moment.)

501
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,306
(The number you have dialed is not available at the moment.)

502
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:33,416
Grace, it’s important to know how to socialize when you’re in this business.

503
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:35,198
Let’s have a drink.

504
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:37,160
Just a little.

505
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:48,970
You don’t want that?

506
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:04,573
It’s alright. Don’t be afraid.

507
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,865
Stop. Stop it!

508
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:22,305
Who the hell are you?

509
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:25,416
Don’t you dare do this to anyone again!

510
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:27,416
Come on here!

511
00:40:29,568 --> 00:40:31,454
You jerk!

512
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:52,272
Hello, Dad?

513
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:54,576
I’ll fly back tonight.

514
00:41:05,555 --> 00:41:06,240
That jerk!

515
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,720
How could he do this to my daughter?

516
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:10,957
I’m going to call the cops on him.

517
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:13,213
Don’t do it, dear.

518
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:15,388
You need to think this through.

519
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,770
Where is Chadjen at a time like this?

520
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:26,008
Where the hell has he gone?

521
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:28,585
Forget him, Dad.

522
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:31,773
My problem probably isn’t important enough for him.

523
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:40,506
Not important enough for him?

524
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:42,053
How could he do this?

525
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:44,977
I trusted him to take care of you.

526
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:47,586
But he let this happen to you!

527
00:42:00,677 --> 00:42:01,671
I’m sorry, dear.

528
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:04,607
It’s alright now.

529
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:08,059
It’s alright now, baby.

530
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,266
Professor, I’ve made up my mind.

531
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,619
I’ll take that job in the countryside.

532
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:54,509
Nothing is more important than my promise to you, Som.

533
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,306
Here.

534
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:00,019
That’s adorable.

535
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,770
(Team Shark Tao)

536
00:43:02,973 --> 00:43:04,377
Dad is in the hospital?

537
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:11,911
Let’s go.

538
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,383
If you go, just stay gone.

539
00:43:16,576 --> 00:43:18,065
Don’t come back to her.

540
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:22,240
Once you know who New invited, you won’t be so happy.

541
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:26,555
Oh, he brought a date.

542
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:28,133
Hello, I’m Sue.

543
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:29,874
I went to medical school with Chadjen.

544
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,671
Oh, you don’t have to.

545
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,780
Tao, take it easy.

546
00:43:38,168 --> 00:43:39,540
You forgot one other thing.

547
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:40,847
What?
