1
00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:02,303
Do you remember that game we played on New Year's Day?

2
00:00:02,517 --> 00:00:05,266
The first person I wanted to see on New Year’s Day was you

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,749
I love you very much.

4
00:00:09,982 --> 00:00:11,817
Are you asking me out?

5
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:24,013
You really won’t help me study, huh?

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

7
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:43,211
(That’s right. I got accepted into the college.)

8
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:45,317
(I finally made it.)

9
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,011
(After working hard for a long time.)

10
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,760
(I hope my college life will be full of fun.)

11
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:52,970
(College Freshman)
(I hope my college life will be full of fun.)

12
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:53,601
(College Freshman)

13
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,417
Done.
(College Freshman)

14
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:54,650
(College Freshman)

15
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:58,128
This is the first time that you are going to be away from me.

16
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:00,176
First time?

17
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:02,817
Last New Year, you went to Phuket for a vacation with Dad.

18
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:04,306
You left me home alone.

19
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:06,896
She’s right.

20
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:10,257
I’m worried about you.

21
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:12,136
I’m worried about how you will live, eat and sleep.

22
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,451
Will it be as comfortable as living in our home?

23
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:20,226
I probably miss you so much that I can’t eat or sleep.

24
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:21,908
Mom.

25
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:27,697
Mom, you are overacting.

26
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:30,880
She’s staying in the college dorm.

27
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:34,097
It’s less than one hour drive from home.

28
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:37,970
Dad, watch what you say.

29
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:41,660
You may miss her more than I do.

30
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:44,874
Let’s hug.

31
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:48,327
I won’t see you for several days.

32
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:50,780
I’m only moving to my dorm.

33
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:52,422
You two are overacting.

34
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:54,903
You don’t understand.

35
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,260
I’ll call you every day, alright?

36
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:00,257
That’s great.

37
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:02,834
Don’t forget to answer my call.

38
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:04,718
Let’s go.

39
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:05,376
Let’s go.

40
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:06,745
Sure, honey.

41
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:08,380
Let’s go.

42
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:15,290
Som-O.

43
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,290
What, Dad?

44
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:20,995
You are now in college.

45
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:22,905
Yes.

46
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:28,309
From now on, you will live away from us.

47
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,007
I know that you are not a kid anymore.

48
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:36,965
It’s normal if you are going to date someone.

49
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,542
I think you are a cute girl.

50
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:41,540
What?

51
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,478
If you have a boyfriend,

52
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,447
don’t forget to introduce him to me so I can size him up.

53
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:54,136
No, I mean you should take him to meet us so we can get to know him.

54
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,802
Dad, it’s not a big deal. I can do that.

55
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,302
Although you two are dating, you cannot have sex.

56
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,788
Promise me.

57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,725
Why are you so mean?

58
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:24,717
You really won’t help me study, huh?

59
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,059
Promise me.

60
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:24,358
Yes, Dad.

61
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,370
(Women’s dormitory)

62
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:42,005
I also like this one. Can I borrow it sometimes?

63
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:42,801
Sure.

64
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,905
When will we finish unpacking?

65
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,222
I brought a lot of stuff.

66
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:54,014
You also use this?

67
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,192
Hello, everyone.

68
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:02,511
I’m Som-O from the Faculty of Fine Arts.

69
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:05,256
I am your roommate.

70
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:08,653
Hello, Som-O. I’m Jan from the Faculty of Science.

71
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,263
I’m Snow from the Faculty of Communication Arts.

72
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:12,576
I’m Nam, also from the Faculty of Communication Arts.

73
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,411
Nice to meet you.

74
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,208
Let’s be friends.

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,758
Us, too. Let’s be friends.

76
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,066
Let’s get back to unpack our stuff. Make yourself at home.

77
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,213
Som, unpack your bag.

78
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:27,312
Hello, everyone.

79
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:29,897
Khao.

80
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:31,438
I’m Khao.

81
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:32,802
I’m a sophomore.

82
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:34,802
I’m the mentor of this dorm.

83
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,819
There are three important rules.

84
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,690
Firstly, the dorm opens at 5 am and is closed at 10 pm.

85
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,496
Secondly, non-residents are not allowed in the dorm.

86
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:49,758
If it’s important or necessary, you need to ask for permission first.

87
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:55,059
Thirdly, don’t make loud noises after 10 pm.

88
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:59,125
Other rules are in the handbook given to you.

89
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:00,568
Do you get it?

90
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:02,568
Yes.

91
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:04,139
Good.

92
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,140
If you break the rules, you can pack your bag and leave.

93
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,711
Som-O, do you understand?

94
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,641
Yes.

95
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,968
Can we get back to unpack our bag?

96
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:22,614
Sure.

97
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:30,937
You look downhearted.

98
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:33,130
That was a prank?

99
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:34,068
Khao.

100
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:42,254
Don’t cause any trouble. Get it?

101
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,955
What trouble will I cause?

102
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:50,816
Everyone, please take care of my friend.

103
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:52,694
Yes.

104
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,477
I got to go. I have so many things to do. I’ll see you.

105
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:00,897
Yes.

106
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:03,810
You’re so strict.

107
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:04,998
See you.

108
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:06,514
Bye.

109
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,746
- Hello, P’Som-O. - You don’t need to do that.

110
00:08:14,613 --> 00:08:15,801
We are all freshmen.

111
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:16,718
Put your hands down.

112
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:21,096
P’Som-O, are you a friend of P’Khao?

113
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:24,170
Yes, we were best friends in high school.

114
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:26,917
You don’t need to call me ‘Phi’.

115
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:28,413
We are all freshmen.

116
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:34,179
We are lucky that non-residents are allowed to come into the dorm.

117
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:39,080
Otherwise, I would be dead if I had to carry my stuff by myself.

118
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,632
That’s right.

119
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,782
Today, my big brother is free.

120
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,016
So I told him to help me move into the dorm.

121
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,872
Those who live next door have their boyfriends help with moving in.

122
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,118
I’m so jealous of them.

123
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,414
Finally.

124
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:55,220
I’m free from the all-girls school.

125
00:08:56,333 --> 00:09:01,148
I’ll live my life freely and find a boyfriend.

126
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:04,011
Talking about boyfriends,

127
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:08,789
P’Som-O, do you have a boyfriend to help you with moving in?

128
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:11,807
Do you have one?

129
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,432
No, I don’t have a boyfriend.

130
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,463
No.

131
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:16,922
You don’t have a boyfriend?

132
00:09:16,943 --> 00:09:18,517
But are you thinking about having one?

133
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,605
Nonsense.

134
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:23,924
Why are you feeling shy?

135
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:25,268
I’m not.

136
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:26,979
I’ll believe you.

137
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:31,336
I wish I had a boyfriend visiting me at the dorm.

138
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:32,211
Me, too.

139
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:35,254
I’m curious what the men’s dorm looks like.

140
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,081
Does it look the same as our dorm?

141
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:41,817
(So this is my chance to see Chadjen’s dorm.)

142
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,730
(Men’s dormitory)

143
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:52,020
Chadjen.

144
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:56,897
See you.

145
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:00,201
Let’s go in.

146
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:01,214
Huh?

147
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,511
Go in?

148
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:04,669
Let’s go to your room.

149
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:06,542
Why?

150
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:09,866
I want to see it.

151
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:11,782
No.

152
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:16,602
Today is the only day that I am allowed to go into the med student’s dorm.

153
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:17,982
Please.

154
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,139
It looks like the women’s dorm. There’s nothing to see.

155
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,262
It’s different.

156
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,420
I just want to see how you live in the college.

157
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:35,459
Please.

158
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,339
Chad.

159
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:40,903
Fine.

160
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:42,699
Yeah!

161
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:43,610
Let’s go.

162
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,457
This way.

163
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,013
Really?

164
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:48,626
Let’s go.

165
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,911
Wow, is this your room?

166
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,822
It looks clean.

167
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,451
Take your shoes off here.

168
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:04,508
Okay.

169
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:17,693
Hello.

170
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:20,920
My name is Som-O. I’m Chad’s best friend.

171
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:24,204
Hello, I’m Jo. I’m Chandjen’s roommate.

172
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,994
Please take care of Chadjen.

173
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,404
Huh?

174
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,783
Why do you say that to him?

175
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,657
Shh! Be quiet.

176
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:46,339
I’m sorry.

177
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,339
My room is messy.

178
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:56,927
Right, we have a freshmen party tonight.

179
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,810
Are you going?

180
00:11:58,472 --> 00:11:59,979
Let me check. I may go.

181
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,008
You should go. It will be fun.

182
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,702
Som-O, why don’t you come with us?

183
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:07,558
If you come with Chad, he won’t feel bored.

184
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,139
Really?

185
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:13,662
Can I come? I’m not a med student.

186
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,211
Of course.

187
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,912
Then I won’t go.

188
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:26,597
If you aren’t going, your juniors will feel bad.

189
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,733
You have missed many of our school’s events.

190
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,580
That’s right.

191
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,380
You should go to this one.

192
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:41,481
Chad, you should go. It’ll be fun.

193
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,460
Your friend is also going.

194
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,460
Let’s go with me.

195
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:51,915
I’ll go.

196
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:55,514
That’s it.

197
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:03,669
The towel…

198
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:06,014
Sorry. It’s mine.

199
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:16,976
You have to read all of these.

200
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:21,180
They are so thick.

201
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:32,376
What are you drawing?

202
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:36,475
It’s my assignment.

203
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:43,254
It looks nothing like the original.

204
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:46,973
They don’t need to look the same.

205
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,152
Let me draw it for you.

206
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,970
No, it’s okay.

207
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,811
Fine. Do whatever you want.

208
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,342
Don’t ask me to do it later.

209
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:26,205
Pan.

210
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:29,807
This is New, my boyfriend.

211
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,663
This is Pan, my roommate.

212
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:36,312
I finally introduced him to you.

213
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:39,506
Nice to meet you, Pan.

214
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:40,740
Nice to meet you.

215
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,054
I heard a lot about you.

216
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,308
Please make yourself comfortable.

217
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,835
Thank you.

218
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,315
What did you tell her about me?

219
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,168
Is this your desk?

220
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:51,837
It’s quite messy.

221
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:53,238
It’s okay.

222
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:05,256
I’ve had a crush on you for a while.

223
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:06,813
Can I have your number?

224
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:12,271
I sent a message to you. Don’t forget to answer me.

225
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,140
Mond.

226
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:17,019
Who is he?

227
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,629
I don’t know him.

228
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:22,022
I just put it with other stuff.

229
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:23,780
So I can throw it away at the same time.

230
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,118
If you were going to throw it away, you should have done it a long time ago.

231
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,478
Khao, you also have the girly side.

232
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:36,309
If the freshmen see this, they will no longer feel afraid of you.

233
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,536
I won’t be your third wheel.

234
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:39,327
Excuse me.

235
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,020
Come on.

236
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:54,174
New, stop being mad. Please, please, please.

237
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,517
It’s nothing, really.

238
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,777
Stop being mad. I’ll throw it away now.

239
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:01,080
Please.

240
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:19,814
Can’t you give me a light kiss?

241
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,872
You need to throw it away now.

242
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:24,139
I don’t want to see it.

243
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,013
Yes.

244
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:27,274
Are you jealous?

245
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:30,130
Yes.

246
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,555
Are we good?

247
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,111
Throw it away.

248
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,920
I’ll do it now.

249
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:03,108
Chadjen.

250
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:04,405
Hi.

251
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,370
This is Som-O. She’s Chadjen’s friend.

252
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:09,900
Hello, everyone.

253
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,893
Hello.

254
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:15,057
Som-O is from the Faculty of Fine Arts.

255
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:18,426
You’re an artist?

256
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:23,370
As an art student, you must have a lot of free time.

257
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,402
I’m not sure.

258
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:28,577
I shouldn’t have listened to my dad and chosen med school.

259
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:29,711
It’s so tiring.

260
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,711
This is just a pre-clinical year.

261
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:35,035
I don’t want to imagine how tiring clinical years will be.

262
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,900
How will the study groups for gross anatomy be selected?

263
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:39,657
I want to be in the same group as Chad.

264
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,204
Can you let me be in your group?

265
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:43,657
Have you ever asked me if I want to be in the same group as you?

266
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:48,127
Before thinking about being in Chad’s group, you should brace yourself for Prof. Prasert’s class.

267
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:50,296
I heard from our seniors that he uses 40 slides for a one-hour class.

268
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:51,712
We are doomed.

269
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:54,957
I went to the geek’s room the other day.

270
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:59,631
He talked in his sleep about the elbow joint’s bone, Humerus.

271
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:01,051
It was so funny.

272
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:02,402
He must have worked really hard.

273
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,905
He also did well in histology class.

274
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:12,220
Not only the geek, Chad has probably read the textbook about the thorax and abdomen in advance.

275
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,626
A little.

276
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:17,939
Are you bored?

277
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:22,017
A little.

278
00:18:25,878 --> 00:18:27,269
Shall we leave?

279
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:31,351
Your friends are still here.

280
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:34,705
Chad, how far have you read the textbook?

281
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,411
Thorax and abdomen?

282
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,305
I’m on Chapter 3.

283
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:42,900
What about you?

284
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,454
I’m on Chapter 1.

285
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:48,494
Are you sure? You haven’t started reading, have you?

286
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,016
I have started.

287
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,508
I’m going to bed now.

288
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,120
I’m so tired from going back home.

289
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,465
(Sure. Good night.)

290
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:03,115
Good night.

291
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:15,620
I recommend that he receive surgery.

292
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,094
It’s the best option right now to regulate his heart rate.

293
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,352
How dangerous is the surgery?

294
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:31,339
To be honest, the mortality rate is 50/50.

295
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:37,254
If the surgery is successful, I guarantee that he will have a long life.

296
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:45,422
A long life…

297
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:48,469
How long am I going to live?

298
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:51,069
You will live until you get old.

299
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:02,019
I’ll do it.

300
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:07,200
I want to live for a long time.

301
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:13,699
I don’t want to keep worrying about when I will die anymore.

302
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:19,063
Are you sure?

303
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:22,906
Yes.

304
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,339
If he’s sure about this, I’ll support him.

305
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:54,336
Hey, Tan.

306
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:56,690
Come here.

307
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,850
Mudmi, have a seat.

308
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:00,804
Thank you.

309
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:02,792
Sorry. The traffic is jammed.

310
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,745
You are always late.

311
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:08,656
Chad.

312
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:10,497
Who is this?

313
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,905
She’s Chad’s friend. Her name is Som-O.

314
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:18,511
Hello, Som-O. I’m Tan.

315
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:20,546
Hi.

316
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,840
Chad.

317
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:26,460
Your friend is so cute.

318
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:30,699
Yeah.

319
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:42,739
Oh, I brought my peer mentee with me.

320
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,059
Her name is Mudmi.

321
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:45,702
She’s been your admirer for some time.

322
00:21:47,435 --> 00:21:48,512
Why don’t you talk to her?

323
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:52,980
What? Another Chad’s admirer?

324
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:55,480
Talk to her.

325
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,706
Hello.

326
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:02,952
Hello, Chadjen. I’m Mudmi.

327
00:22:03,074 --> 00:22:04,782
I’m Tan’s peer mentee.

328
00:22:08,431 --> 00:22:10,872
Chad is making the girl feel shy.

329
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,408
She’s fidgeting.

330
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:22,219
Nice to meet you, Chadjen.

331
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,066
Nice to meet you.

332
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:27,822
Look.

333
00:22:28,537 --> 00:22:29,574
Can’t you sit still?

334
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:39,213
What?

335
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:43,608
Help me.

336
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,376
It’s okay. I’m not hungry.

337
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:51,579
Help me.

338
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:53,120
How?

339
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,758
Ouch! My stomach hurts.

340
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:16,580
It’s so painful.

341
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:18,817
My head also hurts.

342
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:21,034
I think I’m having food poisoning.

343
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:22,663
Ouch!

344
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:24,085
You are burning up.

345
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:25,594
Som-O, are you alright?

346
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:27,008
Som, are you allergic to any food?

347
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:28,183
I’m not sure.

348
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,324
I want to go home.

349
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,540
It’s coming up.

350
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:32,428
Som.

351
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:34,918
I’m taking her home.

352
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:35,922
See you.

353
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:43,004
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

354
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:44,367
It hurts so bad.

355
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:45,902
Ouch.

356
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:47,497
Ouch, ouch.

357
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:51,837
You’re doing this to help me?

358
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:53,802
Of course.

359
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,980
How is my acting?

360
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:02,808
It’s better than hearing your friends teasing you.

361
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:09,044
Anyway, is Mudmi your type?

362
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:19,229
Good.

363
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:21,888
She’s just a kid. She should focus on her study.

364
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,888
You should tell yourself that.

365
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:29,200
Whatever.

366
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:39,613
Today is strangely fun.

367
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,431
What? Didn’t you say you were bored?

368
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:46,102
It was awkward at the time.

369
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:50,637
Now, I know what your circle looks like.

370
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:52,964
How is it?

371
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:57,604
I have no clue what you guys were talking about.

372
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:02,416
What? Joint what? Joint…

373
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:03,979
Elbow joint.

374
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:06,767
Right, elbow joint.

375
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,262
I’m not sure what language it is.

376
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,317
How can you hang out with them?

377
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,162
I’m used to it.

378
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:31,480
Anyway, thank you for helping me with my study until I got into college.

379
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:33,739
Yes.

380
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,783
If you have anything I can help, let me know.

381
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:45,216
Like you did earlier?

382
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:49,902
Didn’t I help you get out?

383
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:54,709
Som.

384
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:57,585
What?

385
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,205
Can you help me with drawing?

386
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:04,794
What drawing?

387
00:26:05,703 --> 00:26:08,805
It’s my assignment about the human body.

388
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,180
Didn’t you tell me earlier that you didn’t need my help?

389
00:26:17,882 --> 00:26:21,423
If you have anything I can help, let me know.

390
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:23,237
Didn’t you say that?

391
00:26:26,924 --> 00:26:29,041
Are you making fun of me?

392
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,275
Chad.

393
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:32,645
Som-O.

394
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:36,820
Khao.

395
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,321
It’s almost 10 pm. Why don’t you go into the dorm?

396
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,437
I’m about to go in.

397
00:26:48,262 --> 00:26:50,257
Are you becoming a non-conformist?

398
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:52,140
What are you saying?

399
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:53,191
Are you crazy?

400
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,641
Let’s go.

401
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:57,117
Som.

402
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,197
Huh? No, I’m not saying anything.

403
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:03,607
My bag.

404
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,405
You could have walked to give it to me.

405
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:15,080
Let’s go.

406
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:52,214
That’s amazing.

407
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:54,214
It looks incredible, Som.

408
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,602
You’re definitely going to get an A for it.

409
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:57,762
That’s right.

410
00:29:03,254 --> 00:29:04,989
(I guess I am a prodigy.)

411
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:06,817
(Last night, I also got compliments from my roommates.)

412
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,607
(I got compliments again today.)

413
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:12,367
(Dad and Mom will be proud of me.)

414
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,789
Everyone.

415
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,520
Today, every freshman needs to attend the hazing.

416
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:26,808
Everyone has to attend.

417
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:32,551
You.

418
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:34,465
Did you hear me?

419
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:36,271
Som-O.

420
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,210
Som-O.

421
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:37,767
Huh?

422
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:38,828
What?

423
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:44,136
All freshmen need to attend the hazing.

424
00:29:44,337 --> 00:29:45,361
All freshmen?

425
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,711
She said we all have to do it.

426
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:51,345
Okay, okay.

427
00:29:52,265 --> 00:29:53,136
I’ll go.

428
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:02,194
What’s your name?

429
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:05,069
Som. I’m Som-O.

430
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:09,805
Your drawing looks great.

431
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,768
Thanks.

432
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:15,911
My old shirt is torn.

433
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:22,983
If you are all here, then line up.

434
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:24,539
Hurry up.

435
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:28,352
Line up nicely.

436
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:33,302
I told you to come here quickly. Why did you take so long?

437
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:35,302
Do you want to do deep squats?

438
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,509
Why does he have to be so strict?

439
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,128
Quiet.

440
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:46,820
I’m here to inform you that you need to wear a name tag while you are in classes.

441
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:47,823
Do you get it?

442
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:49,897
Do you get it?

443
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:52,291
Do you get it?!

444
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:53,768
Yes.

445
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:54,617
Louder.

446
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,826
- Yes. - Louder.

447
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,013
Yes.

448
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,491
Say it at the same time.

449
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:03,540
Yes.

450
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:06,703
Hey.

451
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:10,216
You.

452
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,019
What’s your problem?

453
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:15,306
No…nothing.

454
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,256
Just say it. Don’t murmur.

455
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:23,305
Shout your name out so your friends can hear it.

456
00:31:24,238 --> 00:31:24,782
Now!

457
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,306
Hurry up.

458
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,112
My name is Som-O.

459
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:34,223
What did you say?

460
00:31:34,697 --> 00:31:35,810
My name is Som-O.

461
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:38,318
Did you hear her name?

462
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,720
My name is Som-O.

463
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:42,217
I can’t hear it. Say it louder.

464
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:43,608
Is that all you can do?

465
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:45,542
My name is Som-O.

466
00:31:46,022 --> 00:31:47,296
My name is Som-O.

467
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,219
Louder.

468
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:50,774
My name is Som-O.

469
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,774
My name is Som-O.

470
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,011
Are you sure about the surgery?

471
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:00,263
Yes.

472
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:05,234
I’m really scared, Chadjen.

473
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:16,511
Did you tell Khao about it?

474
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:18,591
No.

475
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:24,019
Actually, I’m not going to tell her.

476
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:26,306
I don’t want her to worry about me.

477
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:32,706
The last time I was hospitalized, she went through a lot because of me.

478
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:35,882
I don’t want to be a burden to her again.

479
00:32:37,877 --> 00:32:40,774
If you don’t tell her, she will be mad at you.

480
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:43,118
You think so?

481
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:51,010
But I made up my mind.

482
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:58,965
Okay.

483
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:02,691
If there’s anything I can help, let me know.

484
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:05,657
Thank you.

485
00:33:23,973 --> 00:33:24,961
Chad.

486
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:31,979
How is Som-O doing?

487
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:35,417
What do you mean?

488
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:38,111
She had a stomach ache last evening.

489
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:39,155
How is she?

490
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:49,976
Don’t tell me that you asked her to pretend to be sick?

491
00:33:50,685 --> 00:33:51,518
Yes.

492
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:52,958
Is it because of Mudmi?

493
00:33:58,468 --> 00:34:00,099
You don’t like her?

494
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:09,509
Listen to me. If you don’t like her, just tell her.

495
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:15,711
There are many ways to tell her that you don’t like her.

496
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:18,183
So she won’t waste her time on you.

497
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:21,610
I don’t like her.

498
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,605
Fine. If you don’t like her, then tell her.

499
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:27,099
Don’t tell me.

500
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,202
I thought Som was sick.

501
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:39,871
If she pretends to be sick, she can get into trouble.

502
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:43,380
I heard that her faculty’s hazing is tough.

503
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:03,521
(How is your hazing today?)

504
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:35,786
I’m late.

505
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,525
I’m late.

506
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:37,616
I’m late.

507
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:56,429
I’m late.

508
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,179
Is there anything for me to eat?

509
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:06,408
Eat slowly.

510
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:09,819
I have to hurry because I have a class at 8.30 am.

511
00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:13,016
But it’s already 8.30.

512
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:14,659
But I am hungry.

513
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:16,404
I don’t want to have stomach ache during the class.

514
00:36:25,943 --> 00:36:27,819
You don’t have to hurry anymore?

515
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,002
No, I got the time wrong.

516
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:32,779
My class starts at 9.30.

517
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:37,945
Som-O, this is so you.

518
00:36:39,654 --> 00:36:42,417
Right. I was gulping it down. Now, I get a stomach ache.

519
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:44,939
How was your hazing yesterday?

520
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:47,413
I was almost in trouble.

521
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:50,168
It was just the first day.

522
00:36:51,998 --> 00:36:54,297
It was so tiring.

523
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,915
I was so clumsy and became a burden to my classmates.

524
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:04,056
I don’t think it was that bad.

525
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:06,057
Don’t stress about it.

526
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,880
I was punished by the seniors.

527
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:10,979
My name is Som-O.

528
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:11,902
My name is Som-O.

529
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:12,903
My name is Som-O.

530
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:15,761
My throat.

531
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:18,897
Do you want me to deal with them?

532
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:22,548
It’s okay. Things are already bad right now.

533
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,602
If you can’t handle it, you need to tell me right away. Okay?

534
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:27,728
Yes.

535
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:31,604
Whose girlfriend is this? You’re so cool.

536
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:55,503
Khao, you are pretty and cool.

537
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:05,520
Will you marry me?

538
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:19,502
How could you joke about a proposal?

539
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,669
New, you are in trouble.

540
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:28,813
Khao.

541
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,207
Khao, wait for me.

542
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,404
Why did you get yourself in trouble?

543
00:38:41,638 --> 00:38:42,914
This is for the best.

544
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,402
You haven’t talked to her?

545
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:51,619
I’ll get the surgery while Khao is still mad at me.

546
00:38:52,262 --> 00:38:54,170
So she won’t suspect when I am away.

547
00:38:58,807 --> 00:38:59,761
Are you sure?

548
00:39:01,788 --> 00:39:02,402
Yes.

549
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,613
My surgery should be completed when Khao stops being mad at me.

550
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,911
What if your surgery fails?

551
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:15,315
What if you die?

552
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,668
You won’t get to say goodbye to Khao.

553
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,717
You should reconsider.

554
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:45,312
Read mine.

555
00:39:49,308 --> 00:39:51,816
It means you’re firm, loyal,

556
00:39:53,014 --> 00:39:54,182
and you love someone with all your heart.

557
00:39:59,034 --> 00:39:59,675
New.

558
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:19,542
I hope you get well soon.

559
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,197
So you will…be happy.

560
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:26,106
You know why I did that, right?

561
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,268
Because you’re really worried about me.

562
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,031
I get it now.

563
00:40:32,017 --> 00:40:33,112
I love you, Khao.

564
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:37,106
I love you very much.

565
00:40:46,552 --> 00:40:47,712
What about Som-O?

566
00:40:53,198 --> 00:40:54,530
I talked to Khao.

567
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,213
How was it?

568
00:40:57,853 --> 00:40:59,400
She’s still mad at New.

569
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:01,314
I don’t know what to do.

570
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:05,311
This is actually between them.

571
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:06,860
Let’s forget about it.

572
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,521
Aren’t going to attend the hazing?

573
00:41:14,798 --> 00:41:16,173
No, I don’t want to do it.

574
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:19,020
You already don’t want to do it?

575
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,152
I just don’t want to.

576
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:23,471
Stop talking about it.

577
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:24,715
Right.

578
00:41:28,797 --> 00:41:30,340
This is for you.

579
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:51,908
Thank you.

580
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:55,371
How is it? Does it look good?

581
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:03,348
These muscles were really hard to draw.

582
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,004
I spent two hours to draw them.

583
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:06,946
The muscles on the shoulder were not hard.

584
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,722
I just added shading to it.

585
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:11,903
I’m pretty good at this, right?

586
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,179
(This kind of moment, it happens again.)

587
00:42:51,882 --> 00:42:53,020
Are you taking me to the hazing?

588
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:54,189
Yes.

589
00:42:54,277 --> 00:42:55,450
That’s nonsense, Im.

590
00:42:56,536 --> 00:42:58,420
Someone is sabotaging our faculty.

591
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,715
Our precious banner is destroyed.

592
00:43:02,072 --> 00:43:02,851
Who did this?

593
00:43:03,087 --> 00:43:03,801
You?

594
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:05,801
Wake up, please.

595
00:43:06,062 --> 00:43:08,342
Actually, I want to see you, Khao.

596
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:11,100
Do you have time to have dinner with me?

597
00:43:11,234 --> 00:43:12,014
Khao.

598
00:43:12,918 --> 00:43:14,017
I have something to tell you.

599
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:16,211
I like you.

600
00:43:19,254 --> 00:43:21,980
Som-O, this medal is for you.

601
00:43:24,085 --> 00:43:24,884
Chadjen.

602
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,057
Chad.

603
00:43:27,094 --> 00:43:28,226
What’s wrong?

604
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:30,029
Is it because of what Tao said?

605
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:33,308
Take it, Som.

606
00:43:34,402 --> 00:43:35,534
This is my way to repay you.

607
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,522
If I didn’t have you, I would not have this strong determination to win.

608
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:44,219
You are being extra.
