1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,710
You two are tied.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,050
Next time, I won’t let it end in a tie.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:06,740
Tao.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,900
You have no other choice but to win.

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,590
Tao, you can do it!

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,650
Every time you come to cheer me, let’s exchange my medal for your banner.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,300
I want to see you have a bright future.

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,780
A better future than staying here.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,170
I already prepared the document for you to go to France.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
All you need to do is sign it.

11
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,370
You should have asked me first.

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,900
Are you really going to live in France, Chad?

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

14
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,470
(My life in high school is falling into place.)

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,360
(I’ve got friends I’m comfortable with.)

16
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,000
(We’ve played around quite a bit together.)

17
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,290
(But to imagine,)

18
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,420
(that while we’re having the time of our lives,)

19
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,100
(someone could just go away.)

20
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,310
Whoa.

21
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,300
They must think they’re so cool.

22
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,550
Look at them.

23
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,570
I think they look okay.

24
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,000
What will the principal make us do this time?

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
We’ve been here only a semester,

26
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,710
and we’ve already done everything.

27
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,320
“100-meter dash to win prizes.”

28
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,260
I think that’s interesting.

29
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,160
You’re too easily swayed.

30
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,510
Som.

31
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,900
Som.

32
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,530
Som-O!

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,540
What? Yeah?

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,880
What’s wrong?

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,920
You’re so quiet today.

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,960
Are you unwell?

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,220
Got a headache?

38
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,320
Got a fever?

39
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,580
Have you?

40
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,310
Does your stomach hurt?

41
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,310
Stop it.

42
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,110
Here’s the thing.

43
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,260
A friend of a friend of mine…

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,440
This is about a friend of a friend of mine, alright? Not mine.

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,580
Mhmm.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,850
This person has a really good friend they have known since childhood.

47
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,200
And that good friend is moving abroad.

48
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,310
So they don’t know what to give them.

49
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,500
Has your friend tried stopping them from leaving?

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,470
Like, “Please don’t go!”

51
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,770
How could they just do that?

52
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,770
Then… maybe tell your friend to give them something like a memento?

53
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,950
Things that, even if 10 years have passed,

54
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,460
this item will still remind them of your friend.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,660
It’s 2011, you know?

56
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,000
Why don’t you tell your friend to stay in contact via Skype, email, or Facebook?

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,060
You can still talk despite the distance.

58
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,000
I know that much, Mr. Sassawat.

59
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,560
But imagine seeing this person every day

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,500
and suddenly they’re just gone…

61
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,810
Does anything really make up for that?

62
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,610
Whose story is this about?

63
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,900
A friend of mine.

64
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,050
Which one?

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,910
The one in my neighborhood.

66
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,910
Alright, quiet down, guys.

67
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,570
Listen up.

68
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,300
The Principal has a surprise for you today.

69
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,520
Please welcome him.

70
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,060
We strive for academics.

71
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,620
We play when we have to.

72
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,010
We excel at sports.

73
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,760
To reflect our nation’s policy,

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,250
our school will encourage each student to have at least one athletic ability.

75
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,060
We’ll start with setting up a 100-meter dash competition in every grade,

76
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,850
which will begin with Grade 10.

77
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,430
I’ve got one more surprise for you all.

78
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,710
That is…

79
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,220
Our newest mascot of this semester!

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,360
Who do you think is under this suit?

81
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,060
Take your time.

82
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,470
No idea.

83
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,220
Well, then, I’m going to tell you.

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,340
Please.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,490
It’s Chadjen!

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,240
Chadjen is an exemplary student in this regard.

87
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,880
Not only is he our school’s rising star as a swimmer,

88
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,910
his academics is also very impressive.

89
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,490
Am I right?

90
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,540
Give your friend a round of applause.

91
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,250
I’ll give you another surprise.

92
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,110
Put the head back on and twirl, Chadjen.

93
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,180
I gotta keep my eyes on this.

94
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,590
Go on! Go on! Go on!

95
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,500
Go on! Go on! Go on!

96
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,080
Go on! Go on! Go on!

97
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,960
Dance!

98
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,760
Dance!

99
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,190
Dance!

100
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,380
Oh, he’s dancing.

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,790
Dance! Dance! Dance!

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
Dance! Dance! Dance!

103
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,700
Dance! Dance! Dance!

104
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,790
Guys.

105
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,620
Does anyone want to participate in this competition?

106
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:44,010
Som-O, do any of your friends want to try it?

107
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,900
Ask the next one, please.

108
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,200
There are two athletes among your friends.

109
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,700
I thought you’d be eager to participate.

110
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,200
Why would I when I’m already doing sports every day, you dummy?

111
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,690
I don’t know if I should tell you.

112
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,730
But Ms. Oh said the winner gets a 1500-baht prize.

113
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,700
Ms. Oh asked me not to tell anyone

114
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,100
because the Principal wanted to keep it a surprise.

115
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,310
But now that you guys know, don’t tell anyone.

116
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,010
Got it?

117
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,600
Yes, ma’am.

118
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,290
(A memento?)

119
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,700
Then… maybe tell your friend to give them something like a memento?

120
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,900
Things that, even if 10 years have passed,

121
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,400
this item will still remind them of your friend.

122
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,870
(Right!)

123
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,410
(I need to give him something to remind him of me!)

124
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,020
- I’ll do it! - I’ll do it!

125
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,820
From this moment on,

126
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,000
Ms. Gewalin and Ms. Kwanta

127
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,500
are now officially rivals until we know the result of this competition.

128
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,600
Come on. We wouldn’t know who to root for.

129
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,660
You don’t have to know that.

130
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,130
Just cheer for anyone who wins at the end.

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,900
Won't you say something?

132
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,660
Som.

133
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,080
I think you should give up now.

134
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,140
With your short legs, you won’t ever win against Khao.

135
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,610
Chad!

136
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,130
You…

137
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,000
Just keep your eyes on me as I win this thing.

138
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,000
Don’t forget to sign up your name for the competition.

139
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,050
I’ll put it here.

140
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,880
This doesn’t feel very safe.

141
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:06,980
You go ahead and sign it.

142
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,900
I can wait.

143
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,200
Here you go.

144
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,210
Drink a lot.

145
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,080
I’ve already got mine.

146
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,570
Mom packed this for me and Chad every morning.

147
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,910
I see.

148
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,410
It’s alright.

149
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,650
I’ll drink all of this.

150
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,110
You okay?

151
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,380
What are you laughing at?

152
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,470
It’s good, you know?

153
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,290
It’s good for your body, too, Tao.

154
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,500
You need to eat more, too, Khao.

155
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,530
Don’t lose out against Som-O and Tao.

156
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,970
Aren’t you all fit for the game?

157
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,650
Nobody wants to lose to you all the time, Chadjen.

158
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,740
Som, let’s stretch.

159
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,770
I’ll help you out.

160
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,460
One, two, three.

161
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,100
Oh, you’re stiff.

162
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,970
Let’s do it.

163
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,510
You can do it.

164
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,750
Just a little more, Som.

165
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,340
Tao.

166
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,030
Just a bit.

167
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,850
You can do it.

168
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,420
Go for it.

169
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,610
- I can’t! - Just a little.

170
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,290
My legs.

171
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,180
Tao!

172
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,900
One more time!

173
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,220
Are you hurt?

174
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,510
I guess I was just too stiff.

175
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,780
- You can do it. - You need to stretch more.

176
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,300
You can do it, Khao.

177
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,850
Shake it off like this.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,760
You’ll definitely win.

179
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,500
What?

180
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,470
What did you just say, nerd?

181
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,800
Guys…

182
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,800
Chadjen is going home.

183
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Where are you rushing off to?

184
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,310
Stay.

185
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,710
I have to see my mother.

186
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,310
She needs to talk to me.

187
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,560
- Let’s do it again, Som. - One, two, three.

188
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,320
One more time.

189
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,660
There won’t be a problem with his academics.

190
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,110
He’s always been a top student.

191
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,750
I’m more concerned about moving mid-school year.

192
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,970
That’s why I called to talk to you.

193
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,150
(There’s nothing to worry about at all.)

194
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,720
(We’ll take care of the document for you.)

195
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,380
Oh, Chad.

196
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,350
Hello.

197
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,820
Chad.

198
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:57,920
Chad.

199
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,690
At least come talk to me before you go.

200
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:09,860
We’ll be learning about present perfect continuous tense today.

201
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,010
Turn to Page 30.

202
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,300
Jot down what’s written on the board.

203
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,420
What are you writing?

204
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,310
Leave me alone, nerd.

205
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,210
Focus on the lesson.

206
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,320
Or else we both won’t have any notes to review.

207
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,470
Let me see.

208
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,820
Fine. I won’t let you copy my notes at all.

209
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,750
But I wouldn’t pass my class otherwise.

210
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,750
Are you guys done?

211
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,520
No, ma’am.

212
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Leave me alone, will ya?

213
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,870
Focus on the class.

214
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,930
- Can’t you show me even a little bit? - No!

215
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,020
It’s a secret.

216
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,300
This might be just a practice.

217
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,500
But I won’t go easy on you.

218
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,940
Why don’t you take three steps ahead of me?

219
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,700
I’ll win anyway.

220
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
You two.

221
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,230
Remember this.

222
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,790
Take a deep breath in and count one, two, three.

223
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,700
Breathe out and count one, two.

224
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,410
Fist your hands loosely.

225
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,010
Look forward when you run.

226
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,210
Don’t look down.

227
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,590
Don’t hold any tension in your shoulders.

228
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,410
Okay?

229
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,680
Alright, we’re ready, Referee Nerd.

230
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,580
Athletes, get in your position.

231
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,300
Get ready.

232
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,070
Get set.

233
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,650
Go, Som, go.

234
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,700
Khao, do your best.

235
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,450
Faster, Som!

236
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,460
Khao, you can do it.

237
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,520
Run, Som.

238
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,620
Khao, do your best.

239
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,670
Khao, do your best.

240
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,700
Khao, do your best.

241
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,140
Khao, do your best.

242
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,500
Nerd, quick.

243
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,340
Are you altright?

244
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,500
- I am. - Khao.

245
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,160
Are you alright, Som?

246
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,230
- How are you feeling, Khao? - Are you hurt?

247
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,910
Are you in pain?

248
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,610
Can you move?

249
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,300
Is it your arm?

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,770
Can you move?

251
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,900
Don’t move so much just yet.

252
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,340
How is Khao?

253
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,600
Khao, you okay?

254
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,920
Nerd, take her to the infirmary.

255
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,580
Alright.

256
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,210
Let me help.

257
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,610
Excuse me.

258
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,930
Don’t move your arm.

259
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,010
Put it here.

260
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,700
You nerd, come on.

261
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,300
I’m not that heavy.

262
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,070
Sorry.

263
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,810
Let’s just go with this.

264
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,810
Let me help.

265
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,400
One, two, three, up.

266
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,860
You alright, Khao?

267
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,210
Careful.

268
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,760
I was running and then my ankle just twisted.

269
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,370
Is my friend okay?

270
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,210
Does this hurt?

271
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,510
Mhog, take off her socks.

272
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,460
Yes, ma’am.

273
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,100
Don’t worry.

274
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,120
Sorry.

275
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,760
It’s alright.

276
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,470
Does it hurt?

277
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,410
A little.

278
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,500
I guess it still hurts.

279
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,490
Are you okay now?

280
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,760
I am.

281
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,890
That won’t hurt me.

282
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,810
Who is he?

283
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,610
His name is Mhog.

284
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,310
I’m helping out at the nursing room.

285
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,770
I’m Som-O.

286
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,930
This is Khao.

287
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,800
Why did you volunteer for this, though?

288
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,320
It doesn’t even look like fun.

289
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,750
I love science.

290
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,600
And I want to be a doctor.

291
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,180
So this is perfect for me.

292
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,100
You like science?

293
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,210
Do you like it, too?

294
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,690
This girl was born with the periodic table.

295
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,220
Oh, that’s great.

296
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,330
Science is in everything around us.

297
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,200
If you’re a curious person, it’s even more fun that way.

298
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,850
All done.

299
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,380
Try not to play around so much for a bit.

300
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,110
Keep an eye on your friend, alright?

301
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,580
Of course.

302
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,710
Alright, try getting up.

303
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,750
- One, two, three. - You alright?

304
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,420
Up.

305
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,940
Careful.

306
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,760
Be careful.

307
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,000
Take it slow.

308
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,000
You’re a bit over the top, you know?

309
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,260
It’s just a scratch. You didn’t need to give me a ride home.

310
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,810
It is not over the top at all.

311
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,620
New even asked his chauffeur to drive Khao home.

312
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,310
Of course I had to give you a ride.

313
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,500
Fine.

314
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,130
I’m going, then.

315
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,400
Bye.

316
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,350
Bye-bye.

317
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,610
Is that right?

318
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,000
I bet it’s very expensive over there.

319
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,090
Oh, it is.

320
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,730
I honestly just avoid it altogether.

321
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,460
Hello, Mom.

322
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,620
Hello, Aunt Aunya.

323
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,620
Who gave you a ride home?

324
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,400
Chad came home earlier.

325
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,810
And I happened to fall down while running.

326
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,210
So Tao gave me a ride home.

327
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,400
He’s a friend in the same group.

328
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,730
He’s a swimmer, too.

329
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,730
Oh, I remember him.

330
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,230
Are you alright, though?

331
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,740
Of course.

332
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,090
I’ll be as good as new after a rest.

333
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,900
Go clean up.

334
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,500
I have to catch up with Aunt Aun here.

335
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,970
I’m off, then.

336
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
- Good day. - Get well soon, dear.

337
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,700
Thank you.

338
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,730
But are you sure it is alright to just move Chad abroad all of a sudden now?

339
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,310
I don’t think there’s anything to worry about.

340
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,310
The only problem now is Chad.

341
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,020
He’s mad at me right now for that.

342
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,100
But I’ve got everything prepared for him.

343
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,010
My husband’s family is waiting there with an open arm.

344
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,120
They just want my son to come live with me.

345
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,410
This comes as a shock for me as well.

346
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,100
I’ve come to adore Chad like he’s my own son over the years.

347
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,870
Chad is really lucky to have that.

348
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,730
Thank you so much for everything, Fon.

349
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,510
It’s been my pleasure.

350
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,010
Thank you, truly.

351
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,670
Of course.

352
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,340
(Tao: Did you apply some ointment yet?)

353
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:15,690
(Don’t sleep on your side tonight. It might hurt your arm.)

354
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,730
Hello?

355
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,420
You’ve been coming home early for a while now.

356
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,710
Is something the matter?

357
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,210
It’s nothing.

358
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,120
Well, I—

359
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,610
I’ll keep you up to date on what happened this evening.

360
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,810
I won against Khao at our practice match.

361
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,360
But Khao sprained her ankle.

362
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,190
I think she won’t be able to compete at the actual match.

363
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,610
You fell down, too, didn’t you?

364
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,900
Are you alright?

365
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,310
Just got a scratch on my elbow.

366
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,310
But the school nurse gave me some ointment to apply.

367
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,130
Chadjen, won’t you help me a little?

368
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,130
Runners take care of themselves.

369
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,970
Oh?

370
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,960
But even Tao gives me so much advice.

371
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,490
“Som, do this. Som, be careful with that.”

372
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,330
Anything else?

373
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,010
No. Nothing more.

374
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,150
(Let me know once you pick the school you like.)

375
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,210
(I’ll ask the agency to prepare your document.)

376
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,930
(I won’t probably stay the night when I come over.)

377
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,300
I’ll be happy enough that you’re here, Dad.

378
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,800
(Send me an email once you know what you want.)

379
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,100
Of course.

380
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,890
(Alright, I have to go for now.)

381
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,320
(I have a meeting to get to.)

382
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,310
Okay, Dad.

383
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,020
Bye-bye.

384
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,290
(New: How’s your leg?)

385
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,740
(Khao: Better. It doesn’t really hurt anymore.)

386
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,450
(But I guess I really can’t run the race anymore.)

387
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,290
(New: You want to compete that badly?)

388
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,330
(Khao: I do. I want that prize.)

389
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,370
(New: It’s just 1500 baht. You can save up that much.)

390
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,810
(Khao: Okay, rich boy.)

391
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,610
(New: Oh.)

392
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,590
(Khao: I want to buy something for my Dad.)

393
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,980
(He’s coming back from abroad.)

394
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,290
(I won’t save up enough money in time.)

395
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,800
Som-O.

396
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,400
What’s with that face so early in the morning?

397
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,400
I feel bad for Khao that she can’t compete now that she’s injured.

398
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,860
Do you know how much the prize money means to Khao?

399
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,700
Why are you telling me?

400
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,500
You want me to give her the prize?

401
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,010
She really wanted that prize.

402
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,900
She wanted to use that money to buy something for her father

403
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,900
who’s coming back from abroad.

404
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,600
Why didn’t you just start with that?

405
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,200
If you win, will you please give the prize to Khao?

406
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,000
Why are you bowing?

407
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,000
Stop it. Stop.

408
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,940
Som-O.

409
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,100
If it’s not you, I don’t know who else would be able to help her.

410
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,130
Please, Som-O.

411
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,980
Please.

412
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,520
New, stop it. Stop.

413
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,370
Get up.

414
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,120
Get up.

415
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,000
New.

416
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,600
How do you think Khao would feel if she found out about this?

417
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,310
If you don’t tell her, she won’t ever find out.

418
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,070
It’s better, but you still shouldn’t compete.

419
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,450
But this is really important to me.

420
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,750
I know it is.

421
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,670
But your ankle is just as important.

422
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,460
Alright.

423
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,000
Are you in the science department?

424
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,900
I am.

425
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,760
I guess we’ll see each other again.

426
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,950
You should sign up for our Science Camp when it happens.

427
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,100
I always tutor the younger students at the camp.

428
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:55,980
Alright.

429
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,700
Mhog…

430
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,760
I really can’t run?

431
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,900
If you don’t believe me, ask the nurse when she’s here.

432
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,650
I believe you.

433
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,580
Thank you.

434
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,100
Here. I bought some for you in case you’re hungry.

435
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,900
I’ll let you get ahead of me this time, Som.

436
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,700
I just saw Mhog, and he insists I shouldn’t compete.

437
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,370
But you have to win, alright?

438
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,700
So you can buy your friend that gift.

439
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,700
You… You know that was—

440
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,000
Well, you asked me.

441
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,220
Everyone can tell it was about you.

442
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,000
(Busted.)

443
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,010
Maybe we can still compete without the use of our legs.

444
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,870
Blowing rubber band game? It’s fair.

445
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,800
Since when was that a sport, you dummy?

446
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,900
It is.

447
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,740
Som.

448
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,620
You need to promise me you will do your best and win.

449
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,020
Yeah.

450
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,240
I will.

451
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,810
Let’s eat.

452
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,960
Come on. Let me help.

453
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,900
Ow, ow, careful!

454
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,440
Chadjen.

455
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,540
Oh, New.

456
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,770
I need a favor.

457
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,200
Khao can’t run the race anymore.

458
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,900
But the prize really matters to her.

459
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,610
Can you help her?

460
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,090
You want me to compete in the 100-meter dash female category?

461
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,810
Of course not.

462
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,890
I mean, can you please help Som-O train?

463
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,850
I know Som-O can win with good training.

464
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,940
Please.

465
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,710
Som-O is the only hope.

466
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,400
Khao would be so happy if Som-O won.

467
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,820
As for the prize… I’ll beg Som-O for it.

468
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,900
I’ll think about it.

469
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,090
Alright.

470
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,400
What?

471
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,170
I heard that.

472
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,160
Do you think I should give Khao the prize?

473
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,170
Don’t burden yourself with that thought.

474
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,410
You won’t win anyway.

475
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:08,444
Let’s go, Som.

476
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:09,096
Alright.

477
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:10,662
I’ll time you.

478
00:28:12,075 --> 00:28:12,730
Okay?

479
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:13,687
Okay.

480
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:15,309
Do your best.

481
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,622
You can do it.

482
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:19,928
You ready yet?

483
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,303
Your form is incorrect.

484
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:29,506
What should I do?

485
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:32,222
Do this.

486
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,429
Look ahead.

487
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:37,505
Don’t think about anything else.

488
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,482
Just blow it when you’re ready.

489
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:45,823
Okay.

490
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:54,924
He means the whistle.

491
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:56,588
I was just kidding.

492
00:28:57,722 --> 00:28:58,437
Oh, New.

493
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,306
Alright?

494
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:00,659
Get ready.

495
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:02,019
Get set.

496
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,942
Hey, wait for me!

497
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:09,968
Som-O!

498
00:29:09,977 --> 00:29:10,800
You alright?

499
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:13,622
I am.

500
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:23,801
You need to control your breathing better.

501
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,208
Keep your body balanced.

502
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,915
You need to learn how to keep your balance when you sprint.

503
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,656
And just run at your fastest speed.

504
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,970
Run at my fastest speed?

505
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:35,805
Can I really compete with people with longer legs?

506
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,869
Running is all about speed, not the length of your legs.

507
00:29:40,518 --> 00:29:44,512
If you can run as fast as you can, you have a chance at winning those long-leggers.

508
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:47,515
Alright.

509
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:48,471
Okay.

510
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:51,287
Som—

511
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:51,917
Stop it.

512
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:53,623
I’ll do it myself.

513
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,327
Thanks.

514
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,768
How do I run at my fastest speed?

515
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:38,219
Think of something that makes you so angry.

516
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:40,331
Extremely angry.

517
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:43,413
Something that makes me angry?

518
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,351
It’s all about you.

519
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,219
What are you talking about?

520
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,008
Don’t you remember that time you got so angry at that dog?

521
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:57,905
The one that stole your meatballs.

522
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,074
You chased after him so fast that he let go of your meatballs.

523
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:05,777
Was I ever that angry?

524
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:08,256
You remember that?

525
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:09,942
What a silly thing to remember.

526
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,044
Now use that and run at your fastest speed.

527
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,691
Alright.

528
00:31:16,782 --> 00:31:17,665
I won’t know if I don’t try.

529
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,115
Let’s do it.

530
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:26,697
Hey, we’re ready, so blow it.

531
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:28,611
Alright.

532
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:29,912
Get ready.

533
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:31,699
Get set.

534
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,122
Do your best!

535
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:38,805
Som-O, you can do it.

536
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:47,660
Just like that.

537
00:31:57,558 --> 00:31:58,303
Tao.

538
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:02,536
Do you have any memories of dogs?

539
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,610
Did I say something wrong?

540
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:13,856
Sorry.

541
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,161
It’d be better if you keep quiet.

542
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,530
(100-meter Dash Championship)

543
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:33,588
Hey, Som-O is here.

544
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,816
John, we’re ready.

545
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:38,419
Ready, three, four.

546
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:39,564
Amazing.

547
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:41,081
Great.

548
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:42,525
Grand.

549
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,066
Som-O!

550
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,407
Amazing. Great. Grand. Som-O!

551
00:32:54,312 --> 00:32:55,508
I’m not even in the field yet.

552
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:56,542
You guys are so over the top.

553
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,112
We’re here to encourage you so you can win.

554
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,408
But I’m kinda scared now.

555
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,460
There are so many people.

556
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:07,100
Som-O, listen to me.

557
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:11,059
You can do it. You can do it. You can do it.

558
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,339
Run fast. Run fast. Run fast.

559
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:16,506
Run fast. Run fast.

560
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:19,537
Win. Win. Win.

561
00:33:19,546 --> 00:33:20,309
Stop it!

562
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,413
Stop.

563
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:26,411
I can do it. I can do it. I can do it.

564
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:37,376
Som.

565
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,168
What did Chad say to you at practice?

566
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:45,571
I’m literally right here so ask me.

567
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,696
But I want to talk to Som.

568
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,502
He said to just run at my fastest speed.

569
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:53,524
Right?

570
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:59,586
Participants in the female 100-meter dash race for Grade 10,

571
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:02,139
come sign up at the referee table right now.

572
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,445
Go get ready, Som.

573
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:04,728
- I’m off. - Go on, Som.

574
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,754
Do your best, Som-O.

575
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:06,413
Do your best.

576
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:07,254
I will.

577
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,594
You can do it, Som-O.

578
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:14,515
Som-O, do your best.

579
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,306
Som-O, do your best.

580
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:24,832
Som-O, do your best.

581
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:27,460
The match will begin soon.

582
00:34:27,672 --> 00:34:30,011
All participants, on standby.

583
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:35,364
Get in position.

584
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:36,718
Get ready.

585
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:42,859
Run at my fastest speed.

586
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:44,213
Get set.

587
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:46,780
She’s here!

588
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:49,817
Do your best!

589
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:51,813
Som-O!

590
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,102
How do I run at my fastest speed?

591
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:10,909
Think of something that makes you so angry.

592
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:13,005
Extremely angry.

593
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:25,722
Hey, stop it!

594
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,851
I said stop!

595
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:27,647
You dog!

596
00:35:27,816 --> 00:35:29,094
Give me back my meatballs!

597
00:35:29,124 --> 00:35:30,805
You won’t stop, huh?

598
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,976
Give me back my meatballs!

599
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,749
Give me back my meatballs!

600
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,011
She won!

601
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,222
- Som-O won! - I can’t believe I can do it!

602
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:52,610
Thank you, Chad.

603
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,405
You’re the best.

604
00:35:56,117 --> 00:35:57,257
I did it, Khao!

605
00:35:57,974 --> 00:35:58,911
Congratulations.

606
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:01,441
Well done.

607
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:05,770
Congratulations to Gewalin for winning this match.

608
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:08,303
A round of applause for your friend, please.

609
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,551
Chad, what do you say?

610
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:46,414
I can’t go along.

611
00:36:48,254 --> 00:36:51,700
Doing this, it’s like you’re not giving me a choice.

612
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,259
Chad, will you hear me out?

613
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:59,918
Of course I’d ask you about quitting school.

614
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:02,503
I want to stay here.

615
00:37:04,503 --> 00:37:07,456
I never said yes to any of your plans.

616
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:12,115
Do you understand that I want you to come live with me?

617
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:13,777
I want us to be a family.

618
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,522
Your brother misses you, you know?

619
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,303
Will you please hear me out, Madam, Chadjen?

620
00:37:23,654 --> 00:37:25,805
Let’s all calm down.

621
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,007
I believe Chadjen has his reasons.

622
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:31,611
Should we wait for him a little longer?

623
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:33,777
What else is there to wait, Miss?

624
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,005
I flew back here just to sort this out.

625
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,106
Why else would I come back at all?

626
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:42,407
If Chad doesn’t come back with me, all this will have been for nothing.

627
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:49,508
How about giving Chadjen another semester so he can finish this school year?

628
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,662
Will the school get the document ready when the time comes?

629
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:57,140
It depends on the student’s consent as well.

630
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,305
I’ll give you another semester.

631
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:09,416
Say goodbye to your friends.

632
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:12,167
Do what you want.

633
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:14,234
I won’t stop you.

634
00:38:15,617 --> 00:38:16,819
Will you be alright with that?

635
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,730
(Prize for the winner of 100-meter dash race)

636
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:38,115
So the prize is this box of snacks?

637
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:42,137
Focus on this.

638
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:46,564
Take it.

639
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:48,428
Buy your father that present.

640
00:38:50,854 --> 00:38:51,502
No way.

641
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,985
You won that.

642
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:55,309
I mean it.

643
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:57,998
What’s more important than buying your dad that present?

644
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:00,980
Open it, Khao.

645
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:02,687
Open it.

646
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:07,305
(Who says life is easy?)

647
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,362
(Even high schoolers have high schoolers’ problems.)

648
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:14,069
(But then again, problems are meant to be solved.)

649
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,440
(Just think of it as completing a quest.)

650
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,520
(Coupon at the school cafeteria)
(Just think of it as completing a quest.)

651
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:19,020
Oh, dear.

652
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:20,368
It’s just a coupon.

653
00:39:22,937 --> 00:39:25,988
Well, I guess my father doesn't need this.

654
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,120
It’s okay.

655
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:33,045
I’ll just see my dad empty-handed.

656
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:40,274
How about this?

657
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:46,475
We pitch in a little bit so Khao can buy her father something.

658
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:48,001
No way.

659
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:50,106
Nerd, that’s actually a good idea.

660
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:51,582
Alright. I’m in.

661
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,265
I only have 100 with me, though.

662
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,571
100 is good enough.

663
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,108
Here.

664
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:01,509
I’ll pay for Chadjen for now.

665
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:03,154
He’s a nice guy.

666
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,407
He will pay me back… I think.

667
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:07,906
Take it, Khao.

668
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,254
Buy your father something.

669
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,002
Here, nerd.

670
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:11,706
Take it.

671
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,825
Take it.

672
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:21,114
No.

673
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:22,339
I won’t take it.

674
00:40:24,474 --> 00:40:25,908
I don’t have time to buy anything.

675
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,805
It’s a sports day.

676
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,459
The gate is left open all day long so we can come and go as we please.

677
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:35,001
There’s time!

678
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:36,626
Let’s go get changed first, shall we?

679
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,885
Let’s do that.

680
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:39,482
Let’s go.

681
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:40,705
- Careful. - Come on, Tao.

682
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:41,505
Quickly.

683
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,312
Are you guys going to just leave this here?

684
00:40:44,952 --> 00:40:46,005
You carry it, Tao.

685
00:40:46,522 --> 00:40:47,245
Oh?

686
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,902
- We’re leaving it, then. - Leave it there, Tao!

687
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:53,908
Open it.

688
00:40:54,842 --> 00:40:56,419
Oh.

689
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:59,896
You remember my favorite color.

690
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:02,139
Can I try it now?

691
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:05,512
Oh, how nice.

692
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:08,302
Is it good?

693
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:10,016
You look dashing, Dad.

694
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:31,355
Chad.

695
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:37,711
I’m going to ask you honestly.

696
00:41:38,714 --> 00:41:40,208
Are you sure you’ve thought this through?

697
00:41:43,482 --> 00:41:45,813
What is wrong with what I’m trying to do for you?

698
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,469
Studying over there is clearly better for your future.

699
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:53,002
Chad.

700
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:55,448
Choose your future carefully.

701
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:59,702
I just want the best for you.

702
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,048
But it isn’t my choice.

703
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,700
My new family is a well-established family.

704
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:11,374
They are ready to support whatever you choose.

705
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:20,368
What else do you want, baby?

706
00:42:21,565 --> 00:42:27,004
Do you know I get worried about you when I’m away?

707
00:42:27,863 --> 00:42:30,542
I can’t help but feel lonely and miss you when you’re not with me.

708
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:33,706
But I’m not lonely here.

709
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:36,508
Of course you’re not.

710
00:42:37,062 --> 00:42:40,964
Som and her parents, Fon and Preecha, take such good care of you.

711
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:47,979
But I’m your mother, and I won’t ever be happy without my baby with me.

712
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:12,241
You want to stay here so much that you’re willing to just let me go?

713
00:43:15,105 --> 00:43:16,614
I never let you go, Mom.

714
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:26,605
(Khao: Dad said thank you to everyone who pitched in for the gift.)

715
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:28,657
(He liked it so much he’s already wearing it.)

716
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,090
(New: He looks amazing.)

717
00:43:32,872 --> 00:43:36,690
(Khao: Dad said next time he’s back, he’ll take everyone out to lunch.)

718
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,690
(Tao: Oh, I’ll be patiently waiting, sir.)

719
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:06,546
Mom!

720
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:07,407
Mom!

721
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:09,700
Mom!

722
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:12,665
What, what is it? What’s the rush?

723
00:44:13,294 --> 00:44:15,520
Mom, do we have anything that might be good as a memento?

724
00:44:15,594 --> 00:44:16,777
I need one right now.

725
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,371
For Aunt Aun?

726
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,743
I already gave her a souvenir.

727
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,992
What else do you want to give her?

728
00:44:21,013 --> 00:44:22,600
No, it’s too late.

729
00:44:22,645 --> 00:44:23,964
Aunt Aun is already leaving.

730
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,257
What is this around your neck?

731
00:44:26,943 --> 00:44:28,257
Oh, it’s a gold medal.

732
00:44:28,853 --> 00:44:30,180
I won it in a 100-meter dash race.

733
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:31,426
You did?

734
00:44:32,746 --> 00:44:33,522
A gold medal…

735
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:35,522
I have to go, Mom.

736
00:44:35,783 --> 00:44:38,084
Come back soon.

737
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:41,517
I’ll make more dinner to celebrate your gold!

738
00:45:30,826 --> 00:45:32,977
Do you really want to become a doctor?

739
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:34,259
When did you realize that?

740
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,619
Why have I never heard about this?

741
00:45:35,657 --> 00:45:38,481
We’re here for the school play casting today.

742
00:45:38,548 --> 00:45:40,952
Chadjen, you’d be the perfect Phra Aphai Mani.

743
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:43,802
There’s one more empty role: the giantess.

744
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:44,714
Does anyone want to play her?

745
00:45:44,946 --> 00:45:45,542
Me.

746
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:48,004
I don’t know why the upperclassmen have to get involved.

747
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:49,721
You don’t look like you like Mhog very much.

748
00:45:49,755 --> 00:45:51,100
Why did you pick me?

749
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:53,911
We need someone gentle but strong for the mermaid role.

750
00:45:53,927 --> 00:45:55,909
I think that’s perfect for you.

751
00:45:56,078 --> 00:45:58,638
Can you give New his medicines?

752
00:45:58,742 --> 00:46:01,148
He’ll be in trouble if he doesn’t take them properly.

753
00:46:01,235 --> 00:46:02,099
Are you sick?

754
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:03,579
Is it serious?

755
00:46:04,684 --> 00:46:05,669
I need a favor.

756
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,920
Oh, dear, you have a maid now?

757
00:46:12,608 --> 00:46:15,328
Khao, Khao, Khao, we’re in trouble!

758
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:16,314
What?

759
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:17,321
What!?

760
00:46:17,394 --> 00:46:18,994
You lost our class wallet?

761
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,457
Chad, won’t you help Som look for the wallet?

762
00:46:21,623 --> 00:46:22,770
How could you just stay silent?

763
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:23,899
What, Som?

764
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:25,397
How much was in that wallet?

765
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:26,528
4000 baht.

766
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,337
Won’t you help your daughter out?
