1
00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:01,408
This is hardly a stroll.

2
00:00:01,527 --> 00:00:02,899
It’s exhausting.

3
00:00:03,026 --> 00:00:04,063
Are we still talking about the stroll?

4
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,905
We’re talking about my being in love with you.

5
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,810
I think I should move in with you.

6
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:14,807
You are a woman.

7
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:17,577
People may gossip about you.

8
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:18,828
Chad and I,

9
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:20,207
(We are dating.)

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,057
I’m moving out to a dorm outside the campus.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,005
Som.

12
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:27,505
Do you want to move in with me?

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

14
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:37,262
It’s going to be so lonely without you here, Som-O.

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,152
Who are you going to live with?

16
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:42,960
Khao and I are going to be roommates.

17
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:47,370
A friend of mine just moved in with her boyfriend.

18
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:49,370
They’re together nearly 24/7.

19
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:50,539
I really envy her.

20
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,069
I want something like that, too…

21
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:56,577
Yeah, keep dreaming.

22
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,814
Your dad is way too protective to allow that.

23
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,336
I honestly hate that he’s like that.

24
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,099
But well… can’t help it that I’m an adorable daughter.

25
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,962
Oh, the nerve.

26
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:07,856
Right?

27
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:11,260
Well, I’m off, guys.

28
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,260
Give me another hug?

29
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,100
Of course.

30
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,825
Take care of yourself, alright?

31
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:18,293
Bring it in, you guys.

32
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,920
I miss you already.

33
00:02:20,737 --> 00:02:22,296
See you on campus, then?

34
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:23,211
Right.

35
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,988
Don’t stay up so much, you hear me?

36
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:26,112
And don’t you forget about us.

37
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:26,920
Okay.

38
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:28,312
Bye.

39
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:30,312
Do you need a hand with your stuff?

40
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,047
Nah, I’m alright.

41
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:34,103
I’m really going this time.

42
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:36,438
- Bye-bye. - Good luck.

43
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:37,810
- Bye. - Bye.

44
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:38,920
Take care.

45
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:40,511
You, too.

46
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:51,294
How much is the rent again?

47
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,709
I need to tell my parents.

48
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:54,509
You don’t have to pay.

49
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:56,604
There’s no way that’s okay.

50
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,016
We have to split the rent. It’s more convincing that way.

51
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,743
Or else my parents wouldn’t believe I’m sharing with Khao.

52
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,299
Just don’t tell them and keep the money.

53
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:07,908
No way.

54
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:10,300
There’s no way I’ll let you pay all by yourself.

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,709
It’s really okay.

56
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:13,800
You sure?

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,570
(Dad)

58
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,202
Dad is video calling me.

59
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:24,967
Get down on the floor!

60
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:27,337
Hey, guys.

61
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,407
Why are you video calling me?

62
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:32,506
We’re not there to help you move in today

63
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:37,207
so we want to know how you’re doing with the moving.

64
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:41,868
Well? Let me see what the place looks like.

65
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:44,539
It looks like any typical dorm room, of course.

66
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,512
Uhh, let me switch to the back camera.

67
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:56,317
Hey, don’t move the camera around so much.

68
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:57,506
You’re making me nauseous.

69
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,376
Stay still.

70
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,205
Oh, sure.

71
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,908
Where’s Khao, though?

72
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,979
Isn’t she there?

73
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,600
Get her on the phone.

74
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:17,514
Oh Khao…

75
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:18,805
Khao…

76
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,057
(Shower.)

77
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:21,715
Huh?

78
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:25,297
Oh, Khao is cleaning the bathroom!

79
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:27,777
Cleaning the bathroom?

80
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,605
On your first day of moving in?

81
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,431
She’s a clean freak.

82
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:39,200
I’m going to go help her clean right now.

83
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,614
It’s better to live in a clean room, right?

84
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,962
Bye, Dad.

85
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:43,828
I have to go.

86
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:45,311
Hey, hold on. Wait!

87
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:50,405
I said “shower.”

88
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,914
Where’d you get cleaning the bathroom from?

89
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:54,739
You were clearly miming cleaning the bathroom!

90
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,811
I don’t know how long I can keep this from my parents.

91
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:02,811
But first, I have to tell Khao.

92
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:09,004
Are you going to keep sitting there on the floor?

93
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,226
’Morning, Khao.

94
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,908
Khao, is something wrong?

95
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:37,517
It’s Som.

96
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:41,591
She told her parents I’m her roommate.

97
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,016
Oh?

98
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:44,860
Why, though?

99
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:47,260
She and Chadjen have been friends since childhood, right?

100
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:49,911
Her parents would probably understand.

101
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:51,500
You’re silly, huh?

102
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:54,008
That’s exactly why she can’t let them know.

103
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:57,001
Her parents love Chadjen like their own son, you know?

104
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:03,604
Won’t it be a total disaster when they finally find out about this?

105
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,979
We’re lying to your father, too.

106
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:29,554
Khao.

107
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:38,805
When we’re all ready,

108
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:41,505
I’ll talk to my parents.

109
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:52,560
Is it Som-O?

110
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:54,706
She was just here.

111
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,251
It’s your Dad!

112
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,801
Dad?

113
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:04,574
Yes!

114
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,162
It was my fault for not telling you, Dad.

115
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:39,931
But I didn’t mean to keep it from you.

116
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,715
I just didn’t want to disappoint you

117
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:48,269
and I didn’t want you to think badly of Khao.

118
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,074
Khao is the woman who means a lot to me.

119
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:11,475
New.

120
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:16,906
It’s great that Khao is here to take care of you.

121
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:18,906
I’m not going to oppose this.

122
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:23,257
Really?

123
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:24,303
Did you mean it?

124
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,253
Of course, I meant it.

125
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:30,940
I really don’t think you’ll find someone who loves you like her.

126
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:36,413
Khao, if New ever acts out, feel free to deal with him.

127
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,754
Of course.

128
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,480
Oh, Dad.

129
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:43,068
Don’t scare me like that.

130
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:44,708
I’d never act out like you said.

131
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,457
Okay, then.

132
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,771
New would never do that.

133
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:51,213
That’s great to hear.

134
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:55,355
You’re really perfect for New, Khao.

135
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:57,579
Thank you.

136
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:01,589
You’re really something, huh, son?

137
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,308
100 sheep.

138
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,105
101 sheep.

139
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:21,216
102 sheep.

140
00:09:23,282 --> 00:09:24,817
103 sheep.

141
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,111
104 sheep.

142
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:31,760
105 sheep.

143
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:35,315
200 sheep.

144
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,416
What’s wrong?

145
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,257
I can’t sleep.

146
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,602
I’m probably not used to this place yet.

147
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:08,554
Hey.

148
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,554
Tell me a story.

149
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:13,823
I don’t know how to do that.

150
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:17,909
Just tell me something you know.

151
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:37,752
When you were a kid,

152
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:42,736
you always stole the ice-cream I was eating.

153
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,379
But you ate so slow.

154
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:48,379
I didn’t want it to melt.

155
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:53,253
When you were a kid,

156
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:55,964
you once chased after a dog.

157
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,308
Just because he took your meatballs.

158
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,659
Well,...

159
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,570
that was exactly why I had to chase after him…

160
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,004
Are those the only kind of memories you have?

161
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:18,014
You walked so slow.

162
00:11:20,674 --> 00:11:22,216
We were always late to school.

163
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,013
Maybe your legs are just too long for normal people’s standard?

164
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:34,869
When we were kids, you yelled into my ears every morning.

165
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,357
That was because you wouldn’t wake up for school.

166
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,952
Are you really going to fall asleep at this rate?

167
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,765
Then stop bringing up bad memories.

168
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,610
You’re not even telling me a story. You’re just calling me out for what I did.

169
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,306
Go to sleep.

170
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,114
I’ll sit here with you.

171
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:11,561
Close your eyes.

172
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:21,317
Tell me more.

173
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:26,300
In Maths…

174
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:30,761
You never got one answer correct.

175
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:36,768
It was difficult.

176
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,703
Who’d be able to do that?

177
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:42,401
Your drawings are always so good, you know?

178
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:46,659
I think you were the best in class.

179
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:51,228
If you were in a competition back then, I believe you’d have won.

180
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:43,951
What are you doing?

181
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,306
Why aren’t you dressed?

182
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:46,888
Will you at least get dressed before you—

183
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:55,216
Don’t get near me.

184
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:57,216
Go and get properly dressed right now.

185
00:16:58,468 --> 00:16:59,773
That’s exactly what I’m doing.

186
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:02,617
Oh, right.

187
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:13,161
Chad!

188
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:20,503
You back in the bathroom yet?

189
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,808
Yeah, I am.

190
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:25,700
Then how come I can still hear—

191
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,154
Chadjen!

192
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:41,896
What are you doing back here?

193
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:43,115
Need a towel.

194
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:01,016
You’re fine.

195
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,801
Take a deep breath.

196
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:04,505
Breathe out.

197
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:11,308
Are–Are you dressed?

198
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,068
Yeah.

199
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,306
You sure?

200
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:27,565
Go get a shower so we can have breakfast.

201
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:32,302
I’ll wait outside.

202
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:47,114
What did you forget now?

203
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,965
Nothing.

204
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:53,410
Huh?

205
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:05,669
Did I get you?

206
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:09,336
Hey, don’t do that.

207
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,177
Stop it. You’re dirtying it.

208
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,456
What?

209
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:21,297
Gimme that.

210
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,202
You use this one.

211
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:24,325
What’s wrong with this one?

212
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:25,457
I’ll do it.

213
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:47,234
(I was wondering at first if I made the right decision.)

214
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:50,748
(Even though I haven’t quite got my answer,)

215
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,217
(I’m happy just spending time with you.)

216
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:03,408
Som.

217
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,091
Som.

218
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:16,124
Go to bed.

219
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:22,736
Bye.

220
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:24,736
Goodnight.

221
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,810
Why didn’t you lock the door?

222
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:10,097
Good thing I wasn’t naked.

223
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,730
(Dad)

224
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,213
Yes, Dad?

225
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:33,112
(Your mother and I are on our way to your place.)

226
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:35,823
(We’ve got you so many things.)

227
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,755
You guys are on the way here?

228
00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:42,565
I’ll… I’ll go take a shower right now.

229
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:43,724
Yes.

230
00:22:45,284 --> 00:22:46,813
My parents are on the way here.

231
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:48,010
What should we do, Chad?

232
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:49,614
What should we do? What should we do!

233
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:51,503
Let’s hide your things first.

234
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:03,560
Is that all?

235
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:05,262
Here.

236
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:06,706
Gimme that.

237
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,417
Go.

238
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,582
Wait at Khao and New’s place.

239
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:14,616
Go to their place.

240
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:19,300
Thank you.

241
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,650
(Som-O)

242
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:30,845
Hello?

243
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:32,808
My parents are coming.

244
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:35,022
What?

245
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,816
Can you please just hurry up and come to my place?

246
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:43,017
Careful with the boxes.

247
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,349
Seems something’s wrong with the wheels.

248
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:45,705
Just hold on to the boxes, dear.

249
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:53,157
Careful, sir.

250
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:26,411
Coming.

251
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:34,229
I’m coming, guys.

252
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,207
Hello, Dad. Hi, Mom.

253
00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:40,844
Oh, what have you got there?

254
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:43,705
Are you guys moving here or something?

255
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,862
Your father was worried so he got everything.

256
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:49,971
Come on in, Dad.

257
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:52,994
Really? It was me?

258
00:24:53,802 --> 00:24:55,979
It was your mother’s doing.

259
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,802
She maxed out my credit card.

260
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:01,840
Where is Khao?

261
00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:03,297
Oh, she—

262
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:06,214
Dad! I haven’t made my bed.

263
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,662
Don’t embarrass me like that.

264
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,343
I haven’t cleaned up.

265
00:25:09,362 --> 00:25:10,801
- You should there. - I was just checking the place out.

266
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,820
Sit down here and get rested, Dad.

267
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,631
You already messed up your dorm room?

268
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,121
Well, you know me.

269
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:21,721
So where is Khao?

270
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:25,011
Oh, she’s…

271
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,312
Oh, hello, guys.

272
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:28,223
Hello.

273
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:28,979
Hello.

274
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:30,410
- Hello. - Hello.

275
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,317
There you are.

276
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,531
- Let me help with your stuff. - There she is.

277
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:37,408
Khao, have breakfast with us.

278
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,623
I’ll cook something.

279
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:40,739
Of course.

280
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:41,598
Thank you.

281
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:49,026
This couch is great.

282
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:50,242
Mom.

283
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,894
You’ve been in the car all morning, right?

284
00:25:52,912 --> 00:25:54,115
Sit on the couch.

285
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:55,906
Sit down here.

286
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:58,102
But I wanted to check the place out.

287
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:00,160
Well, in a bit.

288
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:01,754
Did you miss me at home?

289
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,514
Of course.

290
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:17,411
(Stay at New’s for now.)

291
00:26:17,813 --> 00:26:19,669
(It seems this is gonna be a while.)

292
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:36,420
The place is quite clean, huh?

293
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,657
I like that it’s got so much greenery.

294
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:45,810
This is great.

295
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,364
Get home safe, guys.

296
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,162
Don’t speed, Dad.

297
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:54,416
I know that.

298
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:57,500
We’ll come visit again.

299
00:26:57,927 --> 00:26:58,816
Sure.

300
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,408
Just please let me know in advance in case I’m on campus.

301
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:05,500
Make sure you don’t miss your meals.

302
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:07,214
Right.

303
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:08,708
Bye.

304
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:10,377
Gimme a hug.

305
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:14,462
Bye-bye.

306
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:15,053
Bye.

307
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:16,241
Safe trip.

308
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,982
Alright.

309
00:27:20,032 --> 00:27:21,512
Goob day, sir.

310
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:23,512
Keep up the good work.

311
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:24,465
Of course.

312
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:25,531
It’s my pleasure.

313
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:32,807
- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

314
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:53,780
Som.

315
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:57,220
I think you should probably just tell your parents.

316
00:27:57,722 --> 00:28:00,454
Do you think lying to them will work out till the end?

317
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:01,320
I agree.

318
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,813
Maybe it won’t be as bad as you think.

319
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,306
Khao and I got through it just fine, right?

320
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:07,604
Right.

321
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:12,183
If I told them the truth and they made us stay away from each other,

322
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,545
I’d rather keep lying like this.

323
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:23,776
But there’s no such thing as secrets, you know?

324
00:28:32,056 --> 00:28:34,345
Shark Tao just made history

325
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:37,552
by winning a gold medal at the 29th SEA Games.

326
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,835
He’s now the nation’s hero.

327
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:43,431
Chad.

328
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:44,693
How did you do it?

329
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:50,631
Immune, pharmacology, pathology, and also PBL?

330
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,314
How did you get perfect scores in all those courses?

331
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:55,245
Will you be quiet?

332
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:56,257
Everyone’s looking at us.

333
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,253
Well, yeah, don’t be surprised.

334
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:01,656
You’re famous around here, actually.

335
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:03,964
After you got all A’s for three years, it’s no wonder.

336
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,419
Even the professors are talking about you, you know?

337
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,811
Like I said, everyone knows you around here.

338
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,158
I think I have to go.

339
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:22,431
I have to talk to our professor about some cases this afternoon.

340
00:29:22,777 --> 00:29:23,703
Bye.

341
00:29:36,728 --> 00:29:37,817
What? They’re all gone?

342
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,505
They’re here just for him?

343
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:42,157
I’ve talked to the Association for you.

344
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:44,724
They’ll probably let you stay home for a while longer this time.

345
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,967
Don’t forget to sort things out at school.

346
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:48,690
Yes, Dad.

347
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:52,414
How are your friends?

348
00:29:53,348 --> 00:29:54,106
They’re great.

349
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,405
We keep in touch all the time.

350
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,096
Som-O as well?

351
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,964
Som-O and I really are just friends.

352
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:11,721
I told you I’m only focusing on swimming now.

353
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:14,866
Okay, then.

354
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,179
I’ll wait downstairs.

355
00:30:17,253 --> 00:30:17,985
Alright.

356
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:19,211
I’ll be right there.

357
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:27,117
I’m here.

358
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:28,598
You’re so slow.

359
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,112
I came as fast as I could.

360
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:32,213
Did you hide everything?

361
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:33,653
I did.

362
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:35,400
I’m a pro at it at this point.

363
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:41,137
Oh, you’re so slow.

364
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,000
- Hello, there. - I need to use the toilet.

365
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:45,075
Oh, of course. Go on.

366
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:48,702
Why don’t you come sit over here, Auntie?

367
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,429
Thanks, dear.

368
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:52,105
Here.

369
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:56,537
How are you? How is your study?

370
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:57,709
It’s great.

371
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,117
Honey.

372
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:09,598
Honey, are you done?

373
00:31:10,265 --> 00:31:11,269
He’s about done, Mom.

374
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,097
I am.

375
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:16,915
Khao?

376
00:31:17,657 --> 00:31:18,428
What are you doing?

377
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,503
Oh, I’m just stretching.

378
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:28,823
Chadjen, Som-O, I need to talk—

379
00:31:30,942 --> 00:31:31,565
Oh…

380
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:35,835
Is it bad timing?

381
00:31:36,106 --> 00:31:38,171
Well, have a good day.

382
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:39,229
I’m off.

383
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:40,528
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

384
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,146
I’m in trouble.

385
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,714
Did you say Chadjen just now?

386
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:47,936
Yes.

387
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:50,054
Well…

388
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,097
I was calling—

389
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:57,026
The thing is Som-O and I invited New and Chadjen over today.

390
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:02,111
New probably thought Chadjen already got here so he called his name.

391
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:08,305
They’re friends so it’s not strange they all visit each other, right, honey?

392
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:10,722
The more, the merrier, didn’t they say?

393
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:11,388
Exactly.

394
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:12,611
What Mom said, Dad.

395
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:16,413
Exactly.

396
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,960
Why don’t we all have lunch?

397
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:19,712
Honey, come on.

398
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,671
Hurry.

399
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:21,462
You’re welcome to join us.

400
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,269
Thank you.

401
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,967
What did you make, Mom?

402
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,967
Is it my favorite?

403
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:27,801
She’s made a lot of food.

404
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:29,518
- We can all share. - Come on, guys.

405
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:30,983
This is enough to feed 10 people.

406
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:34,214
Come on here, dear.

407
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,891
This all looks so good.

408
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:41,213
Do you think my mother knows?

409
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:42,847
Of course.

410
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:44,576
She saw his pants with her own eyes.

411
00:32:45,611 --> 00:32:48,814
But I think she’s on your team.

412
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,497
She saved our butts just now.

413
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:53,737
But…

414
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,314
Did you really throw Chad’s pants away?

415
00:32:59,275 --> 00:32:59,848
I did.

416
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:01,977
I threw them away like this.

417
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:03,737
I needed to get rid of the evidence, right?

418
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,216
Did you…

419
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:11,053
Oh, Chad.

420
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:15,060
Did these get blown away by the wind when you hung out the laundry?

421
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,112
I’ll wash them again.

422
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:20,570
Hand them here.

423
00:33:27,157 --> 00:33:28,712
Were your parents just here again?

424
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,274
I feel like I’m going to have a heart attack every time they show up.

425
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,804
But I love it.

426
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,965
They always bring us some amazing food when they’re here.

427
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:45,610
The only thing you care about is food, huh?

428
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:49,826
Som.

429
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:53,318
Can’t you just tell them next time that I’m on campus or something?

430
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,109
They won’t question that.

431
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:56,820
Fine.

432
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:57,739
I know that.

433
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,299
I have to go now.

434
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:01,494
I have my research paper to write.

435
00:34:01,635 --> 00:34:03,702
Haven’t finished it because I’ve been so worried about you.

436
00:34:04,952 --> 00:34:05,608
Bye.

437
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,102
I’m going, too.

438
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:09,066
Well, hurry up.

439
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,048
I’m already so behind schedule.

440
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:15,731
Bye.

441
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:23,905
I’m causing trouble for them, aren’t I?

442
00:34:39,222 --> 00:34:40,502
Don’t overthink it.

443
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:44,742
With what Khao just said, I can’t do that.

444
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,402
Why… did you leave your pants there, though?

445
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:00,155
I’m sorry.

446
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:02,742
I’ll keep them properly next time.

447
00:35:05,785 --> 00:35:06,957
You wash them.

448
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,964
Som-O’s drawings won a competition.

449
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:22,860
You got a fund for your research.

450
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:27,208
I don’t even have to mention Chadjen and Tao.

451
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,365
They’re getting all the attention they need.

452
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,005
Everyone seems to be doing their own things.

453
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,472
I’m the only one who doesn’t look like he’s got a future ahead of him.

454
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,508
Are you listening to me, Khao?

455
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:50,177
Of course.

456
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:54,404
You just have to graduate and find work.

457
00:35:58,205 --> 00:36:01,373
The paths to success don’t look the same for everyone, you know?

458
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,804
But that’s not what I want to do.

459
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,565
Then do what you want to do.

460
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:11,976
Easy for you to say, Khao.

461
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:17,407
You’re amazing, smart, and very pretty.

462
00:36:22,971 --> 00:36:29,604
An amazing person like you will never understand how a loser like me feels.

463
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:52,814
Art is life.

464
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:54,611
Art is spirit!

465
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:57,202
Bring that emotion out, Som-O!

466
00:37:02,382 --> 00:37:05,211
Spirit!

467
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:08,158
Spirit!

468
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:15,053
When did you get here?

469
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,937
Just now.

470
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:20,034
Here.

471
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,311
For you.

472
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:46,173
Let’s go home.

473
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:47,634
Wait.

474
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:52,420
Do doctors have to be passionate about what they do?

475
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,905
Why did you want to be a heart surgeon anyway?

476
00:37:57,256 --> 00:37:58,219
Passion, you said?

477
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:06,660
I just think it’s cool to be able to fix and mend someone’s heart.

478
00:38:08,884 --> 00:38:12,011
It’s like… you can extend someone’s lifespan.

479
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:13,814
Something like that.

480
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:16,511
Let’s go home.

481
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:20,216
Wait.

482
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,111
Shhh.

483
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:37,299
Let me listen to your heartbeat for a little bit.

484
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:02,605
I’ve got an idea for my assignment now.

485
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:06,808
Let’s go home.

486
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:12,354
Chad!

487
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,380
- Hurry up. - Alright.

488
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:31,170
Congratulations.

489
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:35,791
Here.

490
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:36,912
My gift.

491
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:40,062
Congratulations.

492
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,520
I wonder what your heart looks like.

493
00:40:09,613 --> 00:40:11,179
Does this even look like it?

494
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,503
Thanks.

495
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:21,503
You’re giving me a heart?

496
00:40:22,945 --> 00:40:23,902
This is very accurate.

497
00:40:27,005 --> 00:40:29,019
I got an A for this because of you.

498
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,234
Keep it in the bag.

499
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:37,620
I’ll hold on to it for you.

500
00:40:38,328 --> 00:40:39,269
I’ll carry it.

501
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:40,711
It’s alright.

502
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:43,814
Up to you, then.

503
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:50,805
Honey, Som-O is over there.

504
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,029
Hello, guys.

505
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,847
Hello.

506
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:54,204
Hello. Hello.

507
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,280
Congratulations.

508
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,450
Thank you.

509
00:40:58,198 --> 00:40:59,068
Should we take some photos?

510
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:00,007
Right.

511
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,057
Let me do it.

512
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:06,062
Alright, you stay in the middle.

513
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:09,988
One, two, three.

514
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:12,611
Say “Chadjen” together on three, alright?

515
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:13,765
Chadjen?

516
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,192
One, two, three…

517
00:41:15,231 --> 00:41:17,567
Chadjen!

518
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,940
Why did we say it, though? It wasn’t a video, was it?

519
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,065
It just kinda fits the mood, right?

520
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,244
Alright, then.

521
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:26,703
- Good job, son. - I’ll send you the photos.

522
00:41:26,714 --> 00:41:27,560
Thank you.

523
00:41:28,475 --> 00:41:30,918
I’m really proud of you, Chadjen.

524
00:41:31,882 --> 00:41:32,847
Thank you.

525
00:41:33,503 --> 00:41:34,248
Well done.

526
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:36,577
Oh, hey…

527
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:39,900
Can I ask you something?

528
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:40,917
Yes?

529
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:42,499
Anyone hitting on Som-O lately?

530
00:41:43,028 --> 00:41:45,380
You gotta let me know that kind of thing immediately, alright?

531
00:41:45,654 --> 00:41:46,709
Dad.

532
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:48,197
What?

533
00:41:48,788 --> 00:41:50,914
Honey, come on. She’s all grown up now.

534
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:53,451
And it’s Chadjen’s day, you know?

535
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:56,539
You should talk about him, not her.

536
00:41:56,854 --> 00:41:57,767
Talk about him, huh?

537
00:41:59,954 --> 00:42:00,709
Well?

538
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,912
Do you have a girlfriend?

539
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:06,220
Oh, seems I asked the right question!

540
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:07,219
You have, right?

541
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:10,226
Chadjen is a good student.

542
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,222
I don’t see you at home enough.

543
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:13,714
Are you living on campus, dear?

544
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:16,819
Uhh, I’m renting a condo.

545
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:18,155
You are?

546
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:20,242
Are you living with your girlfriend?

547
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,183
Are you?

548
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:25,450
You’re devious, huh?

549
00:42:26,702 --> 00:42:27,850
I’m living with Som-O.

550
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:33,402
What did you just say, Chad?

551
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,411
Who are you living with?

552
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:38,305
Som-O.

553
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:10,616
I can’t believe you’ve been lying to me.

554
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,641
How much longer do you think you can go on like this?

555
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:15,779
Can you even give me an answer?

556
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:20,411
Don’t worry about making something of yourself right now.

557
00:43:20,826 --> 00:43:22,174
I’m not pressuring you to.

558
00:43:22,605 --> 00:43:23,613
But Dad…

559
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:26,229
It’s you I’m dating, not your father.

560
00:43:27,826 --> 00:43:28,517
Som.

561
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,585
Can you go home for now?

562
00:43:31,456 --> 00:43:33,254
Oh, I have to send her this.

563
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,420
Lily just sent me something.
