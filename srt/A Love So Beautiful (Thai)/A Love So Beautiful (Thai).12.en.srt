1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,570
I’m sorry I threw it away.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,140
I’m back, Khao.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,010
New.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,700
Chad.

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,400
Thank you for today.

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,730
About the banner, I mean.

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,110
Som-O.

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,170
This gold is yours.

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,410
Without you, I wouldn’t have the drive I need to compete.

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,450
You’re always so over the top.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

12
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,930
Do you feel lonely, Mr. Sassawat?

13
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,630
A little.

14
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,930
Since you call me every day, I don’t feel lonely anymore.

15
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,110
Urgh! Why do you keep making cheesy comments?

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,170
Hey, do you have an afternoon class?

17
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,700
Are you busy with school lately?

18
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,620
I’m going home this weekend.

19
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,660
Are you going with me?

20
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,610
I don’t know.

21
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,820
New, why don’t you say hi to our friends? You haven’t seen them for some time.

22
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,900
Hi, New.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,410
How are you doing?

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,450
Will you be discharged from the hospital soon?

25
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,400
I need to stay here for some time.

26
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,400
The doctor said at least seven days.

27
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,050
Seven days?

28
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,220
Chad.

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,100
New.

30
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,770
Get well soon.

31
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,660
Thank you.

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,930
Chadjen, do you want to try wearing a nasal cannula?

33
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,060
I’m kidding.

34
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,780
Take it.

35
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,990
It’s my thanks to you.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Without you, I wouldn’t have the drive I need to compete.

37
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:33,910
Hey.

38
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,560
Chad.

39
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,850
Chadjen.

40
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,200
Chad.

41
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,860
Chadjen.

42
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,800
Why don’t you tell me what’s going on?

43
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,860
So I would know what I need to apologize to you about.

44
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,350
You, jerk.

45
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,830
I’m back.

46
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,500
She’s back.

47
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,160
- Hello, Dad and Mom. - I miss you so much.

48
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,900
Let me hug you.

49
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,810
The food is ready.

50
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,210
- Have a seat. - Mom, why do you cook so many dishes?

51
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,710
You can’t find food tasting like my cooking at your college.

52
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,340
I miss your cooking so much.

53
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,600
This is my way to get you to come home.

54
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,280
I have to warn you not to praise her cooking too much.

55
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,740
Otherwise, you need to pack her food back to the dorm.

56
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,470
Dad.

57
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,780
Do you remember when I praised that her green beef curry was delicious?

58
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,500
After that, she kept making green beef curry.

59
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,790
I had eaten it for several days.

60
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,420
Dad, how could you nag Mom like that?

61
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,110
Let’s eat.

62
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,400
Dad. Mom.

63
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,910
I have something to ask you.

64
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,280
Sure.

65
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,310
While you were dating, had you ever been mad at each other?

66
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,610
Of course.

67
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,440
Your dad was mad at me a lot.

68
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,450
Why do you ask us about it?

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,710
Are you…

70
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,070
No, Dad.

71
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,500
Are you secretly dating?

72
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,210
How can she have time to date?

73
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,380
She can do it because she’s living away from us.

74
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,300
I don’t trust you.

75
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,800
Dad, I’m not a kid anymore.

76
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,210
You don’t need to be overprotective of me.

77
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,560
If I had a boyfriend, I would have spent the weekend going on dates.

78
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,980
But I chose to come home because I miss you so much.

79
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,290
Right, Mom?

80
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,090
Fine. Don’t get caught by me.

81
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,500
When was the first time I was mad at her?

82
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,270
It started when we first dated.

83
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,700
I knew that your mom was very popular among men.

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,410
Because I was pretty.

85
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,540
Oh.

86
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,060
When I knew that she was approached by a man, I was mad at her.

87
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,970
I was mad at her.

88
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,390
She was popular.

89
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,900
Tofu, your favorite.

90
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,930
Give it to me.

91
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,930
You should come home often.

92
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,601
Hello.

93
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:02,010
I have something to talk to you.

94
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:03,343
(What?)

95
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,613
Did you notice that Chad was acting strange today?

96
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:09,702
Yes.

97
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:13,384
Do you know why he is mad at me?

98
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,105
How would I know it, silly?

99
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,217
What should I do?

100
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,871
Som, is there something between you and Chad?

101
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:27,903
(I can sense it.)

102
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:30,611
What do you sense?

103
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:36,511
Why don’t you look back and see if any strange moments happened between you two?

104
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:43,505
When New is in the hospital, I’m worried about him and want to take care of him.

105
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,804
I feel shy talking about it.

106
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:51,305
(Som, look at me and New. We were friends.)

107
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,537
But we are now dating.

108
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:56,537
It’s not strange.

109
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:58,111
Strange moments?

110
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:14,512
No, I don’t think so.

111
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:18,337
Fine if you say so.

112
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,448
Then you have nothing to worry about.

113
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,306
I’m hanging up. Bye.

114
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:28,471
Bye.

115
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,807
(New, I think there’s something between Som and Chadjen.)

116
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,505
(Huh? Really, Khao?)

117
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:09,100
(Why don’t you look back and see if any strange moments happened between you two?)

118
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:52,402
There are a few moments like that.

119
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,037
Maybe…

120
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:16,302
Silly.

121
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,019
Khao, you came early today.

122
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:37,911
Of course. I know you are lonely so I hurry to see you.

123
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:40,417
Thank you.

124
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:45,703
Who will take care of you after you are discharged from the hospital?

125
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,109
If my dad is not busy, he will stop by to see me.

126
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:52,601
That’s not good enough.

127
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,601
Your wound is not fully healed.

128
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,401
It will be healed soon. I’m doing fine.

129
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,125
Here.

130
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:09,962
I think I should move in with you.

131
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:15,336
Do you think it’s a good idea?

132
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,617
We are not married.

133
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:20,019
Silly.

134
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:25,251
You are sick. So I’m going to move in to take care of you.

135
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:31,742
But I think both my dad and your mom will oppose it.

136
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:33,946
Why will they oppose it?

137
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:36,037
We are not doing anything bad.

138
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:49,619
I mean we are still working hard at school.

139
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:53,244
You are sick and I’m just taking care of you.

140
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:54,977
That’s a good thing, isn’t it?

141
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:58,057
That’s true.

142
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,441
If you are afraid to talk to your dad about it, I’ll do it.

143
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,871
I think he will be okay with it.

144
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,521
Come on. Don’t you trust me?

145
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:13,561
It’s not that I don’t trust you.

146
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:21,755
Eat it.

147
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:23,755
Don’t worry about it.

148
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:27,434
It’s delicious.

149
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:29,462
Do you want to eat it?

150
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,580
I have been thinking about me and Chadjen for two days.

151
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:42,835
Today, I’ll ask him why he is mad at me.

152
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,706
One more thing.

153
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:50,287
I also want to ask him about that.

154
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,696
About what?

155
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,395
About that. Don’t make me say it again.

156
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,201
That’s good.

157
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:04,211
I encourage you to talk things over with Chadjen.

158
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,235
Stand up.

159
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:11,106
Now.

160
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:13,755
Why?

161
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:17,214
Are you going to wear the uniform to meet him?

162
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,768
Why? What’s wrong with the uniform?

163
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:29,179
I think if you do your hair and wear a cute outfit.

164
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:33,142
You look more mature and much prettier.

165
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:34,700
Really?

166
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,259
It’s time to transform Som-O into Cinderella.

167
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,251
It’s good that you came to visit me.

168
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:51,020
I haven’t seen Khao today.

169
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:52,608
She said she was going to see Som-O.

170
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,162
Chadjen.

171
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:55,531
Huh?

172
00:14:56,877 --> 00:15:00,902
Khao said she’s going to move in with me to take care of me.

173
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,408
Do you think…

174
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,425
if it’s a good idea?

175
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:11,105
Good for whom?

176
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,065
You?

177
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,139
If it’s good for Khao.

178
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,183
I’m worried if other people find out, they may view her negatively.

179
00:15:23,662 --> 00:15:25,004
You shouldn’t be worried about what other people think.

180
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:26,416
But…

181
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,626
Khao is doing this for you.

182
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,865
(Are you free this evening?)

183
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:53,112
(Can you come to meet me at the park? Don’t stand me up.)

184
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,594
(I have an important thing to talk to you.)

185
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:58,011
I got to go.

186
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:01,654
See you.

187
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:03,774
Thank you, Chadjen.

188
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:25,708
Chad.

189
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,007
What are you looking at?

190
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:46,311
You look different.

191
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:52,014
I’m just the same. You will get used to it.

192
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:58,645
Are you going to wear heels every day?

193
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:06,001
Nonsense.

194
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:07,333
Let’s walk.

195
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,434
See?

196
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:44,404
Let’s go.

197
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:33,090
(Training camp of Thai national team in South Korea)

198
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:20,962
Khao, can I talk to Som?

199
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:24,020
(If you want to talk to her, why don’t you call her?)

200
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,459
I called her but she didn’t answer it.

201
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:32,508
(Som said she is working in the studio with her friends.)

202
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:34,562
(She probably forgot to take her phone.)

203
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:36,411
Really?

204
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,650
(She probably comes back to the dorm late.)

205
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,739
(If you have a message for her, you can tell me.)

206
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,060
It’s nothing.

207
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:47,737
How is Nerd?

208
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,960
Is he fully recovered?

209
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,400
(He will be discharged from the hospital soon.)

210
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:54,211
Okay.

211
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:55,974
Please take care of him.

212
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:09,711
Chad.

213
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:11,014
Chadjen.

214
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:12,459
What?

215
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:14,638
This is hardly a stroll.

216
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,111
It’s like you’re walking away from me.

217
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,402
You still manage to catch up with me every time.

218
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,663
But it’s exhausting.

219
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,002
Do you have to be so cruel?

220
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,607
Are we still talking about the stroll?

221
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,059
We’re talking about my being in love with you.

222
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,312
(This fool finally realized how I feel.)

223
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:52,265
(This time, he will give me the answer, won’t he?)

224
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,223
(I just hope the answer is worth the long wait.)

225
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:26,647
Khao.

226
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:27,968
Are you ready to go home?

227
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:30,014
Yes.

228
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,845
Don’t you have class today?

229
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,306
I don’t have any class in the afternoon.

230
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:37,682
So I hurry to come to see you.

231
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:40,176
New, sit down. I’ll help you pack your bag.

232
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,968
It’s okay. I’m fine.

233
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:43,139
I can do it.

234
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,306
I’ll do it.

235
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,451
Where is your dad?

236
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:48,816
He’s on his way.

237
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:53,111
I made up my mind.

238
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:57,746
I’ll talk to your dad that I will move in to live with you at your condo.

239
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,611
Are you sure?

240
00:23:02,794 --> 00:23:03,428
Yes.

241
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:06,205
If I wait for you to do the talk, we will probably graduate first.

242
00:23:13,254 --> 00:23:16,204
If I didn’t have you, I would have had a hard time.

243
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:17,468
Thank you so much.

244
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:20,371
It’s okay It’s not a big deal.

245
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:24,499
Dad.

246
00:23:27,795 --> 00:23:28,712
I…

247
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:30,862
What?

248
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:35,905
Who will take care of him after he is discharged from the hospital?

249
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:37,607
I’ll do it.

250
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,511
I can go see him in the morning and leave in the evening.

251
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,457
I need to ask you to take care of him when he is at the college during the day.

252
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:45,136
Or should you move back home?

253
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:46,955
No, Dad.

254
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:49,105
It’s far from the college. I don’t want to bother you.

255
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:50,607
It’s not a big deal for me.

256
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:53,908
How about this?

257
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,103
I’ll take care of him.

258
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,770
(Khao.)

259
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:01,831
Oh.

260
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:05,160
That will be great.

261
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,617
Your dorm is close to his condo.

262
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:11,226
You can go visit him often.

263
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,525
But there’s one thing I’m worried about.

264
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:20,922
Do you feel uncomfortable to do that?

265
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:23,644
Not at all.

266
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,970
You are a woman.

267
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:31,808
If you often come to visit him at his condo,

268
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:35,208
people may gossip about you.

269
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,568
I’m worried about that.

270
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:40,560
You don’t need to worry about it.

271
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:43,324
I won’t go to his condo alone.

272
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:47,416
Som-O and Chadjen can take turns to come with me.

273
00:24:47,813 --> 00:24:48,579
Really?

274
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:49,998
That’s great.

275
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:53,554
I’ll go get the car and wait for you at the entrance.

276
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:54,967
See you.

277
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,503
Give me his bag.

278
00:24:57,148 --> 00:24:58,057
Thank you.

279
00:24:58,693 --> 00:24:59,466
See you.

280
00:25:06,302 --> 00:25:07,610
You didn’t help me talk to your dad.

281
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:12,823
See? I told you that my dad would oppose the idea.

282
00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:15,122
You can’t move in with me.

283
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:17,908
Then we don’t have to tell him.

284
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,011
Are you serious?

285
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,351
Yes.

286
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,336
Let’s go.

287
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:34,681
Here.

288
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:43,546
What do you want to tell me?

289
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,939
I’m going to give an update.

290
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:49,711
I talked to Chad.

291
00:25:51,226 --> 00:25:54,063
I asked him why he was mad at me.

292
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:56,937
I also asked him what you have asked me.

293
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:04,004
So what happened?

294
00:26:05,537 --> 00:26:06,500
What did he tell you?

295
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,222
He didn’t say anything.

296
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:15,434
You got me excited for nothing.

297
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:19,395
But…

298
00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:23,511
He…

299
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:26,210
He kissed me.

300
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:31,277
Really?

301
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:32,419
Yes.

302
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:35,499
I’m happy for you.

303
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:42,419
But…

304
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,007
Does this mean we are dating?

305
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:51,817
Khao, stop it.

306
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:54,327
Stop teasing me.

307
00:26:58,431 --> 00:26:59,714
Is this real?

308
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:02,459
You will know it.

309
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,460
Know what?

310
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:11,700
You will know what you need to do next when you are dating.

311
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:32,005
I have a tip to tell you.

312
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:33,808
What tip?

313
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:39,402
In our college, there is a sacred bridge for lovers.

314
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,973
Why don’t you ask Chadjen to go ride a bike there?

315
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:47,368
It’s believed that if a couple rides a bike and crosses the bridge without their legs touching the ground,

316
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:51,385
Their love will be long-lasting and it proves that this is a true love.

317
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:54,909
Did you do it?

318
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:56,325
Of course.

319
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,263
Why would I tell you if I haven’t done it?

320
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:01,263
How was it? Was it hard?

321
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:04,691
No. You just ride a bike as usual.

322
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:07,013
If you can cross the bridge, it’s done.

323
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:08,407
Do I need to lift my legs high?

324
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:11,251
I don’t think you need to you that.

325
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:12,801
Your legs aren’t that long.

326
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:14,795
Khao. How can you say that?

327
00:28:21,388 --> 00:28:22,005
Hey.

328
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,234
Have you ever heard the myth about the sacred bridge for lovers in our college?

329
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,025
No.

330
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:32,124
It’s said if a couple rides a bike and successfully crosses the bridge

331
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:34,930
without their legs touching the ground

332
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:38,909
Their love will be long-lasting and it’s a true love.

333
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:40,259
A myth?

334
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:42,805
Who told you?

335
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:49,820
It’s believed that if a couple rides a bike and crosses the bridge without their legs touching the ground,

336
00:28:50,342 --> 00:28:53,816
Their love will be long-lasting and it proves that this is a true love.

337
00:28:55,983 --> 00:29:01,174
I think love is about two people.

338
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:03,853
The bridge has nothing to do with it.

339
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,379
You ride the bike.

340
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:07,509
You have to cross the bridge.

341
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:10,020
Come on, Chad.

342
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,017
Fine.

343
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:14,109
Chad.

344
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:16,106
Get on.

345
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:17,518
I’m getting on.

346
00:29:22,903 --> 00:29:23,705
Hold on tight.

347
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:25,951
I’m doing it.

348
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,454
Don’t forget.

349
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:29,705
Your legs cannot touch the ground.

350
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:34,217
You should worry about your legs.

351
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:36,942
Why do I need to worry about them? My legs are short.

352
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:41,340
One, two, three.

353
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:43,948
Don’t let your legs touch the ground

354
00:29:44,274 --> 00:29:44,934
Keep going, Chad.

355
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:46,060
Keep going. Keep going.

356
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:47,768
Don’t stop.

357
00:29:50,992 --> 00:29:52,579
Chad, watch out for the rock.

358
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:54,688
Don’t let your legs touch the ground.

359
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:56,315
Chad. No.

360
00:29:57,411 --> 00:29:58,536
Stay still.

361
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:00,207
Som, did your legs touch the ground?

362
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:01,382
No. Not at all.

363
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,367
I’m lifting my legs.

364
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:03,872
We are almost there, Chad.

365
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:06,148
- We’re almost there.
- We’re almost there.

366
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:07,542
We’re almost there.

367
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:15,571
We made it, Chad.

368
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:16,657
Chad.

369
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:18,712
We made it.

370
00:30:19,677 --> 00:30:20,668
Well done.

371
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:22,896
Did your legs touch the ground before we crossed the bridge?

372
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:24,303
No.

373
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:26,611
Did your legs touch the ground?

374
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,106
No.

375
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:29,367
Are you sure?

376
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:30,457
Yes.

377
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:32,229
So…

378
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,856
Shall we do it again?

379
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:34,859
- Sure. - Shall we?

380
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:35,684
Sure.

381
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:37,509
Where are you going?

382
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:49,019
Your record is getting better.

383
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,614
If you keep doing well until you get a gold medal, it will be great.

384
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:56,900
What’s wrong?

385
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:00,727
I have something to ask from you, Dad.

386
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:02,561
Say it.

387
00:31:03,616 --> 00:31:05,216
Can I go back to Thailand before the competition?

388
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:06,810
Are you crazy?

389
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:09,016
How can you leave the training camp before the competition?

390
00:31:10,177 --> 00:31:11,579
It’s very important to me.

391
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,600
What’s more important than the competition?

392
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:16,499
Is it about a girl?

393
00:31:19,782 --> 00:31:21,314
Can I go back for two days?

394
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:29,847
I’ll improve my record to 48 seconds.

395
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,361
The Asian record is 48.49 seconds.

396
00:31:34,856 --> 00:31:36,308
Are you saying you can break the record?

397
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:40,810
If I’m going to be a champion, I want to be a memorable one.

398
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:44,871
I’m not kidding.

399
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,623
Fine, I’ll give you two days.

400
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:54,001
Don’t forget to keep your promise.

401
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:55,838
Yes, Dad.

402
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,137
Yes, Coach.

403
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:01,505
I’ll keep my promise.

404
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,936
Sometimes, it’s good if athletes have inspiration.

405
00:32:18,211 --> 00:32:22,219
Som told me you would come to have a meal with us this weekend.

406
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:23,767
So I did my best to prepare the food.

407
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:25,219
Please enjoy it.

408
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:30,514
We haven’t had a meal together like this for some time.

409
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:32,914
We usually have a meal just the two of us.

410
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:34,020
It’s so lonely.

411
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:38,208
Chadjen, how are you doing?

412
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,617
Are you busy with school?

413
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,219
I’m doing okay.

414
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,502
Chadjen is doing well.

415
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:47,608
He will graduate from the med school soon.

416
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:49,463
Look at Som.

417
00:32:52,463 --> 00:32:53,056
Mom.

418
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:00,862
Here is steamed egg, your favorite dish.

419
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,331
Som, how is school?

420
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:18,440
Do you enjoy it?

421
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:20,508
Yes, I do.

422
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,462
Is there any guy hitting on you?

423
00:33:30,397 --> 00:33:32,016
I thought you weren’t listening.

424
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:34,167
I’m listening.

425
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:37,577
If a guy is hitting on you, you need to tell me right away.

426
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:42,114
You can’t choose a random stranger to date.

427
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,114
Don’t worry, Dad.

428
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,499
Chadjen is keeping guys away from me.

429
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:50,875
Is that true, Chadjen?

430
00:33:52,235 --> 00:33:52,854
Yes.

431
00:33:54,037 --> 00:33:55,059
Now, I am relieved.

432
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:01,217
If there’s a guy hitting on her, you need to tell us right away.

433
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:03,060
Sure.

434
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:19,890
Are you here to study or to sleep?

435
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:23,927
The library is cold.

436
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:31,413
Hey.

437
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:34,208
Can you turn the page for me?

438
00:34:34,565 --> 00:34:36,810
I don’t want to take my hands out of the blanket. It’s cold.

439
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,760
Can’t you do it yourself?

440
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:44,760
I’m cold.

441
00:34:50,226 --> 00:34:50,808
Hey.

442
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:52,808
Do it again.

443
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,767
Did you finish the page?

444
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:56,416
Yes.

445
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:07,613
Hey.

446
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:09,402
Aren’t you cold?

447
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:12,619
Do you want to share the blanket with me?

448
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,980
The blanket is too small for us.

449
00:35:19,177 --> 00:35:20,506
It’s big enough for us.

450
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,780
The rabbit print is perfect for you.

451
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:23,216
It’s okay. You can use it.

452
00:35:23,896 --> 00:35:24,915
Take it.

453
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:28,825
Didn’t you say you are cold?

454
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,920
Everyone, please come to take a look.

455
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,780
Come on, come to take a look at my photos.

456
00:35:33,902 --> 00:35:34,918
Come on in.

457
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:37,122
Please come to take a look.

458
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:40,023
I proudly present this photo.

459
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:43,908
I named it “The Ultimate Shipped Couple.”

460
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:47,154
How is it? Don’t they look cute together?

461
00:35:49,874 --> 00:35:51,308
I secretly took the picture.

462
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:53,308
The Ultimate Shipped Couple?

463
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,674
Why aren’t there any photos of our couple?

464
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,662
Here they are. The couple in the photo.

465
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:05,712
Does the photo look great?

466
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,508
The photo is cute.

467
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,106
Don’t you think?

468
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:15,638
You think so?

469
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,768
How is it? Does it look cute?

470
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,143
He must feel shy.

471
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,108
Khao.

472
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:29,096
Chadjen is mad at me.

473
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,219
Let’s get back to my photos.

474
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:32,340
Follow him.

475
00:36:32,828 --> 00:36:33,437
Go.

476
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:37,605
Hey.

477
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:38,414
Chad.

478
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:40,157
Chadjen.

479
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Chadjen.

480
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:45,866
Chadjen.

481
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,450
Are you that mad about the photo?

482
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:53,598
If people get the wrong idea, you may be negatively affected.

483
00:36:55,185 --> 00:36:56,708
Are you that worried about it?

484
00:36:57,546 --> 00:37:01,706
Or are you embarrassed if people know you are dating a mess like me?

485
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,945
Let go of me. I’ll take the photo down.

486
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:07,854
You don’t need to do that.

487
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,808
Everyone already saw it.

488
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:13,303
Forget it.

489
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,474
Let’s go back to our dorm.

490
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:25,404
Come on. Let’s go back to our dorm.

491
00:37:29,444 --> 00:37:30,105
Fine.

492
00:37:40,513 --> 00:37:42,150
Why are you so mad about it?

493
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:14,705
Hello. What’s up, Tao?

494
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:16,705
I saw the photo.

495
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:18,705
It’s not some kind of prank you, is it?

496
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,466
No.

497
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,011
Good.

498
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,605
Tao, I have something to tell you.

499
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,960
What?

500
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:48,321
Chad and I,

501
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:51,263
(We are dating.)

502
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:06,808
Congratulations, Som.

503
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,142
Thanks…

504
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:16,416
I got to go. Coach calls me to practice.

505
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,226
Bye.

506
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,570
(ONE WEEK LATER)

507
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:06,010
Come on, Khao.

508
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:09,614
- Hello, Chadjen and Som-O. - We are here.

509
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,817
The competition is over?

510
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:14,256
See? We missed it.

511
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:16,256
Tao won.

512
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:17,348
I tell you the result.

513
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,343
Khao, it’s because you took so long to make your hair bun.

514
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:24,008
Let’s eat.

515
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,911
Calm down.

516
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:36,619
Do you want another bite?

517
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:58,210
I won the gold medal for all Thais.

518
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,859
Thank you, everyone, for cheering on me.

519
00:41:04,451 --> 00:41:08,108
Tao, do you have anything to say to your special someone?

520
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,650
Dad.

521
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,810
I’ll break the record.

522
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:25,845
That’s it?

523
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,115
Why didn’t he say anything about us?

524
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,405
He must be nervous. He only talked about Coach Yut.

525
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:37,020
This is strange.

526
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:39,755
Tao won. That’s a good thing.

527
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,108
Let’s take a selfie and send it to him.

528
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:43,497
Good idea.

529
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,748
Do you see the screen?

530
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,272
Khao, come closer.

531
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:57,997
Okay.

532
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,659
(Congratulations. We are celebrating for you.)

533
00:42:04,798 --> 00:42:06,312
I look really cute in the photo.

534
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:08,417
Tao must be happy to see it.

535
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:13,014
Don’t I look cute?

536
00:42:13,848 --> 00:42:14,539
So cute.

537
00:42:19,365 --> 00:42:22,008
I told Tao that I am dating Chad.

538
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:25,013
Huh?

539
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:31,208
I have another thing I want to tell you.

540
00:42:33,742 --> 00:42:35,179
I’m moving out to a dorm outside the campus.

541
00:42:36,402 --> 00:42:37,048
Som.

542
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:39,662
Do you want to move in with me?

543
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,835
When you study late, you don’t have to worry about the dorm’s closing time.

544
00:43:10,684 --> 00:43:15,620
Som lies to her parents that she moved to live with me.

545
00:43:15,974 --> 00:43:19,380
If they find out, it will be a disaster.

546
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,066
Your dad is here.

547
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,277
What are you doing?

548
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:29,543
Why aren’t you wearing any clothes?

549
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:31,383
You should be fully clothed when you…

550
00:43:32,866 --> 00:43:35,514
(We are going to visit you at the condo.)

551
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:37,162
My parents are coming here.

552
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,503
Dad.

553
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,361
There is no secret in this world.

554
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:48,139
If I tell them the truth, they will separate us. I’d rather keep lying to them.

555
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:53,454
Chadjen, Som-O, I have something to tell…

556
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:56,656
Damn it.

557
00:43:56,774 --> 00:43:59,142
Did you call Chadjen?

558
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,142
So do you have a girlfriend?

559
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:02,343
I’m living in a condo.

560
00:44:02,442 --> 00:44:03,614
Are you living with a girl?
