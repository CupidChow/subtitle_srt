1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:00,955
Chad.

2
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:04,253
Som-O, since you’re dressed as a servant,

3
00:00:04,275 --> 00:00:05,207
come and take a photo for us.

4
00:00:06,226 --> 00:00:08,149
Chad, thanks for what you did back there just now.

5
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:11,270
What is it?

6
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:12,856
Cardiac arrhythmia.

7
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:16,061
Everyone misses you, and misses messing with you.

8
00:00:16,232 --> 00:00:17,809
I really miss you, too.

9
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:21,664
I trust you, Khao.

10
00:00:21,826 --> 00:00:24,915
I’m trusting you to look after him for me.

11
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:25,964
Alright?

12
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:26,966
Of course.

13
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:27,881
No problem.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

15
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:41,686
Please take care of Sassawat.

16
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,121
Excuse us. Goodbye.

17
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,341
Let’s go.

18
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:53,364
New, if you start to feel unwell, you need to tell your teacher right away.

19
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,500
Do you have your medicine with you?

20
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,669
Yes.

21
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:56,418
Good.

22
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,706
- Don’t worry. - If you feel sick, tell your teacher that you need to take your medicine.

23
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:02,706
Hello.

24
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:04,304
Hi, Khao.

25
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:06,709
I heard that today is New’s first day back to school.

26
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:07,643
So I’m here to wait for him.

27
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:08,712
You wait for him?

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,606
Great. Now, I can feel relieved.

29
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,304
Why are you looking at me?

30
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:19,660
Khao, when you have free time, I’ll buy you a meal.

31
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,563
Thank you but I don’t want to bother you.

32
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,306
It’s not a big deal. You helped me take good care of New.

33
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:29,000
But today is not good. I have other plans and need to go now.

34
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,809
Have a good day.

35
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:31,772
Goodbye.

36
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:32,583
Goodbye, Dad.

37
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,749
Don’t forget to take your medicine.

38
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,907
Got it.

39
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,055
Let’s go to our classroom.

40
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:44,580
When did you become close with my dad?

41
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,400
When you were unconscious.

42
00:02:56,673 --> 00:02:58,209
Our school is just the same.

43
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:00,661
It was a bit boring without you.

44
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:04,572
It’s like going back to my first year at this school.

45
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,033
I’ll get to meet my friends again.

46
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:09,953
You won’t feel lonely anymore.

47
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,093
Because many assignments are waiting for you.

48
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:17,563
Don’t worry.

49
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:21,412
I prepared everything for you, young master.

50
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:25,070
Am I a burden to you?

51
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:26,704
Not at all.

52
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,080
You need to get ready for the admission exam.

53
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:31,935
This time, you need to get a full score.

54
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:34,806
Yes.

55
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,949
Don’t worry about it.

56
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:41,975
Chill out.

57
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,698
Turn to page 586.

58
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,398
In the graph of the given function,

59
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,043
the absolute maximum is the point with the highest y-value.

60
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:55,700
Do you know which one is the highest point?

61
00:03:58,486 --> 00:03:59,203
Which one is it?

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,121
It’s written over here.

63
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:04,695
Chadjen is so strict.

64
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,049
Som-O.

65
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:09,103
What are you doing?

66
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:10,929
Which page did you turn to?

67
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:12,920
Is it page 586?

68
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:18,710
The question is not on that page.

69
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:26,358
The letters are so tiny. Just looking at it, I already feel dizzy.

70
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:29,021
The minimum score is that high?

71
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,512
With Chad’s score, he can definitely get in.

72
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:33,623
No need to worry.

73
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:36,063
I shouldn’t be overconfident.

74
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:37,909
Fine.

75
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,860
Som, what faculty are you going to choose?

76
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,207
I need to get a high score in the upcoming admission exam.

77
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:44,858
I won’t mess up the exam like the last time.

78
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:47,116
But last time, your score was less than 100.

79
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,218
This time, I’ll get over 100 points.

80
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,178
Watch me.

81
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,380
Som, are you sure you can do it?

82
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:57,544
The minimum score is 25,000 points.

83
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:01,210
With your score, I think it’s not too late to change your mind.

84
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:04,018
Her score is none of your business.

85
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:05,410
Let me see.

86
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,330
I’m going to choose this faculty.

87
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,409
Faculty of Education.

88
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,438
Tao, do you want to be a teacher?

89
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:16,101
Yes.

90
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,675
You are so gullible.

91
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,241
He will definitely choose the Faculty of Sports Science.

92
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:24,460
He will get in through the sports quota without a doubt.

93
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:26,460
It’s not that easy.

94
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,866
If I fail the interview, I will be in trouble.

95
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,250
I’m going to choose the Faculty of Liberal Arts.

96
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:36,015
You’re going to change your study path?

97
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,164
It’s the field I’m good at. My dad also supports it.

98
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:42,306
I’m going to choose this faculty.

99
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,820
If I want to work at NASA, a physics major is my only choice.

100
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:48,689
Khao, you are the best.

101
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:55,018
If we all get into the same college, it will be fun.

102
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,018
I agree.

103
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,876
So I’ll see you all in college.

104
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:02,660
Let me take a look.

105
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:05,401
What the heck? Everyone is looking at it.

106
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,083
Can’t I see it?

107
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,587
Your future looks like this blank paper.

108
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:12,780
You are not different from me.

109
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,835
Who else wants to see it?

110
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,060
Som-O, honey.

111
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:27,375
Come here.

112
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,618
Come here.

113
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:30,618
Come and make a prayer.

114
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,887
Listen to me, think of only good things.

115
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:44,040
So today will be your good day.

116
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,121
That’s right.

117
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,460
She’s serious about making the wish.

118
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,207
Give this to Chad. So you both will have good luck.

119
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:02,555
You should go now otherwise you may be late.

120
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,749
Did you have everything you need?

121
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:05,806
Yes, Mom.

122
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:07,844
I got to go. Goodbye, Mom and Dad.

123
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,056
Don’t forget to take the steamed bun.

124
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:11,126
I’m leaving.

125
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:12,658
Wait, wait.

126
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,529
You haven’t lit the firecrackers.

127
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:16,318
Come on.

128
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,536
It will bring good luck to you.

129
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,726
It’s done.

130
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,909
I got to go now, Dad.

131
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,909
Good luck.

132
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,164
The exam result is out.

133
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,515
What are you excited about?

134
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:46,896
Look. My scores are higher than the last time.

135
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,873
Last time, I got 50 points for math and 65 points for science.

136
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,286
Khao, how is your result?

137
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:56,124
Let me check.

138
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:08,716
(My goodness!)

139
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,767
I think Chadjen’s scores must be very high.

140
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:15,933
Chadjen, Tao, come here.

141
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,701
Chadjen I think you probably break the national record.

142
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:38,223
But I don’t think I should feel relaxed.

143
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:42,209
I think you can feel relaxed for a bit.

144
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,112
You did well too.

145
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:46,983
Som, good job.

146
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,867
(Som, you can do it. Your scores are much higher now.)

147
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:10,726
What are you doing?

148
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:13,815
There’s a flower on your head.

149
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,500
Today is our last day at school.

150
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:21,941
How do you feel?

151
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,372
I don’t know.

152
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,535
Huh?

153
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:27,896
You don’t feel anything?

154
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:34,563
This may be our chance to go to the same school.

155
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:36,304
Our houses are located so close.

156
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,106
We can see each other any time.

157
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,021
Anyway.

158
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:46,106
Thank you for tutoring me. My scores are much higher.

159
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:50,023
It was because you worked hard.

160
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:51,915
I think you can’t…

161
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:52,909
I can’t relax yet.

162
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:54,760
I know.

163
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,460
Have you decided which school you will choose?

164
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,309
I’ll choose the same school as you.

165
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,216
Med school.

166
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,753
Are you serious?

167
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:09,103
Half of it depends on the exam scores. The other half depends on luck.

168
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:12,341
I already brace myself in case I don’t get in.

169
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,307
For the second choice, I’ll choose…

170
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:22,307
dentistry school.

171
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,552
My third choice will be pharmacy school.

172
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,610
My fourth choice will be nursing school.

173
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,718
What do you think?

174
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:32,378
If I choose this field of study, we will work in the same field.

175
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:33,660
Isn’t it great?

176
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,218
Good.

177
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:40,021
Good, right?

178
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,960
We’re going to be late for school.

179
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:44,829
Let’s go.

180
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,081
- Why don’t you hurry? - Don’t hit me.

181
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:49,149
Hurry up.

182
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:52,587
Walk faster. Come on.

183
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,556
This teacher will give you a lesson.

184
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:58,010
Let me teach you a lesson.

185
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:01,898
Wait for me.

186
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,306
Chadjen.

187
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,732
Can I put stickers on your shirt?

188
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,507
Yes.

189
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:17,298
Chadjen, what school are you going to?

190
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,846
Probably, med school.

191
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:22,578
Som.

192
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:25,666
Can I put a sticker on you?

193
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,820
I hope you get into the college that you want.

194
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:33,293
My turn.

195
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:37,021
I hope you are selected to join the national team and compete at the Olympic Games.

196
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,109
You can do it.

197
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,135
Take it back.

198
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,706
You ruin it.

199
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:43,970
Tao. Som-O.

200
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,470
Can I put a sticker on you?

201
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,281
Me, too.

202
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:49,720
I’ll put it on you too.

203
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,606
Congratulations.

204
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:53,741
- This is cute. - You got many stickers.

205
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,207
Want more stickers?

206
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,012
That’s okay.

207
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:21,052
I hope you get well soon.

208
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:23,713
So you will…be happy.

209
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,209
Thank you, Khao.

210
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:29,276
I’ll put a sticker on you too.

211
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:32,761
I’ll choose this colorful one.

212
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:38,576
A yellow one, too.

213
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:42,124
Can you write a message for me?

214
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,307
Give me your back.

215
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,270
Are you done?

216
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:53,413
Yes.

217
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:54,972
What did you write?

218
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:56,681
Read it when you get home.

219
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:59,520
You will never forget it.

220
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,970
(Feel free to kick me.)

221
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:10,650
Why did you kick me?

222
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:12,293
Let’s kick him.

223
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,298
Kick him, kick him, kick him.

224
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:22,733
Hello.

225
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:25,301
We have been together for three years.

226
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,823
Today, I feel sad.

227
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,556
Because I will no longer have a chance to scold you.

228
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,409
I want to say this to you.

229
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:43,180
You are now adults who know what you are doing.

230
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:45,935
I want you to be confident.

231
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:50,316
When you are an adult, you will be scolded by many people.

232
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,136
But no one will care about you as much as I do.

233
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:59,676
I want you to remember the past three years.

234
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:12,766
Whether it was a good or bad time,

235
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,766
your days here will never come back.

236
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:46,303
I wish you good luck and success.

237
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,718
I hope you grow up and become good people.

238
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:51,660
Don’t let anyone look down on you.

239
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:54,423
Promise me.

240
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,093
Yes.

241
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:02,649
Why are you such a crybaby?

242
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,850
(Good luck, Grade 12 Class 2.)

243
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,067
Hey.

244
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,806
Do you want me to write you a message?

245
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,821
What?

246
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:18,187
Do it.

247
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,716
Where should I write it?

248
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,664
Excuse me.

249
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:30,189
Chad, can you write a message for me?

250
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:33,420
I’ll keep it as a good memory between us.

251
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:38,707
We will meet again at the med school anyway, right?

252
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,164
Me, too.

253
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:43,538
See you at the med school, Lily.

254
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,664
Here. I’ll write you a message.

255
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:47,529
Come on.

256
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,350
Stay still otherwise it will come out bad.

257
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:53,267
What are you writing?

258
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,484
Just a sec. I’m almost done.

259
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,854
(See you, Lily.)

260
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:57,868
Done.
(See you, Lily.)

261
00:16:57,869 --> 00:16:58,170
(See you, Lily.)

262
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:02,615
Chad, aren’t you going to write a message for me?

263
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:07,803
My message is the same as Som-O’s.

264
00:17:08,713 --> 00:17:09,503
See you.

265
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,816
Move.

266
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,330
(We will always be in each other’s dream – Min ♡ Fahsai.)

267
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:26,504
Stay still. It’s hard to write on your back.

268
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:44,900
Don’t look.

269
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:48,104
Chad.

270
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:54,212
Done.

271
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:56,603
Wait, the ink is not dry yet.

272
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:01,901
It’s dry now.

273
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:07,300
Your turn.

274
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:10,073
I’ll use the blue pen.

275
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:12,876
Where can you write?

276
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,607
What are you writing?

277
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:37,407
Wait a sec.

278
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,632
(Good luck with catching up with me.)

279
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:51,090
Done.
(Good luck with catching up with me.)

280
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,313
Done.

281
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:52,335
Done?

282
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,550
Yes.

283
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:54,612
What did you write?

284
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,769
Read it at home.

285
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,698
You two should take a picture together.

286
00:18:58,349 --> 00:18:59,698
I’ll take it for you.

287
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,340
Sure.

288
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,167
Alright.

289
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:10,535
One, two, three.

290
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:13,978
One, two.

291
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,258
What are you doing?

292
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,023
Wait for me.

293
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,072
Come in.

294
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:24,695
Everyone, let’s take a photo.

295
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:33,467
One, two, three.

296
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,230
You got a flower, nerd?

297
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:58,763
Of course.

298
00:19:59,096 --> 00:19:59,675
What?

299
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:00,593
I bought it.

300
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:09,860
You can go first.

301
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,723
Let’s go. It’s probably nothing.

302
00:20:22,216 --> 00:20:22,887
Let’s go.

303
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:27,615
There is Chadjen.

304
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,304
Sit down. Your mom wants to talk to you.

305
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:33,646
Chad, I came to see you right after I arrived.

306
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:35,781
Are you really here to see me?

307
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,009
I also came here to talk to your teacher.

308
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:44,732
What do you need to talk to her?

309
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,176
You are graduating from high school.

310
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:48,906
Soon you will go to college.

311
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:52,196
I want to know which college you are going to attend.

312
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,426
I think it would be better if you talk to Chadjen alone about it.

313
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,916
Chadjen’s scores are one of the national top rankings.

314
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:06,626
Don’t worry. He can choose any college he wants.

315
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,070
That makes me even more worried.

316
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:12,663
I don’t want to leave him here alone.

317
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:18,944
I told you that I don’t want to go.

318
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:30,812
Do you think he can get into the country’s top college?

319
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:32,910
Yes.

320
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:46,473
I’ll wait until the result is out.

321
00:21:47,387 --> 00:21:53,020
You need to get into the top med school.

322
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:56,053
If you fail to do it, you need to come with me.

323
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,610
Is that what you are here for?

324
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:02,330
Chadjen.

325
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:06,312
When will you see my good intentions?

326
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:11,615
I get it.

327
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,815
I’ll get into the top school.

328
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,781
Khao.

329
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:47,712
Let me help you.

330
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:50,681
You got a lot of stuff.

331
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,681
I’ll ask my dad to give you a ride home.

332
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:55,390
You can’t carry them all by yourself.

333
00:22:56,444 --> 00:22:58,267
It’s okay. I don’t want to bother your dad.

334
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,607
You don’t need to feel that way.

335
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,960
He keeps telling me that he misses you.

336
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:05,760
I think he wants to see you.

337
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:12,533
K		New, can I ask you something?

338
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:17,135
When you are in college, do you want to have a girlfriend?

339
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:19,360
Why did you ask me that?

340
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:22,224
I…

341
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:26,118
You can’t have a girlfriend.

342
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:27,652
Don’t even think about it.

343
00:23:30,146 --> 00:23:31,224
Just focus on your study.

344
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:32,910
Why?

345
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:38,081
If you have a girlfriend and you two have a falling out or break up,

346
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:40,890
your condition may be worsened.

347
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:44,709
Yes.

348
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:48,358
You can’t have a girlfriend.

349
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,576
Yes.

350
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:51,327
Let’s go.

351
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:52,810
Yes.

352
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:55,412
Let me help you.

353
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:20,926
Why do you look so moody?

354
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,764
Did someone confess their love to you?

355
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:24,918
No.

356
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:26,718
What about you?

357
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:31,375
Let’s go home.

358
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:40,476
I saw Aunt Aunya at school.

359
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,104
Is there something wrong?

360
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:45,913
No.

361
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,506
She just came here to see me.

362
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:55,524
You got many flowers today. Where are they?

363
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,223
I gave them to the janitor.

364
00:24:58,596 --> 00:24:59,710
If I take it home, it’ll throw them away anyway.

365
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:03,540
If those girls know, they will be crushed.

366
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,404
You didn’t get any flowers?

367
00:25:10,627 --> 00:25:11,798
What are you laughing?

368
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,326
Nothing. If you want one.

369
00:25:15,838 --> 00:25:17,009
Next time, I’ll give mine to you.

370
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,113
I don’t want your unwanted flowers.

371
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:35,546
Hello.

372
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:37,246
Come on in.

373
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:41,260
You haven’t stayed in Thailand during the Songkran holidays for a few years.

374
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:44,113
Eat as much as you want to fulfill your longing for Thailand.

375
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:46,413
Fon, did you make all the food by yourself?

376
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:47,618
It looks tasty.

377
00:25:48,675 --> 00:25:50,064
I’ll help you set the table.

378
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,821
Chad, Som is doing something at the back of the house.

379
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:57,140
Can you check on her for me?

380
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:59,209
I’m afraid she might cause mischief.

381
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:00,912
Sure.

382
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:06,863
She is a young adult now but she still causes mischief?

383
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,858
Don’t get me started.

384
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,221
Thank you.

385
00:26:18,424 --> 00:26:20,049
- I wish you success. - I wish you happiness.

386
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,670
I wish you happiness.

387
00:26:23,964 --> 00:26:25,690
I wish you a peaceful life.

388
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:27,915
I wish you happiness.

389
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,301
Thank you.

390
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,672
You are pretty. May you grow more radiant.

391
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,352
I wish you happiness.

392
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,704
Did you put ice in the water?

393
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:40,316
I’ll sprinkle the water back on you.

394
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,163
Happy Thai New Year, Dad.

395
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:46,721
I wish you happiness

396
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:48,863
Now, I’m 200% happy.

397
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:50,780
I’ll give half of my happiness to you.

398
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,135
Thank you.

399
00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:54,607
Here, Dad.

400
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,158
Thank you.

401
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:04,963
Let me give you my Songkran well wishes.

402
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:07,740
Come on.

403
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:09,160
Alright.

404
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:14,663
I wish you good health.

405
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:16,704
May you be a good father.

406
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:18,975
Be even a better father.

407
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,313
No one passes to play with us.

408
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:23,618
Right.

409
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,376
Then I’ll splash the wind.

410
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:28,573
Here we go.

411
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,421
Tao.

412
00:27:34,506 --> 00:27:35,358
Tao.

413
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:51,109
You only play with each other?

414
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,241
Why?

415
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:55,829
How could it be fun?

416
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:56,533
Come with us.

417
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:58,896
That’s right. Come with us.

418
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,606
Since it’s Songkran festival. Let’s go guys.

419
00:28:38,523 --> 00:28:39,163
Oh.

420
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:40,309
Khao.

421
00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:41,950
We got into the same college.

422
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:43,135
Really? Let me see.

423
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:45,130
It’s true. High five.

424
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:48,315
Yes!

425
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:49,583
This is great.

426
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:53,147
New, congratulations.

427
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:55,904
Soon you will follow my footsteps and become a famous writer.

428
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:57,300
Yes, Dad.

429
00:28:59,201 --> 00:28:59,700
Dad.

430
00:28:59,961 --> 00:29:00,610
Dad.

431
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,563
It’s out.

432
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:03,870
I got in, Dad.

433
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,750
That’s great.

434
00:29:06,341 --> 00:29:07,009
Good job.

435
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,215
I got in.

436
00:29:26,936 --> 00:29:28,961
Are you ready for the class, Dr. Som?

437
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,655
Yes, Dr. Chad.

438
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,266
Let’s go see patients.

439
00:29:42,152 --> 00:29:43,384
Som.

440
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:45,972
Som-O.

441
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:47,427
Did you check your admission result?

442
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,189
Som.

443
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:52,821
Dad. Mom.

444
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,469
The admission result is out, right?

445
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,692
I definitely get in.

446
00:29:57,789 --> 00:29:59,010
Did you see the result?

447
00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:04,804
No, I had a dream that I got accepted into a med school.

448
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,550
What?

449
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:09,606
The result is out, right?

450
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:11,983
The result.

451
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:20,121
Let’s help her look.

452
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,618
Hey.

453
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:32,520
There.

454
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,713
Gewalin, it’s not her name.

455
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:36,423
It’s not her.

456
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,109
It should be around here.

457
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:44,012
(Someone said when you reach a certain age.)

458
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:46,652
(You will meet a crossroad.)

459
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,580
It’s okay, sweetie.

460
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:01,112
You can go to another school.

461
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,784
No, Dad.

462
00:31:07,103 --> 00:31:08,210
Can you leave me alone?

463
00:31:38,253 --> 00:31:39,275
(At this crossroad.)

464
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:46,609
(I am left behind because I can’t catch up with my friends.)

465
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,067
Chad, you made it.

466
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:52,424
Yes, Mom.

467
00:32:58,675 --> 00:32:59,407
So…

468
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:05,243
I need to keep my promise, right?

469
00:33:18,884 --> 00:33:23,515
From now on, I will not force you to do anything.

470
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:33,807
While living here,

471
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,500
you need to take good care of yourself.

472
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:44,512
If you have a problem, you can always call me.

473
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:54,210
Med school is hard work.

474
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:01,573
You need to manage your time to get some rest.

475
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,249
Yes, Mom.

476
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:12,113
Congratulations.

477
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:17,973
Well done. You did well, sweetie.

478
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:45,903
Mom, can I go check on Som-O?

479
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:46,812
Sure.

480
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:15,518
Hello.

481
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:16,416
Hi.

482
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,221
Chad, how is your admission result?

483
00:35:19,276 --> 00:35:20,569
I got accepted into the school of my first choice.

484
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:24,115
See? I know you can do it.

485
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,606
Where is Som-O?

486
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:31,213
Can you go check on her?

487
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,981
She refuses to talk to us.

488
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:35,721
We are worried about her.

489
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:38,904
I told her that she could attend another school.

490
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,769
It’s alright if she attends an open admission college.

491
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,240
But she doesn’t listen to me.

492
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,618
I guess she really wants to go to that college.

493
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,623
I’ll go check on her.

494
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:55,707
Please take care of her for us.

495
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,363
Mom, I want to be alone.

496
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:20,316
It’s me, Som.

497
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,398
Can I talk to you?

498
00:37:07,204 --> 00:37:08,703
What are you going to do?

499
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,070
Why don’t you…

500
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:22,904
apply to an open admission college?

501
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:28,370
Your parents don’t have a problem with it.

502
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:47,370
What about taking the admission exam again next year?

503
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:09,513
Do you want to take a walk?

504
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:11,469
I’m disappointed with myself.

505
00:39:16,518 --> 00:39:17,309
It’s okay.

506
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:21,100
You can retake the exam next year.

507
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:27,010
That’s not it.

508
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,276
I don’t think I can go to the med school like you.

509
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,781
You can choose another school.

510
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,607
I don’t know what I want to study.

511
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:06,641
Som.

512
00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:13,929
You look very happy when you are drawing.

513
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:19,284
Why don’t you go to an art school?

514
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:32,223
What work can I do after I graduate, Chad?

515
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:41,109
I think right now you should focus on the exam.

516
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,218
You can think about your future later.

517
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:50,118
Don’t worry.

518
00:40:51,924 --> 00:40:53,006
I’ll help you with your study.

519
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,386
You said you’ll help me. Don’t forget it.

520
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:03,229
Yes.

521
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,498
Promise me.

522
00:41:34,615 --> 00:41:35,572
Mom. Dad.

523
00:41:36,169 --> 00:41:37,013
What?

524
00:41:39,156 --> 00:41:40,500
I’ll retake the exam next year.

525
00:41:40,906 --> 00:41:42,310
I’ll go to an art school.

526
00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:44,101
Huh?

527
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:50,783
Are you sure?

528
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:53,167
Yes.

529
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:55,543
If you want to go to college this year,

530
00:41:56,243 --> 00:41:57,543
you can attend an open admission college.

531
00:41:58,352 --> 00:41:59,543
Your mom and I are fine with it.

532
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:02,006
Now, I’m sure about what I like.

533
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:09,758
The thing that makes me happy is drawing.

534
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,870
I’ve been doing it all this time.

535
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:16,012
Som has liked drawing since she was young.

536
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,550
I never thought that you would be serious about it.

537
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:24,440
You are going to choose an art school next year.

538
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:25,909
Where are you going to attend?

539
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,924
I’ll go to the same college as Chad.

540
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:45,803
(Although I can’t go with them at this crossroad,)

541
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:48,543
(I can’t walk with you just like I’ve imagined.)

542
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:52,707
(Please wait for me. I’ll try to catch up with you.)

543
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,569
I’ll come back to help you with your study.

544
00:43:01,584 --> 00:43:02,873
I need to sort things out at my dorm first.

545
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,820
Chadjen, you got into this school.

546
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:10,118
Khao told me that Som-O asked Chadjen to help her with her study.

547
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:12,553
I thought you would help her just like before.

548
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,024
Chad bailed on me.

549
00:43:14,207 --> 00:43:16,100
I was lucky that Tao helped me with my study.

550
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,480
How is it? I ordered you the watermelon juice that you like.

551
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:21,969
You know me so well.

552
00:43:22,255 --> 00:43:26,923
If you spent time studying instead of chatting, you would have gotten into college.

553
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,473
Tao, you got accepted into the national team.

554
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,801
If you have something you want to do, do it.

555
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:32,212
You will go to the training camp soon.

556
00:43:32,544 --> 00:43:34,703
Som, do you remember the game we played on the New Year’s Day?

557
00:43:34,936 --> 00:43:37,655
The first person I wanted to see on the New Year’s Day was you.

558
00:43:40,072 --> 00:43:42,578
Khao, you don’t need to come to see me here.

559
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:43,540
Do I embarrass you?

560
00:43:43,686 --> 00:43:46,824
If I overstep your boundary, you can just tell me.

561
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,047
What are you doing here?

562
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:49,718
I need to talk to you.

563
00:43:50,386 --> 00:43:53,543
The person who should help Som with her study is you.

564
00:43:53,946 --> 00:43:55,110
Do you have feelings for Som-O?
