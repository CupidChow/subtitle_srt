1
00:00:00,226 --> 00:00:04,782
Som told her parents I’m her roommate.

2
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:08,149
Won’t it be a total disaster when they finally find out about this?

3
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:11,016
Your mother and I are on our way to your place.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,714
My parents are on the way here.

5
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:14,537
Oh, hello, guys.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,277
Hello. Hello.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,675
- Hello. - Hello.

8
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:20,945
If I told them the truth and they made us stay away from each other,

9
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:23,134
I’d rather keep lying like this.

10
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:25,100
But there’s no such thing as secrets, you know?

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,472
What did you just say, Chad?

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,320
I’m living with Som-O.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,490
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

14
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:36,407
You two…

15
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,303
have been living together all this time?

16
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,114
I’m really sorry.

17
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:50,010
Som, didn’t you tell us you were living with Khao?

18
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,770
I can’t believe…

19
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,014
that you have been lying to me all this time.

20
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:06,007
Then who is Khao living with?

21
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:07,514
She…

22
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,308
She’s living with New.

23
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,266
Dad, please hear me out.

24
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,000
I’ll talk to him.

25
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:38,211
But Mom…

26
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:39,453
Som.

27
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:45,671
Dad.

28
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:47,871
I can’t believe it.

29
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:51,610
This is normal for young people.

30
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:54,714
When they are dating, they want to live together.

31
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:55,601
Dating?

32
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:57,601
Don’t say that.

33
00:02:58,503 --> 00:02:59,730
You don’t think they are dating?

34
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:03,422
Wouldn’t it be strange if they were not dating but living together?

35
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:06,460
When did they start dating?

36
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:11,520
Come on. You can’t stop them from falling in love.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,217
At least, Chadjen is a good kid.

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,620
He’s not some random guy.

39
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,265
Look at what he did.

40
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,408
How can you say he’s a good kid?

41
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:25,536
It’s wrong that they didn’t tell us about living together.

42
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:29,533
But you can’t use one wrongdoing to judge him.

43
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,214
I can tell that he didn’t intend to lie to us.

44
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:35,008
You need to calm down.

45
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:37,497
Wait until they are ready to talk to us.

46
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:39,211
I have nothing to say to them.

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,272
Dad.

48
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:52,334
I don’t think what I do is that wrong.

49
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:58,339
Chad and I never did anything inappropriate.

50
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,662
You still don’t feel remorse for your action.

51
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,405
New, stop it. That’s not helping.

52
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:06,186
Som.

53
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,177
Even though you and Chad didn’t do it.

54
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,642
You two don’t sleep in the same room.

55
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:15,204
But from your parents’ perspective, who would believe that?

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,711
You talk like an expert.

57
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,780
What did you do to make your mom accept your choice?

58
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:25,602
I didn’t do anything.

59
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:30,939
She said if I love him, she will love him too.

60
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,444
You are so lucky.

61
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,610
New’s dad is also fine with this.

62
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,702
Is that what you think?

63
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:44,771
Tell her what we just went through.

64
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:49,183
My dad pressured me to marry Khao.

65
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:52,413
But I want to earn my own first.

66
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,413
He’s so outdated.

67
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,469
So what do you do?

68
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:02,410
I ask Khao to give me some time to deal with it.

69
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:06,007
I’m sure I can convince my dad to agree with our choice.

70
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:07,705
But it will take some time.

71
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,105
Our families are different.

72
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:16,567
I think you know your family best.

73
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,063
Cheer up. We will always be there for you.

74
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:25,968
Thank you so much.

75
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,114
Trust me.

76
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,422
Wait.

77
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:25,573
Thank you.

78
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,780
These are good stuff.

79
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:29,702
It has your favorite item.

80
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:31,570
I don’t need this from them.

81
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,911
How far have you gone with Som-O?

82
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,352
A man and a woman live together.

83
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,921
How could they resist the urges?

84
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,506
When did you start dating?

85
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,303
In the second semester of Som-O’s freshman year.

86
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,822
I’m very sorry.

87
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:34,059
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you sooner.

88
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,411
What is your plan for the future?

89
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,094
After graduating, I will work as an intern…

90
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:50,545
I’m talking about your plan with Som-O.

91
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,623
I will continue to date her.

92
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,897
Of course, you will do that.

93
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,608
But what will your relationship look like?

94
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:03,801
How will you continue to date her?

95
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,164
For how long?

96
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:11,813
Do you have a plan to marry her?

97
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:15,136
I’m not forcing you.

98
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,271
But she’s my daughter.

99
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:24,117
Dad.

100
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,915
We haven’t been dating for long. Why are you asking him about the future?

101
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,717
Can you just let us be together…

102
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,604
You are so irresponsible.

103
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:48,900
How could you let the debt pile up so much?

104
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,771
You know that I’m trying my best to solve it.

105
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:54,213
Trying your best?

106
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:58,217
You don’t even have a proper job.

107
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,808
If I knew that my life would end up like this, I would not have married you.

108
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:09,909
So?

109
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:12,582
Answer me.

110
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:18,810
What are you going to do?

111
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:42,231
Get out.

112
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,062
Get out!

113
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:46,611
Take your stuff back.

114
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:48,537
Dad.

115
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,518
Chadjen, I think you should leave.

116
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:01,909
Wait until he calms down and you can come back.

117
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:02,934
Please.

118
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:08,500
I’m very sorry.

119
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:19,909
Mom.

120
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:31,740
Som, I’m sorry.

121
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,708
I made your dad even more furious.

122
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:41,911
It’s okay.

123
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,250
My dad went too far when he asked you about the marriage plan.

124
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,622
You are not overthinking, right?

125
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:57,066
It’s okay.

126
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:01,002
I understand.

127
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:06,619
Although we fail this time, we can try again.

128
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,942
Thank you so much.

129
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,213
Dad, you have no right to pack my stuff.

130
00:11:58,725 --> 00:11:59,733
Why not?

131
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,992
I’m your dad.

132
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:09,601
When I see you make a bad choice, I have to stop you.

133
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:12,410
But...

134
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:15,106
But I didn’t do anything wrong.

135
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:17,804
You did nothing wrong?

136
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,703
Living with a guy, that is not wrong?

137
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:29,917
The guy is not even serious with you.

138
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,303
Why are you going to keep living with him?

139
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:35,512
Dad.

140
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:39,259
I’m not a kid anymore.

141
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:41,518
I can make my own decision.

142
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:46,957
If you want to take my stuff home, then do it.

143
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:49,693
But I’m not going with you.

144
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,840
You have to go with me.

145
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,512
Som, please go home. I’m begging you.

146
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:56,964
Please, honey.

147
00:12:57,282 --> 00:12:59,940
But I don’t want to go, Mom.

148
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:01,454
Look at how she is acting.

149
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,708
That’s enough. She’s going with us, don’t you see?

150
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:08,404
Even if I go home, he will not stop scolding me.

151
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:33,638
Hello.

152
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:39,616
Hello.

153
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:41,213
I’ll go wait in the car.

154
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:47,405
How is it?

155
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:50,211
Dad doesn’t listen to me.

156
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:54,103
Calm down. You shouldn’t be frustrated like your dad.

157
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:58,860
Don’t you think he goes too far?

158
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,602
Why doesn’t he trust me?

159
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,300
Som-O.

160
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:03,808
Let’s go.

161
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:07,482
I got to go.

162
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,508
Keep me posted.

163
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:57,939
How is Som doing?

164
00:14:58,487 --> 00:14:59,561
(She is making a fuss.)

165
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:01,407
(She is having a big fight with her dad.)

166
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:03,311
(She got separated from Chadjen.)

167
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,139
Thanks for telling me about this.

168
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:23,410
Tao.

169
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,411
You are leaving tomorrow morning. Why aren’t you packing?

170
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,103
My friend has a problem.

171
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:40,017
If your friend had a fight with her family about her boyfriend,

172
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,607
what would you do to help her?

173
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:44,659
That friend’s name is Som-O, right?

174
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,702
I saw that your room is full of cheering banners she made.

175
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,469
If you go comfort her,

176
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,408
when she makes up with her boyfriend,

177
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:57,872
they will forget about you.

178
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:10,274
Please eat something.

179
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:11,771
So you will have the energy to do things.

180
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:16,715
I’m not hungry.

181
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,066
Like father like daughter.

182
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,837
You both are so stubborn.

183
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,411
I’m not like her. I’m not being stubborn.

184
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:30,829
Do you remember when we were young?

185
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,915
When we fell in love,

186
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:36,160
We didn’t listen to anyone as well.

187
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:42,711
When you drove to my home, no one listened to what you had to say.

188
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,737
This is different.

189
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:48,216
No, it’s not.

190
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:51,902
But I really loved you.

191
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,909
I was serious about you.

192
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:59,570
How do you know that their love is not real?

193
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,810
Dad. Mom.

194
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:22,702
I decided to choose the science program.

195
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:25,306
But your grades are not high.

196
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:27,871
I’ll do my best.

197
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,857
I made up my mind. I’m going to choose med school.

198
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,696
Are you sure?

199
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:41,862
Of course, Dad.

200
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:54,675
It’s okay.

201
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:06,185
Dad. Mom. I decided to play football.

202
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,084
Are you sure you can do it?

203
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:10,213
Yes.

204
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:13,365
Alright. Show me your kick.

205
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:15,131
It hurts, Dad.

206
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:16,648
I’m sorry, honey.

207
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:20,216
Her wound is not that bad, Dad.

208
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,878
Not that bad? Look at her wound.

209
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,320
It must be really hurt.

210
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,260
- It hurts? - It hurts.

211
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,340
- It hurts?

212
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,896
I’ll blow it.

213
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,810
Chad.

214
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:58,216
I’m back.

215
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:33,660
(I hope my decision to leave home this time is the right decision.)

216
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,600
I thought I would never see you again.

217
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,014
Don’t overreact.

218
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,317
This is like a drama series.

219
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:52,906
Parents oppose their children’s relationship.

220
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:59,691
What did your parents say?

221
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:04,010
I don’t know.

222
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:08,102
Som.

223
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,496
Did you run away from home?

224
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:20,992
Yes.

225
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,312
I’m sorry for doing this.

226
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,108
Don’t worry about it.

227
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:54,109
It’s okay.

228
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:04,411
I…

229
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:10,420
Chad.

230
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:14,509
I decided to be with you.

231
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:17,517
You can tell me everything.

232
00:22:19,408 --> 00:22:21,001
There will be no secrets between us.

233
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:29,106
Everyone thought I had a slip of the tongue when I told your parents about us.

234
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:33,005
Why?

235
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:35,714
The truth is…

236
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,660
It was intentional.

237
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:42,340
Huh?

238
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:48,871
I thought we should tell them the truth.

239
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,820
If we are serious about this relationship.

240
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,374
You got us into trouble.

241
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:02,514
Actually, I’m the one who got us into trouble.

242
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:15,607
Let’s prove to my parents that we are serious about this relationship.

243
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:52,111
(I’m sorry that I can’t do what you want me to do.)

244
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:56,004
(I think I’m old enough to make a decision about this.)

245
00:23:56,592 --> 00:24:00,198
(I hope you won’t be mad and understand my decision.)

246
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:03,402
(I love you. Som-O.)

247
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,512
You are looking stressed all day.

248
00:24:12,148 --> 00:24:17,709
From my experience, I think Som made a bad choice this time.

249
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,065
If she gets hurt, we’ll just be there for her like we did.

250
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:27,808
You said like you agree with her decision.

251
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:30,970
We were once teenagers.

252
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:36,208
When you were in love, the way you acted was not different from Som.

253
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:37,994
But I…

254
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,413
The more you try to stop her, the further she will drift away from us.

255
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:44,500
That’s why I told you to calm down.

256
00:24:48,226 --> 00:24:48,912
Alright.

257
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,730
(ONE YEAR LATER)

258
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,908
Let’s take a photo together.

259
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:07,268
Step closer.

260
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:09,173
One, two, three.

261
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:11,380
Cheese.

262
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:15,991
(In a blink, one year already passed.)

263
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,416
- (Now, I’m a senior.) - One, two, three.

264
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:21,460
... two, three.

265
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,589
Yeah!

266
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:26,875
Great.

267
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:33,308
How about this? Khao’s parents and I will go to wait for you at the restaurant.

268
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,602
You and Khao can go there after you finish taking photos with your friends.

269
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:37,709
Yes, Dad.

270
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,622
Please follow me. The dinner is on me.

271
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:40,918
Shall we go to have Somtam for dinner?

272
00:25:41,162 --> 00:25:42,287
This way, please.

273
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:44,760
I’ll pay for it.

274
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:47,202
It looks like we are having Somtam for dinner.

275
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:50,856
Congratulations to the two new graduates.

276
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:52,614
Thank you, Som.

277
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:54,106
Thank you so much, Som-O.

278
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:59,108
New, you are such a sweet talker.

279
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:01,013
Chad.

280
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,405
Congratulations, Khao and New.

281
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:04,755
Here is your flower.

282
00:26:05,016 --> 00:26:05,752
Thanks.

283
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:06,933
Thank you.

284
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:07,937
Congratulations.

285
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:09,102
Thank you.

286
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,520
I have to hurry back.

287
00:26:14,863 --> 00:26:16,171
I have another class today.

288
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,312
Sorry.

289
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,780
So we don’t get to celebrate together?

290
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,857
That’s right.

291
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:23,505
I’m sorry.

292
00:26:25,937 --> 00:26:26,777
It’s okay.

293
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:29,152
Let’s take a photo together.

294
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:30,208
Good idea.

295
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,717
It’s too bad that Tao is not here.

296
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,717
Who said so? Wait a minute.

297
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:36,771
Excuse me.

298
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:40,146
Here.

299
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:42,700
Here he is.

300
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:44,542
He’s really here.

301
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:46,860
Let’s take a photo together.

302
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:48,360
Put it down.

303
00:26:48,594 --> 00:26:49,561
Put it here.

304
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:52,180
Alright.

305
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:52,825
Okay.

306
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:53,712
Okay.

307
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,112
Som-O, come to take a picture with us.

308
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:57,070
Come on.

309
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,105
Let’s take a selfie.

310
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,502
Selfie.

311
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:03,020
Khao.

312
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:04,247
One.

313
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,179
These are doctor’s exam rooms.

314
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:15,108
The doctors schedule to examine patients three times a day, at 8 am, 1 pm, and 6 pm.

315
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:22,785
This is the hospital pharmacy.

316
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:25,598
It distributes medicine prescribed by doctors.

317
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:50,614
Som.

318
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:52,758
Som.

319
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,016
You’re here.

320
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,659
Let’s go back to the condo.

321
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,324
Can you go back alone?

322
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:03,010
Huh?

323
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:05,465
I have a case discussion with my seniors.

324
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:08,548
But we made a plan for this.

325
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,260
Chad, let’s go.

326
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:14,017
I’ll be right after you.

327
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:16,143
I’m very sorry.

328
00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:53,700
Can you tell me your strength?

329
00:28:57,272 --> 00:28:58,512
I’m an open-minded person.

330
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:01,800
I’m ready to learn new things.

331
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:06,106
I’m not afraid to ask what I don’t know.

332
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,677
I’m not afraid to look like a fool in front of other people.

333
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:12,909
If it helps me improve myself and be better.

334
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:17,431
How do you see yourself in the next five or ten years?

335
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,709
Don’t stress about it.

336
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:47,914
You will do well next time.

337
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:55,417
I don’t know.

338
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:00,911
You don’t need to worry about earning your keep.

339
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:02,705
I’m not thinking about it.

340
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,482
I’m not worried about it but my dad…

341
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:10,105
I’m dating you, not your dad.

342
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:18,173
Everyone was praising me when I was in school because I got good grades.

343
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:21,272
Look at me now.

344
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:23,711
I have to work hard just like everyone else.

345
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,711
You know that, don’t you?

346
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,122
When I hear you say that, I feel even worse.

347
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:36,502
If you feel bad, you should realize whom you need to care about, me or your dad.

348
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:41,958
Khao.

349
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:45,662
Khao, let’s talk.

350
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:53,278
I’m stressed out.

351
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:54,911
Som, you need to get over it

352
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:59,503
Or why don’t you tell Chad you want to spend more time with him?

353
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:04,205
No, I don’t want to be an unreasonable girlfriend.

354
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:18,321
Why don’t you write down your schedules and find time that both of you are free?

355
00:31:19,574 --> 00:31:20,321
That’s right.

356
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,321
Thank you.

357
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:28,106
What are you stressing about?

358
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:33,210
Last night,

359
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:35,567
New and I had a fight.

360
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:38,715
You two?

361
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:40,875
You are usually so lovey-dovey.

362
00:31:41,183 --> 00:31:42,014
New.

363
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,801
He is so worried about his dad’s opinion that he has no confidence.

364
00:31:47,955 --> 00:31:51,431
Why is it so hard for boys to act mature?

365
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:55,909
I like that New is mature.

366
00:31:57,254 --> 00:31:59,622
But if he doesn’t learn to rebel sometimes,

367
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:01,497
he will never learn how to be an adult

368
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:09,109
I guess we are the only ones who are stubborn and give our parents a headache.

369
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,909
Let’s drink this to relieve our stress.

370
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,010
Yes.

371
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,040
Cheers.

372
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:27,648
I’m so stressed that my blood sugar drops.

373
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:31,183
If I gain weight, it’s Chadjen’s fault.

374
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,306
I haven’t had lunch.

375
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:38,411
I’m starving.

376
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,204
Complaining won’t make the hunger go away.

377
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:44,912
Chadjen.

378
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:46,576
Hey.

379
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:48,365
I got to go.

380
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:52,257
What are you doing here?

381
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,903
I have an appointment for a health checkup.

382
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:55,834
Oh.

383
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:59,628
How are things between you and Som-O?

384
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,737
It takes time to learn about relationships.

385
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:12,213
Even when women don’t say anything, it doesn’t mean they don’t feel anything.

386
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:17,004
Let’s stop talking about Som-O.

387
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:22,008
I actually have a big concern right now.

388
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,296
What is it?

389
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:25,268
It’s about my dad.

390
00:33:25,774 --> 00:33:29,167
Now, I’ve graduated. He is pressuring me to marry Khao.

391
00:33:29,512 --> 00:33:30,708
You too?

392
00:33:31,014 --> 00:33:32,109
You too?

393
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,342
I’m tired of it.

394
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,604
My dad is pressuring me.

395
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:38,334
Khao doesn’t understand me.

396
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:41,108
The girls keep saying that I am old-fashioned.

397
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,056
They think we want to be a leader and a head of the family.

398
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,859
But I just want to be self-sufficient before I settle down.

399
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:51,059
I want to feel financially secure.

400
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:59,222
I think it’s not different from being a doctor.

401
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:02,309
Before I can take care of my patients,

402
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,925
I need to know how to take care of myself first.

403
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:10,303
If we are not healthy, how can we take care of others?

404
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,016
Am I right?

405
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,660
Yes.

406
00:34:15,774 --> 00:34:17,114
Well said, Chadjen.

407
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:23,162
Chadjen, don’t you have a bedside learning with Professor Sarun?

408
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:24,967
Yes.

409
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,170
The professor is here.

410
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,361
Really?

411
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,308
I got to go.

412
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:31,872
Sure.

413
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:56,302
Khao.

414
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,703
Can we talk?

415
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:08,740
What we talked about the other night.

416
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,831
To be honest, I don’t need to be successful before I get married.

417
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,911
What do you mean?

418
00:35:19,754 --> 00:35:21,134
Explain it.

419
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:28,909
I don’t need to be successful before I get married.

420
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:31,702
I just want to be able to take care of myself first.

421
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,007
So I can take care of my family.

422
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,420
My family means you, Khao.

423
00:35:44,503 --> 00:35:46,405
And our children.

424
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,767
I don’t want to rush into things because my dad wants me to

425
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:55,720
and it ends up as a failure.

426
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,505
I get it.

427
00:36:05,752 --> 00:36:09,008
I guarantee that you didn’t pick the wrong man.

428
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:15,311
I have another thing I want to tell you.

429
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:19,416
What?

430
00:36:21,254 --> 00:36:22,275
I…

431
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:27,306
I make up my mind. I will no longer look for a job.

432
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:28,580
Huh?

433
00:36:29,574 --> 00:36:30,662
What do you mean?

434
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:35,109
I don’t want to be an office worker.

435
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:36,616
I want to be a game creator.

436
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,962
Are you sure?

437
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:42,700
Yes.

438
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:48,108
Being an office worker is not my thing.

439
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:50,284
I don’t want to force myself to do it.

440
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:53,530
Creating a game is my dream.

441
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,108
I want to make the dream come true.

442
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,663
Fine.

443
00:37:02,562 --> 00:37:04,376
Then you focus on creating your game.

444
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:07,709
I’ll be here to support you.

445
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:14,005
I’ll prove to my dad that I can do it.

446
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:39,617
Som, what are you doing?

447
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,617
Chad.

448
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,207
I’m making our calendar.

449
00:37:49,023 --> 00:37:50,103
I made it myself.

450
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,808
I spent the whole day to make it.

451
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:53,506
How do we use it?

452
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,305
The white boxes are the time when we both are free.

453
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,776
Although we don’t have much matching free time,

454
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,364
it’s better than having no time together like we did.

455
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,709
Can we talk about it tomorrow?

456
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:09,805
I have a quiz tomorrow.

457
00:38:12,597 --> 00:38:13,213
Fine.

458
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:22,414
(Even when women don’t say anything, it doesn’t mean they don’t feel anything.)

459
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:32,961
Som.

460
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,512
Are you feeling hurt that I don’t have time for you?

461
00:38:42,379 --> 00:38:43,500
You notice it?

462
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:52,148
Um…

463
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:56,173
Som, if you have something on your mind, you can always tell me.

464
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,906
Can I really say it?

465
00:39:00,844 --> 00:39:01,520
Yes.

466
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,918
Then…

467
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:11,517
Sit down.

468
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,810
To tell you the truth, I am a bit sad.

469
00:39:28,437 --> 00:39:32,220
After I make the calendar, I feel even sadder.

470
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:40,709
It’s clear to me that I’m only a tiny part of your life.

471
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:46,337
One more thing,

472
00:39:49,857 --> 00:39:51,832
I’m afraid.

473
00:39:54,550 --> 00:40:02,909
I’m afraid that my decision to go against my parents and move in with you is a mistake.

474
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:40,610
Tan said the medical ward is great.

475
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,888
His seniors often buy him meals.

476
00:40:42,094 --> 00:40:42,893
I’m jealous of him.

477
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:44,951
Keep your voice down.

478
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:47,013
We will get in trouble if someone hears it.

479
00:40:47,592 --> 00:40:49,274
I’m not afraid.

480
00:40:50,205 --> 00:40:52,561
Are you sure?

481
00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:56,651
Dao, I’m just kidding.

482
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,222
Take it. I bought it for you.

483
00:41:02,016 --> 00:41:04,008
Take it, Chad. She bought it for you.

484
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:06,531
I bought it for both of you.

485
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:08,518
Thank you.

486
00:41:13,477 --> 00:41:15,016
Dao, have a seat.

487
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,022
Sure.

488
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,469
Being 5th year medical student must be exhausting.

489
00:41:24,706 --> 00:41:25,303
Yes.

490
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:27,804
Are you busy with study?

491
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:31,967
Dao, of course, we are very busy.

492
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:36,173
But we are a bit more relaxed than in the 4th year because we are getting used to it.

493
00:41:36,423 --> 00:41:37,819
We are no longer the youngest ones here.

494
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,911
That is the best thing.

495
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,081
It’s great because you spend your time teasing the 4th year students.

496
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:46,136
Who will be as nice as you, Dr.Chadjen?

497
00:41:47,413 --> 00:41:51,976
Instead of teasing them, you should be studying for the national license exam.

498
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:53,739
You are so mean.

499
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,423
I’ll go prepare the drinks.

500
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,539
I’ll get the snack for you.

501
00:42:07,383 --> 00:42:08,554
Here, Chadjen.

502
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:11,914
It’s delicious. Try it.

503
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:13,910
Thank you.

504
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,168
I need to share this.

505
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:16,114
Do you need a fork?

506
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,718
Lily sends a message to me.

507
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,407
(Dr.Chadjen is having a fling with Nurse Dao.)

508
00:42:37,497 --> 00:42:38,205
What’s wrong?

509
00:42:39,176 --> 00:42:40,170
What happened?

510
00:42:45,794 --> 00:42:46,826
Look at the photo.

511
00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:50,962
What is it?

512
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:54,060
What the…

513
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:03,656
Nurse Dao is making a pass at your man.

514
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:08,217
(What the heck is this?)

515
00:43:08,665 --> 00:43:11,419
(What is happening with your life, Som-O?)

516
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:21,260
I’m worried about you, Som.

517
00:43:21,453 --> 00:43:24,779
Did you go to see Chadjen at the hospital lately?

518
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,414
We date someone who is not in our field of work.

519
00:43:29,642 --> 00:43:32,804
If our schedule is so different, we will get a headache

520
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:33,980
I agree.

521
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:35,576
Tao, when is your competition?

522
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,825
In two days.

523
00:43:37,274 --> 00:43:39,220
I still have several hours to hang out with you.

524
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,897
How long do you mean when you say soon? How many years?

525
00:43:42,311 --> 00:43:43,275
How many decades?

526
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,096
I think you should give up on your project.

527
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:48,604
I’m going home, Chad.

528
00:43:49,248 --> 00:43:50,709
I don’t want to be alone anymore.
