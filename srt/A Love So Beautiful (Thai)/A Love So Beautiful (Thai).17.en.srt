1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,955
Gosh. Didn’t he tell you that he has a new girlfriend?

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,284
Som-O.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,662
Have you ever regretted breaking up with me?

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,031
No.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,119
Hello, I’m Sue.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,120
I went to med school with Chadjen.

7
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:19,413
You need to eat a lot.

8
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:20,711
You have worked many shifts lately.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,782
What about you? Are you dating Sue?

10
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:27,626
Why?

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,697
Are you jealous?

12
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,231
Thank you.

13
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:39,822
This is to repay for the other night.

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,226
I think there’s another thing you forgot.

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,777
What did I forget?

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,297
Do you really not know?

17
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,000
I don’t know.

18
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,733
So say it.

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,364
Do I need to say it?

20
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:09,493
(No!)

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,813
(You can’t dream of something like that.)

22
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:13,386
(Enough now, Som-O!)

23
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:14,337
(Stop it.)

24
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:16,820
(You’re not allowed to move on in circles.)

25
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,964
Chadjen, I’m calling to tell you what you did last night was so wrong!

26
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,973
You can’t kiss me when you’re dating someone else!

27
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:34,026
I don’t want to be a homewrecker.

28
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:36,862
Don’t you feel even one bit sorry for Dr. Sue for what you did?

29
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,115
She’s your girlfriend, you know?

30
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:39,573
One more thing, I…

31
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,582
I’m over you. I’ve moved on ages ago!

32
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:46,888
If you’re going to be like this, don’t ever show your face again.

33
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,644
Are you listening?

34
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:58,133
(Uhh, this is Sue speaking, Som-O.)

35
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,662
Crap!

36
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:04,844
What should I do?

37
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,484
Sorry.

38
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:08,462
I’m so sorry.

39
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:10,417
I’m… sorry.

40
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:21,537
Come on!

41
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,946
(Why does this always happen to me!)

42
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,351
Dad, are you alright getting changed in there?

43
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
I am.

44
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:32,960
Stop worrying so much.

45
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,337
Som.

46
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,600
Last night, you and Chadjen—

47
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:44,330
Shh.

48
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,493
Dad could hear you.

49
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,200
Nothing happened.

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,911
You sure?

51
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,955
Of course.

52
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,040
Do you still like him?

53
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,880
I don’t feel anything anymore.

54
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,031
It’s been ages, you know?

55
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,484
Let me help.

56
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,311
It’s okay.

57
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,400
I’m fine.

58
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:31,448
At least lean on me.

59
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,382
Alright.

60
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,848
Careful, Uncle.

61
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,493
Thank you so much for coming here to give me a ride home, kid.

62
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,200
It’s alright.

63
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:52,648
You’re as good as being my Dad.

64
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,386
Oh, you sweet talker.

65
00:06:57,431 --> 00:07:02,177
Who’d have thought a celebrity like you would have time for me?

66
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,573
Oh, Uncle.

67
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,140
I’m no celebrity at all.

68
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:07,644
You’re not?

69
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,084
I saw someone asking for your photo just right outside.

70
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,382
Don’t make fun of me.

71
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:17,000
I’m sure your comic will be famous soon.

72
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,364
Famous?

73
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:20,080
With only 100 readers?

74
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:20,728
Trust me.

75
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:22,320
It’ll be great.

76
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,524
Mom.

77
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,755
I ran into Chadjen and he asked to tag along to see you.

78
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,693
Hello, Uncle.

79
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,253
Hello.

80
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:44,942
How are you doing?

81
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,800
Do you feel better now?

82
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:52,570
He’s much better, dear.

83
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,862
Thank you for coming.

84
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,031
Of course.

85
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,986
Congratulations. You can go home today.

86
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,262
Thank you for taking such good care of me, Doctor.

87
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,644
Thank you.

88
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,773
It’s no problem at all. It’s my job anyway.

89
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:23,662
Don’t forget to come in for a checkup in two weeks.

90
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,373
Right.

91
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,662
Can I talk to you for a minute, Som-O?

92
00:08:29,697 --> 00:08:32,844
(Is she going to beat me up like in a TV drama?)

93
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,075
Sue, no!

94
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:45,617
Sue, no!

95
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:07,160
I’m really sorry about Chadjen.

96
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:09,351
But I swear I won’t fall for him again.

97
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,040
I won’t get between you and Chadjen.

98
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,662
But Chadjen is still in love with you.

99
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,893
Actually, about Chadjen…

100
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,862
I lied.

101
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:27,991
What?

102
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,053
What’s going on?

103
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,733
Chadjen and I are just friends.

104
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:38,311
Chadjen is single.

105
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,924
I admit I’m intervening.

106
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,568
I see that you two are still in love but don’t seem to want to get back together.

107
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:51,280
I’m tired of seeing Chadjen like this so I had to help.

108
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,902
I’m so sorry if this has made you uncomfortable in any way.

109
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,440
I don’t think there’s anything we can do anymore about my relationship.

110
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,093
Are you sure?

111
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:11,937
Wait.

112
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,640
What you said just now…

113
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,897
Does that mean Chadjen knows about this?

114
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:17,955
No, he doesn’t.

115
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,568
He’s too much of an idiot to catch on.

116
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,977
You’re right.

117
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,253
I’ll forgive you this time.

118
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:29,715
But please don’t do anything like this again.

119
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:32,000
I would never.

120
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,742
Speaking of which,

121
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,204
did Chadjen stay over at your place last night?

122
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,440
No, he didn’t.

123
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,168
He really didn’t.

124
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,284
I want you to reconsider this, though.

125
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,164
Chadjen really is still in love with you.

126
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,613
There!

127
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:08,195
I knew it!

128
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,875
Dad.

129
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,653
What are you doing here so late?

130
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,728
Why aren’t you in bed?

131
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:16,871
Well, I’ve been calling you so many times and you didn’t pick up.

132
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,271
Every time I ask Khao about you,

133
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:21,697
she’s been avoiding giving me a straightforward answer.

134
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:26,480
I feel sorry for her for having such a lousy boyfriend like you.

135
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:29,128
I’m making a game, not playing it.

136
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,351
It’s exhausting, you know?

137
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:34,951
When I was young, I was a writer, right?

138
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,426
Well, I was a poor one, at least, because no one ever believed in me.

139
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,017
What did you do?

140
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,906
I fought for it. I fought tooth and nail for it.

141
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:44,977
I just really loved it.

142
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,191
I believe in you.

143
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,120
Do your best, New.

144
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,248
Thank you.

145
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,386
I have something I want to talk to you about.

146
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:57,380
I’ve been worrying about New lately.

147
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,964
I’m just afraid something bad might happen to him.

148
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,093
What’s happened?

149
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,533
New is working full-time and also making his game.

150
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:09,511
His father has been supportive of his dream lately,

151
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,017
so New’s working even harder now.

152
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,231
Isn’t that good?

153
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:16,230
He’s following his dream.

154
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:21,020
How are you? How have you been?

155
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:24,640
It’s so-so. Nothing new.

156
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,000
Liar.

157
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:28,195
Your eyebags are giving you away.

158
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:28,657
They are?

159
00:12:28,684 --> 00:12:29,413
You need to sleep more, Som.

160
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,062
Yeah.

161
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,840
Are they sagging?

162
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,813
I need to get it together.

163
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,973
Better now?

164
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,471
How are things with Tao?

165
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,671
Well, nothing out of the norm.

166
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:51,670
You know how Tao feels about you, right?

167
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,791
Are you going to fold this time?

168
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,355
Or are you… still in love with Chadjen?

169
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:13,360
Who went ahead and paid for my surgery?

170
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,204
Yeah. It wasn’t exactly cheap, either.

171
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,311
I think it was Tao.

172
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,097
Do you?

173
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,090
I guessed as much.

174
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,728
He’s been hanging around for years.

175
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,573
I’d say he’s been taking care of her, honey.

176
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:31,020
What do you mean, “hanging around”?

177
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:34,470
Tao is a good kid.

178
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,835
He paid for the surgery.

179
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:41,290
I bet it probably costs 100K.

180
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,626
I don’t think it’s proper, honey.

181
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:45,751
I agree.

182
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:48,595
I don’t want to impose.

183
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:56,168
Why don’t we ask him over for dinner so we can talk about this?

184
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:57,431
You don’t need to, Mom.

185
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:59,724
He hasn’t even said anything, you know?

186
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,133
Alright. We’ll do it your way.

187
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,462
Speaking of which…

188
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,848
Tao sure is a good guy.

189
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,280
It won’t hurt if you give him a chance, don’t you think?

190
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,453
Just because he’s good doesn’t mean she has to love him, you know?

191
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:21,626
But like, you fall for a good person eventually, right?

192
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,853
Som.

193
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,008
Why don’t you go ahead and go home?

194
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,746
We’ll wait for the prescription.

195
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,217
It’s okay. I’m good.

196
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:39,102
You certainly don’t look it.

197
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,004
Go. Go home.

198
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,182
Your mother and I will do some shopping after this, too.

199
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,222
You sure?

200
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,680
Yeah. Go.

201
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,226
- Take a rest. - 		Well, I’m off, then.

202
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,684
Bye.

203
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,613
(Cashier)

204
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:12,293
Som!

205
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,560
Are you alright?

206
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
None of your business.

207
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,524
Sit down.

208
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,800
You eyes look tired—

209
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,088
I said it’s none of your business.

210
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,457
You look so pale.

211
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,057
It’s probably because I didn’t sleep much.

212
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:40,417
But I’m fine.

213
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,866
Som.

214
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,026
Are you going home?

215
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,400
I’ll give you a ride.

216
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,715
No need.

217
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,195
I don’t want to spend another moment with an opportunist like you.

218
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,355
One more thing… Did you forget we broke up?

219
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,297
I’m sorry.

220
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,244
Som!

221
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,573
Somebody get me a wheelchair.

222
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,102
Are you sure about this?

223
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,177
Yes.

224
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:27,777
I want to at least try it.

225
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,804
Go for it, then.

226
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,644
Oh, but…

227
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,728
What do people say when they want to quit?

228
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,506
Isn’t it a bit late to ask that?

229
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:45,360
Just call them and you’ll know what to say.

230
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:45,857
Go ahead.

231
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,564
- Alright. - 		Hurry.

232
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,577
Okay.

233
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,902
(Boss)

234
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:13,822
Okay.

235
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,280
Hello, New?

236
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,497
What’s up?

237
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,693
“I quit!”

238
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,151
I’m calling to tell you I’m quitting.

239
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,893
For real?

240
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,048
Yes.

241
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,022
Can’t say I didn’t see this coming.

242
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:30,017
I knew it.

243
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,497
Well, talk to HR on Monday.

244
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:36,471
Don’t forget to transfer all your current projects to someone.

245
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:37,226
Okay?

246
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:38,986
Of course.

247
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,995
Thank you.

248
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,333
I did it!

249
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:49,146
What a relief.

250
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,897
Well done.

251
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:52,890
I told you it wouldn’t be so hard.

252
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,586
Oh!

253
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,266
Khao!

254
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:01,093
What?

255
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:03,540
Someone just left a review for my game!

256
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,524
They said they can’t wait for the full version.

257
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:07,484
Oh!

258
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,795
Khao.

259
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,857
I’m going to borrow from my Dad some money to make this game.

260
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,582
I’ll return it one day.

261
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:21,724
And I’m going to marry you in a year.

262
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,991
Well, I’d love to invest.

263
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,697
No.

264
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,755
Why not?

265
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,577
I need to prove it.

266
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,875
I have to build this by myself to prove my love to you.

267
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,502
What a silly idea.

268
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,662
Good job, you!

269
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,653
Well done!

270
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:46,604
Som.

271
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,128
How are you feeling?

272
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,271
I’m a bit dazed and my vision’s blurry.

273
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,853
Drink some water.

274
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:20,595
You feel better now?

275
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,111
Can you see clearly now?

276
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,475
Chadjen.

277
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,177
You need to rest more.

278
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,497
I’m worried about you.

279
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:42,693
Well, unlike you, I didn’t stay over at someone else’s place.

280
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:47,410
I thought Tao would take care of you.

281
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,968
He’s doing better than you ever did, at least.

282
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:03,537
You remember when I called you so many times and you didn’t pick up?

283
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,560
I was so scared at that time.

284
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,755
I went to a job interview and got harassed.

285
00:20:19,004 --> 00:20:21,000
Good thing I made it out alright.

286
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,991
I’m really sorry.

287
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,884
And you’re saying you take better care of me?

288
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,564
Forget it.

289
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,360
It’s long gone.

290
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,537
Som-O.

291
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,520
Can you give me another chance?

292
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,568
At least let’s be friends again.

293
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:52,444
Hello, Tao.

294
00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:00,440
I’m still at the hospital.

295
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,191
Hurry up.

296
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:21,822
I’ll walk you out.

297
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:26,080
Som.

298
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,088
How are you feeling?

299
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,937
Better now.

300
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,422
How come you passed out?

301
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I’ve been working too much lately.

302
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,817
If your company works you too hard, you should just quit.

303
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:42,488
Do you want me to talk to them?

304
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,906
Slow down.

305
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,831
I’m working on my personal project right now.

306
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:51,208
What are you working on?

307
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:53,057
A graphic novel.

308
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,480
I heard New also works on his side project along with his full-time job.

309
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,380
So I’m going to do that, too.

310
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:03,580
I don’t want to abandon my dream.

311
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,995
But you have to take care of yourself, too.

312
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,040
Som.

313
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,035
Let’s go home.

314
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,715
You need to rest.

315
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,964
Bye, Chad.

316
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:02,053
Careful, Som.

317
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,466
Som.

318
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,906
I think you should quit your job to focus on that graphic novel of yours.

319
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,448
No, I can’t.

320
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:37,440
I need the money to pitch in at home.

321
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,137
It’s alright.

322
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,835
I’ll take care of that.

323
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,493
If you keep doing both things, next time, it won’t be just feeling light-headed.

324
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,666
You’re taking care of me too well already.

325
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,995
If you do more than this, I’m going to be spoiled rotten.

326
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,408
I’d love to do that more.

327
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,431
I won’t even complain if you turn into a spoiled brat.

328
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,217
Didn’t you say I should hurry up and go home?

329
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:45,368
You remember when I called you so many times and you didn’t pick up?

330
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,310
I was so scared at that time.

331
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,053
I went to a job interview and got harassed.

332
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:54,782
Khao.

333
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,942
I did it!

334
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,026
Congratulations, New!

335
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:04,097
What’s with this last-minute appointment?

336
00:27:04,142 --> 00:27:05,911
I nearly couldn’t make it, you know?

337
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,653
Sorry.

338
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,333
We were just so excited.

339
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:11,333
About what?

340
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,506
Surprise!

341
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:15,804
Give it to them.

342
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,444
This is yours, Som-O.

343
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,653
For you, Tao.

344
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:21,431
And you, Chadjen.

345
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,617
Freshly printed.

346
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,124
Congratulations, nerd.

347
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:29,022
You, too, Khao.

348
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,355
You guys are finally going to do it, huh?

349
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,124
Congratulations, Khao, New.

350
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:34,951
Thank you.

351
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,595
You two are going to be my best men.

352
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:42,050
And of course, you’re my bridesmaid.

353
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,640
Isn’t this the envelope New used when he was looking for you in Grade 10?

354
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,302
It is.

355
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,737
The theme is…

356
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,471
Love at first sight.

357
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,417
I think it’s still a bit dark.

358
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:06,097
Can you adjust the light for me?

359
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:09,137
A bit to the right.

360
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,786
Alright, we got it.

361
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:14,568
You see that model, Khao?

362
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,120
Yeah.

363
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,008
Can you move it to the left?

364
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:21,360
Left?

365
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,635
Alright.

366
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,280
Wait. I think the box looks weird there.

367
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,124
Can you open it?

368
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:42,640
Take it out.

369
00:28:50,204 --> 00:28:52,200
You’re putting a ring in your game?

370
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,302
It looks adorable.

371
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,715
I’m not putting any rings in my game.

372
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:22,577
This is for you and you only.

373
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,995
Khao, will you marry me?

374
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,248
Yes.

375
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
Thank you.

376
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:54,977
Thank you for everything.

377
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,488
I know I’m not as strong as everyone.

378
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,048
But you chose to stay by my side.

379
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:13,786
Without you, I wouldn’t be here.

380
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,866
Don’t you act up, you hear me?

381
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:22,888
Of course.

382
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:24,586
I won’t.

383
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,795
That’s pretty romantic.

384
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,848
It’s damn nerdy.

385
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:50,690
You wouldn’t understand, Chadjen.

386
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,422
Your heart is stone cold.

387
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,484
I know, right?

388
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,071
How I wish I had something like that going on.

389
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,617
Well, I can give you that.

390
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,253
When it comes to romantic stuff, I’m always 100% ready.

391
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,466
Give me 200%.

392
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,235
Of course.

393
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:12,915
Where should we start?

394
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,520
Flowers every day?

395
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,200
Every day?

396
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:17,875
Yeah.

397
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:19,870
You’re too much.

398
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,137
You two need to chill.

399
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:25,057
Even I am getting jealous.

400
00:31:25,235 --> 00:31:28,782
How about I send you flowers every day, too?

401
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,426
Don’t. It’s a waste of money.

402
00:31:34,248 --> 00:31:35,333
Excuse me.

403
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:37,111
But I think I have to go.

404
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:39,110
Where are you off to?

405
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,604
Chadjen.

406
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:46,266
What’s his problem?

407
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,924
I don’t know.

408
00:31:50,168 --> 00:31:52,160
He hasn’t even had his lunch.

409
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,573
Your work is as good as Im said it is.

410
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:07,617
Thank you.

411
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,857
But I feel like it’s lacking something.

412
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,960
Why don’t you post it on Webtoon?

413
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:16,311
I think it might work.

414
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,146
I tried that with my other story.

415
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:21,860
But it hardly gained any readership.

416
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,524
Do your best.

417
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,088
I’ll root for you.

418
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:27,928
Yes, I will.

419
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:28,684
Go for it.

420
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:30,960
(I don’t want you rooting for me.)

421
00:32:31,226 --> 00:32:34,168
(I want you to publish my work.)

422
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,884
(Should I just draw caricatures on the beach?)

423
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,982
Hello, Tao.

424
00:32:50,008 --> 00:32:50,808
Hello.

425
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:52,213
Here’s the list of artists.

426
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,360
Please look through at your leisure.

427
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,222
Thank you.

428
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,671
You can take your pick.

429
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:04,950
There’s no one I like here.

430
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,693
These are all the famous artists right now.

431
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,835
I want something like this.

432
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,493
Oh, it’s beautiful.

433
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:25,031
The artstyle is so pretty.

434
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,128
There aren’t many views, though.

435
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,964
I think it’s better to use a famous artist.

436
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,217
It sells more that way.

437
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:36,204
But I love her artstyle.

438
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,337
One more thing, she’s my best friend.

439
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,186
I’m sure she’ll do a good job at portraying my story.

440
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,155
Hello?

441
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,835
Really?

442
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:03,306
Thank you!

443
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,204
Thank you!

444
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,053
Of course. I’ll send it to you right away.

445
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,253
Som-O, what’s wrong?

446
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:10,302
Boss.

447
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,106
Can you please step out of your cubicle?

448
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:19,662
I have something to talk to you about.

449
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,164
I quit.

450
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,560
What?

451
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,973
What’s going on?

452
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:26,977
What are you saying?

453
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,252
I said… I quit.

454
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:33,250
I just got a new job.

455
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,186
I am a Webtoon artist now.

456
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:40,373
Congratulations!

457
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:49,582
I have to go, guys.

458
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,404
Oh, can’t forget this…

459
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:52,906
Goodbye, dear Boss.

460
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,800
I finally get to follow my dream.

461
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:04,311
It’s all because of you.

462
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:06,310
I only did, like, 30% of the work.

463
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,066
The rest is all because of your potential.

464
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:12,782
I just mentioned your name and they decided it by themselves.

465
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,257
Without you, I’d still be confused about what to do with my life.

466
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,853
I’m happy to be an important part in your life, Som-O.

467
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,982
Seeing you happy makes me happy.

468
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,768
I have to go.

469
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,017
I’ll see you soon.

470
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,333
See you.

471
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:02,062
Bye.

472
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,840
Hello.

473
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:07,182
Khao and New are already inside.

474
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:08,080
Please come in.

475
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:12,293
This is so exciting.

476
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,662
I know.

477
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:15,146
She’s been in there for ages.

478
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:16,115
She has.

479
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,653
I’m so nervous.

480
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:19,386
Stop shaking, you.

481
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,693
She’s here.

482
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:36,266
Wow.

483
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,808
You’re an angel.

484
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:42,640
You look gorgeous, Khao.

485
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,733
My bride-to-be is the most beautiful girl in the world.

486
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:49,413
Can I get a photo?

487
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,711
One, two, three.

488
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:54,782
Smile for me, Khao.

489
00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:56,400
One, two, three.

490
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,444
Why don’t you get in, too, Som-O?

491
00:37:58,844 --> 00:37:59,591
Me?

492
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,102
Come on.

493
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,946
One, two, three.

494
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,542
One, two, three.

495
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:07,644
One more.

496
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:09,706
One, two, three.

497
00:38:10,008 --> 00:38:10,977
Beautiful.

498
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:13,217
You really are beautiful.

499
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,746
Really?

500
00:38:14,951 --> 00:38:17,608
But I don’t really like this one.

501
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:19,262
Why not?

502
00:38:19,893 --> 00:38:21,413
It just doesn’t feel right.

503
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,164
I want to try more dresses.

504
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,715
But I like this one.

505
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,253
Hey, I wear it. I pick it.

506
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,751
You are so right.

507
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:34,017
Som, why don’t you try some on, too?

508
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,200
What?

509
00:38:35,537 --> 00:38:36,595
Are you out of your mind?

510
00:38:36,622 --> 00:38:38,133
I’m not the one getting married.

511
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:39,040
Please.

512
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,351
Just put some on.

513
00:38:41,377 --> 00:38:44,630
It feels really great when you put it on, you know?

514
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:50,000
They said women look their best in their wedding dress.

515
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,840
You sure about this?

516
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,693
Of course.

517
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,133
Come on.

518
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,671
I’ll pick.

519
00:38:57,706 --> 00:38:58,533
Now?

520
00:38:58,577 --> 00:38:59,048
Yes.

521
00:38:59,093 --> 00:39:01,040
I’ll pick the best one.

522
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,768
(What do you think?)

523
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:07,564
(Is my bride beautiful?)

524
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:08,844
(Yeah.)

525
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,297
(Som-O is here, too.)

526
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,884
(She’s trying on some wedding dresses with Khao.)

527
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,937
(Okay. On my way.)

528
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:19,208
(Som-O is trying on some dresses. Hurry up.)

529
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,324
(Roger. Everything’s ready to go.)

530
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:46,986
Oh, Som-O, you look stunning.

531
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:02,560
Oh, you’re here.

532
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,897
Well? How do we look?

533
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:12,062
Som is gorgeous.

534
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,248
Thanks.

535
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
You’re so beautiful.

536
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,075
I’m the bride, you know?

537
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
Chadjen, the way you’re staring at Som-O…

538
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,066
It’s like you’re getting back together.

539
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,280
Watch your mouth, you nerd.

540
00:40:39,342 --> 00:40:40,640
Why are you pinching me?

541
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,044
Thank you.

542
00:40:58,675 --> 00:40:59,617
Bye, guys.

543
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:01,075
Bye.

544
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,284
Drive safe, you guys.

545
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,288
Let’s go, Som.

546
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,608
Bye, Chad.

547
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,320
Why are we here?

548
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,386
Just want to take you down memory lane.

549
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,333
“Memory lane” makes us sound so old.

550
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,102
We’re not old at all.

551
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,911
You’re still as adorable as the first day.

552
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,857
Don’t tell anyone anything you heard.

553
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,555
Got it?

554
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,675
Yes, ma’am.

555
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,311
Do you remember that?

556
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,466
It honestly… feels just like yesterday, doesn’t it?

557
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,328
Makes me think of the good old days.

558
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:29,617
You motivated me to be who I am today.

559
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,235
Will you marry me?

560
00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:55,146
I challenge you to a race.

561
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,133
Now?

562
00:43:58,346 --> 00:43:59,217
Yes.

563
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,884
Get someone else to practice with you.

564
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,097
I asked Som to marry me.

565
00:44:04,124 --> 00:44:05,511
You’re late, Chad.

566
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,973
What’s with you and Tao?

567
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,724
You guys have been flaunting it publicly for three years.

568
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:19,720
Is it going to be your wedding next?

569
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:24,400
I’m very happy to see you two make it.

570
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:30,097
Thank you the bride and the groom for allowing me to speak for them today.

571
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:33,813
There’s another important friend I’d love to talk about.

572
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:36,257
I want to help them do something.

573
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:39,991
And I believe I’m the only person who can help them.

574
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,280
You dare show your face here?

575
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,648
You had your chance, and you ruined it.

576
00:44:46,924 --> 00:44:49,048
A real man doesn’t hurt the woman he loves.
