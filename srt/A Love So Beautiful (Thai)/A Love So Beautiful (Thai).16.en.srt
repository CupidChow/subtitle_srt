1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:03,373
I think I made a mistake when I left everything I had to be with you.

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,905
But the two of us don’t have to be tired anymore.

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:13,642
Hey.

4
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:16,380
Hold on, Som-O.

5
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:19,054
Som-O.

6
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:20,908
Tao, help me.

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:21,982
Som, what’s wrong?

8
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:23,044
Calm down.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,708
Where is Chadjen at a time like this?

10
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,314
Where the hell has he gone?

11
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,717
Forget him, Dad.

12
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:30,010
My problem probably isn’t important enough for him.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

14
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,605
Your condo is clean.

15
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,100
Of course. Som-O doesn’t do the cleaning but Chad…jen…

16
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:51,564
I’m sorry, Som.

17
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:53,960
It’s okay.

18
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:57,802
It’s good that you mention it.

19
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,859
I have a favor to ask you.

20
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,407
I don’t want to see Chad in the meantime.

21
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,903
If you’re going to meet him, you don’t need to invite me.

22
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:25,210
You don’t need to help me get back together with him.

23
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:30,906
I feel that I’m done.

24
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,914
Okay. It’s alright.

25
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,875
I think this is probably good for both of you.

26
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:49,407
I’ll do what you ask.

27
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,168
Thank you two so much.

28
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,717
May I come in?

29
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,514
Is there any problem with the case?

30
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:22,380
No.

31
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:24,108
Professor.

32
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:26,577
I made up my mind.

33
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,868
I’ll move to work in the province.

34
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,577
After I finish my internship, I will study cardiology there.

35
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:37,277
I’ll arrange it.

36
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:40,308
In the meantime, you should get ready for it.

37
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:44,762
Yes.

38
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:46,505
Thank you.

39
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,309
(Everyone chooses their own path.)

40
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:03,413
(There’s no way to know if our chosen path is best for us.)

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,878
(They said time will help us grow up and learn to handle pain better.)

42
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:17,423
(I hope that I will become like that in the future.)

43
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:37,109
He will definitely win.

44
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:42,103
My daughter, are you going to work?

45
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:42,611
Yes.

46
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,186
Sit down and cheer for him.

47
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:46,928
Shark Tao is competing today.

48
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:47,764
Here.

49
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:49,014
Is it the Olympic Games?

50
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,321
Yes.

51
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,185
There is Tao.

52
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:57,881
Right.

53
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,401
He looks great.

54
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,022
Go. Go.

55
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,426
Faster, faster, faster.

56
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:18,822
It’s too bad he didn’t win.

57
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:22,020
Too bad, Tao.

58
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:23,613
But he did well, Dad.

59
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:26,140
No one can do what he did.

60
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:28,816
Of course. He’s the best.

61
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:31,896
Aren’t you being too boastful about him?

62
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:37,128
Huh?! 8 am?!

63
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:39,711
I’m going to be late.

64
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:43,312
I got to go. See you in the evening.

65
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:54,225
It’s already passed 5 pm.

66
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:55,579
Aren’t you getting off work, Som-O?

67
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,007
It will take a while. I haven’t finished revising my work.

68
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:01,964
Your client must be a tough one.

69
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:02,823
Yes.

70
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:04,419
You can do it.

71
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:06,211
Thank you.

72
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:08,068
I get off work first.

73
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:11,008
Bye. Go home safely.

74
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:41,515
Peek-a-boo.

75
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,225
Tao.

76
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,754
How did you get here?

77
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:49,293
Didn’t you have a competition this morning?

78
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:51,777
What are you doing here?

79
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:54,896
I took a plane right after my competition was over.

80
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:56,903
I almost missed my flight because of the traffic jam.

81
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,011
I bought this for you.

82
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,108
Thanks.

83
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:09,617
Let’s have dinner after you finish your work.

84
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,112
It will take a while.

85
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:15,742
It’s okay. I can wait.

86
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:18,644
Are you sure?

87
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:22,260
I’ll wait here.

88
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:38,385
You are getting famous, Shark Tao.

89
00:07:38,677 --> 00:07:40,604
It took you so long to get here.

90
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:46,265
If New didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t have known that you were back.

91
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,400
He’s better than Chadjen.

92
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:52,457
After he broke up with Som-O, he has gone no contact.

93
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,914
Are you going to stay here long?

94
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,706
Yes, I’m thinking about retiring from swimming.

95
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:07,902
I’ve done it all my life.

96
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,703
I want to try to do something else.

97
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:13,068
Khao and Nerd, how are you doing?

98
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:15,266
I’m still working as a researcher.

99
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,696
In addition, I’m studying for a master's degree.

100
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:20,019
- Really? - Really?

101
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,588
That’s great.

102
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,705
Nerd, what about you? What are you doing?

103
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,124
I’m developing a game.

104
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:26,062
Really?

105
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,714
He’s been working on it for three years.

106
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:30,105
While I have been working my butt off.

107
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,402
Now, I have to work hard for my degree as well.

108
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:34,402
I’m so tired.

109
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,588
Nerd, I told you if you picked the right girl, your life would be a smooth journey.

110
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:43,917
Do you want to take him under your care?

111
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:45,711
You two are besties, aren’t you?

112
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,025
Who is his bestie?

113
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,312
Nerd, don’t get upset. I’m joking.

114
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:54,062
What about you? How are you doing?

115
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,179
I started to feel bored with my job.

116
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:01,213
Why?

117
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,207
I want to try something new.

118
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:07,850
So quit your job, Som.

119
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,469
Quit my job?

120
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,260
Quit your job.

121
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,160
I believe that you will find a job that you love.

122
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,226
Submit your resignation letter.

123
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:20,853
Really? What would I do if I’m jobless?

124
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:22,656
You won’t be jobless for long.

125
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:24,656
Let’s eat.

126
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:25,857
Yes, let’s eat.

127
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:26,871
Som, this dish is delicious.

128
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:28,383
Thank you.

129
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:29,933
I want to eat shrimp.

130
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,706
I’ll pick it up.

131
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,647
It’s okay. I’ll do it.

132
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,422
Thank you for giving me a ride home, Tao.

133
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:49,066
Drive home safely.

134
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:50,672
I’m going in.

135
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,611
Wait.

136
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:54,911
I have something to give you.

137
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:56,813
What?

138
00:09:59,105 --> 00:09:59,751
Here.

139
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,106
I’m sorry. This is all I can give you.

140
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:06,266
Tao.

141
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:08,767
- You don’t need to give it to me. - Just take it.

142
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,017
But this is your dream.

143
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,718
Nothing is more important than…

144
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:21,105
the promise I gave to you.

145
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:25,411
Here.

146
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:28,802
What is it?

147
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:31,014
It’s a gold medal.

148
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:33,410
It’s edible.

149
00:10:33,752 --> 00:10:34,437
Really?

150
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:35,161
Yes.

151
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:38,121
It’s cute.

152
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:44,435
Here.

153
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,890
(Team Shark Tao)

154
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:47,905
Wow.

155
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:50,711
It said “Team Shark Tao.”

156
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:51,933
Som.

157
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:53,401
How is it?

158
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:54,611
It’s cute.

159
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:56,514
It’s so cool.

160
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:00,506
- Tao, it covers your eyes. - Som, I can’t see.

161
00:11:01,714 --> 00:11:02,500
How do I use it?

162
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:04,416
Put it on your forehead.

163
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,192
Oh.

164
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:08,837
You look cool.

165
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:12,306
Thank you, Som.

166
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:15,312
Can I ask you something?

167
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:17,737
Are you sad that you didn’t win any medal?

168
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:19,582
No.

169
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:22,016
I did my best.

170
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:24,616
My dad is no longer controlling me.

171
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,903
From now on, I’ll live my life.

172
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:32,063
You have grown up a lot.

173
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:34,063
Grown up?

174
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:38,017
If I had grown up, I wouldn’t be here with you.

175
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,208
Give it back.

176
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:41,748
I’m going to take it back.

177
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:44,902
You already gave it to me. You can’t take it back.

178
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,911
Wait until I have my chance.

179
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:52,567
We are acting like kids.

180
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:55,275
That’s why I said I’m just a kid when I’m with you.

181
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:01,857
Are you busy tomorrow?

182
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:03,512
Tomorrow?

183
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:04,709
No.

184
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:05,604
Really?

185
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:06,573
Good.

186
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:09,020
While I was in training camp, I saved many places I wanted to visit.

187
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:10,357
I planned to ask you to go with me.

188
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:13,208
I’ll come to pick you up tomorrow.

189
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,220
Sure.

190
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:19,204
I’m going in.

191
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,674
Drive home safely.

192
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,850
(Team Shark Tao)

193
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:47,607
So…

194
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:51,300
Are you really going to retire from swimming?

195
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:53,207
Yes.

196
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:55,691
I want to live here.

197
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,056
I want to be close to you.

198
00:13:05,614 --> 00:13:07,248
Don’t forget to show me the photos.

199
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:08,339
Sure.

200
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,705
You will be surprised.

201
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,106
Hello.

202
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,207
(Are you with Tao?)

203
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,891
How did you know?

204
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,208
(Check our group chat now.)

205
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,355
Okay.

206
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:23,300
What’s going on?

207
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:24,537
Wait a sec.

208
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:27,539
Tao.

209
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:29,617
When are the photos taken?

210
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:33,211
(Shark Tao and his imaginary girlfriend.)

211
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:41,826
I was opening my mouth in the photo.

212
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:44,411
Look at my face.

213
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,610
You look cute.

214
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:50,060
Do you mean it?

215
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:50,921
Yes.

216
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:53,952
Hello, Mom.

217
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,617
Dad is in the hospital?

218
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:04,256
Yes, I’ll be right there.

219
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:07,860
Som, I’ll give you a ride.

220
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:09,016
Come on. Let’s go.

221
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:46,761
Som.

222
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:49,327
How is your dad?

223
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:54,165
I’m looking for a place to make an appointment with an orthopedist for my dad.

224
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:59,090
Long time no see.

225
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:02,202
Yes, long time no see.

226
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:11,002
Excuse me.

227
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:14,016
Where can I make an appointment with an orthopedist?

228
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:15,711
Are you Shark Tao?

229
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:16,971
Yes.

230
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,019
Take an elevator and go to the 5th floor. You will see it.

231
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:22,465
But the doctor’s schedule is full until next month.

232
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:24,920
Can I have an appointment sooner than that?

233
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,207
Can you help us?

234
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,900
That’s not up to me.

235
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,414
Chad.

236
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:42,413
Are you going to act indifferent again?

237
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,628
Forget it, Som. Let’s go.

238
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:08,749
Come in.

239
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:20,552
Sue.

240
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:25,819
I have a favor to ask you.

241
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,017
What is it?

242
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:33,311
Tao.

243
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,011
You broke up with Som.

244
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:43,204
Do you have to stop being friends with all of us?

245
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:48,515
If I kept my contact with you guys, we all would feel awkward.

246
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:50,970
What’s wrong with you?

247
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,422
Forget it.

248
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,414
If you decide to leave,

249
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:00,709
then leave for good.

250
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,586
Don’t show up to Som’s face again.

251
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,171
Why are you applying for the job?

252
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:23,911
You have developed a game for three years.

253
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,022
To tell you the truth,

254
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,453
I saw the programmer position here is open.

255
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,760
So I am applying for the job.

256
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,162
I believe that my skills will be useful here.

257
00:17:40,198 --> 00:17:41,205
What do you think?

258
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:42,894
I don’t think he’s a good choice.

259
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:43,800
His looks are not good.

260
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:45,383
Look at how he answers our questions.

261
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,546
It’s not good.

262
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,674
It’s okay, Tao.

263
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:53,013
I can go home by myself.

264
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:07,312
Som.

265
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:09,765
Are you going home?

266
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:11,804
Let me give you a ride.

267
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:14,137
It’s okay.

268
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:15,620
I’ve already called for a ride.

269
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,161
Are you still living in the same house?

270
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,768
Let me give you a ride.

271
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:30,103
It’s okay.

272
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:32,214
My ride will be here soon.

273
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:34,804
Som.

274
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,158
Please let me give you a ride.

275
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,155
Fine.

276
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,011
Thank you.

277
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,724
What are you doing?

278
00:19:55,848 --> 00:19:58,011
Can you get antacids for me?

279
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:04,303
This one?

280
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:05,711
Yes.

281
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:34,160
Thank you.

282
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,783
Are you sick?

283
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:44,324
I’m so busy that I haven’t eaten anything today.

284
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,105
Thank you.

285
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:11,906
Do you want to go inside and eat something?

286
00:21:15,096 --> 00:21:15,820
It’s okay.

287
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:19,005
It only takes 30 minutes to get to my condo.

288
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,512
But we are at my house.

289
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,047
Is it a good idea?

290
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:28,906
Do whatever you want.

291
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:34,152
Fine.

292
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:44,958
Have a seat.

293
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,165
I’ll get you some water.

294
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,611
Here is your water.

295
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,001
Thank you, Som.

296
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:31,508
I’ll make instant noodles for you.

297
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,703
Chad, the noodles are ready.

298
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:04,610
You must be tired from working all day.

299
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,877
You are unbelievable.

300
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:17,808
Since you were young until now, you have never taken care of yourself.

301
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,143
Why a doctor like you is living like this?

302
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:57,808
Khao, how long have you been home?

303
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:00,897
Did you have dinner? Do you want me to order something to eat?

304
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:02,897
It’s okay. I already ate.

305
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:06,739
Where have you been?

306
00:26:07,057 --> 00:26:08,240
Why did you come home late?

307
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:11,019
I had a job interview.

308
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,918
I got lost in the train system because I’m not used to the area.

309
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:18,795
How was it? Did it go well?

310
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:20,480
They told me…

311
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,005
I can start working right away.

312
00:26:26,678 --> 00:26:27,570
Really?

313
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,322
New, well done.

314
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:32,322
I’m so happy for you.

315
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:34,638
I thought you wouldn’t like it.

316
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:36,214
Why wouldn’t I?

317
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:37,948
You are going to be successful now.

318
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:39,420
Of course, I’m happy for you.

319
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:41,420
Thank you.

320
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,130
(Thank you for the noodles and the blanket.)

321
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,213
Chadjen.

322
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,121
Hello.

323
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:33,777
Long time no see, Chadjen.

324
00:27:34,822 --> 00:27:36,331
Som told me.

325
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:40,302
Thank you for helping us with his surgery.

326
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:43,462
It’s okay. I’m happy to help.

327
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:45,462
Dr. Sue is a talented doctor.

328
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:49,405
His surgery will be supervised by a specialist physician.

329
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:50,613
Yes.

330
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:55,277
Don’t worry. Your husband will fully recover.

331
00:27:55,678 --> 00:27:57,157
Thank you, doctor.

332
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,714
Excuse me. I need to go get ready.

333
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:12,706
I’m going to answer this call.

334
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,780
It was too bad.

335
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:24,351
When you were dating Som-O, I never had a chance to have a proper talk with you two.

336
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,019
The next thing I knew, you two already broke up.

337
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:31,908
I was my fault.

338
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:34,874
I didn’t take good care of her.

339
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,921
Maybe it was your fate.

340
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:42,320
If you two are meant to be, it will be.

341
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:51,620
(Sorry, I’m so busy with my work at the institute.)

342
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:53,407
(New just got a new job.)

343
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:55,339
(So we can’t go visit your dad.)

344
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:57,810
(It’s okay.)

345
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,300
(My dad will be discharged from the hospital soon.)

346
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,056
Som-O.

347
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:10,211
Yes.

348
00:29:10,302 --> 00:29:11,247
Are you alone?

349
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:12,648
Yes.

350
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,804
I told my mom to go home and rest.

351
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:18,771
Som-O, can I ask you something?

352
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:22,371
How did you know Chadjen?

353
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,708
He was a friend from school.

354
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:30,503
He was also living in my neighborhood.

355
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,408
So you’ve known him since he was young.

356
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:39,235
You saw him growing up.

357
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:40,868
You are so lucky.

358
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:42,508
Huh?

359
00:29:45,177 --> 00:29:47,016
Do you know his girlfriend?

360
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,114
Girlfriend?

361
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:54,468
Gosh. Didn’t he tell you that he has a new girlfriend?

362
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:11,619
Som-O.

363
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:14,185
Take the fruit and give it to Chadjen.

364
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:16,324
Don’t forget to buy him a meal.

365
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,761
What’s with the face?

366
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,102
He helped us.

367
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,874
You should be nice to him.

368
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:28,278
Who knows? You two might get back together.

369
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:31,287
Mom.

370
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:37,111
Why are you rooting for them now?

371
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:39,650
Things are going well. Som-O is dating Tao now.

372
00:30:41,442 --> 00:30:42,517
What is good about that?

373
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,013
Every time he’s on TV, he always shows his abs.

374
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,130
That’s his job.

375
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:54,023
He’s working. He shoots many commercials.

376
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:55,811
He has a bright future waiting for him.

377
00:30:57,842 --> 00:31:01,674
Whatever, I still like Chadjen better.

378
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:05,161
Hurry up. Give it to him.

379
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,019
Mom, why are you forcing me to do this?

380
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:14,909
That’s right. Why are you forcing her?

381
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:19,730
It’s so heavy, Mom.

382
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,004
It’s not that heavy. Come on.

383
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:25,423
Come on, honey.

384
00:31:28,023 --> 00:31:29,509
Didn’t you have lunch?

385
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:32,810
My shoulder is almost dislocated, Mom.

386
00:31:34,974 --> 00:31:37,420
Both my daughter and husband are not after my own heart.

387
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:45,380
Hey, my mom told me to give the fruit to you.

388
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,223
Put it here.

389
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:57,004
Here.

390
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,004
Please tell your mom I said thank you.

391
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,007
I went to visit your dad this morning.

392
00:32:04,426 --> 00:32:05,605
He is recovering well.

393
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:08,205
He will be discharged in a few days.

394
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:12,811
Thank you again for helping us.

395
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,210
I…

396
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:20,414
I should go. I won’t bother you any further.

397
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:23,965
Som-O.

398
00:32:34,728 --> 00:32:38,525
Have you ever regretted breaking up with me?

399
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:44,136
Didn’t he tell you that he has a new girlfriend?

400
00:32:58,478 --> 00:32:59,257
No.

401
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:24,010
Hello, professor.

402
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,706
(Are you sure you want to go study there?)

403
00:33:27,328 --> 00:33:29,900
(Are you sure you won’t change your mind about the overseas residency?)

404
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,022
I’m sure.

405
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:35,413
(Why did you change your mind and not go study abroad?)

406
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:38,509
(A great opportunity like this is not offered to everyone.)

407
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:47,102
Because I have something here that I can’t leave.

408
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:50,918
(You can’t change your mind later.)

409
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,760
Yes, professor.

410
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:21,910
(I heard that you are back in Bangkok.)

411
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:24,605
(I’ll have a party celebrating my new job tonight.)

412
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,798
(I want you to come.)

413
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,706
What, Som?

414
00:34:36,613 --> 00:34:37,720
Why are you smiling?

415
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,302
What smile?

416
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:43,306
My friend just invited me to a party.

417
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:44,964
Really?

418
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:46,413
That’s great.

419
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:48,413
I’m not on duty tonight.

420
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:52,361
Is it a birthday party? Does it have a theme?

421
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:55,251
I’m not inviting you.

422
00:34:56,694 --> 00:35:02,684
Are all the physical therapists for intervertebral disc disease busy lately?

423
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,225
6.30 pm.

424
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,562
Don’t be late.

425
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:14,229
Okay.

426
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:22,365
Are we starting now?

427
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:23,128
Yes.

428
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,182
Here.

429
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,885
Yes.

430
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:34,903
What if you get drunk?

431
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:36,121
I won’t.

432
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,835
I’ll refill your glass.

433
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,435
I haven’t finished the last glass.

434
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:44,820
What? Why are you making a grumpy face?

435
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,712
We’re late because of the traffic jam.

436
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:54,010
If you know who New has invited, I don’t think you can keep a smile on your face.

437
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:55,865
Who is it?

438
00:35:58,937 --> 00:35:59,617
There he is.

439
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,346
You bring a girl with you.

440
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,131
You’re something, Chadjen.

441
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,014
Hello, I’m Sue.

442
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,909
I went to the med school with Chadjen.

443
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:14,048
Hello.

444
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:16,474
Doctors these days are good-looking.

445
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:20,801
This is Tao.

446
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:21,934
This is New.

447
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,770
That’s Khao.

448
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:24,342
Hello.

449
00:36:24,364 --> 00:36:25,168
Hello.

450
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:26,120
Have a seat.

451
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:28,511
New, congratulations on your new job.

452
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,404
Thank you.

453
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,408
Please have a seat.

454
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:39,783
Feel free to eat.

455
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,518
You need to eat a lot.

456
00:36:46,742 --> 00:36:49,042
You have worked many shifts lately and don’t get enough rest.

457
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:56,432
Thanks.

458
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,810
Tao, you don’t get enough protein.

459
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:01,173
Thank you, Som.

460
00:37:02,106 --> 00:37:03,275
How did you know that I like shrimp?

461
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:04,785
I remember it.

462
00:37:08,632 --> 00:37:09,976
You are taking care of each other.

463
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:11,749
That’s good.

464
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:14,274
Som-O, this is the biggest piece.

465
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:16,631
Thanks.

466
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,410
Tao, do you want more?

467
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,564
- What? - Do you want more?

468
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,973
No, I have enough.

469
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:24,992
How are you doing? Are you tired?

470
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,976
I’m fine. Same as always.

471
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:29,496
That’s great.

472
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:36,013
I’m sorry.

473
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:39,168
I think I have rhinitis.

474
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:50,674
It’s okay. I’m not cold.

475
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,325
Take it. You will get sick.

476
00:37:56,656 --> 00:37:57,321
Thank you.

477
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,604
Chadjen is always like this.

478
00:38:01,475 --> 00:38:02,604
He likes to take care of other people.

479
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,614
Let’s drink.

480
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:09,391
Good idea.

481
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:11,223
For Nerd’s new job.

482
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,240
Yeah!

483
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:23,863
Tao.

484
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:27,502
Nerd, can you get me the wine?

485
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,469
Yes.

486
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:31,937
This can’t do anything to me.

487
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,906
Don’t drink too much.

488
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:37,442
Nerd, I told you not to drink too much.

489
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,419
Be careful.

490
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:44,546
Khao, do you feel stressed from dating him?

491
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,120
Tao, you are so noisy.

492
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:49,805
Let’s have another glass.

493
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,093
- No. I can’t drink anymore. - That’s enough, both of you.

494
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:00,045
We will arrive at Tao’s place first.

495
00:39:00,857 --> 00:39:03,574
Then Dr. Sue’s and Som-O’s places.

496
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:06,503
I’ll get off at Som-O’s house.

497
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,909
But we almost arrived at your place.

498
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,970
I said I’ll get off at Som-O’s house.

499
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:18,654
Don’t worry. I’ll ride with Som-O and Chadjen.

500
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:20,562
I said I’ll get off at Som-O’s house.

501
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:21,309
Tao.

502
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:46,909
This is your place, Tao.

503
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,120
I said I’ll get off at Som-O’s house.

504
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:51,312
Tao, go home.

505
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:05,751
Thanks, Som. Take care.

506
00:40:18,814 --> 00:40:20,508
Sue, this is your place.

507
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:23,026
I’m getting off. Drive safely.

508
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:39,509
Are you dating Tao?

509
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:43,903
Why are you asking me that?

510
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:49,210
What about you? Are you dating Sue?

511
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:53,419
Why?

512
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,506
Are you jealous?

513
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:01,751
Jealous? Why would I be jealous of you?

514
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:30,305
Thank you.

515
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,762
This is to repay for the other night.

516
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:42,205
Som.

517
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,616
What?

518
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,902
You forgot this.

519
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:51,917
Thanks.

520
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:02,419
I think there’s another that you forgot.

521
00:42:03,985 --> 00:42:05,002
What did I forget?

522
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:08,674
Do you really not know?

523
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:12,905
I don’t know. So say it.

524
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,607
Do I need to say it?

525
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:37,371
Keep it for so long

526
00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:42,983
This secret hidden deep inside

527
00:42:48,022 --> 00:42:51,706
Chadjen, I’m calling to tell you what you did last night was wrong.

528
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,762
You have a girlfriend. You can’t kiss me.

529
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:55,902
I don’t want to be a third wheel in anybody’s relationship.

530
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:58,106
Can I talk to you, Som-O?

531
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,937
(I feel sorry for Khao for having a terrible boyfriend like you.)

532
00:43:04,078 --> 00:43:05,617
I’m working on my game, Dad.

533
00:43:05,629 --> 00:43:07,219
My every day is so tiring.

534
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,400
Som, are you okay?

535
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:13,654
It’s okay. I don’t want to be around an opportunist like you.

536
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:15,860
Som, I think we should leave.

537
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:20,834
Surprise!

538
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:22,321
Give it to them.

539
00:43:23,211 --> 00:43:25,408
Your story is so romantic.

540
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,957
It’s so lame.

541
00:43:26,968 --> 00:43:28,663
Chadjen, you will never understand it.

542
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,900
You are a cold man.

543
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,405
Will you marry me?
