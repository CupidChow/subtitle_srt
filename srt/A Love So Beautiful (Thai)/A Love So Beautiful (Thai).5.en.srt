1
00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:01,321
How did it get here?

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,296
- What, Som? - I was looking for it everywhere yesterday.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,866
I’ll go tell Khao.

4
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:07,388
You are dead.

5
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:08,448
Stop right there.

6
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:12,737
The ogress destroys the set.

7
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:14,912
I’m sorry.

8
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:17,469
Saying sorry won’t change anything.

9
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,010
Do you like to be a villain?

10
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:24,139
You are the one who found the pouch for her?

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,182
I don’t like that Mhog is being around you.

12
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:29,602
Who you like or don’t like is your problem.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,930
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

14
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,183
Chad.

15
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:37,004
Chadjen.

16
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:41,576
Chad, you jerk!

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,631
What did you just call me?

18
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,675
Sorry.

19
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:51,574
I called many times but you didn’t hear me so…

20
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:53,705
What do you want?

21
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:55,705
Can I…

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,914
ask you something?

23
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:06,808
When Som-O is mad at you, what do you usually do to make up?

24
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,380
(Don’t get mad at me…)

25
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:15,380
(Because I believe every minute really counts.)

26
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:18,764
Here’s the thing.

27
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,709
Khao and I…

28
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:25,506
Can I talk to you?

29
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,213
What’s up?

30
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,780
I don’t like…

31
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:31,724
What?

32
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:34,571
I don’t like that Mhog is being around you.

33
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:41,814
Well, what can I even do about that?

34
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:47,525
Listen.

35
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:51,069
Who you like or don’t like is your problem.

36
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,807
I don’t need you to tell me.

37
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:06,656
Just tell me if you have any ideas.

38
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,862
I don’t want Khao to be mad at me for long.

39
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:10,549
Hmm…

40
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:12,865
I don’t know.

41
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:15,005
What?

42
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,711
That’s the best answer you have for me?

43
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,905
You and Som-O have been friends since you were kids.

44
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,404
I thought you guys might have some more experience at fighting and making up.

45
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:29,810
Som-O and Tao are here.

46
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:39,767
Bye, Som.

47
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:40,942
Safe trip home.

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,179
Chad.

49
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:03,859
What’s with this tension?

50
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:08,607
Oh, Som-O, you’re back.

51
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:10,668
I am.

52
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:12,614
What’s wrong?

53
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:14,407
I don’t know.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,360
Is this your friend?

55
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:21,257
Oh, yeah.

56
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:22,899
Hello, ma’am.

57
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:25,779
My name is New. I’m Som-O and Chadjen’s friend.

58
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:30,114
You’re lucky to have such a lovely friend, Som-O.

59
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:38,971
Som-O.

60
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:41,807
What’s wrong? What’s with the long face?

61
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,007
Your dad is right.

62
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:45,171
Just tell us if there’s something on your mind.

63
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,068
Is it about money?

64
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,940
Don’t worry about that.

65
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,069
I’ll take care of it.

66
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,866
- Oh, maybe it’s about the play— - Hey, here.

67
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:05,894
Why don’t you try this?

68
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:07,539
It’s good.

69
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:09,848
What play?

70
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,309
It’s something we study in class.

71
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:13,982
It’s nothing.

72
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:18,004
It’s the play—

73
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,139
Oh!

74
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,608
The food is amazing.

75
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:31,234
That reaction is a bit dramatic.

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,705
Well, have your fill if you like it so much.

77
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:33,733
Yes…

78
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,755
You like it, don’t you?

79
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,314
Your favorite food always lights you up, huh?

80
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,605
You know what, Dad?

81
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:10,742
Water spinach and pork belly make me crave shabu-shabu all of a sudden.

82
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,407
With all the food right in front of you, you want shabu-shabu instead?

83
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:21,001
What’s her problem?

84
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,530
(Trip to Phuket)

85
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,162
Yay! We won a trip to Phuket!

86
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:38,602
Oh, my.

87
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,044
Next year really is going to be our lucky year, huh?

88
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:44,120
Let’s hope we’re fortunate all year long.

89
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,579
I’ll say amen to that!

90
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:47,271
This is amazing.

91
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:48,711
What got you guys so excited?

92
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:54,219
Your father won a trip to Phuket

93
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,940
that comes with plane tickets and a 5-star hotel deal at the company.

94
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:59,185
I did!

95
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,154
Are we going to Phuket this year, then?

96
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:02,374
That’s great!

97
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:05,299
Not so fast.

98
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:08,019
It’s a package for two people.

99
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,472
Oh, am I going with Mom?

100
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:12,016
Dream on, kiddo!

101
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:15,377
Your mother and I are having our sweet alone time.

102
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,622
You stay home.

103
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,320
You’re gonna leave me home alone again?

104
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,936
But I want to go, too.

105
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:25,029
Let me go, please.

106
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:27,259
Mom and I can go, just the two of us.

107
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:28,115
Please?

108
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,973
Oh, dear.

109
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:32,105
You’re all grown up now, you know?

110
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:35,807
I just want a little getaway with your mother, you know?

111
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:41,207
How about we ask Chadjen to stay with you while we’re gone?

112
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,265
What do you say, Chadjen?

113
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:45,109
Yeah, Chadjen, will you keep Som-O company?

114
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:46,813
Of course.

115
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:49,402
No way.

116
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,447
I’m a grownup now.

117
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:51,616
I can be alone.

118
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:53,520
Yeah, right.

119
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:55,792
As if you weren’t just complaining just now.

120
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:57,008
You’re so right, dear.

121
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,367
Chadjen, make sure you stop by to check up on her, okay?

122
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:00,739
Yes, sir.

123
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,525
- Should we start packing, dear?
- Oh, we should!

124
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:04,472
Go on, go on.

125
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:05,493
This is exciting!

126
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,281
Phuket, Phuket, Phuket!

127
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:12,499
Look at them! How could they?

128
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,111
They’re abandoning me! I must have been adopted.

129
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:17,783
I want to go, too!

130
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,060
I want to go!

131
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:23,708
They’re leaving next week, right?

132
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:25,471
Yes.

133
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,373
Maybe… you really were adopted?

134
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:32,894
What did you say?

135
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:35,505
How dare you!

136
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,561
What did you just say? Me? Adopted?

137
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,640
I’m going to strangle you.

138
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:43,303
Say it to my face.

139
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,903
Who’s adopted?

140
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:47,968
Don’t you dare play dead! Wake up! Wake up!

141
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:54,874
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

142
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,400
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey

143
00:08:58,422 --> 00:08:59,210
Here.

144
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,460
I got this for the party.

145
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:02,840
Tao.

146
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:04,320
What’s that?

147
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:05,672
What unfestive food.

148
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:06,374
Yeah.

149
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,844
But Som, I was busy with practice.

150
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:13,699
What did you bring?

151
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:14,831
That looks amazing.

152
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:16,001
Of course.

153
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:18,717
Mom got up at 5 just to make this for me.

154
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:19,751
For Chad, too.

155
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,582
Yeah, he’s a lucky dude, alright.

156
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:25,059
Must be great to live right near you and get to have amazing food all the time.

157
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:29,736
Where is New?

158
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,675
New called to tell me this morning that he’s going abroad with his family.

159
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:34,533
Oh?

160
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:37,114
His family really is filthy rich, huh?

161
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:38,503
They even go abroad on holidays.

162
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,466
Meanwhile, my parents are going to leave me home all alone.

163
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:47,429
Why didn’t New text me about this?

164
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:50,278
He’s been avoiding my texts lately, too.

165
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:52,475
Are you guys fighting?

166
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:55,247
No, we aren’t.

167
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,973
“We aren’t” with that tone? Yeah, right.

168
00:09:59,216 --> 00:09:59,805
Here.

169
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,088
Have some grilled pork.

170
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:02,817
No.

171
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,096
What about you?

172
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:08,900
Alright, guys.

173
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,309
Here comes the highlight of the party.

174
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,579
Enjoy the show.

175
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:19,511
Where are you?

176
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:22,114
Where are they?

177
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,617
If I find you, I’ll eat you up.

178
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:32,045
You are dead!

179
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:36,862
Stop right there.

180
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,299
The ogress destroys the set.

181
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:42,613
Stop filming.

182
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:48,205
Hey, stop that.

183
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:49,557
I said stop it!

184
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,968
Come on, learn to take a joke.

185
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,308
Well, it’s not funny.

186
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,408
Som.

187
00:10:59,068 --> 00:10:59,700
Som.

188
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,962
This is the place you said will make me feel better?

189
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:13,937
Come on.

190
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:16,608
Close your eyes.

191
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:18,420
Count to 100.

192
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:19,662
Okay?

193
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:21,017
Why?

194
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:22,574
Just trust me.

195
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:23,582
Do it.

196
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:26,463
Try it.

197
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:29,407
Fine.

198
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:32,183
Don’t peek.

199
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:34,300
I won’t.

200
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:36,317
Start counting.

201
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:37,102
Okay.

202
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:38,960
Now?

203
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:40,025
Yeah.

204
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:40,927
One.

205
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,177
Two.

206
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:45,177
Three.

207
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:46,902
Four. Five.

208
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,601
Six.

209
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,601
Seven.

210
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,195
Eight.

211
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,195
60.

212
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,282
61.

213
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:57,831
62.

214
00:11:58,277 --> 00:11:59,268
63.

215
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:01,007
What?

216
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:04,703
Tao?

217
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:06,140
What are you doing in the water?

218
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:07,811
Wanna get on this thing?

219
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:09,394
The water is cool, you know?

220
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,411
It will calm you right down.

221
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:13,417
No way.

222
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:14,708
I don’t want to fall into the water.

223
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,219
You won’t.

224
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,666
I’ll hold it for you.

225
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:18,736
Hurry up.

226
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:19,820
No way.

227
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,334
Come on.

228
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:22,600
Give it a try.

229
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,145
Som, come on.

230
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:25,691
No!

231
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:32,351
Well, do you feel better now?

232
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,508
Yeah.

233
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,217
It’s just like you’re in the ocean, right?

234
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,074
There’s no way it would be the same.

235
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,514
What even makes you think that?

236
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,022
I just wanted to make you feel better.

237
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:49,605
But it’s really cool.

238
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:53,120
You feel better, then?

239
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:55,696
Yeah.

240
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:59,002
What happened just now finally seems like no big deal, does it?

241
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:03,706
Yeah.

242
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,699
If you have something you want to get off your chest,

243
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:08,942
feel free to tell the flamingo.

244
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:10,420
I won’t listen in on you.

245
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:11,539
What?

246
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:14,600
Yeah, try it.

247
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:16,152
I’ll cover my ears.

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,605
Hello?

249
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:23,770
Sorry, that wasn’t very secure enough.

250
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:24,921
Let’s try again.

251
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,819
Just you wait, you jerks!

252
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:35,924
One of these days, I'm gonna blow your tiny minds away!

253
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:39,460
I’ll show you I’m the coolest, the greatest—

254
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:40,765
And the prettiest!

255
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:46,388
Som-O is the coolest, the greatest, and the prettiest girl ever!

256
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:48,620
I’ll show you!

257
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:54,007
Oww, that’s mean.

258
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,214
What do you think you’re doing?

259
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:00,475
Who is this, Tao?

260
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,305
She’s a friend of mine.

261
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:04,540
A friend?

262
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:06,065
Are you sure she’s just a friend?

263
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,179
Yes, sir.

264
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:08,557
She’s just a friend.

265
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,640
Are you sure you’re not dating her?

266
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:15,613
I told you girls will only distract you.

267
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:20,811
Tao only means well.

268
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:23,480
He saw I was distressed so he tried to cheer me up.

269
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,616
This is no playground.

270
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,158
I’ll let you off the hook this time.

271
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:28,656
But Tao…

272
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,468
You and I have a lot to talk about after school.

273
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:41,228
I’m sorry.

274
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,933
You got scolded because of me.

275
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:45,094
It’s okay.

276
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,361
Coach does that every day anyway.

277
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,962
I’m used to it by now.

278
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:52,761
Well…

279
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,234
What will happen after school?

280
00:14:56,251 --> 00:15:00,659
He’ll probably make me do a hundred push-ups.

281
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:01,632
No big deal.

282
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:03,311
No big deal?

283
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,961
My chest is going to be so sore.

284
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:09,703
It is?

285
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,567
We’re talking a hundred push-ups here, Som.

286
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,177
Well-deserved!

287
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:17,220
Does that help?

288
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,611
I haven’t even been sore yet!

289
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:21,500
I have to go.

290
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:22,462
What?

291
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:24,814
No, don’t.

292
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:27,106
Tao, come back.

293
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,198
Come back here!

294
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,414
Hurry up!

295
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,118
I’m going to float away.

296
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:38,146
Come on here!

297
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:38,998
Hurry!

298
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:49,611
What the hell?

299
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,777
Don’t think you’ve got something to say to Som-O?

300
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,216
Hurry up.

301
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,066
So–Sorry. I’m sorry, Som.

302
00:15:56,642 --> 00:15:57,431
Pardon?

303
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,500
I’m sorry, Som. I won’t do it again!

304
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:01,837
I can barely hear you.

305
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:02,511
Say that again.

306
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,161
- I won’t do it— - Louder!

307
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,672
There ya go.

308
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,005
I guess he won’t mess with you for a while now.

309
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,071
Thank you, Tao.

310
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:22,060
Now that that is over…

311
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:25,564
What are you guys doing during the New Year break?

312
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,122
I’ll be home, of course.

313
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:30,980
Since my parents are off to Phuket.

314
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:33,405
I’ll be home, too.

315
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:38,508
My mother works and my Dad is abroad, per usual.

316
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:42,315
I think I’ll be at practice.

317
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,583
Since none of us has anything to do,

318
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:48,780
and Som-O will get the house all to herself,

319
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,198
why don’t we throw a party there?

320
00:16:54,872 --> 00:16:55,448
I’m in.

321
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:58,120
Chad is basically my guardian right now.

322
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:00,200
It sounds like fun, doesn’t it?

323
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,442
It must be boring watching the fireworks with just the two of us.

324
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:04,506
Right?

325
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,373
Hmm?

326
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,161
Please, please, please, Chad.

327
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:09,657
Please, Mr. Guardian?

328
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,454
Just do whatever you want.

329
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:17,337
Yay!

330
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,282
Now we’re talking!

331
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:21,626
What should we have for the party?

332
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:23,625
Barbecue, barbecue, barbecue! barbecue!

333
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:24,653
Barbecue?

334
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,174
Yep.

335
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:25,810
Sounds good.

336
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:30,140
What else should we do?

337
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:31,813
Read books?

338
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,066
Oh, no.

339
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,360
Did he go to Mars for the holiday? Why can’t he pick up the phone?

340
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:57,109
Khao?

341
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,600
Hello, Khao.

342
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:05,001
New.

343
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:09,011
Khao.

344
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:11,654
Khao.

345
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:15,780
Why didn’t you pick up my calls?

346
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:20,173
It’s on silent so I didn’t hear the phone ring.

347
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,902
All the entire time?

348
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:25,810
Didn’t you say you went abroad with your family?

349
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,305
I…

350
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,417
I just got back this morning.

351
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,214
Where’s your ticket?

352
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:35,465
Ticket…

353
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:37,602
Ticket…

354
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,954
Not funny.

355
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:57,961
I’m sorry.

356
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,957
What are you doing here, Khao?

357
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:07,702
I’m doing some shopping for the party at Som-O’s.

358
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:09,315
Party?

359
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,868
Yes.

360
00:19:11,257 --> 00:19:13,862
There’s Som-O, Chadjen, and Tao…

361
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:15,985
You’re not invited, though,

362
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,607
since we thought you’d be abroad.

363
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:27,251
I’m sorry.

364
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:33,505
But…

365
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:38,321
Those guys would be happy if you show up as a surprise.

366
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:43,266
Of course.

367
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:44,512
Good.

368
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:46,693
Just know you’ll be made to work to make up for this.

369
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:51,334
Starting now, you packmule.

370
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:53,909
Yes, ma’am!

371
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:57,776
…oh, they are going to kiss.

372
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,654
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

373
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:18,016
Oh, no…

374
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:25,906
How long have you been standing there?

375
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,819
A while.

376
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,060
Forget everything.

377
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:32,958
Just pretend you never saw anything.

378
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,819
Worry not.

379
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,991
I’ve seen you do much weirder stuff.

380
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:41,105
That… doesn’t make me feel any better.

381
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,715
Stop it. What are you doing?

382
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:47,109
I’m cleaning up.

383
00:20:47,802 --> 00:20:49,180
Those guys are coming over soon, right?

384
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,278
Oh, don’t clean up now.

385
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,299
It’ll be a mess after the party anyway.

386
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:54,847
It’s a waste of time.

387
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,422
You sure?

388
00:20:57,814 --> 00:20:59,004
They’re going to complain, you know?

389
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:01,020
They won't.

390
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:02,601
I’m one million percent sure.

391
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,041
Yeah, what’s up?

392
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:20,002
Som-O?

393
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:23,380
She loves romance novels.

394
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:26,380
You know… cartoons.

395
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:31,642
I don’t know. I don’t read those.

396
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:35,007
Excuse me, Khao.

397
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:40,005
There’s one more thing Som-O loves.

398
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:42,762
It’s shabu-shabu.

399
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:46,407
She was just saying the other day that she’s been craving shabu-shabu.

400
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,668
Why don’t you try—

401
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:50,122
Oh? Hello?

402
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:51,725
Hello?

403
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,657
Tao hangs up.

404
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:01,949
Just say what you need to say.

405
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:03,899
It’s…

406
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:06,900
I…

407
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,817
Say it now.

408
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,533
Or keep it to yourself for the rest of your life.

409
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,376
I’m really sorry

410
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,518
for lying about going abroad.

411
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:25,622
You apologized for that three times already.

412
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:28,530
If you would go so far as to lie to me,

413
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:32,708
that must mean there’s something really important that you can’t tell me.

414
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:35,560
Yes.

415
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:38,711
But there’s something more important…

416
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:41,404
You’re not mad at me, are you?

417
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:43,368
I’m not.

418
00:22:48,277 --> 00:22:49,908
Hurry up, packmule.

419
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:51,499
Yes, ma’am.

420
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,702
Som-O.

421
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:01,365
Are you for real?

422
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:02,808
What?

423
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,465
Won’t you clean up a little, I beg you.

424
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:06,200
Please?

425
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:07,930
Why?

426
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:09,296
You guys are going to mess it up anyway.

427
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:11,822
What kind of logic is that?

428
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:13,367
The correct one.

429
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:15,266
Am I right, New?

430
00:23:16,422 --> 00:23:19,380
If it was correct, no man should ever take a shower.

431
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,611
Why take a shower now when you will be dirty tomorrow, that kind of thing.

432
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:24,016
That’s not the same thing.

433
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,120
Any man who sees how unorganized you are would run at first sight.

434
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:37,825
Well, Chadjen lives across the street so he can’t run far anyway.

435
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,017
Right…

436
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:43,164
I won’t run, Som.

437
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,561
Eww!

438
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:48,257
This entire mess gives me anxiety.

439
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:49,259
Let’s clean up.

440
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,811
Quick. Hurry up.

441
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,594
Why didn’t you tell me to clean up?

442
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:55,856
- What? - Khao is giving me an earful, see?

443
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:56,974
Do it, nerd.

444
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:59,087
Help us out.

445
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,642
Why should we even clean up?

446
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:02,715
I need a bite.

447
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,748
New, hurry up and put those stuff here.

448
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:06,620
Right. Yes.

449
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,927
Hey, I’m still eating that!

450
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:18,515
Is there anything you need my help with, guys?

451
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,057
I’m putting this on the grill now.

452
00:24:25,577 --> 00:24:26,302
You want more, Khao?

453
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:27,010
Yeah.

454
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:28,543
You like this one?

455
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:31,308
That’s more than enough.

456
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,983
What’s in that big box you brought with you?

457
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:38,487
- That one?
- Yeah.

458
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,217
Tan-tan-tan.

459
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,800
Som, for you.

460
00:24:48,494 --> 00:24:49,322
For me?

461
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:50,075
Yeah.

462
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,666
Just for Som?

463
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:58,607
What about the rest of us?

464
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,962
She’s got a point.

465
00:25:01,878 --> 00:25:02,937
I only have something for Som.

466
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:05,309
Why?

467
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:06,703
Because…

468
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:16,401
Because my father taught me it is impolite to show up at someone’s house empty-handed.

469
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:21,208
Your Dad has some great advice.

470
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,780
That’s why his son is amazing.

471
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,834
Go ahead and open it.

472
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:27,842
Open it, Som-O.

473
00:25:27,857 --> 00:25:28,917
- Open it.
- Should I?

474
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:30,765
What could this be?

475
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:32,565
Stuffed animals?

476
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:50,014
Oh, a shabu-shabu pot!

477
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:51,774
This is a great gift!

478
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,469
We can now make both shabu-shabu and barbecue.

479
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:55,407
Amazing.

480
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:02,219
Amazing.

481
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:06,740
Cheers!

482
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:10,773
Well-deserved.

483
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:12,223
Let’s eat.

484
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,204
Do you like shrimps?

485
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:14,739
Sure.

486
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:15,509
Stop it, nerd.

487
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:19,160
You eat, too, Tao.

488
00:26:21,322 --> 00:26:21,976
Try this, too.

489
00:26:23,577 --> 00:26:24,623
It’s alright.

490
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:26,275
I can do it myself.

491
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:30,407
But Som-O looks so happy when Tao does it for her.

492
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:32,109
Don’t be sad, nerd.

493
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:35,588
Here. This one is ready.

494
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:40,816
I want some, too.

495
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:44,671
Here. Eat lots of veggies.

496
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,777
I love veggies— Oh, that burns!

497
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,914
- Sorry.
- It’s okay.

498
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:50,029
I’m so sorry.

499
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:52,214
What, you jealous?

500
00:26:52,355 --> 00:26:53,817
The nerd is giving you plenty of food already.

501
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:54,875
I’m not jealous.

502
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:57,118
You want some more?

503
00:26:58,032 --> 00:26:58,622
No.

504
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:02,640
A year goes by so fast, doesn't it?

505
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,619
It sure does.

506
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,810
It’s been an eventful year, too.

507
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,478
I’d say it’s been quite impressive,

508
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:12,777
especially your shenanigans, Som-O.

509
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:15,801
He’s right.

510
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:18,211
Chad. New.

511
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:20,155
I did my best, you know?

512
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:22,102
“I did my best, you know?”

513
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:23,438
You hear that?

514
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:25,647
Stop it.

515
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,117
Why don’t you just eat more?

516
00:27:27,468 --> 00:27:28,259
Say “ah.”

517
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:31,995
New, you.

518
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:36,211
It’s almost midnight.

519
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:39,010
It is.

520
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,165
I’ll be eating into the new year.

521
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:43,340
Oh, you’re going to get so big, nerd.

522
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,241
Count me in.

523
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,761
Hurry up, Tao.

524
00:27:55,914 --> 00:27:58,717
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

525
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:25,004
I wish to make it into the national team.

526
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:26,844
Amen. Amen. Amen.

527
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:30,377
What?

528
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:32,099
You’re supposed to make wishes on New Year’s Day, right?

529
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:33,802
On fireworks?

530
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:36,226
Yeah, try it.

531
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:41,177
I wish to make it to NASA.

532
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:49,260
I wish to be healthy so I can be the most amazing game developer in the country.

533
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:53,214
Nerd, what’s that wish? You sound like an old man.

534
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:54,475
You wish to be healthy?

535
00:28:57,259 --> 00:28:58,257
Well…

536
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:01,106
Health is wealth, didn’t they say?

537
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,223
Am I right?

538
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,749
I wish… to become a heart surgeon.

539
00:29:10,155 --> 00:29:11,749
Oh!

540
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:17,542
Make a wish, Som.

541
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,026
I…

542
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:29,816
I don’t know what I want to be… or what I want.

543
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:31,832
It’s okay.

544
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,223
You have another year.

545
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:34,321
Am I right?

546
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:35,565
Yes.

547
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:38,465
It’s okay.

548
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:40,022
It’s alright.

549
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,705
Should we hurry up and get inside?

550
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:44,965
I’m getting cold.

551
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,660
Cold, you say?

552
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:49,722
Why didn’t you say so?

553
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:51,139
You’re cold?

554
00:29:51,274 --> 00:29:51,832
Yes.

555
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:53,117
Why didn’t you say so, buddy?

556
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:55,420
Hurry up, then.

557
00:29:57,322 --> 00:29:58,825
I’ll warm you up.

558
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:00,648
Oh, dear.

559
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:01,776
What do you think?

560
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,597
I’m not cold anymore, actually.

561
00:30:03,878 --> 00:30:08,576
(I’m really happy to spend time with my friends today.)

562
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:12,367
(I can just hope that I get to do this for a really long time.)

563
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:18,725
Here.

564
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:20,352
Som, come on.

565
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,626
Really?

566
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,081
You know how to read palms?

567
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:25,617
- Yes. - Read mine.

568
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,666
Look here.

569
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:31,780
Everyone has three lines on their hands.

570
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,764
This one tells us about life, this one work, and this one about love.

571
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:37,468
And?

572
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:42,019
It tells you how each aspect is going to be like.

573
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,019
I see.

574
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:46,179
Does that mean the lines change over the years?

575
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:48,051
Read mine.

576
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:51,865
Hurry up.

577
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:57,665
Well… can you show me your other hand too, please?

578
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,573
When you put them next to each other,

579
00:31:09,592 --> 00:31:11,096
the lines on your palms make the shape of a ship.

580
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:14,158
What does that mean?

581
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,900
It means you’re firm, loyal,

582
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,220
and you love someone with all your heart.

583
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:25,275
Oh!

584
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:29,317
Not everyone has the same looking ship.

585
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:31,315
But look at mine.

586
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,511
I have the same shape.

587
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:37,813
Come on. Take a look at mine, too.

588
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,303
As for you, Tao…

589
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:47,416
This says you love challenges and adventures.

590
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:48,364
Right.

591
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:50,764
What about love?

592
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:56,777
It says you change your mind quickly when it comes to love.

593
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,000
You can’t be pinned down easily.

594
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,970
Oh, that is so not true, you hoax.

595
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:03,900
But it also says you tend to get head over heels in love when the time comes.

596
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:05,900
Now that’s more like it.

597
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:06,854
What about me?

598
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:07,737
Try me.

599
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:09,315
As for you…

600
00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:15,942
You are always yourself.

601
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:17,872
You’re at the center of your friend group.

602
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,425
Everyone is happy around you.

603
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,360
You’re very reliable.

604
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:23,480
Really?

605
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:24,417
I’m that good?

606
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:25,717
Of course.

607
00:32:26,088 --> 00:32:27,407
Your palms don’t lie, you know?

608
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:29,247
As for your love life…

609
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:30,521
No, it’s okay.

610
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:31,976
I don't want to know anymore.

611
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:35,604
Your turn, Chadjen.

612
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:38,671
Hurry up.

613
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:40,782
Nah.

614
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:41,957
I don’t want mine read.

615
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:44,411
Just go along, man. You don’t have to believe it.

616
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:46,437
Come on.

617
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:47,394
It’s nothing.

618
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:48,909
Just your hands.

619
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:50,717
I’m accurate, you know?

620
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:52,717
It’s nonsense.

621
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,103
Don’t we have better games to be playing?

622
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:56,321
We do.

623
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:01,794
Ta-da!

624
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:02,557
What’s that?

625
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:03,828
Is that a jar?

626
00:33:05,185 --> 00:33:06,281
Here.

627
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:07,631
What is it?

628
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:10,023
I want you guys to write it in a piece of paper

629
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:12,866
who the first person you want to see on New Year’s Day is.

630
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,797
Then, we’ll all put our answer in this jar and pick one.

631
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,917
Most importantly, you must not tell anyone what you get.

632
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,379
Alright. Let’s begin.

633
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:28,385
Easy, right?

634
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:30,062
Give me some paper.

635
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:39,401
How do I fold this?

636
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:40,868
In half, maybe?

637
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,290
(Mhog)

638
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,170
(Khao)

639
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,250
(Parents)

640
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,010
(Som-O)

641
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:32,625
Should we go to sleep?

642
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,506
Oh, perfect timing.

643
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,041
I’m getting tired.

644
00:34:42,035 --> 00:34:42,601
Let’s go.

645
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:43,877
Let’s lay out some futons.

646
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:16,164
(Oh, how nice of Khao to worry about me.)

647
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,008
What are you doing out here all by yourself?

648
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,219
Guess I just can’t sleep.

649
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,269
Maybe my body isn’t used to sleeping in new places.

650
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,700
You come here every day. It’s hardly a new place.

651
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:25,124
You can go back and sleep at home, you know?

652
00:36:27,573 --> 00:36:28,308
It’s okay.

653
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:35,014
Hey.

654
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:37,420
Can I ask you something?

655
00:36:40,485 --> 00:36:44,608
What you said to me after the school play mess…

656
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:48,269
Did you really think that?

657
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:52,308
No.

658
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,106
I didn’t.

659
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:03,201
I’m sorry, Som.

660
00:37:07,188 --> 00:37:08,007
It’s okay.

661
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:12,137
I won’t think about it again now that you apologized.

662
00:37:15,964 --> 00:37:16,511
Oh.

663
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:18,825
I’ve got something for you.

664
00:37:19,926 --> 00:37:21,185
Happy New Year again.

665
00:37:41,432 --> 00:37:43,167
For when you study.

666
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,054
It suits you.

667
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:50,853
Thank you.

668
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:54,908
And…

669
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:58,411
Happy New Year again, too.

670
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:18,614
Sit down for the blessing.

671
00:40:19,522 --> 00:40:20,094
Yes.

672
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:28,100
May you be blessed with longevity, health, happiness, and strength.

673
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,008
What are you looking at?

674
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,444
Let’s get inside.

675
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:40,970
Just take the whole table.

676
00:41:17,878 --> 00:41:18,598
Hello?

677
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:21,940
(Som-O, we’re on the way home.)

678
00:41:22,223 --> 00:41:23,739
(We will be there in a bit.)

679
00:41:24,721 --> 00:41:25,511
Yes, Mom.

680
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:28,773
Crap!

681
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,275
What should I do?

682
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,605
This place is a mess.

683
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:34,208
Mom’s coming.

684
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:37,374
What happened?

685
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,851
Mom just called to say she’s almost home.

686
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:43,739
What should I do?

687
00:41:45,657 --> 00:41:47,102
Oh, we’re in trouble.

688
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:48,675
There’s only four of us now.

689
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:50,068
Tao already left.

690
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,949
It’s okay. We’ll just do our best.

691
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:57,714
Don’t worry. We’ve got a secret weapon.

692
00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:08,296
What?

693
00:42:09,555 --> 00:42:10,355
Aren’t we cleaning up?

694
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:20,777
Did you eat this?

695
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:22,361
What? No.

696
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,939
It was Tao.

697
00:42:52,026 --> 00:42:53,314
(I couldn’t sleep at all.)

698
00:42:53,842 --> 00:42:55,423
(And I miss my friends so bad.)

699
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:06,204
Your teacher called the other day to tell me she wants to discuss your grades.

700
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,740
Have you decided which university you’re going to?

701
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:10,463
I’m waiting for my friends to decide.

702
00:43:10,894 --> 00:43:12,660
Your future doesn’t depend on your friends.

703
00:43:13,488 --> 00:43:14,740
Tao has an athlete scholarship.

704
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:16,140
Let me be frank with you.

705
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,810
I don’t want Tao to throw his future away because of you.

706
00:43:18,004 --> 00:43:19,890
The only person he cares about is himself.

707
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:21,949
He didn’t make it to the Olympics.

708
00:43:22,157 --> 00:43:24,674
He’s putting all his dreams on my shoulders.

709
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:25,937
Are you messing with me?

710
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:31,385
You don’t go to school.

711
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,339
You’re not at home.

712
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:36,725
I thought you were busy studying.

713
00:43:37,162 --> 00:43:38,419
Are you outside?

714
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:39,502
I got the tickets!

715
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:40,333
I got them!

716
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:42,706
Where are you right now? I’ll go to you.
