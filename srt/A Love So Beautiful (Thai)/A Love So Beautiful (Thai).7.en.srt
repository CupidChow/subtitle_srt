1
00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:01,821
You know if you are on the national team,

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,573
you won’t have much time to spend with your friends.

3
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:05,104
That’s all I want.

4
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:07,429
I just want to be with them a bit longer.

5
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:08,464
If that’s what you want,

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,643
I’ll let you do it.

7
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:13,373
You did well today when you hit them.

8
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,221
Next time, you cannot be soft and weak like this.

9
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,546
Here, Tao.

10
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:18,423
I thought you were going to ask me to go with you.

11
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:19,873
The tickets are fake.

12
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:21,438
I think you are scammed.

13
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:22,380
Let’s go home.

14
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,820
We can’t hear much anyway even if we sit here.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,130
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

16
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:43,913
I’m sorry, Chad.

17
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,407
I messed up today so we didn’t get to see the concert.

18
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:49,407
It’s alright.

19
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,375
But don’t you want to?

20
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:00,063
Of course I do.

21
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:07,352
But this is okay, too.

22
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:13,710
Right.

23
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:16,503
If you say so.

24
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:41,004
(When someone asks you what your life is like,)

25
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,001
(you often mention the important moments.)

26
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:45,909
(But in reality,)

27
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:50,941
(it’s the little moments that mean the most.)

28
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,112
They’re here.

29
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:54,218
Well?

30
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,021
How was the concert last night? Was it fun?

31
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:58,723
I’d love to tell you it was.

32
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:00,950
But I got scammed into buying fake tickets.

33
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:05,160
Did you—

34
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,700
Hold it.

35
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:07,147
I don’t want a lecture.

36
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,807
I’ve been hurt enough, you know?

37
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:11,410
Well, what did you do?

38
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:12,812
We didn’t do anything.

39
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:15,880
We just sat outside the hall listening to music.

40
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,270
What a waste of money and time.

41
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,212
Sorry.

42
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,607
It’s okay.

43
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,216
Just think of it as taking the time off to slow down.

44
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,744
You were too stressed about school so you deserved to relax.

45
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:43,780
Let’s get inside.

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,110
- Alright.
- Let’s go.

47
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,572
Hey, have you guys heard?

48
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:50,169
We’re supposed to work in a group of three to write a report.

49
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:55,421
As for you… at least try to do a good job.

50
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:57,844
Dear God,

51
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,706
please let me get to work with people who actually know what they’re doing

52
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,206
so I don’t have to take on all the workload.

53
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,207
Som.

54
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,807
Heard that?

55
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:12,981
I think she was talking about you.

56
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:16,535
Dear God,

57
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:18,350
please don’t put me in the same group as her.

58
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,663
Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

59
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,423
Amen!

60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,484
You were talking about Lily, weren’t you?

61
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:28,378
Not us?

62
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,378
Yeah.

63
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,461
What a relief.

64
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:33,780
Shall we go?

65
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:34,607
Sure.

66
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,113
Please, not the same group.

67
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:41,884
My life has gotta be a joke.

68
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:48,158
It’s good that we’re in the same group, right?

69
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:49,450
I can help you out, Som.

70
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,169
Don’t worry, Chad.

71
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,818
Alright, guys.

72
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:02,347
Now that you’re in groups. I hope you work together well.

73
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:06,203
We’ve got the other schools in our district with us today.

74
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:08,515
So I hope you play nice.

75
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,861
Behave as well as you look, guys.

76
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:15,967
But like, they’re much more good-looking than us.

77
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:22,007
Alright. If you’re all set, follow me.

78
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:22,764
Come on.

79
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,001
Let’s go, Chad.

80
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:26,907
Come on up.

81
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:37,212
Hey.

82
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,450
You guys take care of the report.

83
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:41,712
I’m gonna bail on that.

84
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,104
Not only are you not helping, but you’re gonna be a burden?

85
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:46,524
What?

86
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,215
That’s harsh, Khao.

87
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:50,215
Fine. I’ll help out.

88
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:51,624
Gimme that.

89
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:57,706
But…

90
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:00,436
Sukhothai and Ayutthaya,

91
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:02,207
which period is older again?

92
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,976
Mr. Tao, sir, you don’t even know that much?

93
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:10,976
Why, is it a common thing to know?

94
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:12,976
Sukhothai is older.

95
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,201
Is it important which is older than which?

96
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:18,883
I think it is.

97
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:20,763
You really should know that.

98
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:23,076
Just get inside, shall we?

99
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:23,773
Alright.

100
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,210
Come on, Khao.

101
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:33,581
Oh, this room is great.

102
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,558
Come look at this.

103
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:41,404
Excuse me.

104
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:43,252
Chadjen, what is that?

105
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,426
Hey, isn’t this Phra Aphai Mani?

106
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,107
Chad, come look.

107
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:53,181
What is that?

108
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:54,076
It’s…

109
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,793
Oh, it’s Phra Aphai Mani.

110
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:02,100
Look at this coin.

111
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,316
Let me see.

112
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:04,963
What’s that?

113
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:07,816
That’s some tiny music instrument.

114
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,366
What’s going on? Let me see.

115
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:12,021
Oh.

116
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,840
This is perfect for the report.

117
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:15,613
Why don’t you take some photos of this?

118
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,856
Hey, let me see, too.

119
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,298
Oh, this is great.

120
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:24,513
Why don’t you come take a closer look?

121
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:27,278
Oh, wow.

122
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,941
Let’s go.

123
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,143
That’s not bad.

124
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:44,047
Sorry.

125
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:44,706
Sorry.

126
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,670
It’s okay.

127
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:55,933
What’s wrong?

128
00:07:57,107 --> 00:08:01,206
I happened to tell Dad that there would be students from other schools today.

129
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,581
Won’t that be dangerous, Som?

130
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,263
Will Chad be there?

131
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:11,501
Are you sure the teachers will be able to take care of you all?

132
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,053
Come on, Dad.

133
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:14,586
What’s your problem?

134
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,072
It’s no big deal.

135
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:19,409
Don’t worry. There will be students from other schools there, too.

136
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:20,663
Other schools?

137
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:22,330
Other schools…

138
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:23,607
Which ones?

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,607
Well, just the ones in the same district.

140
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,607
Three schools in total.

141
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:30,116
Three schools in the same district?

142
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:31,449
Are they all-boy or all-girl schools?

143
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,316
Mixed, like mine.

144
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,856
Does that mean there will be a lot of boys you have never seen before?

145
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:42,312
Come on, dear.

146
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:44,940
It’s just like going to school.

147
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,252
It’s clearly not the same.

148
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:50,904
We don’t know anything about these boys.

149
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:55,550
There are hundreds of students at her school that we don’t know, either.

150
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:56,553
I know that.

151
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:59,947
And I’m constantly worried about that.

152
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,206
But we’re fortunate to have Chadjen with her so I can rest easy for a bit.

153
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,103
It’s not like he does anything.

154
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:08,569
Did you say something?

155
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:10,170
No.

156
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:15,061
Boys these days are just too cheeky.

157
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:16,635
They’re hasty and handsy, too.

158
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:19,053
You have to be careful around them.

159
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:20,126
Dad.

160
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:22,784
It’s just a field trip to a museum.

161
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,321
What are you saying?

162
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:29,220
What if a boy approaches you for your number?

163
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,409
I know my daughter is beautiful enough to attract someone.

164
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:38,640
If someone asks for your number, just give them mine.

165
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:40,212
I’ll help you screen them.

166
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:41,123
Mom!

167
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:43,318
Don’t encourage her, dear!

168
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,046
Just go, babe.

169
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:47,246
Go now.

170
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:48,175
No, she can’t.

171
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,300
- I’m still talking to you.
- Just go.

172
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,000
Hey.

173
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:54,306
Report back to me with photos.

174
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:56,764
Give me your teacher’s number!

175
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:03,958
He seems to worry about you a lot, even the way that you are.

176
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:08,509
Yeah, he says I’m not pretty and then he’s still worried about me.

177
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:10,496
He’s not wrong.

178
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,816
What? Are you saying I’m not pretty, Chad, you jerk!

179
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:15,606
What did you just call me?

180
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:17,207
What?

181
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,524
I… I didn’t say anything.

182
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:26,310
Wait, I need to use the restroom.

183
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,295
Go and wait at the changing room.

184
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:29,352
I’ll be there.

185
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:36,509
How is this?

186
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:38,149
Yeah.

187
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,521
If you’re done, just go away.

188
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:46,169
Lily.

189
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:47,340
Yes, Chad?

190
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,070
Have you seen Som-O?

191
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,710
I… don’t know.

192
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:06,676
Chad.

193
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:13,747
Oh, look.

194
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,223
- Who’s that? - Take a photo.

195
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,446
What is she wearing?

196
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:20,312
Who’s that?

197
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,021
Why?

198
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:27,607
- That’s just not right. - Come on here.

199
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:29,464
Chad.

200
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,664
Min-min, Fahsai, come here.

201
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:36,121
What’s with her?

202
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,636
It’s just so…

203
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:40,869
Is Som-O okay?

204
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:42,301
What’s with that getup?

205
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:46,295
The staff said they ran out of costumes.

206
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,875
This is the only one left.

207
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,621
What, are you embarrassed?

208
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:54,867
Yeah.

209
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:56,815
Come on.

210
00:11:57,872 --> 00:11:58,612
Stick to me.

211
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,866
Hey, since you’re all dressed up, let’s take a photo.

212
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,878
Yeah, good idea.

213
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:12,672
It is.

214
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:13,429
That sounds nice.

215
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,175
Over there.

216
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:22,126
Alright, ready?

217
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:28,210
Som-O, since you’re dressed as a servant,

218
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:29,820
come and take a photo for us.

219
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,172
Fitting.

220
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:36,432
That’s a servant costume, right?

221
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:47,686
One, two…

222
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:49,506
Three—

223
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:55,375
Don’t.

224
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:01,272
Why don’t you take your own photos?

225
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:09,061
What the hell?

226
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,176
The famous Tao the Shark.

227
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:26,852
This is getting out of hand.

228
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,607
We’re not done with the report, either.

229
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,123
Let’s go.

230
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:39,784
Where are we going?

231
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:43,006
You’re dressed as a soldier.

232
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:45,532
You don’t question what the girl dressed as a lady tells you to do.

233
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:48,010
Yes, ma’am!

234
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,055
Thank you. Thank you.

235
00:13:55,956 --> 00:14:01,110
Hey, my Lord, please get back to work now that your fans are gone.

236
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,086
She’s right.

237
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:03,906
Khao.

238
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:06,996
You won’t ever understand what a hot guy like me is going through.

239
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:10,160
So just follow me, alright?

240
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:31,780
Can we get this report done already? I’m tired.

241
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:32,809
Hey, Khao.

242
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:34,669
I knew you’d be here.

243
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,138
I saw a lot of students from our school so I guessed that much.

244
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:38,821
Hello, Mhog.

245
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,476
Are you in…

246
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,720
Medical school, yes.

247
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,286
Are you here to take care of people who faint, then?

248
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,006
Oh, right.

249
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:50,018
But that’s not all we can do.

250
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:53,615
We brought a lot of stuff so we can perform all types of procedures.

251
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:56,856
We can treat fractures, perform I and D, and anything that needs ET tubes.

252
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:59,461
If you want to know more, you should stop by.

253
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,032
I’ll have my friends give you a tour.

254
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,500
Excuse me.

255
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,183
Slow down, nerd.

256
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,116
Whao, hey.

257
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,620
Hey.

258
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,018
That’s dangerous.

259
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,669
Drinking cold water too fast when it’s extremely hot can make you sick.

260
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:20,316
I’m hot.

261
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:21,798
Thank you.

262
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:22,749
Excuse me.

263
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:24,332
What?

264
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:25,193
Nerd?

265
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,955
Hey.

266
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:27,703
New, where are you going?

267
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,750
Excuse me.

268
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:30,415
Sure.

269
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:32,624
Hey.

270
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:46,740
Chad.

271
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:49,556
Thanks for what you did back there just now.

272
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,315
Oh, Chadjen.

273
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,423
There you are. I’ve been looking everywhere for you.

274
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:08,960
You guys can go.

275
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:10,373
I have to take care of this report.

276
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:11,895
Okay, Lily. See ya later.

277
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,776
Have fun with Chadjen.

278
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,712
Let’s go work on that report, Chad.

279
00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:18,490
Come on.

280
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:29,052
Hello, guys.

281
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:32,746
We’re making a little news scoop today.

282
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:34,813
Is it okay if we interview you?

283
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:37,170
Of course.

284
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:39,706
What do you think identifies Thai people?

285
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,298
My friend here wants to give you an answer.

286
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:48,213
Alright.

287
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:50,215
Can we adjust the camera a little bit?

288
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:51,189
Me?

289
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,103
Yeah, sure.

290
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,070
Let’s go with this angle.

291
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:55,876
A little more.

292
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,689
That’s perfect.

293
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,464
Alright.

294
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:03,960
What do you think identifies Thai people?

295
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:12,833
Well… that would be me.

296
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,310
Can you elaborate?

297
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,430
Like, this costume I’m wearing.

298
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:23,104
What identifies Thai people is the ability to change when need be.

299
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:25,703
We’re good at fusing foreign cultures into our own.

300
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:28,215
And we love each other for it.

301
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:31,567
We’re open to differences and changes.

302
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:34,815
What defines Contemporary Thai is that we can match the pace of the world.

303
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,841
Thank you.

304
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:39,306
Of course.

305
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:44,907
Good job, Gewalin.

306
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:48,763
You understand the purpose of this field trip perfectly.

307
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,696
That would be great on the report.

308
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:52,183
Yes.

309
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,773
Well, of course.

310
00:17:55,238 --> 00:18:00,015
I showed her around and had to explain everything to her so many times

311
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,263
before she finally got it.

312
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:02,806
Am I right, Gewalin?

313
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:08,901
Mr. Pong, excuse us but we’re going to continue with the report.

314
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:12,281
You guys can get changed and get ready to go home.

315
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,318
It’s getting late.

316
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:15,995
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

317
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:29,206
Where’s the nerd gone?

318
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,287
I don’t know.

319
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:31,204
The toilet, maybe.

320
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,009
If that’s the case, this will be a while.

321
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,898
The costume is really hard to take off.

322
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:40,007
And he’s drunk a lot of water just now when we were with Mhog.

323
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:43,407
By the way, what’s his deal with Mhog anyway?

324
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:44,912
Good question.

325
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:48,006
Oh, Khao.

326
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:49,575
You guys haven’t gone home yet?

327
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,069
The first aid team is already leaving.

328
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,318
We’re leaving soon, too.

329
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,109
There’s a report to finish.

330
00:18:57,372 --> 00:19:00,213
Excuse me, but you’ve got something on your eyebrow.

331
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:02,018
Let me help.

332
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:41,475
Help! Someone’s passed out!

333
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,141
Help! Help!

334
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,220
Are you okay?

335
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:47,378
Who passed out?

336
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:48,961
Hey, how are you feeling?

337
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,886
He’s passed out! Help!

338
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:52,807
New!

339
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:54,418
New, what’s wrong?

340
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:55,618
New!

341
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:00,850
Nerd!

342
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,036
What’s going on?

343
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:03,816
New!

344
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,901
- Nerd! - New, hold it together.

345
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:07,503
What's wrong with him?

346
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:08,906
New…

347
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,658
(They said, in your last moment,)

348
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,006
(the last thing that flashes in your head)

349
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:18,810
(is the most important thing in your life.)

350
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:22,863
New.

351
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,066
New.

352
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:29,276
New.

353
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,026
New.

354
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,933
Please wait outside.

355
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:33,215
Nerd, hang in there!

356
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,452
Are you guys New’s friends?

357
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:41,453
Yes.

358
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:42,607
What’s happened?

359
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:48,212
We were on a field trip when New suddenly fell to his knees.

360
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,607
We don’t know what’s wrong.

361
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,601
He’s been in the ER for half an hour now.

362
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,666
There’s no update yet.

363
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:03,290
That’s why he needs his medicine.

364
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,696
What medicine?

365
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:11,104
Beta-blocker that lowers his heart rate so it’s not too high.

366
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:15,263
Let me through.

367
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,807
New. New!

368
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,216
Sir, please wait outside.

369
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,820
But is my son alright?

370
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:24,024
Nurse?

371
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,016
I’m New’s Dad.

372
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:42,204
Can you give the medicine to him?

373
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,606
If he doesn’t take the medicine, he will be in trouble.

374
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,007
Didn’t you say you went abroad with your family?

375
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:51,147
I…

376
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:56,666
I just got back this morning.

377
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,470
Haven’t gotten a chance to tell you.

378
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,309
Uncle.

379
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:04,460
Did New go anywhere abroad last year?

380
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,415
Abroad?

381
00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:10,112
With his condition, I won’t likely allow him.

382
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:12,316
What would I do if something happened when he was far away?

383
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,007
The thing is…

384
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:20,735
His condition worsened last year

385
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,818
so he had to stay home for a month.

386
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:27,806
I took him to a heart checkup and now we know what’s wrong with him.

387
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:29,666
What is it?

388
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,144
Cardiac arrhythmia.

389
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:37,140
I wanted him to drop out of school.

390
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,706
But he was insistently refusing,

391
00:22:42,286 --> 00:22:43,612
saying he wanted to be with his friends.

392
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,829
He said he was going to finish high school soon,

393
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,413
and that a person only gets to experience senior year once in a lifetime.

394
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,953
Are you Sassawat’s family?

395
00:22:58,441 --> 00:22:59,001
That’s me.

396
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:00,206
I’m his father.

397
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:04,203
The patient’s heart is now beating normally.

398
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:05,916
- Good. - But since he’s still unconscious,

399
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:09,701
I’d like to keep him monitored in the ICU for a while.

400
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:13,100
Yes.

401
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:16,055
When will he wake up, Doctor?

402
00:23:17,121 --> 00:23:19,149
I can’t say for sure.

403
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,221
We’re waiting for his brain scan

404
00:23:21,513 --> 00:23:23,715
to see if his brain took damage from the lack of oxygen

405
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,304
and how he’ll get on later.

406
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,238
Excuse us for now.

407
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:30,153
Thank you.

408
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,370
1 WEEK LATER

409
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,500
Oh, here’s some good lines, kid.

410
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,463
Listen, alright?

411
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:09,769
“Nature protects us.”

412
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:13,667
“We are no smarter than a bird, or an animal.”

413
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,120
“They know how to live to be happy.”

414
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:19,109
“They are smarter than us.”

415
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:25,163
It means, humans like us should learn to find joy in the smallest things.

416
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,207
So that we can be as good as the birds and the mice.

417
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:31,410
“Shores and what remains…”

418
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:32,963
“The face of—”

419
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:34,527
Hello, Uncle.

420
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,349
Oh, hey there, kids.

421
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:38,567
Are you guys here to see New?

422
00:24:38,664 --> 00:24:39,349
Yes.

423
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:40,478
Thank you for coming.

424
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,924
You can take a rest, Uncle.

425
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:45,209
We’ll look after New for now.

426
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:46,721
Will you?

427
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:47,469
Of course.

428
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,220
I haven’t gotten a good night’s sleep in a while.

429
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:52,723
I’ll go grab some coffee to freshen up.

430
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:53,513
Yes.

431
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:54,272
Please.

432
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:55,256
Don’t worry, sir.

433
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:56,820
Thanks, kids.

434
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:05,296
Oh, nerd.

435
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,063
I should have been nicer to you when I got the chance.

436
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:15,023
Tao, New isn’t dead!

437
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,023
I’m kidding.

438
00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:20,678
Oh, poor nerd.

439
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:26,056
So that’s why he said that at the New Year party.

440
00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:31,813
I wish to be healthy so I can be the most amazing game developer in the country.

441
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:34,341
Nerd, what’s that wish?

442
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:35,816
You sound like an old man.

443
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:39,741
Well…

444
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,612
Health is wealth, didn’t they say?

445
00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:49,343
Oh.

446
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,221
Nerd.

447
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,816
When you wake up, I promise I won’t mess with you anymore.

448
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:58,766
Can you do that?

449
00:25:59,678 --> 00:26:00,812
I feel like you’re messing with him even now.

450
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:05,107
Anything to say, Som?

451
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:09,316
It’s very lonely when you’re not here.

452
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:11,004
Nobody plays with me.

453
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,147
Because you play like a middle schooler.

454
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:14,715
Khao!

455
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:17,315
Yeah, that.

456
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:20,289
So come back soon, New.

457
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:22,538
I need someone to goof off with.

458
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:24,715
You hear me?

459
00:26:27,947 --> 00:26:28,700
Your turn.

460
00:26:33,244 --> 00:26:34,224
Get well soon, New.

461
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:36,433
Exams are coming.

462
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,850
What the hell? That’s terrible.

463
00:26:52,926 --> 00:26:53,581
New.

464
00:26:58,649 --> 00:26:59,309
Nerd.

465
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:05,704
You should know you’re the only man to ever make Khao speechless.

466
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:07,503
Congrats.

467
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:09,503
Wake up already.

468
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:12,673
Dead silence.

469
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,670
No response.

470
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:16,370
Just look at him.

471
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:20,215
Don’t be sad.

472
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,920
2 WEEKS LATER

473
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:33,770

475
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:17,600
Moving on to “contractile vacuole.”

4 WEEKS LATER
Moving on to “contractile vacuole.”

4 WEEKS LATER

478
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:21,530
You explained this to me once.
4 WEEKS LATER

479
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,984
You explained this to me once.

480
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:29,806
It’s basically a single-cell organism like amoeba or paramecium, you know?

481
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,810
5 WEEKS LATER

482
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:38,858
Hello.

483
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:40,147
Hello, Uncle.

484
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:43,016
How is he doing?

485
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:46,104
He’s hanging in there.

486
00:28:47,763 --> 00:28:48,766
Well, you tired, kid?

487
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:51,518
Not at all. I just came here from school.

488
00:28:52,236 --> 00:28:54,778
Have you had anything to eat yet?

489
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:56,256
I got something with me.

490
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,592
Let me plate it for you.

491
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:58,593
Oh, it’s okay.

492
00:28:58,764 --> 00:29:00,309
I’ll handle that.

493
00:29:00,492 --> 00:29:01,403
Thanks.

494
00:29:01,424 --> 00:29:02,006
Of course.

495
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:06,146
Khao, keep an eye on him for a bit, alright?

496
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:07,456
Of course.

497
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,170
6 WEEKS LATER

498
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,530
(I want to hear your voice, New. Wake up.) / (Thinking about you, New.)

499
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,490
(I’m always happy with you around.)

500
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,730
(It’s been too long.) / (Always thinking about you.)

501
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,770
(I’ll come here again tomorrow. Miss you.)

502
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,610
(Really miss you.) / (Can’t wait to hear your voice.)
(Getting mad at you for not waking up already.)

503
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,060
Som, have breakfast.

504
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:19,067
Hey, eat your food.

505
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:29,018
Som, I said have breakfast!

506
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,723
What?

507
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:32,124
Are you going to beat me, Mom?

508
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:34,446
She was telling you to have breakfast.

509
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:36,709
Oh…

510
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,176
You could have just said that.

511
00:30:39,643 --> 00:30:41,084
Well, you weren’t listening.

512
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:45,169
You rot in those PJs all morning and study at the dining table.

513
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,169
Have you even brushed your teeth since you woke up?

514
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:50,273
I have!

515
00:30:53,595 --> 00:30:58,910
Listen, I know it’s about to be finals week.

516
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,004
But studying all the time like this…

517
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:05,729
Your mother and I are worried about you.

518
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:08,809
I can’t waste any more time.

519
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,015
I’m late catching up with the lessons so I need to cram everything.

520
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:17,173
Alright.

521
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,012
Chadjen.

522
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,447
Like, honestly.

523
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,703
You’re good at maths. How do you even solve these x’s and y’s?

524
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,123
Look at this.

525
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,309
Why do I have to multiply it?

526
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:39,563
Hang on.

527
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:47,007
Here.

528
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:51,975
The notes I’ve been keeping since Grade 10 until now.

529
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:55,336
Wow.

530
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:58,416
You’re a genius.

531
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:05,966
How do you solve for x here if it’s x+3.

532
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:07,763
Combine like terms.

533
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:10,860
So both sides of the equation will be minus by 3.

534
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,327
Wait, minus by what?

535
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,376
3.

536
00:32:14,096 --> 00:32:14,720
Here.

537
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:17,016
Write it down, x+3.

538
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,538
x+3…

EXAM RESULT ANNOUNCEMENT DAY

540
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,810
(Final Result School Year 2013)

541
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:27,321
Where is my name?

542
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,860
Som, maybe you did so bad you aren't even on the list.

543
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,449
You and I are always one of the last and you have the nerve to say that?

544
00:32:42,736 --> 00:32:44,558
Hey, how did you do?

545
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:45,661
I’m in 14th place.

546
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,412
What a relief.

547
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:49,627
Thank you for helping me study, Fahsai.

548
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:51,104
Not at all.

549
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:53,278
You studied well, Min.

550
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,961
It was worth all the time you took off from your dance cover.

551
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:57,343
It was. I’m going to dance so much to make up now.

552
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:58,506
Go for it.

553
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,006
More.

554
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:02,096
Hey, how did I do?

555
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:03,144
Have you guys checked for me?

556
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:07,218
- You gotta be in the top three, of course. - Definitely, Lily.

557
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,404
Hey, I found my name.

558
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:12,460
I’m in 39th place.

559
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:14,060
Your name is nowhere near it, though.

560
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,210
What about my name?

561
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,104
You don’t have to check.

562
00:33:21,176 --> 00:33:22,400
You’re definitely in first place.

563
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,415
Move.

564
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:30,907
Get out of the way.

565
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:37,583
Hey, we’re right next to each other. I’m in second place.

566
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,200
Look at this, Som.

567
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,907
(3 Gewalin Asarattana)
Look at this, Som.

568
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:41,890
(3 Gewalin Asarattana)

569
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:44,204
Third place?

570
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:47,807
Hey, I’m in third place!

571
00:33:48,815 --> 00:33:49,556
It’s there.

572
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:51,355
You did it!

573
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,572
Third place!

574
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:56,576
I almost got straight A’s. Only one B.

575
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:58,933
You’re amazing.

576
00:33:59,223 --> 00:34:00,709
You did even better than me.

577
00:34:00,723 --> 00:34:02,036
I’m in fourth place.

578
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:08,652
Som, if you got another A, you would have done better than Lily.

579
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:09,624
She would.

580
00:34:09,906 --> 00:34:12,410
That means you can take your pick with college.

581
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:13,955
What do you want to study?

582
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,633
I want to go to medical school.

583
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,704
So you want to be Dr. Gewalin.

584
00:34:25,284 --> 00:34:26,676
I guess I have to be a patient now.

585
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,446
Congratulations on your exam.

586
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:38,943
I’m still so far away from you, though.

587
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:44,316
I think you can do anything if you set your mind to it.

588
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:48,461
Chadjen.

589
00:34:50,206 --> 00:34:52,326
I’ve decided to go to medical school.

590
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:59,267
From now on, we’ll be walking side by side.

591
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:08,021
Are you sure?

592
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:09,790
Of course.

593
00:35:10,623 --> 00:35:11,849
Don’t worry about me.

594
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,163
Just get used to calling me Dr. Som-O.

595
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,760
Bye.

596
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:21,463
Dr. Som-O, huh?

597
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,995
Dr. Som-O…

598
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:32,024
New, Som did it.

599
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:35,466
She would’ve got straight A’s, if it wasn’t for Maths.

600
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:38,412
But she’s the third best in our class.

601
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:40,553
She’s amazing.

602
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:44,920
Everyone’s really happy for her.

603
00:35:45,818 --> 00:35:48,806
Even Chadjen was smiling, imagine that.

604
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:54,878
And you know what the funniest part was?

605
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:58,860
Som suddenly said she’s going to med school.

606
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,750
She must be out of her mind.

607
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:07,016
Hey, you can’t keep missing something funny like that.

608
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,649
Wake up already.

609
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:14,218
Everyone misses you, and misses messing with you.

610
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:17,715
Wake up.

611
00:36:37,852 --> 00:36:39,409
I really miss you, too.

612
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,164
You’ll finally wake up one of these days, won’t you?

613
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:46,472
New?

614
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:56,075
Nurse!

615
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:35,273
Has New come to?

616
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,855
Doctor! Doctor!

617
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:37,786
He’s back?

618
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:39,241
How is my son, doc?

619
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:41,396
He’s definitely conscious now.

620
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:43,609
But we should let his body slowly recover.

621
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:44,320
Of course.

622
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:47,698
Let him take a lot of rest for now.

623
00:38:47,727 --> 00:38:48,818
Of course, sir.

624
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:50,066
Excuse us.

625
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,309
Thank you so much.

626
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,016
Please.

627
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:54,484
How are you feeling, kid?

628
00:38:54,743 --> 00:38:55,246
Nerd.

629
00:38:55,263 --> 00:38:55,780
Kid.

630
00:38:55,795 --> 00:38:56,398
Nerd.

631
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:57,660
Nerd.

632
00:38:57,709 --> 00:38:58,207
New.

633
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,881
He’s opening his eyes.

634
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:05,883
Kid.

635
00:39:06,784 --> 00:39:07,338
New.

636
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,421
Get away from me, Mhog!

637
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:11,596
Leave me alone!

638
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:13,116
Nerd!

639
00:39:14,293 --> 00:39:15,143
- Nerd! - New?

640
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:15,935
It’s me!

641
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,010
Put his glasses on.

642
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:20,123
It’s me.

643
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:21,584
It’s me!

644
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:23,887
Don’t you recognize my voice?

645
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,209
It’s me, Som.

646
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:32,615
Your friends are all here, kid.

647
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:37,335
He got it.

648
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:39,518
- I apologize for him. - It’s alright.

649
00:39:39,806 --> 00:39:40,650
I’m sorry.

650
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:43,267
I guess I had a bad dream.

651
00:39:44,573 --> 00:39:45,661
It’s okay, kid.

652
00:39:48,103 --> 00:39:49,767
How long was I asleep, Dad?

653
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:53,812
Long enough to scare your old man, kid.

654
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:55,453
Give me a hug.

655
00:39:55,618 --> 00:39:57,003
The nerd is back!

656
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:58,201
Group hug!

657
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:00,956
Wait, wait, I can’t breathe.

658
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,086
Your friends are here to see you.

659
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:04,750
Give him a hug, you guys.

660
00:40:05,301 --> 00:40:06,256
Gently.

661
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:10,100
Nerd, I got something for you.

662
00:40:10,738 --> 00:40:11,910
Can you eat, though?

663
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,413
His body has begun to recover.

664
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:18,941
I’ll discharge him so he can continue the rest of his recovery at home.

665
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:23,413
But be careful with stress and exhaustion for now.

666
00:40:23,747 --> 00:40:26,216
Those things can affect his heart rate,

667
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:28,321
which can be bad for his health.

668
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:32,721
Is there a way to treat this illness?

669
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,910
I think that’s a question for when the patient is much stronger.

670
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:41,915
We can talk about treatment options later.

671
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:46,689
What if he got worse when he’s at school or something like this happened again,

672
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,310
what can we do?

673
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:50,523
You don’t have to worry about that.

674
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:54,181
He can go about his day-to-day life like normal now.

675
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:58,181
But I suggest he take a rest at home for the time being.

676
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,264
Once his body is stronger, he can go back to school.

677
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:08,258
But we’re about to take our university entrance exam.

678
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:09,967
Will that be possible…

679
00:41:10,024 --> 00:41:15,521
Then I suggest you don’t put too much pressure on him.

680
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:19,367
What matters most right now is his health.

681
00:41:20,315 --> 00:41:22,309
Get a lot of rest.

682
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,026
Yes, sir.

683
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,538
I’ll let you talk.

684
00:41:25,732 --> 00:41:26,358
Yes.

685
00:41:26,513 --> 00:41:27,238
Thank you.

686
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:27,990
Thank you.

687
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:37,303
Khao.

688
00:41:38,224 --> 00:41:40,913
Thank you for coming by to see him all the time.

689
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:42,236
Of course.

690
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:47,007
There’s still something I’m worried about.

691
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,436
It’s school.

692
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,643
I just think that you should…

693
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:54,378
New can definitely come back to school.

694
00:41:54,747 --> 00:41:55,973
Don’t worry.

695
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:57,315
Right?

696
00:42:02,616 --> 00:42:03,461
Of course.

697
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,207
That’s what I was going to say.

698
00:42:05,243 --> 00:42:07,509
I want him to go back to school soon.

699
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,473
But can I ask you to keep an eye on him, Khao?

700
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,013
Dad, I can take care of myself.

701
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:16,880
Stop it, you.

702
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:20,310
If something like this happened again, what would you do?

703
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,680
Don’t worry, Uncle.

704
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,664
Som-O, Chadjen, and Tao will help me out with this.

705
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,664
We’ll all keep an eye on him.

706
00:42:27,732 --> 00:42:29,013
Don’t you worry at all.

707
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:33,426
Som-O, Chadjen, and Tao aren’t the same.

708
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:35,384
They’re nothing like you, you know?

709
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:37,621
I trust you, Khao.

710
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:41,846
Well, let’s just say, I’m trusting you to look after him for me.

711
00:42:42,235 --> 00:42:42,966
Alright?

712
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,867
Of course.

713
00:42:43,884 --> 00:42:44,821
No problem.

714
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:47,484
Dad!

715
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,353
I feel so much better.

716
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,892
You got it?

717
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,007
Just don’t overdo it, okay?

718
00:42:59,023 --> 00:42:59,652
Yes.

719
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,946
Guys, if we all go to the same university, it will definitely be fun!

720
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,583
I agree.

721
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:15,520
I’ll see you all in college.

722
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,647
It’s our last day of school.

723
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:20,269
Maybe we won’t get to see each other every day like this again.

724
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:25,404
I hope you get on the national team and get to the Olympics.

725
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:26,701
You can do it.

726
00:43:27,613 --> 00:43:30,023
Have you decided what school you’re going to?

727
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:31,181
Medical school!

728
00:43:31,266 --> 00:43:34,275
Are you going to start dating when you’re in college?

729
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:35,541
Why?

730
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:36,807
Well…

731
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:41,376
I told you I’m not going anywhere.

732
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:43,543
I’ll wait until your entrance exam result comes out.

733
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:50,760
Unless it’s the country’s number one medical school of the best university,

734
00:43:51,444 --> 00:43:52,343
you have to come with me.

735
00:43:53,475 --> 00:43:54,473
Hey, Chad.

736
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,616
Ready for school, Dr. Som?
