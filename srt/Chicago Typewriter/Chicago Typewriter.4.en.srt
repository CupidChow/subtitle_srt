00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:21,051
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:51,612
Who are you?

3
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:55,912
I asked. Who are you?

4
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:01,212
As you can see, I am...

5
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:03,882
Mr. Han Se Ju's ghost writer,

6
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:07,552
Yoo Jin Oh.

7
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:12,612
Hey.

8
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:14,552
Why are you smirking?

9
00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:18,082
I didn't think I'd get caught like this.

10
00:01:18,182 --> 00:01:20,082
I'm a little flustered at the moment.

11
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:22,282
You didn't think you'd get caught?

12
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:25,842
You're sitting at my desk in my office.

13
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:28,442
You were typing away on my typewriter.

14
00:01:28,682 --> 00:01:30,212
And you were hoping you wouldn't get caught?

15
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:32,242
You're right.

16
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,642
Hey, why do you keep smirking?

17
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,582
Are you hoping I wouldn't be able to spit on your face?

18
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:38,982
Do you think I can't?

19
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:40,742
Please don't.

20
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:44,742
I'd be very insulted.

21
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:46,782
More than me?

22
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,482
Are you insulted?

23
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:51,842
You caught me. I've been caught.

24
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:54,012
- You piece of... - Please.

25
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:55,712
Who sent you?

26
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,542
I'm asking who sent you, you rat!

27
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:02,182
- Why are you calling me? I'm hurt - Why are you calling me? I'm hurt

28
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:06,012
- Why are you calling me? I'm hurt - Why are you calling me? I'm hurt

29
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:10,112
- Open your arms and hold me close - Open your arms and hold me close

30
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:13,212
1, 2, 3. Let's go!

31
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:16,342
- In the midst of the blue waves - In the midst of the blue waves

32
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:18,882
- Loneliness drifts - Loneliness drifts

33
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:24,382
- Why did I come all the way here? - Why did I come all the way here?

34
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:30,642
- I know that even I cannot - I know that even I cannot

35
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:33,482
- Love myself anymore - Love myself anymore

36
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:34,642
Let's go!

37
00:02:34,642 --> 00:02:38,742
- Who's calling my name from behind? - Who's calling my name from behind?

38
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,582
Was it you? Who called my name?

39
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,382
Golden Touch?

40
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:46,542
Hello?

41
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:50,582
- No one has truly loved me - No one has truly loved me

42
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:51,842
What just happened?

43
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:53,342
Who did this?

44
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,042
Mr. Gal, you have a call.

45
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,542
Gosh, who is it? I was just starting to have some real fun.

46
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:01,642
I think it's Golden Touch, Mr. Han.

47
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:10,642
Hey, baby. What's up?

48
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:15,112
Gal Ji Seok. Meet me at my place right now.

49
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:21,582
Se Ju. I'm really sorry,

50
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:27,112
but I'm out with my employees for a team dinner,

51
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:29,482
so I can't come over right now.

52
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:36,842
You have 20 minutes. If you don't come, I won't renew my contract.

53
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:42,242
I think I just saw Usain Bolt.

54
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:44,382
He basically teleported there.

55
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:46,012
I thought he was a goblin.

56
00:03:57,242 --> 00:04:00,212
Are you tying me up right now?

57
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,812
Does it look like I'm tying my shoelaces?

58
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:04,712
Isn't it illegal to confine someone like this?

59
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,782
You trespassed, so you're in no position to say that.

60
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:08,512
You know who I am and who sent me.

61
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:10,512
I told you everything truthfully.

62
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:12,442
I...

63
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:16,942
don't trust what people say. In most cases, that is.

64
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,012
Then what will you do after you finish tying me up?

65
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:21,382
Will I be burned to death?

66
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:23,042
That is a good idea,

67
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:25,812
but we can think about it after this three-party meeting.

68
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:29,112
Don't we need one more person to make it a three-party meeting?

69
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:31,682
Se Ju! Han Se Ju!

70
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,212
Do not move.

71
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:38,842
How can I move?

72
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:40,612
You tied me up like a dead body.

73
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:42,512
Shall I stitch your mouth shut too?

74
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,442
Don't make me torn.

75
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,482
He's quite cute.

76
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:58,382
Se Ju, when did you change your passcode?

77
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,042
You should've told me.

78
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,342
The security company could've sent people.

79
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:07,252
Don't try so hard to put on a show.

80
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:09,712
I heard you gave my passcode to the ghost writer.

81
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:12,112
That means you already have my new passcode.

82
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,252
Why are you being like this, seriously?

83
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:17,282
I told you that we already decided not to hire a ghost writer.

84
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:19,482
Don't you dare lie to my face.

85
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,752
Follow me. The three of us need to sit down and talk.

86
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:23,382
Se Ju, I have legs too.

87
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:25,382
I know how to walk, okay?

88
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:28,412
Open your eyes wide and look. Can you still deny it?

89
00:05:34,382 --> 00:05:35,412
Look at what?

90
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:38,612
What?

91
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,312
What is this? Some kind of a magic show?

92
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,012
When am I supposed to applaud?

93
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:46,942
Oh, I guess someone will show up from here.

94
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:50,782
All right. I should act surprised.

95
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:57,712
You helped him run away, didn't you?

96
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:00,912
Who? I don't even know whom you're talking about.

97
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,982
He was right here.

98
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:04,612
Looking all triumphant,

99
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:08,042
that guy was audaciously typing away on my typewriter!

100
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:15,312
You took those pills again, didn't you? Have you seen Dr. Yang yet?

101
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,542
Are you trying to say that I'm crazy?

102
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:21,242
Tell me when and where he's supposed to show up.

103
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:23,382
I'll applaud when I see him.

104
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:26,242
He was right here.

105
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:29,742
He said himself that he's a ghost writer whom you hired.

106
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:32,912
He said that Gal Ji Seok of Golden Bear Publishing sent him.

107
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:34,642
You're seriously driving me crazy here.

108
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:36,242
Okay. Let's sort this out once and for all today.

109
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:39,082
I'll call Mr. Yoo now. That will solve everything, right?

110
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:41,242
Gosh, you think I'm lying to your face?

111
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,212
I almost cracked up.

112
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,212
Hey, Mr. Yoo. This is Gal Ji Seok...

113
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:47,182
- of Golden Bear... - Good day.

114
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:50,582
I'm in Italy, the country of pizza and spaghetti.

115
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:52,882
Please don't contact me for the next little while.

116
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,082
I told you to stop lying to me!

117
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,382
Mr. Yoo, did you disable roaming?

118
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:01,242
Pick up, Mr. Yoo. Chang Myung!

119
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:04,182
What did you just say?

120
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:06,282
What?

121
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:09,412
His name is Yoo Chang Myung?

122
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:12,612
Yes. The writer, Yoo Chang Myung.

123
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:13,982
You've heard of his name, right?

124
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:17,012
He debuted three years ago through an open competition,

125
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:18,782
but things didn't go well for him after that.

126
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:21,182
I heard that he ghostwrites biographies these days.

127
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,842
His name is not Yoo Jin Oh?

128
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,282
Who is Yoo Jin Oh?

129
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:26,882
I'm Mr. Han Se Ju's ghost writer,

130
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:31,782
Yoo Jin Oh.

131
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:37,112
Yoo Jin Oh...

132
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:42,182
(Yoo Jin Oh)

133
00:07:42,182 --> 00:07:43,212
Gosh.

134
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:49,482
What's the matter? What about Yoo Jin Oh?

135
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,612
That piece of...

136
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:54,912
What did you just say?

137
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:56,812
Se Ju, did you just swear at me?

138
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,842
You're being so ridiculous.

139
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:01,312
Don't be mean to me. I'm your business partner...

140
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:03,182
That scumbag!

141
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:09,742
My goodness.

142
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:13,212
What is wrong with him these days?

143
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,212
Goodness gracious.

144
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,782
Hello, Dr. Yang. This is Gal Ji Seok of Golden Bear.

145
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:23,042
I'm calling about Se Ju. When did he get his psychotherapy session?

146
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,512
Oh, I see. I was wondering.

147
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:31,012
He's been acting strange.

148
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:40,182
I didn't expect to get caught like that.

149
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:41,782
What should I do now?

150
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:46,712
Since this already happened, shall I...

151
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:50,242
fool around with him a bit more?

152
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:53,542
Who is he?

153
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:56,082
Who are you?

154
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,712
("Chicago Typewriter" Episode 11)

155
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:18,712
Who are you, really?

156
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:27,112
(Chicago Typewriter)

157
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:30,782
Tae Min, what are you talking about?

158
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:32,682
You said you finished it two days ago.

159
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:35,442
I chucked it.

160
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,742
I'm going to start again from scratch.

161
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:43,912
You were supposed to send it in today. How can you do this to me?

162
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,642
Why are you doing this? What is the problem?

163
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,482
I think it needs more soul.

164
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:52,442
What? Is it about a shaman or what? That's not what the story was about.

165
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,482
Thanks for being understanding.

166
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:57,352
I'll be away for a week to do research for the story.

167
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:59,942
Wait, Tae Min. Don't be like this. Just bring it to me.

168
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:03,312
Send it in, and we can talk about how we can revise it.

169
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:06,442
I apologize. It's my first novel in five years,

170
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:08,112
so I want it to be really good.

171
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,212
Gosh, this is crazy. Se Ju drove me insane yesterday,

172
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:13,612
and you're doing this today. Are you two ganging up against me or what?

173
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:17,412
Han Se Ju? Why? Did something happen?

174
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:20,912
What? Never mind. I don't even know what I just said.

175
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:23,382
What's the story about? About a shaman?

176
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:38,882
You should've waited 30 seconds.

177
00:10:38,882 --> 00:10:40,712
I'm right in front.

178
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:44,212
All right. I'll see you shortly.

179
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:55,512
Hey, it's me.

180
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:58,712
Hey, you came just in time.

181
00:10:58,712 --> 00:11:01,842
My husband would've gotten so mad at me if you were a minute late.

182
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,842
You should go. Have a lovely time on your wedding anniversary.

183
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:07,512
Okay. Thank you for your work.

184
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:10,912
Hey. Why don't you...

185
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:14,182
quit Do Anything and work with me?

186
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:15,682
You've said that before.

187
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,712
I'll make you the vice president.

188
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:19,882
- No, thanks. - Why?

189
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:23,642
Do the cows still cry? Will they not stop crying?

190
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,342
Aren't you late?

191
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:28,112
You said you're dead if you're late.

192
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:29,342
Well...

193
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:33,382
Put on a gown. People won't trust you without it.

194
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:04,082
Mong is breathing much better now as he's in the oxygen cage.

195
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,582
Cherry is suffering from gastroenteritis.

196
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,512
I will check your eyes, Cherry.

197
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,312
He needs ofloxacin too.

198
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:15,612
Okay. I'll prepare it.

199
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:23,942
What's wrong?

200
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:26,112
It's strange.

201
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:29,812
It felt like someone was gazing at me.

202
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:48,382
Hello.

203
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:50,282
Hello.

204
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:53,542
By the way, is Baek Seol sick again?

205
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:57,212
No. I'm going on a trip to collect some materials, so I'll be away.

206
00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:58,912
I came to leave him here.

207
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:00,282
By the way,

208
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:03,982
were you a vet?

209
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:07,882
What's that disapproving look?

210
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:12,682
I'm looking after my friend's clinic.

211
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:14,612
How long will you be going away for?

212
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:17,682
I'm not sure. I'm thinking about five days.

213
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,382
But I am not sure yet.

214
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,442
- Come in. - Okay.

215
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:34,612
- Yes. Good job. Good job. - Okay. Okay.

216
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:38,012
Do you want to go down and play?

217
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:41,682
Did you say she still vomits from time to time?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

218
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:44,912
Yes. She doesn't seem to have appetite, and she keeps sleeping.

219
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,642
She doesn't groom herself often.

220
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:49,712
She used to be friendly like a dog, but she's less friendly now.

221
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:54,012
- She might be depressed. - What?

222
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:58,512
It looks like you leave her here often even when she's not ill.

223
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:01,242
When you often leave a cat, the cat becomes anxious...

224
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:03,082
as it thinks it's abandoned.

225
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:05,782
I am sorry.

226
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,342
How much do you play with her every day?

227
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:10,782
I am busy...

228
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:14,212
and she hates me waking her up as she sleeps a lot.

229
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,182
Baek Seol is not a sleepyhead.

230
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:19,782
She sleeps more because you don't play with her.

231
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,342
You don't brush her hair either, do you?

232
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:23,382
I...

233
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,112
I'm a man, so...

234
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:28,942
It's not like she asked you to braid her hair or do an updo.

235
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:31,082
What does it have to do with your gender?

236
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:35,082
This is why she gave up on her looks and stopped grooming herself.

237
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:42,412
Why do I feel like I'm being scolded by a teacher?

238
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:49,412
I think you need to learn how to play.

239
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:52,982
This is a fishing rod. Look.

240
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:54,582
A fishing rod?

241
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:57,312
Move it like a flying bird. Move it up and down.

242
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,842
- Then... Right. - Like this? Like this?

243
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:03,812
Okay. Come on, Baek Seol.

244
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:05,912
Find the ball. Right.

245
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:08,012
You have to evoke her rat hunting instinct.

246
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:11,082
- Watch this. Right. - Like this?

247
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:14,742
You are good. Isn't it fun?

248
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:15,782
It is.

249
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:24,412
What time do you finish work today?

250
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:25,642
At 7 o'clock.

251
00:15:29,282 --> 00:15:30,282
Why?

252
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,042
Do you want to grab some beer with me?

253
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:36,912
What's this? It sounds like you're hitting on me.

254
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:39,312
I'm not hitting on you.

255
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,842
I want to thank you for helping me the other day for free...

256
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:43,612
and for looking after Baek Seol today.

257
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:46,612
Also, I have a favor to ask you.

258
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,482
What favor?

259
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,552
Darn it!

260
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:15,552
What is it? Where is it coming from?

261
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:17,742
Where on earth is it?

262
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,912
This is my father's cabin.

263
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:37,412
I was on the way to find the keepsake from my father...

264
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:38,912
which I lost while carrying you.

265
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:41,482
I'm taking a shovel because I'm worried it might've been buried.

266
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:46,942
Assistant?

267
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:50,642
Yes. I'm writing a new novel,

268
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:52,282
and I need someone to help me.

269
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:55,882
But why me?

270
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:57,642
I am not a writer.

271
00:17:58,012 --> 00:18:02,052
The person I need is not a writer but a vet.

272
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:05,482
Why do you need a vet when you write?

273
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:10,112
Do you want me to be Baek Seol's butler?

274
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:14,212
No. I need knowledge in veterinary medicine.

275
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:18,942
So you can be my advisor, supervisor, and assistant.

276
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:23,412
What do you think? I'll pay you well.

277
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:24,912
No.

278
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:27,052
I quit being a vet a long time ago.

279
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:29,552
I will recommend you someone good.

280
00:18:29,552 --> 00:18:30,912
I don't want anyone else.

281
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:33,642
I want you to do that.

282
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:37,412
No. It can't be me.

283
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:42,942
Why did you quit being a vet?

284
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:46,482
Is there a great story about it?

285
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:50,482
I'll tell you later when we become close.

286
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:54,782
Let's be close then, start now.

287
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:59,112
From the moment I saw you, I've been wanting to be close to you.

288
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,312
Excuse me. Get me another pint.

289
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:17,182
"Silence of the Lambs".

290
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:25,242
"Silence of the Lambs"?

291
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,812
For me, it's "Silence of the Cows".

292
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:33,942
"Silence of the Cows".

293
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:39,582
Do you remember the time...

294
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,442
when the foot-and-mouth disease was very serious several years ago?

295
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:44,312
But it happened many times.

296
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:49,552
Anyway, when that happened, they didn't have enough hands,

297
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:52,482
so vets and even students were mobilized to stop it.

298
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:54,742
Even you?

299
00:19:56,312 --> 00:20:00,412
I was in charge of euthanasia and collecting blood samples for tests.

300
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,012
Oh, dear.

301
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:05,812
The farmers...

302
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:10,312
fed the cows the most expensive feed and cried.

303
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:14,182
Beside them, I counted the number of syringes.

304
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,942
A very young calf...

305
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:21,842
licked my hand when I was there to kill him.

306
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:26,742
When I euthanized him,

307
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:30,812
he died in just three seconds because he was too young.

308
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:37,712
Ever since that, I can't forget about the cows' cries.

309
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:43,012
I became a vet to treat sick animals.

310
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:49,642
But I killed more animals than I saved.

311
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:53,712
So I ran away.

312
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:57,812
I ran away because the cows didn't stop crying.

313
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,612
That's my story.

314
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:04,782
We'd like to order some more beer.

315
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:09,482
Now that think of it,

316
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:14,582
whenever I aim to do something related to killing, I'm frustrated.

317
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,552
Maybe I was a butcher in my past life.

318
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:21,842
Or maybe I killed someone.

319
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,112
(Sungsoocheong)

320
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:27,682
Maybe I'm being punished from killing someone...

321
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:30,612
whom I shouldn't have killed.

322
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:19,842
Why are you here?

323
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:34,605
Why are you here?

324
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:39,505
What brings you here?

325
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:42,805
Are you here to see a fortuneteller?

326
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:44,875
I asked you first.

327
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:52,235
Who are you?

328
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:55,105
Why do you keep loitering around here?

329
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:05,935
I fell in love at first sight.

330
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:14,105
Do you want to die?

331
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,035
Not with you.

332
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,705
I'm talking about Jeon Seol.

333
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,405
What are you doing out here?

334
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,935
You're not supposed to leave laundries out. They'll get wet.

335
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:33,575
I was going to take them now.

336
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,475
I'll take care of it. You can go in.

337
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:40,235
- What's wrong? - Bang Jin.

338
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,005
- Ma Bang Jin. - Why?

339
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:47,005
I was on a roll with my writing just now.

340
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:49,405
Go to the kitchen and bring a bowl of red beans.

341
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:51,405
Why red beans?

342
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:54,135
I can sense something evil coming.

343
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:58,105
There are two,

344
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:02,075
but I'm not sure which one.

345
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,135
Which one is it?

346
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:14,535
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

347
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:16,805
What are you doing?

348
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,135
- Go get the red beans. - Goodness.

349
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:23,405
How and where...

350
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:26,535
did you get to know that girl?

351
00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:30,335
When I arrived in Korea from the US,

352
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:32,335
I fell in love at first sight at the airport.

353
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:36,935
"The US"?

354
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:40,805
"The US". That sounds good.

355
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,205
Stop lying all the time.

356
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:49,935
Are New Yorkers all old-fashioned like this these days?

357
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:56,575
Something is coming. We've got to run away.

358
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:59,375
Hey, where are you going?

359
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:03,505
- Go away! Go away! - My goodness!

360
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,175
It hurts!

361
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:08,035
- Go away! - Gosh, it hurts.

362
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:09,475
Mr. Han!

363
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:14,905
Han Se Ju?

364
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:20,605
Are you crazy?

365
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:25,075
Mr. Han. What brings you here?

366
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:27,975
Are you here to meet me?

367
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:33,605
That's ridiculous. I'm not here to meet you.

368
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:39,275
Mr. Han. Mr. Han.

369
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:42,675
Gosh. Go in.

370
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:46,235
- My goodness! - What have you done!

371
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:48,635
There's nothing evil.

372
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:55,035
What's wrong?

373
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:57,375
Do you really see something?

374
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,675
I can see it all over his face.

375
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:03,705
What do you mean?

376
00:26:04,805 --> 00:26:06,175
I can see he's handsome.

377
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,575
Goodness. Are you kidding me?

378
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:11,205
Go pick the red beans. They're domestic product.

379
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:20,875
People can stumble over it.

380
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:25,505
She might've lost the fortunetelling skill, but not her throwing skill.

381
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:29,375
What a technical movement it was.

382
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:35,205
Thank...

383
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,805
you.

384
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:54,875
My goodness.

385
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:06,705
He's so gentle.

386
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:08,935
And...

387
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:11,105
here is some more.

388
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:17,575
Hearts.

389
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:23,135
They're not hearts. They're red beans.

390
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:28,805
I see.

391
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:32,005
- Goodbye. - Excuse me.

392
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,805
What's your name?

393
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:40,305
I can't reveal my name for some reason.

394
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:46,075
You can just call me "Yoo".

395
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:14,705
Mr. Han.

396
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:17,875
Hold on a second, Mr. Han.

397
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:20,235
Mr. Han.

398
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:21,935
Do you know Yoo Jin Oh?

399
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:25,275
How do you know him? What did he say to you?

400
00:28:25,575 --> 00:28:26,575
Did he talk about me?

401
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,375
To which question should I answer first?

402
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,235
All of them. One by one. Sincerely.

403
00:28:32,035 --> 00:28:33,875
First, I don't know Yoo Jin Oh.

404
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,335
Therefore, I don't need to answer the rest.

405
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:39,205
Fine.

406
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:43,435
Is that why you came?

407
00:28:53,935 --> 00:28:55,035
What's this?

408
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,275
- How did you... - I found it on the street.

409
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:01,935
Are you happy now?

410
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:09,205
Goodness. Did you just act cold while being nice?

411
00:29:09,405 --> 00:29:12,605
Where did you learn such a line? From the internet?

412
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:15,075
Stop following me.

413
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:18,275
Did you go back to the cabin to find this?

414
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:21,535
Because of me? For me? You didn't want me to be sad?

415
00:29:21,605 --> 00:29:22,635
Hey.

416
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:25,675
You're totally misunderstanding.

417
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:28,805
I just went out on business...

418
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:33,375
and there was a thick fog. So I stopped the car.

419
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,375
Then I found something shiny.

420
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:37,805
Forget it.

421
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:43,275
You went out and went to the cabin because you were thinking of me.

422
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:47,475
Due to a thick fog, you stopped the car and found something shiny.

423
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:48,605
And it was this pocket watch.

424
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:51,205
What you said with the messy wording sounds about right...

425
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:54,935
except the part that goes, "I was thinking of you."

426
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:58,775
You don't have to exclude that part. It doesn't sound so wrong.

427
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,405
It sounds wrong.

428
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:02,805
It sounds so wrong because it's not true.

429
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,035
Let's go. I'll treat you to something delicious.

430
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:08,905
I want to thank you for finding my heart.

431
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:19,005
Will you really be okay with this?

432
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:22,275
What's wrong with this? I like this place.

433
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:24,505
Are you sure about that?

434
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:26,035
Why do you ask?

435
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:30,035
I did say that I don't want to go back to those days 10 years ago...

436
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:31,205
because it was like a nightmare.

437
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,035
Is it because of that?

438
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:36,075
Do you remember now?

439
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:38,175
Yes, the memories came back.

440
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:42,005
The part-timer who used to bring me hot chocolate.

441
00:30:42,535 --> 00:30:43,975
The crazy fan who used to take my photos.

442
00:30:45,775 --> 00:30:47,205
Don't call me like that.

443
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:50,975
What do you even know about me besides what I look like?

444
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:52,905
I might know some things about you.

445
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:55,575
Writers speak through their writings, you know.

446
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:57,405
I was a no-name writer back then.

447
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:02,335
Actually, I read it.

448
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:04,275
The manuscript.

449
00:31:25,775 --> 00:31:26,775
Are you closing now?

450
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:29,175
Oh, we'll be closing in 30 minutes.

451
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,575
You can take your time.

452
00:31:31,075 --> 00:31:33,105
Okay, thank you.

453
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:49,805
It sure is like "Misery". You're like that woman in "Misery".

454
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:53,175
Don't say that. I'm your first fan.

455
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:57,005
So? You think you got to know me through what you read?

456
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:59,075
Just from a piece of paper that was chucked away,

457
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:01,805
- you think you know me? - We had conversations too.

458
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:03,235
We had conversations?

459
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:04,975
I did?

460
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:06,475
With you?

461
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:10,105
This is for you.

462
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,105
I hope you had a great day.

463
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,035
Are you a writer?

464
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:24,105
At the moment, I'm just an aspiring writer.

465
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:26,235
Do you enjoy writing?

466
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:28,035
Does it look like I enjoy it?

467
00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:29,935
You do seem crazy about it.

468
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:32,505
Is that an insult or a compliment?

469
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:37,375
Why do you write as if your life depends on it?

470
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:42,105
"If I don't write to empty my mind,"

471
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:43,675
"I go mad."

472
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:44,975
- Lord Byron. - Lord Byron.

473
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:50,105
It looks like you read a lot.

474
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:54,535
Life can be tough, you know. Books are the only things that console me.

475
00:32:55,135 --> 00:32:59,235
This world can be ridiculous. I feel the same way with writing.

476
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:01,605
Has your life been tough?

477
00:33:03,035 --> 00:33:04,605
It still is.

478
00:33:06,405 --> 00:33:08,675
Did you decide to write a novel as a way of overcoming it?

479
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:12,145
For a desperate attempt, it looks pretty cool.

480
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:16,105
Compared to holding hands with someone who might betray me,

481
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:17,775
it's safer.

482
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:19,735
I can be as desperate as I want and not look pitiful.

483
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:21,935
It also allows me to escape the reality without drugs.

484
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:25,175
And if I'm lucky, it can be a lucrative career.

485
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,645
Is it worth all the work?

486
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,075
Well, I think so.

487
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:33,605
But I'd be happier if I could earn a living through it.

488
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:36,375
What kind of writer do you want to become?

489
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,575
A writer who's original.

490
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,675
A writer whom no one copies?

491
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,105
No.

492
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,145
A writer whom no one can copy.

493
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:47,605
- Chateaubriand. - Chateaubriand.

494
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:51,035
You're really good at making up stories.

495
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:54,575
I'm not making anything up. It actually happened.

496
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:57,645
I smiled? 10 years ago?

497
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:00,775
There's no way I smiled back then.

498
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:04,205
What happened to you back then?

499
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:06,975
I don't like to earn pity through telling my life stories.

500
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:13,175
So something did happen, and you do have some stories to tell.

501
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:16,005
Let's get going if you're done.

502
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,435
It was phenomenal.

503
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,775
The novel on the piece of paper you threw away.

504
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:26,775
It was better than any novel you've written so far.

505
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:30,775
I already knew it back then.

506
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,005
I thought, "He's going to become a very successful writer."

507
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:38,775
I've been rooting for you since then.

508
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:42,035
"I hope that desperate attempt turns into something solid."

509
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:45,005
"I hope he can soon make a living through writing alone."

510
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:48,805
And I prayed for you.

511
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:53,275
"I hope his tough life doesn't stall him."

512
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:56,675
I hoped that it'd just be a fleeting ordeal you had to go through...

513
00:34:56,675 --> 00:34:58,735
to be groomed into a phenomenal writer.

514
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:01,775
I hoped that all the suffering...

515
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:04,535
would just be a training process for you.

516
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:12,735
It's been 10 years, so I'd like to ask you this.

517
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,375
Are you now able to make a living through writing?

518
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:22,705
Of course. I've achieved much more than that.

519
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:25,605
I've bought a mansion, a deer,

520
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,205
and a car. I can buy whatever I want.

521
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,575
Then have you become a writer whom no one can copy?

522
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:36,435
As you can see, I'm Mr. Han Se Ju's...

523
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:39,605
ghost writer, Yoo Jin Oh.

524
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:49,035
I guess you don't think you've achieved it yet.

525
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:51,505
Let's go.

526
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:53,575
- Wait. - Come on.

527
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:56,605
What is the matter?

528
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:00,305
Are you mad at me?

529
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:03,705
Why are you mad?

530
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,005
If you write like this,

531
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:09,975
your readers will criticize you saying that you're overly emotional.

532
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:14,105
Gosh, you're so difficult.

533
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:18,205
Oh, it's the writer, Baek Tae Min.

534
00:36:18,735 --> 00:36:21,005
You're in it too!

535
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,205
When did you shoot this commercial?

536
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:29,105
Oh, my. Baek Tae Min looks much better in person.

537
00:36:31,805 --> 00:36:34,205
Have you even met him in person?

538
00:36:35,475 --> 00:36:37,205
I'm saying it because I've met him.

539
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:40,305
I actually had beer with him today.

540
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,775
He's a very nice guy.

541
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:46,175
Why did you meet him?

542
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,075
He comes to the veterinary clinic my friend runs.

543
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,075
He has a cat, so...

544
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,905
My first fan? My foot.

545
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:57,005
You like just about everyone.

546
00:36:57,605 --> 00:36:59,005
What did you just say?

547
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:02,105
Listen. When you claim that you're a fan, you have to be loyal.

548
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:03,705
You told me to stop being your fan.

549
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:06,775
I graciously accepted you back.

550
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:10,105
Forget it. I don't even want to be your fan anymore. I quit!

551
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,275
- What about me? - What?

552
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,205
You've seen me in person and on TV.

553
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:18,805
What's better?

554
00:37:19,645 --> 00:37:21,705
You obviously look so handsome in person as well as on TV.

555
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:23,205
I can't answer that!

556
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:34,275
You didn't have to overly compliment me like that.

557
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:36,935
With you, it's all or nothing.

558
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:47,075
- How fast can you run? - Why do you ask?

559
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:48,675
We have to run, or we'll get photos taken.

560
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,375
Run! Run as fast as you can!

561
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,145
Mr. Han, why are you standing there? Run! Mr. Han, let's run.

562
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:53,075
Who are you?

563
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:54,505
Pardon me?

564
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,335
Why do you keep showing up before me?

565
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:04,705
Today, it was you who wanted to...

566
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:10,805
Why do you keep appearing in my dreams,

567
00:39:12,305 --> 00:39:13,735
in my head,

568
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:19,035
and in my novels? Why?

569
00:39:52,035 --> 00:39:53,105
My gosh.

570
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:56,705
It looks like he reads a lot of web novels.

571
00:41:02,435 --> 00:41:05,375
I'm sorry. I'll stay here for a while.

572
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:08,235
I have nowhere else to go.

573
00:41:18,805 --> 00:41:21,275
Why do you to keep appearing in my dream,

574
00:41:22,705 --> 00:41:24,375
in my head,

575
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,975
and in my novel? Why?

576
00:41:34,905 --> 00:41:37,735
I am not in the position to tell you my name.

577
00:41:38,275 --> 00:41:41,235
Just call me "Yoo".

578
00:41:54,905 --> 00:41:56,105
It's going.

579
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:00,905
My head is turning too.

580
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:02,175
What happened?

581
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,505
The repairman said it was impossible to fix it.

582
00:42:12,105 --> 00:42:14,645
What's going on? What's up with it?

583
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:44,805
You girls.

584
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:47,575
What are you doing in front of food? You're chasing luck away.

585
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:49,305
You surprised me, Mom.

586
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:53,105
Check what time it is. You don't have time to waste.

587
00:42:53,105 --> 00:42:54,905
Aren't you going to the bookstore to work?

588
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,205
I got fired.

589
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:58,735
Good for you.

590
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:01,905
While trying to write when you can't, you always went in late.

591
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:03,875
Good job. You did a really good job.

592
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:07,675
I'm going to work in another place today.

593
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:09,535
- Bang Wool. - What?

594
00:43:09,635 --> 00:43:13,435
In the past, when I was young,

595
00:43:15,105 --> 00:43:19,605
my mom came to you because I kept saying strange things. Right?

596
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,435
She asked you if I'm going to be a shaman.

597
00:43:22,805 --> 00:43:25,635
Why do you bring that up in the morning?

598
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:28,305
What did I say at that time?

599
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:31,005
What was the strange thing I said?

600
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:37,335
I don't know. It was a long time ago. So I don't remember it.

601
00:43:41,775 --> 00:43:42,875
Why?

602
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,135
Can you see something again?

603
00:43:46,235 --> 00:43:47,235
What?

604
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:52,205
No.

605
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:59,305
- Hello? - Miss.

606
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:01,775
Why are you crying, Dae Han?

607
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:03,735
Is he crying?

608
00:44:05,675 --> 00:44:09,475
Did you really stay in an isolated cabin with Se Ju?

609
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:12,475
How did you know that?

610
00:44:12,805 --> 00:44:15,475
Is that true? I heard you quit being Se Ju's fan.

611
00:44:15,475 --> 00:44:17,405
I heard you're going to become a normal person again.

612
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,605
How can you become his lover?

613
00:44:20,905 --> 00:44:22,935
Why did it have to be Se Ju?

614
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:24,805
What are you talking about?

615
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:26,505
No way.

616
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:28,875
Isn't this you?

617
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:33,705
The bestseller writer Han Se Ju, who recently suffered from...

618
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:36,475
getting involved in the suicide case of a serial killer,

619
00:44:36,475 --> 00:44:40,775
was caught while being on a secret night date with a mysterious woman.

620
00:44:41,405 --> 00:44:44,775
The woman who turned out to be Mr. Han's woman used to...

621
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:49,275
be a vet, but she's now working for a chore agency.

622
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:52,505
What is interesting is that the woman who was at Mr. Han's...

623
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:56,175
when the stalker broke into his place is the same woman...

624
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:59,535
who was next to him when Mr. Han got into a car accident.

625
00:44:59,605 --> 00:45:01,305
They're both women with initial J.

626
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:09,935
Reporter Son is such a jerk. This is unbelievable.

627
00:45:10,305 --> 00:45:11,605
I'll go out for a while.

628
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:15,005
Some people gave an interesting speculation that...

629
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:19,335
Ms. J is not Mr. Han's lover but his secret ghost writer.

630
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:27,475
The picture isn't so great.

631
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:31,405
It looks like a mediocre picture taken by a paparazzi.

632
00:45:31,405 --> 00:45:35,575
We can make her look like his lover, but not his ghost writer.

633
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:43,405
It's just the first step. You're being too impatient.

634
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:45,175
Here's your seolleongtang.

635
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:47,005
It's hot. Be careful.

636
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:49,675
Can't we get a picture of them together in the writing room?

637
00:45:50,105 --> 00:45:52,875
That means I have to install a candid camera inside his room.

638
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:04,505
That house has a very high security level.

639
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:07,275
Why don't we make her work for us?

640
00:46:08,205 --> 00:46:10,205
You need a follow-up article, don't you think?

641
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:12,805
You need to hear her opinion.

642
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:18,035
And she'll reveal everything through that article.

643
00:46:18,035 --> 00:46:22,905
If it's too difficult, you can get her as our secret agent.

644
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:26,335
I'll give it a try.

645
00:46:26,805 --> 00:46:29,135
Nobody hates money.

646
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:31,775
I'll pay you a generous amount for your work.

647
00:46:49,205 --> 00:46:51,235
I've been through this so many times.

648
00:46:52,305 --> 00:46:55,375
Scandals, plagiarism disputes and ghost writer speculations.

649
00:46:55,535 --> 00:46:58,805
Those rumors have been following me since the debut.

650
00:46:58,805 --> 00:47:01,675
I should be okay, and I don't have to be fooled.

651
00:47:02,505 --> 00:47:06,305
That's it. That's Han Se Ju.

652
00:47:06,305 --> 00:47:08,635
You know that this is the time to fight back with your writing, right?

653
00:47:08,635 --> 00:47:12,675
If you stop publishing the series or your writing becomes boring,

654
00:47:12,675 --> 00:47:15,635
people will think that you get affected...

655
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:17,875
and that the article is true.

656
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:20,735
So many people will enjoy gossiping about this.

657
00:47:20,935 --> 00:47:23,305
I won't go easy on that jerk reporter this time.

658
00:47:23,305 --> 00:47:26,035
So don't worry about a thing and just focus on your writing.

659
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:28,635
You want me to submit the script on time and write what makes money.

660
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:30,005
What's up with all the editorials?

661
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:32,005
I'm hanging up. I have to write.

662
00:47:34,775 --> 00:47:36,505
Bring in Attorney Min.

663
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:40,805
Look into that Jeon Seol.

664
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:42,935
Get me her number and address.

665
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:03,035
(Su Hyeon looked at Hui Young and said this.)

666
00:48:12,905 --> 00:48:15,305
(Hui Young's heart pounded...)

667
00:48:16,405 --> 00:48:17,405
(while looking at Su Hyeon.)

668
00:48:37,805 --> 00:48:39,535
If I work with that,

669
00:48:40,205 --> 00:48:41,775
will I be able to write too?

670
00:49:45,205 --> 00:49:46,275
Gosh!

671
00:50:40,235 --> 00:50:42,175
Do you enjoy writing?

672
00:50:43,275 --> 00:50:44,305
No.

673
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,475
What kind of writer do you want to become?

674
00:50:51,475 --> 00:50:53,805
What kind of writer do you want to become?

675
00:50:55,775 --> 00:50:57,735
A writer who doesn't get creative blocks.

676
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:22,905
What do you think you're doing right now?

677
00:51:27,515 --> 00:51:29,385
What do you think you're doing right now?

678
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:38,295
Am I caught again?

679
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:41,065
"Am I caught again?"

680
00:51:42,095 --> 00:51:43,365
You rat!

681
00:51:43,595 --> 00:51:45,365
Mr. Han, wait. Mr. Han.

682
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,695
Please. What are you going to do to me?

683
00:51:47,865 --> 00:51:49,735
You look as if you're about to rip my clothes off.

684
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:51,965
Answer me. I asked you what you're doing here!

685
00:51:52,095 --> 00:51:54,665
It looked like you were unhappy with the manuscript I wrote.

686
00:51:54,665 --> 00:51:57,865
I saw that you ripped it to pieces, so I was trying to rewrite it.

687
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,635
Who told you to do that? I never gave you permission!

688
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:03,465
I told myself! Well, I mean...

689
00:52:03,795 --> 00:52:07,395
my heart told me to do it because I wanted to help you.

690
00:52:09,665 --> 00:52:10,695
Get back here.

691
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:13,135
Can we just talk it out?

692
00:52:13,265 --> 00:52:16,435
Get back here and let me grab you by the collar before I get angrier.

693
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:19,495
Being grabbed like that is insulting. More importantly,

694
00:52:19,535 --> 00:52:23,465
I won't be able to answer you well as it'll impede breathing.

695
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,965
Is that so? All right, then.

696
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,395
Come have a seat. I said, sit down.

697
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:39,235
The first question. How did you get in here?

698
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:43,095
I sneaked in when you were getting home last night.

699
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,635
Last night?

700
00:52:44,865 --> 00:52:49,065
Yes. You seemed to be deep in thought. You didn't even notice.

701
00:52:49,765 --> 00:52:51,995
Are you saying you slept here overnight?

702
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,095
Well, that's...

703
00:52:55,865 --> 00:52:57,595
I have nowhere to go.

704
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:07,135
I want to kill you now, but I'll do my best to suppress the urge.

705
00:53:08,335 --> 00:53:10,035
Then how did you get in the first day?

706
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:12,795
Well, that's...

707
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:16,835
To tell you the truth, I used to be involved in the dark world.

708
00:53:16,835 --> 00:53:19,265
Picking a door lock is a piece of cake for me...

709
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:22,665
I can kill you this second, but I'll suppress the urge once again.

710
00:53:24,065 --> 00:53:25,395
Who sent you?

711
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:27,335
Mr. Gal Ji Seok...

712
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:30,135
I already know that is not true. Who sent you?

713
00:53:34,265 --> 00:53:37,265
It's my doing. I sent myself...

714
00:53:37,935 --> 00:53:39,435
to you.

715
00:53:40,195 --> 00:53:42,035
Is that right?

716
00:53:49,395 --> 00:53:51,365
Gosh, please calm down! If you hit me with it,

717
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:54,235
I won't be able to answer your question because I'll pass out.

718
00:54:00,295 --> 00:54:02,095
- What do you want? - Pardon me?

719
00:54:02,095 --> 00:54:05,665
I'm sure you're doing this to me for a reason and a goal!

720
00:54:06,495 --> 00:54:08,765
A goal...

721
00:54:10,035 --> 00:54:11,335
Do I have to have one?

722
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:14,865
- You little... - Gosh! I'll come up with something.

723
00:54:14,865 --> 00:54:16,495
My goal is...

724
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:24,835
I want to be your friend. Also, I'd like to live here with you.

725
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:29,735
Get out.

726
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:33,265
Like I told you a few minutes ago, I have nowhere to go.

727
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,795
You're not going to leave?

728
00:54:36,865 --> 00:54:38,095
I'll call the police, then.

729
00:54:38,635 --> 00:54:40,595
That will cause trouble.

730
00:54:40,595 --> 00:54:43,195
Bingo. I'm calling the police to get you into trouble.

731
00:54:44,095 --> 00:54:46,465
Wouldn't you be in trouble too?

732
00:54:49,335 --> 00:54:51,135
- What? - If the police come,

733
00:54:51,235 --> 00:54:53,865
they'll ask what I was doing here. Then I'll have no choice...

734
00:54:53,865 --> 00:54:57,465
but to tell them that I was writing your manuscript in your place.

735
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:01,565
Are you threatening me right now?

736
00:55:02,095 --> 00:55:04,865
Did it sound like a threat? I was just stating the fact...

737
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:05,865
Get out.

738
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:11,595
I don't need any of this. Take all of it and get out.

739
00:55:11,635 --> 00:55:12,735
Get lost, you punk.

740
00:55:12,735 --> 00:55:15,095
Get out of my sight immediately, you rat!

741
00:55:20,095 --> 00:55:22,665
Shouldn't you decide quickly whether to open the door or not?

742
00:55:22,735 --> 00:55:24,465
If it's Mr. Gal or Ms. Kang,

743
00:55:24,465 --> 00:55:27,135
- they might let themselves in. - Shut your mouth.

744
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:35,235
Stay right here. If you do anything reckless, you'll die in my hands.

745
00:55:52,035 --> 00:55:54,095
What brings you here?

746
00:55:54,795 --> 00:55:56,395
I want to talk to you about something.

747
00:55:58,495 --> 00:56:00,295
Just a moment, please. I'll be right out.

748
00:56:00,295 --> 00:56:03,935
I don't think you'd want people to hear it. Let's talk inside.

749
00:56:04,495 --> 00:56:06,165
No, we'll talk outside...

750
00:56:06,995 --> 00:56:10,165
It looks like some reporters are on stakeout here. Will you be okay?

751
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:19,865
Until when are you going to make me wait here?

752
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:37,295
How have you been?

753
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:39,935
Good.

754
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:41,565
What is it about?

755
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:46,265
Are you going to make me stand here and talk?

756
00:56:48,595 --> 00:56:49,735
Come in.

757
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:06,195
It's a huge mansion. Do you live here alone without a steward?

758
00:57:08,765 --> 00:57:12,635
I'm extra sensitive these days, so I gave my staff some time off.

759
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:15,435
Are you stressed out?

760
00:57:16,835 --> 00:57:19,235
I heard you're working on a pretty big project.

761
00:57:19,865 --> 00:57:21,235
What do you want to talk to me about?

762
00:57:22,865 --> 00:57:26,395
It sounds like you want me gone quickly.

763
00:57:26,635 --> 00:57:30,135
You probably had to sneak out to come here because of your wife.

764
00:57:32,465 --> 00:57:35,295
I guess you still deeply resent her.

765
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,595
It sounds like there's some misunderstanding.

766
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:42,865
I do not resent Ms. Hong.

767
00:57:43,735 --> 00:57:46,765
I can understand her if I work at it.

768
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,535
What woman would want to raise a child...

769
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:54,595
who doesn't even share a drop of blood with her?

770
00:57:55,235 --> 00:57:59,395
A child to whom her husband's first love gave birth.

771
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:03,335
She was full of suspicion and hated me,

772
00:58:04,295 --> 00:58:06,135
but I think she had more than enough reason.

773
00:58:07,865 --> 00:58:09,035
Right.

774
00:58:10,565 --> 00:58:13,865
Thanks for being understanding.

775
00:58:15,335 --> 00:58:17,295
The person I resent...

776
00:58:20,435 --> 00:58:21,765
is you.

777
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:35,265
("Fate")

778
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,835

("Fate", First draft)

783
00:59:17,135 --> 00:59:19,195
The person whom I trusted the most...

784
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:23,095
The man whom I thought of like my own father...

785
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:27,265
stabbed me in the back.

786
00:59:44,935 --> 00:59:47,235
Are you not even going to offer me a cup of tea?

What are you doing there?

790
01:01:38,063 --> 01:01:41,093
You know how every writer feels about his writing room.

791
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:44,333
How can you just walk in here without my permission?

792
01:01:44,763 --> 01:01:48,033
I see that you have something writers should not have.

793
01:01:51,633 --> 01:01:54,733
Wouldn't it be wise to get rid of things that could become problems?

794
01:01:57,893 --> 01:02:00,833
I'm just going to think that I didn't see it. Put this away.

795
01:02:04,463 --> 01:02:07,963
I came to see you as I was worried you might be upset over the article.

796
01:02:08,263 --> 01:02:12,233
But it looks like visiting you was a mistake.

797
01:02:54,033 --> 01:02:55,363
What do you want from me?

798
01:02:55,763 --> 01:02:57,963
Why did you show up in my life like this?

799
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:01,133
Please calm down, Mr. Han.

800
01:03:01,493 --> 01:03:04,733
Are you doing this to ruin my life? Is that it?

801
01:03:05,393 --> 01:03:07,933
If that's what you're thinking, don't even dream. It won't happen.

802
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:12,033
I won't be broken easily.

803
01:03:13,693 --> 01:03:16,263
Do you even know what I've been through to get here?

804
01:03:16,763 --> 01:03:18,863
I will not fall because of a punk like you!

805
01:03:33,493 --> 01:03:35,163
By any chance,

806
01:03:37,633 --> 01:03:39,333
did you use to be a ghost writer yourself too?

807
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:45,233
Did you write Baek Tae Min's "Fate" for him?

808
01:03:47,563 --> 01:03:49,493
Were you his ghost writer?

809
01:04:00,193 --> 01:04:01,293
Get out.

810
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:15,263
I...

811
01:04:16,763 --> 01:04:19,363
I'd much rather let someone steal my writing...

812
01:04:20,633 --> 01:04:22,333
than taking credit for someone else's work.

813
01:04:42,163 --> 01:04:43,533
("Chicago Typewriter")

814
01:04:49,633 --> 01:04:51,563
("Chicago Typewriter")

815
01:05:57,933 --> 01:06:00,663
(Chicago Typewriter)

816
01:06:01,033 --> 01:06:04,093
I must've been the biggest traitor to my country in my past life.

817
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:07,333
The person whom I never wanted to forget about even after death...

818
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,433
Seol! Did you want to do things like this?

819
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:12,433
You have no clue. Every fan would die for this.

820
01:06:12,433 --> 01:06:14,733
"Did you see? He and I are this close."

821
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:16,233
- I'm sorry. - "I love you"?

822
01:06:16,233 --> 01:06:17,863
The next episode hasn't been published yet.

823
01:06:17,863 --> 01:06:19,633
Was my manuscript not helpful?

824
01:06:19,633 --> 01:06:22,563
I decided to come here to put an end to the rumor that I have...

825
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:23,693
a ghost writer.

826
01:06:23,668 --> 01:06:25,038
Thank you for everything.

827
01:06:25,063 --> 01:06:26,533
I don't need you anymore.

828
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:27,863
Keep writing.

829
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:29,633
Only then, I'll live.
