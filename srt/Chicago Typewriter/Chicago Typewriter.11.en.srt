1
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:22,614
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,844
Shoot. It's an order.

3
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:01,114
Seol.

4
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:05,754
What's wrong?

5
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:07,514
What happened?

6
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:11,415
Just remember this, Seol.

7
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:15,775
You must not let any of the ill-fated relationships repeat.

8
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:33,675
I asked who you are.

9
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:41,545
I'm sorry that you don't remember me.

10
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:45,745
I had a lot of things I wanted to ask you.

11
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,015
Do you know me?

12
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:55,415
First, should we do something about that?

13
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:56,615
("Fate")

14
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,415
It's not polite to run away.

15
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,615
The owner of this house should know what you tried to steal.

16
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:36,845
What's wrong?

17
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,675
What happened?

18
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,345
I'm just so touched...

19
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:54,875
that you ran straight here for me.

20
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,875
I spent all my youth fan-girling.

21
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,215
I'm so happy that it wasn't a waste.

22
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:07,345
Fine, thank you so much for your support.

23
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:10,015
I'll work even harder from now on. Are you happy now?

24
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,215
So why are you crying?

25
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:19,915
Did you see something again?

26
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:27,875
Did you see the face of the person you killed?

27
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:39,045
No.

28
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:45,545
Then why are you crying? What are you so scared of?

29
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:51,145
You give me a hug every time I cry.

30
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,675
You want a hug?

31
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,875
Yes. That'd be nice.

32
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,075
You're so shameless.

33
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:09,215
Didn't I cry enough?

34
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:34,015
(Chicago Typewriter)

35
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,345
Have you been starving for days?

36
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:45,445
You must have been a farmhand,

37
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,385
not an activist in your previous life.

38
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:52,645
Anyway, I'm relieved you look okay.

39
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,345
The serial novel you're working on,

40
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,245
how does it end?

41
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:04,075
I can't tell you. You might be my fan,

42
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:05,415
but I can't tell you ahead.

43
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:06,915
That's petty.

44
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,975
It's about my previous life too. I'm a part of it.

45
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,115
The thing is,

46
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,275
I also don't know it yet.

47
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,545
You're such an irresponsible writer.

48
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:20,775
You started it without knowing what you're going to do with it?

49
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:24,175
So how does it end?

50
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:27,975
After starting as a fiction, does it end as a non-fiction?

51
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,945
No. It'll still be closer to a fiction.

52
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:33,215
I'm getting help from a third party.

53
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:35,045
A third party?

54
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:38,645
Do you...

55
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:41,115
believe in supernatural creatures?

56
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,275
Ghosts, to be specific.

57
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:49,875
Have you joined a religious cult or something?

58
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:52,875
You don't have to believe me.

59
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:55,875
I'll tell you everything when the time is right.

60
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:01,715
By the way, does the novel...

61
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:03,945
have to be finished?

62
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,275
I guess it has to.

63
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,015
It probably has to.

64
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,215
I think so too.

65
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:17,675
Do you not want it to be done?

66
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:22,275
Well, I mean...

67
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:24,475
if it has a sad ending,

68
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,145
I'll be sad.

69
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:30,215
I'm also scared it'll turn into just another one of those bad novels.

70
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:32,115
What do you mean?

71
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:35,245
You know, those cheesy, bad novels.

72
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:39,415
But you still have to finish it, right?

73
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:41,575
Otherwise, you'll be penalized.

74
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:44,915
Well, it's not just that.

75
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,875
I promised someone I'd finish it no matter what.

76
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:50,575
Who?

77
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:51,745
The third party.

78
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:56,575
Gosh, I'm almost getting jealous of that person.

79
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,815
Is his name the third party?

80
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,045
I'll let you know eventually.

81
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,175
Are you sure you're okay?

82
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:15,415
Of course.

83
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:18,115
I feel so replenished, thanks to you.

84
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,775
By the way,

85
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:26,375
can't I meet the third-party guy in person?

86
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:29,775
I don't know.

87
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:32,175
It's not easy to see him.

88
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,915
Why?

89
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:39,015
Well, I want to be let in on how the novel ends.

90
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:43,015
But...

91
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:46,175
why do you want to know how it ends so badly?

92
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,345
You'll find out eventually.

93
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:53,475
I'm not sure...

94
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:56,275
I'll be able to wait until then.

95
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:58,875
Don't be so dramatic.

96
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:02,245
Gosh, it doesn't work on you.

97
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:04,915
I'll be late for work.

98
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:07,675
Thank you for today, Brother.

99
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,415
I'll get going.

100
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:11,815
Wait.

101
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:22,145
What was that?

102
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:25,375
Did I just try to stop her?

103
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:28,415
And she pushed me away?

104
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:31,115
Gosh, is she playing hard to get?

105
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:38,645
Hey, where did you go so early in the morning?

106
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:42,215
I thought you went to live with your mom, so I was...

107
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,915
Hey, what's wrong? Did something happen?

108
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,275
Did you drink?

109
00:08:58,145 --> 00:09:00,845
He couldn't see me at first.

110
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,145
But he started to see me at some point.

111
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:05,845
How did he start to see me?

112
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,145
What made him see me?

113
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:20,575
Wait, why am I back here?

114
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:22,615
Was it a dream?

115
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,775
Am I still drunk?

116
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:37,445
You're still here.

117
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:39,075
Yes.

118
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:41,875
I'm about to leave.

119
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,245
I'm sorry for yesterday.

120
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:46,775
I apologize.

121
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,375
Hold on.

122
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:51,415
Follow me.

123
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,715
("Fate")

124
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:17,175
("Fate")

125
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:21,245
I told you I'd give it to you.

126
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:27,415
Are you really giving it to me?

127
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:30,515
I don't need it anymore.

128
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:33,175
I wasn't going to reveal it anyway.

129
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:37,115
I held on to it because it reminds me of what I failed to protect...

130
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:39,775
and keeps me working hard.

131
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,415
- Then... - Why did I change my mind?

132
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:47,845
I'm going to stop using anger to motivate myself.

133
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:51,145
I'll protect people and things that matter to me.

134
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:54,115
I won't be blinded by the past...

135
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,575
because that's stupid.

136
00:10:57,175 --> 00:11:00,475
I don't care about what you're going to do with it.

137
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:08,515
Thank you.

138
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:12,245
If you...

139
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:16,745
also want to break free from your past,

140
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:19,215
don't give up too easily.

141
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:21,845
Your life is not over yet.

142
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,975
Rumors don't last longer than a year.

143
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:28,715
It's not that easy to hit rock bottom.

144
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:47,175
Are you letting him get away like this?

145
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:50,975
What can I do? Should I tie him up and burn him at the stake?

146
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,375
Is it really okay to forgive him so easily?

147
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:55,845
I'm not forgiving him.

148
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,745
I'm just giving him another chance.

149
00:11:58,845 --> 00:11:59,845
Some people...

150
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:03,215
don't deserve another chance.

151
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:05,415
I'm sure he will...

152
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,375
betray you again.

153
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:08,845
What makes you think so?

154
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:10,615
He did so in the past.

155
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,675
He doesn't seem very different in this life too.

156
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:18,675
What did Tae Min do in his previous life?

157
00:12:20,215 --> 00:12:21,875
You said you don't remember everything.

158
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:26,815
I remember...

159
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:29,215
one thing very clearly.

160
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:44,545
Go, Anastasia!

161
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:49,075
Hey! Stop singing! Get over here and pour me some drinks.

162
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:04,645
Hey, didn't you hear me?

163
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:07,815
Come and drink with me.

164
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:12,675
I'm in the middle of a performance here, sir.

165
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:16,215
You're spoiling the fun for everyone. Please let go of me.

166
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:20,515
You're acting awfully expensive for a waitress.

167
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,815
I am not a waitress.

168
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:25,345
I am a singer, sir.

169
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:27,545
Whether you are a singer or waitress,

170
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:29,775
you are just a girl who sells drinks.

171
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:31,345
How dare you try to appear noble?

172
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:34,915
If you came to drink,

173
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:38,145
just go drink, jerk.

174
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:41,845
What?

175
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:43,815
How dare you treat me rudely?

176
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:46,875
Hey, what's going on?

177
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:55,175
Do you want to be shot in the head?

178
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:58,415
You're asking for trouble, you wench.

179
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:02,445
It looks like you're very drunk.

180
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:04,475
Why don't you just stop?

181
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,875
Hey, who are you? Let go of me!

182
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,075
Let go! Let go of me!

183
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,675
Who do you think you are?

184
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:23,645
- Hey! - Goodness.

185
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,215
Cheers.

186
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,015
Thank you for what you did.

187
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:43,145
I should help my fellow countrymen.

188
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:45,815
You don't need to thank me.

189
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:47,275
Let's introduce each other.

190
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:49,715
I am the owner of Carpe Diem, Shin Yul.

191
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:51,915
You've managed to become very successful at an early age.

192
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,375
I am Heo Young Min.

193
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,815
I am Seo Hui Young.

194
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:00,675
Excuse me, Mr. Heo. What do you do?

195
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:04,845
I write. Poems and others.

196
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:08,315
I can't make a living out of writing yet,

197
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,675
but fortunately, my family is not desperate. So I'm holding out.

198
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,875
We write insignificant writings and call ourselves writers too.

199
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,315
I've heard about you, Hui Young.

200
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:25,345
You were quite popular during the secondary school.

201
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:31,545
That was all in the past.

202
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:35,045
I just write different sorts of articles for a newspaper now.

203
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:39,845
By the way, are you a member of any literary society?

204
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:45,575
I'm not at that level yet.

205
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:49,845
It's already quite late.

206
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:53,315
I'm sorry, but I should be heading back.

207
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:56,045
I will treat you when you come back next time.

208
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:57,275
Please come back.

209
00:15:57,275 --> 00:15:59,175
Okay. I'll look forward to it.

210
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,015
You don't have to see me out.

211
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:12,945
Thank you for your help.

212
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,075
You're welcome.

213
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,645
Bye.

214
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:24,415
Are you all right,

215
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:26,915
gentlemen?

216
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:28,745
- Gentlemen? - Gentlemen?

217
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:30,975
Goodness.

218
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:41,345
Gosh,

219
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:44,445
look at yourselves. You're well beaten up.

220
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,115
How can you get beaten so badly by the drunkards?

221
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:49,345
Rub your eyes with these.

222
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:55,445
How can you be worse than the drunk customer?

223
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:57,075
You are good for nothing.

224
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:58,945
Stop it already.

225
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:02,375
Looking at the way she talks sarcastically,

226
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,645
I can tell that it'll go on for at least 10 days.

227
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,415
Why don't you come out now?

228
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:33,645
You said that person hid inside Carpe Diem, right?

229
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:34,775
Yes, sir.

230
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:37,075
There's something going on there.

231
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:40,115
The business is doing well,

232
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:43,015
but the reported sales are too low.

233
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,075
Where did...

234
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:48,475
all the money go?

235
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:51,515
I heard the owner is a big spender.

236
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:55,945
I'm sure they are related to the firelock man.

237
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,145
Should we search them tomorrow?

238
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,315
No. No.

239
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:05,945
We threw the bait. We should wait.

240
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:09,015
I want to catch a big fish.

241
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,275
In order to break up an organization,

242
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:16,145
you should hit the head, not the tail.

243
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:22,345
Was Tae Min really a secret agent of the Japanese Empire?

244
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:26,445
It suits him perfectly.

245
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,875
I almost feel sorry that it suits him so well.

246
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:31,875
I know.

247
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,545
That's why Heo Tae Min...

248
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:36,575
I mean,

249
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:41,045
Heo Young Min killed you. Is that it?

250
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:45,145
I don't know. I don't remember what happened after that.

251
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:48,045
Anyway, I'm certain that he's a dangerous man.

252
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,615
If we leave him like that, he will become more dangerous.

253
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:52,715
Stop talking like an old man.

254
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,945
Anyway, it happened in the past, which I don't even remember.

255
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:59,275
Tae Min I know is just Tae Min.

256
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:02,915
Are you going to just leave him alone when he stole your work?

257
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:05,945
What can he do with it anyway?

258
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,345
There are only two choices he can make.

259
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,685
He can either burn it...

260
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:12,345
or clear his conscience.

261
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:14,685
Let him do whatever he wishes.

262
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:19,245
I want to get away from the past now.

263
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,815
The past that left vestiges...

264
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,115
can't be overcome.

265
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,145
Why would you take it that far?

266
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:31,615
Unsettled pasts get corrupted,

267
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:34,145
and uncorrected faults get repeated.

268
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:40,415
I've seen someone take another person's work...

269
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,115
and still blame the person who got his work stolen.

270
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,575
I still hold a bitter grudge against him.

271
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:04,645
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,215
("Fate")

273
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:49,185
I'm sorry.

274
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:55,245
Se Ju.

275
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:57,375
How dare you.

276
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,075
How dare you play with me?

277
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:13,875
Hello?

278
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:15,945
Why didn't you call me?

279
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:19,685
Isn't it normal to show reaction when you are threatened?

280
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:22,185
I can't wait too long.

281
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:28,685
Okay. All right.

282
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:38,685
This is Baek Tae Min.

283
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:42,115
I will send you a number.

284
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:45,075
Please find out whose number it is.

285
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,415
What happened to her to make her sleep for hours?

286
00:21:56,175 --> 00:21:58,045
Shouldn't we take her to a doctor?

287
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,215
That woman did this to her.

288
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:05,245
What are you talking about?

289
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:06,545
What did Seol's mother do?

290
00:22:06,845 --> 00:22:07,875
You don't need to know.

291
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:10,575
Don't force her to wake up. Let her sleep.

292
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:13,945
I made porridge for her. Feed her when she wakes up.

293
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,115
What is it? What happened?

294
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:19,545
Why do you have so many secrets?

295
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:27,475
Remember. A fighter can't fall in love.

296
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:29,345
As long as you have a gun in your hand,

297
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,815
you can never be in a relationship.

298
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:35,015
Why not? It has a direct connection with your life.

299
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:09,675
Gosh, dear spirits... I thought you were the Grim Reaper, you wench.

300
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:12,145
A little while ago,

301
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:15,545
you asked me if I've ever carried a cremation urn.

302
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:18,975
Why are you asking me such a random question?

303
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:23,145
What did you sense from me that day? You must've said it for a reason.

304
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:25,475
I'm not sure.

305
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:29,945
How should I describe it? Tenacity?

306
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,375
Or was it more like deep-seated resentment or sorrow?

307
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:36,775
Anyway, I think I sensed a resentful spirit with many regrets.

308
00:23:38,645 --> 00:23:41,045
Why are you asking me about it out of the blue?

309
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:48,615
- I need you to do a face reading. - What are you doing right now?

310
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:50,675
Please have a look at this face, and tell me what you think.

311
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:55,815
Han Se Ju?

312
00:23:56,815 --> 00:24:00,075
I've done a reading for him in the past.

313
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:02,615
When?

314
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:05,545
Your energy is very unstable.

315
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:09,715
You're surrounded by all sorts of dark energy.

316
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:11,845
A scandal might break out as well.

317
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:15,115
Death will knock on your door often.

318
00:24:16,145 --> 00:24:19,745
You'll meet someone every time, but you can't tell good from bad.

319
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:24,345
You might have two special encounters soon.

320
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:28,215
Be good. Only then, you'll live.

321
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:32,745
Death knocks on his door often?

322
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:37,645
I don't even know. I just said the words that popped up on my mind.

323
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:42,015
A little while after that, I heard he actually got into a car accident.

324
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:43,975
That spooked me out.

325
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:49,015
I think that was around the time when you went to the mountain cabin.

326
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:52,345
Anyway, his face tells me that he probably lost his parents young.

327
00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:54,375
He's fated to live a lonely, hard life like a small boat...

328
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,645
floating all alone in the sea.

329
00:24:57,345 --> 00:25:00,845
Men with such fate must carefully choose the women they end up with.

330
00:25:01,315 --> 00:25:03,375
The right woman will strengthen his weak life energy.

331
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:06,945
By any chance, will I bring more danger to his life...

332
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:08,575
if I stay by his side?

333
00:25:09,515 --> 00:25:11,245
What do you mean?

334
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:13,975
Were you asking me for a compatibility reading?

335
00:25:15,245 --> 00:25:16,345
Tell me.

336
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,415
Are we ill-fated?

337
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:21,445
Am I bad or good for him?

338
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:22,715
Why are you suddenly...

339
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,845
Your mom must've said weird stuff to you again, right?

340
00:25:29,115 --> 00:25:32,075
Ms. Ma. You know where my mom is, don't you?

341
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,715
What on earth have you heard? Why are you being like this?

342
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:38,775
Stop asking me questions, and please give me Mom's address.

343
00:25:58,615 --> 00:25:59,775
Excuse me.

344
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:02,875
We're not open yet.

345
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:06,975
I'm actually looking for someone.

346
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:09,775
Her name is Lim So Yeon. I heard she works in the kitchen here.

347
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:12,615
She quit yesterday.

348
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:19,015
Do you know where she went by any chance?

349
00:26:20,415 --> 00:26:23,375
I have no idea. She rarely talked.

350
00:26:27,315 --> 00:26:30,745
Men with such fate must carefully choose the women they end up with.

351
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,415
Us meeting each other was not a coincidence.

352
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:38,175
There must be a reason.

353
00:26:38,415 --> 00:26:42,175
You must not let any of the ill-fated relationships repeat.

354
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:55,815
The side with the number means "go", and the other side means "stop".

355
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,645
Does it sound good?

356
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,510
Who are you?

357
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,110
How on earth have I become visible?

358
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,210
By the way, does the novel...

359
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,470
have to be finished?

360
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,310
Well, I mean... If it has a sad ending,

361
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,040
I'll be sad.

362
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,270
Did I make her open a Pandora's box?

363
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,040
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy. - Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

364
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,070
Why? What's driving you crazy?

365
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,770
Well, you know. It's just...

366
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,040
I've been trying to figure out what to write for the next episode.

367
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,970
What about you? What's bothering you?

368
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,470
She must be distressed,

369
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,610
but she's cheerful. She's being overly cheerful.

370
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,410
Who? Are you talking about Seol?

371
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,410
Are you heading out to see her?

372
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,870
If you follow me, I'll call up an exorcist.

373
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,840
- Hello? - What are you doing?

374
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,210
I was just about to...

375
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,470
Hang on. Last time, she played hard to get.

376
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,010
It's now my turn to play hard to get.

377
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,770
I'm on my way to see you.

378
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,870
Me? Why?

379
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,010
I had a showdown with the almighty today and got an answer.

380
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,370
What's your religion? What kind of showdown are we talking about here?

381
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,840
It's a religion that worships coins. It has two sides.

382
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,410
I heard their church is near Minting and Security Printing Corporation.

383
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,740
Every citizen is a believer.

384
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,740
So what's the answer you got?

385
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,470
I've been told not to work today and have fun with you.

386
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,240
That's such an irresponsible answer.

387
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,710
What about the consequences?

388
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,440
Gosh, stop asking questions and hear me out first.

389
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,970
I might be put under a curse if I disobey.

390
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,610
Look at that.

391
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,140
She's in a full-on pull mode.

392
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,140
She sure knows how to play hard to get.

393
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,970
I can't get over the handsomeness.

394
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,510
It's nothing new. Shouldn't you be used to it by now?

395
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,110
This car is... It'd be a super model if it came with six-pack abs.

396
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,840
But it's not as sharp as you are.

397
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,070
Do you like sharp guys?

398
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,840
Then you should've told me.

399
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,370
This sharp guy is going to speed up.

400
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,810
This is so nice.

401
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,070
You mean, me?

402
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,610
The weather is so nice indeed.

403
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,170
- Hello. - Pick one.

404
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,440
- Matching hats? - Who am I?

405
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,370
Brother?

406
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,970
- No, my name. - Han Se Ju.

407
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,640
Right. It's a little awkward for me to say this myself,

408
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,910
but I'm as famous as an idol star, you know.

409
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,340
Do you see how everyone is looking at me right now?

410
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,910
I'll go hide over there.

411
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,110
Get two hats, so that people can't recognize us.

412
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,470
Is he embarrassed of me or what?

413
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,870
What's with you?

414
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,740
My goodness.

415
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,170
Do I embarrass you?

416
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,010
Do you want me to strike a pose or not?

417
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,440
Do you specialize in absurd photos?

418
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,510
(Support prospective authors)

419
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,570
You should be taking photos of things like this.

420
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,670
What's wrong? Do you not like my pose?

421
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,770
Gosh, that was a lot of fun.

422
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,140
You should get going now.

423
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,040
You said you've been told to have fun all day without working at all.

424
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,640
Your deadline is coming up.

425
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,410
You should go get some work done.

426
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,170
Will you be okay if I continue to write the novel?

427
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,310
Of course, I will be.

428
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,770
Why do you ask? Have you been worried because of me?

429
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,270
Were you wondering if you should quit it for me?

430
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,770
I thought about closing it...

431
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,440
because it felt like a Pandora's box.

432
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,470
Man up. Why are you so yielding?

433
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,580
You've opened the box,

434
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,970
so you need to do something.

435
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,510
Will you be really okay?

436
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,610
No matter what pops out of the box?

437
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,910
What about you? Will you be all right?

438
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,170
Even if something horrendous comes out of it?

439
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,610
I'll be fine.

440
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,410
I told you.

441
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,610
Fear stems from anxiety of the unknown.

442
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,080
Then we're good.

443
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,370
All is good if you're okay with it.

444
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,870
Oh, I should get going too.

445
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,670
I'm supposed to do a night shift today.

446
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,970
I'll get going.

447
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,710
Now, she's back in her cold push mode.

448
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,310
She sure is a pro at this.

449
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,610
Se Ju!

450
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,040
Thanks for today.

451
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,670
And...

452
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,510
And what?

453
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,310
Can I hold you?

454
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
Right now?

455
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,140
Here? You want to hold me?

456
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Yes.

457
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,040
What if someone recognizes me?

458
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,370
Have you forgotten...

459
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,810
Hey. Let's at least switch roles so that I can...

460
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,510
I can feel your heartbeat.

461
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,640
The side with the number means "go",

462
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,310
and the other side means "stop".

463
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,210
Are you crying or trembling?

464
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,080
I'm trembling, of course.

465
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,970
I've been a fan of yours for 10 years, and you're in my arms now.

466
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,210
How can I not be nervous?

467
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,040
What caused it?

468
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,510
Was it because of the sun?

469
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,410
Or...

470
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,970
Because of the spatial proximity to the typewriter?

471
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,440
If neither is the reason...

472
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,870
You're still living like a rat,

473
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,370
Heo Young Min.

474
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,870
Could it have been...

475
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,640
Hey, Hui Young.

476
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,740
Who are you?

477
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,010
By any chance,

478
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,540
do I become visible to people when I call them...

479
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,040
by their names from their past lives?

480
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,910
Aren't you off today?

481
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,870
Why are you here when you're not even working?

482
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,770
Did you cry?

483
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,810
Why would I cry?

484
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,010
I had such a great time.

485
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,470
Am I getting old?

486
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Why do you look sad to me?

487
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,510
I'm actually here...

488
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,040
to talk to you about something that makes me feel apologetic.

489
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,710
Just a second.

490
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,240
(Baek Tae Min)

491
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,580
How about we meet up and work together today?

492
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,270
There are a lot of things I want to go over.

493
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,370
I'll be waiting at the cafe until you come.

494
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,240
It looks like I need to ask a favor of you as well.

495
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,870
Mr. Baek.

496
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
What brings you here?

497
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,970
Please have a seat. I'd like to sit down too.

498
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,470
Oh, sure. Please have a seat.

499
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,370
You must be surprised to see me.

500
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,210
Seol actually asked me to meet you on behalf of her.

501
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,370
Did something happen to her?

502
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,740
No, it's not that.

503
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,910
Something has come up, so she's no longer...

504
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,770
able to help you with the project.

505
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,540
She asked me to take over what she's been doing.

506
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,040
(Incoming call, Ms. Baek)

507
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,340
(Incoming call, Ms. Baek)

508
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,910
Hello? Han Se Ju speaking.

509
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,810
Hey, Se Ju.

510
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,670
It's me, Tae Min's mom.

511
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,710
Can you stop by our place today?

512
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,110
I want to talk to you about something.

513
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,470
- I'm sorry, but I'm busy... - If you're too busy,

514
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,240
I can meet you at your place.

515
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,870
What do you want to do?

516
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,040
Welcome. It's very nice to see you.

517
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,040
How have you been? Ms. Baek wanted to see me.

518
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,270
I figured he hasn't been taking good care of himself due to the project.

519
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,810
I asked him to come by so that I can make him a nutritious meal.

520
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,540
You should join us.

521
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,440
My housekeeper and I went to the market early this morning...

522
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,080
to get fresh ingredients for these dishes.

523
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,870
I hope you like them.

524
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,310
Try this. It's flounder soup with mugwort.

525
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,940
And this is fresh ginseng salad with vinaigrette.

526
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,370
I heard it's rejuvenating.

527
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,840
Don't you know that Se Ju hates ginseng?

528
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,110
My gosh, do you?

529
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,210
That's right. You do hate ginseng.

530
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,310
I got confused between you and Tae Min.

531
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,440
I'm sorry.

532
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,970
You can just leave it there. I'll try it.

533
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,110
All right.

534
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,210
You look very tired.

535
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,210
Writing must be stressful.

536
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,170
I live with two authors,

537
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,670
so I'm fully aware of how excruciating it can be.

538
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,270
You've been doing a good job though.

539
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,340
I'm very proud of you.

540
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,970
Where are you going?

541
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,770
My stomach is upset.

542
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,910
Se Ju, take your time and eat up.

543
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,470
I'll go now.

544
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,540
She's acting that way because she knows what you're capable of.

545
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,270
She's trying to protect Tae Min.

546
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,340
Please think of it as a pitiful maternal instinct and forgive her.

547
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,510
She told me already.

548
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,670
She's being reckless like a broken car.

549
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,610
I feel like at least I should try and stop her.

550
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,540
I'm already full of regret.

551
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,080
I gave Tae Min...

552
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,940
the first draft of "Fate".

553
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,770
Everything's up to him now.

554
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,810
Did Tae Min...

555
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,440
ask you for it?

556
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,510
Did he go visit you?

557
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,870
Whatever he decides to do,

558
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,470
you should respect that and be at peace.

559
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,240
"There's no such thing as meaningless pain."

560
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:48,110
Thanks to you, I've become stronger like steel.

561
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,140
That's enough for me to be grateful towards you.

562
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,910
The reason why I can't be at peace...

563
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,070
is because I can't be a respectable mentor...

564
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,410
and a loving father to you.

565
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,910
I lost my chance.

566
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:10,940
I don't think...

567
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,040
I can never be that kind of person to you anymore.

568
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,970
That's why I'm always uneasy...

569
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,440
and in pain.

570
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,370
Where are you going this time?

571
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,870
I'm not going to tell you.

572
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,670
You're going to barge in with Dae Han.

573
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,570
When are you coming back?

574
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:57,870
As soon as my mind is clear.

575
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,410
Will it take long?

576
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
I don't know.

577
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,140
Are you sure you're going to come back?

578
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,970
Are you a kid?

579
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,640
Should I get you a present on my way back?

580
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,140
What did your mom say to you?

581
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,340
Why do you need to clear your mind?

582
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,370
My gosh.

583
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,170
If you leave me and my mom behind and not come back,

584
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,410
that's betraying us.

585
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,470
Are you shooting a melodrama?

586
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,470
I'm going to switch the channel.

587
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,770
Then please set me up with Yoo Jin Oh before you leave.

588
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,010
What genre is this?

589
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,740
Is it a mystery genre?

590
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,510
Why are you pretending like you don't know what I'm talking about?

591
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,310
He came to our house once, and I even saw him at the cart bar.

592
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,870
I also know that you met him the other day at Riccardo.

593
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,540
You even told him my name.

594
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,370
It's Yoo Jin Oh, isn't it?

595
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,440
Is it a "Love and War" kind of genre?

596
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,440
Do you go to church?

597
00:44:58,370 --> 00:44:59,910
It's Deacon Baek.

598
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,070
Hi, Mr. Baek.

599
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,770
I'm in front of your house.

600
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,470
Please come out.

601
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,340
I have something to say to you.

602
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,240
I'm sorry.

603
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,310
You heard, right?

604
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,540
I have an urgent matter, so I'm going to...

605
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,910
Am I a stalker?

606
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,910
- Sorry? - Am I a pervert?

607
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,670
Did I try to threaten you?

608
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,210
Mr. Baek.

609
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:36,710
Why do you make me feel miserable?

610
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,170
Do I seem like I don't have any pride?

611
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,410
Please calm down and listen to me.

612
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,440
You said you weren't attracted to me,

613
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,510
so I suggested that we stay as friends.

614
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,310
But why are you ignoring me?

615
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,570
Why are you treating me like a bug?

616
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,870
What gives you the right to do that?

617
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,070
Who are you to treat me that way?

618
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,710
What are you doing to her?

619
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:25,770
Mind your own business.

620
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,710
I'm here because she violated our employment contract.

621
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:30,670
I guess you didn't hear.

622
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,270
She'll be working...

623
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,710
as my assistant from now on.

624
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,140
Didn't I tell you to mind your own business?

625
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,810
If there's a problem, send a penalty bill to my lawyer.

626
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,010
He'll take care of things.

627
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,340
Let's go.

628
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,740
How did you come?

629
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,870
A veterinarian I know told me that she's on duty tonight.

630
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,810
So I went to the hospital to woo her with presents.

631
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,440
But it turns out that she wasn't on duty.

632
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,040
She actually took a leave of absence.

633
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,140
It turns out she lied to me.

634
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,310
She apparently told the director that she's going somewhere.

635
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,970
But I had never heard a thing from her.

636
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,370
That's when I knew.

637
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:33,370
The reason why she spent the day with me today...

638
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,940
was so that she could say goodbye.

639
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,040
So where are we going right now?

640
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:42,810
The shooting range.

641
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,770
Why are we going there?

642
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,710
Because I think that is where you started lying to me.

643
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,640
It always starts at the site of the accident.

644
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,370
Stop the car. I'll tell you everything.

645
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,710
No, you had enough time to make up a whole new lie.

646
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,940
We'll do an on-site inspection.

647
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,010
I...

648
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,640
think...

649
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,410
I killed you.

650
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:18,910
What?

651
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,710
In my past life,

652
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,710
I think I shot you in the head.

653
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,840
How do you feel?

654
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,840
Something horrible came out of the box, didn't it?

655
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,410
I'm running away...

656
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,070
because I can't handle it.

657
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,470
You said that...

658
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,310
we didn't meet by coincidence.

659
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,010
You said there must be a good reason.

660
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,940
I think I know that reason.

661
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,640
We met so that I can pay for what I did.

662
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,870
So that I can live in pain all my life while I watch you from afar.

663
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,340
The almighty must've led me to like you...

664
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,910
so that I can get punished.

665
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,570
They wanted me to be heartbroken.

666
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,340
I hope you live well.

667
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:32,340
I also hope you meet a nice woman...

668
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:35,070
who will help you lengthen your lifeline.

669
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,240
I'll go back home by taxi.

670
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,110
The past life...

671
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,440
Isn't just a past life.

672
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,240
That doesn't console me.

673
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,440
Because...

674
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,040
I actually feel...

675
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,710
painful...

676
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,210
as if it happened just now.

677
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:09,970
You don't know why you killed me.

678
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,910
I could've been the bad guy.

679
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,840
I'm sorry. That doesn't console me either.

680
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,810
Don't you think you're being a fool?

681
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,670
How can you be sure that it'll happen again?

682
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,240
It already is happening.

683
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,740
You almost got killed twice, and I saw that with my own eyes.

684
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,070
You'll be miserable if you stay with me. So...

685
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,170
Hello.

686
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,170
I just sent what you asked for.

687
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,740
Did you check it out?

688
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:41,870
I was about to.

689
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,470
She seems to be an interesting person after all.

690
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,870
(Family Relation Certificate)

691
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,940
Did you see the picture?

692
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,340
I happened to spot some interesting scenes when I went to see Ms. Jo.

693
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,610
Mr. Han. Mr. Han. Wake up.

694
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,870
You're kidding me. You've got to be kidding me.

695
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,810
You're driving me nuts.

696
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,610
- Open your eyes. - Mr. Han.

697
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,910
Can you hear me? Mr. Han.

698
00:52:45,294 --> 00:52:49,554
If I call your name, will you able to see me?

699
00:52:51,994 --> 00:52:53,554
Will I finally...

700
00:52:54,994 --> 00:52:57,294
get to show myself to you?

701
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:10,394
Jin Oh.

702
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:12,494
Hello, Bang Jin.

703
00:53:13,894 --> 00:53:17,854
I was disappointed that you disappeared without saying goodbye.

704
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:20,154
Are you here to apologize?

705
00:53:20,454 --> 00:53:22,194
No, I'm here to meet Seol.

706
00:53:23,994 --> 00:53:25,254
What's with Seol?

707
00:53:27,694 --> 00:53:30,154
I want to try calling her name.

708
00:53:31,324 --> 00:53:32,494
Call her name?

709
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,794
Are you the poet Kim Chun Su or what?

710
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:38,694
Who is she talking to?

711
00:53:38,894 --> 00:53:41,794
Why do you want to call her name? To make her a flower?

712
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:45,224
Why don't you call my name instead of hers?

713
00:53:45,494 --> 00:53:48,754
I promise I will be a special person for you for free.

714
00:53:49,194 --> 00:53:50,994
What is she doing?

715
00:53:52,124 --> 00:53:53,854
Why do you keep smiling?

716
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,494
Did I say something funny?

717
00:53:58,824 --> 00:53:59,894
Ma Bang Jin.

718
00:54:00,354 --> 00:54:01,754
Mom.

719
00:54:02,094 --> 00:54:03,694
Follow me. Right now.

720
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:09,824
You, next to her. You should follow me as well.

721
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:26,354
You. What's your name?

722
00:54:26,954 --> 00:54:29,994
How old are you? What are you?

723
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:35,994
Mom, he's not there. He's over there.

724
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:41,954
Why don't you look at his face when you talk to him?

725
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,594
- Have some manners. - Be quiet.

726
00:54:46,054 --> 00:54:48,624
Why don't you go out and buy something cold to drink?

727
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:51,754
Hurry up.

728
00:54:51,824 --> 00:54:53,424
Fine.

729
00:54:57,824 --> 00:55:00,494
Have a seat. I'll be right back.

730
00:55:12,324 --> 00:55:14,654
What are you doing? Come have a seat.

731
00:55:22,854 --> 00:55:24,354
I'm already sitting.

732
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:28,494
Darn it. I can't see nor hear him. I don't know where to look at.

733
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:33,224
Anyway, you must be listening.

734
00:55:33,694 --> 00:55:35,224
Yes, I'm listening.

735
00:55:35,824 --> 00:55:37,524
Bang Jin can't tell...

736
00:55:37,824 --> 00:55:40,794
if you're a ghost or a human.

737
00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:42,554
Yes, it seems like it.

738
00:55:42,554 --> 00:55:46,494
I don't want my daughter to be like me.

739
00:55:46,524 --> 00:55:49,654
So you'd better stay away from my daughter when I'm saying nicely.

740
00:55:49,654 --> 00:55:52,124
Excuse me, but I'm not the one who is being clingy...

741
00:55:52,124 --> 00:55:55,094
She has no idea what she's doing. I know you're interested in her...

742
00:55:55,094 --> 00:55:57,554
because she's being nice to you.

743
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:00,124
I'm saying there's nothing going on between Bang Jin and...

744
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:02,624
You're not a human. You're a ghost.

745
00:56:05,794 --> 00:56:09,754
Do you know what happens when a ghost pretends to be a human?

746
00:56:10,894 --> 00:56:13,224
You'll get obsessed with life.

747
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:18,024
As the obsession grows, you'll feel sorry about yourself...

748
00:56:18,354 --> 00:56:20,924
and you'll bear a grudge.

749
00:56:22,394 --> 00:56:25,794
Showing myself in front of the person I like...

750
00:56:26,454 --> 00:56:28,454
is the only thing I want.

751
00:56:28,454 --> 00:56:32,554
Ghosts should live like ghosts and humans should live like humans.

752
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:36,224
Don't try to lure humans as if you're a human.

753
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:39,394
Don't have a false hope towards humans.

754
00:56:39,994 --> 00:56:43,154
It's easy for you to be nice to them and then leave them.

755
00:56:43,624 --> 00:56:45,424
But what about the one who is left behind?

756
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:51,224
If you have a conscience, let go of your greed.

757
00:56:51,924 --> 00:56:55,354
If you don't want to be wandering as an evil spirit, just leave.

758
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:57,654
Do you understand?

759
00:57:15,254 --> 00:57:17,654
Jin Oh. Why are you leaving already?

760
00:57:19,694 --> 00:57:21,094
Did my mom say something?

761
00:57:21,894 --> 00:57:24,054
My mom might sound rude,

762
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:26,324
- but she means no harm. - It's not because...

763
00:57:27,354 --> 00:57:28,594
of your mother.

764
00:57:30,354 --> 00:57:31,454
I just...

765
00:57:33,394 --> 00:57:34,854
need to get going.

766
00:57:36,024 --> 00:57:39,194
- You wanted to see Seol. - No.

767
00:57:40,554 --> 00:57:42,194
I don't think I should see her.

768
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:45,024
Bang Jin.

769
00:57:45,954 --> 00:57:48,094
Thank you for everything.

770
00:57:48,694 --> 00:57:51,524
- We won't see each other again. - Why?

771
00:57:54,094 --> 00:57:55,824
Why can't we see each other again?

772
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,254
Are you also going somewhere?

773
00:58:02,594 --> 00:58:03,624
Well.

774
00:58:04,554 --> 00:58:06,994
There's no good reason.

775
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:09,224
I...

776
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:13,554
have been thinking about you everyday...

777
00:58:13,554 --> 00:58:15,524
ever since you helped me picking up the red beans.

778
00:58:16,454 --> 00:58:20,194
I've been dreaming about someone whom I don't even know.

779
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:25,424
I didn't know where you lived. When I tried to talk to you,

780
00:58:25,654 --> 00:58:27,394
you quickly disappeared.

781
00:58:29,594 --> 00:58:32,124
Is it so bad that I like you?

782
00:58:33,354 --> 00:58:35,524
Seol already has a crush on someone.

783
00:58:35,524 --> 00:58:37,794
You keep looking for her...

784
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:39,924
but Seol said she doesn't know you.

785
00:58:40,424 --> 00:58:42,494
You tell me that I'm not your type.

786
00:58:57,254 --> 00:58:58,424
I...

787
00:59:00,154 --> 00:59:02,954
am not the right one for you, Bang Jin.

788
00:59:04,094 --> 00:59:06,154
Why not?

789
00:59:07,054 --> 00:59:08,154
Because...

790
00:59:12,154 --> 00:59:14,594
Why now?

791
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,624
It's Seol.

792
00:59:21,354 --> 00:59:22,724
Hi, Seol. What's up?

793
00:59:24,654 --> 00:59:26,854
What? Why are you in a hospital?

794
00:59:37,424 --> 00:59:39,824
There's no witness?

795
00:59:40,954 --> 00:59:42,654
Fine. I'm coming down.

796
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:50,954
You're still here.

797
00:59:51,894 --> 00:59:53,394
I wanted to see him wake up before I go.

798
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:55,994
No one told me to come in, so I was waiting.

799
00:59:56,294 --> 00:59:57,994
Mr. Gal didn't want that.

800
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:02,224
Don't worry. He got a mild concussion.

801
01:00:02,394 --> 01:00:03,524
He's fine.

802
01:00:04,094 --> 01:00:07,754
He can leave right away, but he wanted to get a checkup.

803
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:13,354
Would you like to go in?

804
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:15,524
Can I?

805
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,894
We will have to be away for a while.

806
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:19,354
Please take good care of him.

807
01:00:19,594 --> 01:00:20,594
Thank you.

808
01:01:02,694 --> 01:01:04,154
I told you to listen to me.

809
01:01:05,694 --> 01:01:07,294
You almost died again.

810
01:01:15,154 --> 01:01:17,124
Can I stay here for a while?

811
01:01:19,124 --> 01:01:21,024
Just for a little while. It should be okay, right?

812
01:01:24,354 --> 01:01:26,524
I'll flip the coin again later.

813
01:01:28,794 --> 01:01:30,624
If the coin doesn't change its mind,

814
01:01:31,724 --> 01:01:32,754
I will leave then.

815
01:01:35,254 --> 01:01:36,554
I promise I will leave then.

816
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:40,494
The motorcycle disappeared near an abandoned factory.

817
01:01:40,494 --> 01:01:43,454
So are you saying you lost the motorcycle?

818
01:01:43,454 --> 01:01:45,954
There are security cameras everywhere. How is that possible?

819
01:01:45,954 --> 01:01:47,194
Please calm down.

820
01:01:49,354 --> 01:01:51,324
Weren't there other security cameras...

821
01:01:51,324 --> 01:01:52,924
except those installed by the public office?

822
01:01:53,024 --> 01:01:54,024
What about witnesses?

823
01:01:54,394 --> 01:01:56,724
There are no witnesses since it's a solitary place.

824
01:01:56,924 --> 01:01:59,254
Luckily, there was a security camera installed to prevent materials...

825
01:01:59,254 --> 01:02:00,454
from getting stolen.

826
01:02:00,454 --> 01:02:03,524
Why didn't you say that earlier? Get the video right away.

827
01:02:03,524 --> 01:02:04,854
I did try,

828
01:02:05,824 --> 01:02:08,724
but somebody destroyed the whole video data in advance.

829
01:02:09,694 --> 01:02:10,724
Destroyed?

830
01:02:13,654 --> 01:02:15,994
Hold on a second. That means...

831
01:02:16,354 --> 01:02:19,794
the accident that happened today wasn't just an accident,

832
01:02:20,954 --> 01:02:23,954
but somebody intended to harm Se Ju.

833
01:02:25,894 --> 01:02:28,854
Mr. Gal. Please call the police for an official investigation.

834
01:02:29,054 --> 01:02:32,124
I'll find out who destroyed the camera.

835
01:02:32,524 --> 01:02:35,454
My goodness. How dare someone try to destroy my purse string?

836
01:02:35,724 --> 01:02:37,324
Whoever it is,

837
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:39,624
- I'll make that person pay for it. - Please calm down.

838
01:02:39,624 --> 01:02:41,154
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

839
01:02:50,824 --> 01:02:51,824
Ms. Jo?

840
01:02:52,954 --> 01:02:54,154
Shall we make a deal now?

841
01:02:58,454 --> 01:02:59,894
What do you mean by, "You're late"?

842
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:02,094
I also needed some time...

843
01:03:02,424 --> 01:03:05,124
to think about the cards I'm holding.

844
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:10,654
That's how deals work.

845
01:03:46,154 --> 01:03:48,624
You're wrong.

846
01:03:57,554 --> 01:04:00,494
You didn't put me into danger.

847
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:04,494
You saved me whenever...

848
01:04:06,424 --> 01:04:08,154
I was in danger.

849
01:04:11,694 --> 01:04:13,494
If it weren't for you,

850
01:04:15,124 --> 01:04:16,894
I would've been killed by the gunshot,

851
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:18,294
the car accident,

852
01:04:19,454 --> 01:04:21,724
and the motorcycle.

853
01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:27,524
And I may have lost my career as a writer.

854
01:04:32,424 --> 01:04:33,994
I told you...

855
01:04:35,754 --> 01:04:37,894
we must have been meant to meet each other.

856
01:04:39,994 --> 01:04:41,054
I think...

857
01:04:43,454 --> 01:04:44,794
I know the reason why.

858
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:48,294
What is it?

859
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:52,754
Because you couldn't save me in the past life,

860
01:04:55,154 --> 01:04:57,724
you're supposed to save me in this life.

861
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,094
And...

862
01:05:06,994 --> 01:05:08,294
And?

863
01:05:09,194 --> 01:05:10,494
I think...

864
01:05:12,954 --> 01:05:16,894
I loved you in my past life.

865
01:05:19,224 --> 01:05:20,654
But...

866
01:05:22,524 --> 01:05:24,524
I think I gave up on you,

867
01:05:29,424 --> 01:05:31,654
so that we could freely date...

868
01:05:33,124 --> 01:05:34,754
when our country is liberated.

869
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:44,994
You don't need to make amends.

870
01:05:46,024 --> 01:05:47,094
You're excused.

871
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:49,354
This is a chance.

872
01:05:51,754 --> 01:05:53,324
So today I'm going to...

873
01:05:57,694 --> 01:05:58,894
do something...

874
01:05:59,924 --> 01:06:01,254
for my country.

875
01:06:48,364 --> 01:06:50,954
(Chicago Typewriter)

876
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,924
We're going to go straight, without any U-turns.

877
01:06:53,054 --> 01:06:55,624
We're going to push forward without playing games.

878
01:06:56,124 --> 01:06:58,294
Do you want to write with me?

879
01:06:58,624 --> 01:06:59,654
The three of us together.

880
01:06:59,654 --> 01:07:01,594
I'd like to see his face.

881
01:07:01,594 --> 01:07:02,654
Su Hyeon.

882
01:07:03,694 --> 01:07:04,754
Can you see him?

883
01:07:05,754 --> 01:07:08,954
Se Ju won't be easy to deal with.

884
01:07:09,054 --> 01:07:11,864
Why do you think my target is Han Se Ju?

885
01:07:12,254 --> 01:07:14,494
I guess I should use this.

886
01:07:15,124 --> 01:07:19,124
I think I killed the owner of this pocket watch.
