1
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:22,435
You don't need to make amends.

2
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:24,435
You're excused.

3
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:26,675
This is a chance.

4
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:30,905
So today I'm going to...

5
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:37,375
do something for my country.

6
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:15,975
(Episode 12)

7
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:21,005
Do you know what happens when a ghost pretends to be a human?

8
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:23,935
Su Hyeon.

9
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:26,005
As the obsession grows,

10
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:28,675
you'll feel sorry about yourself...

11
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:31,905
and you'll bear a grudge.

12
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:34,835
Ryu Su Hyeon.

13
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:39,175
If you have a conscience, let go of your greed.

14
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:43,535
If you don't want to be wandering as an evil spirit, just leave.

15
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:47,775
Su Hyeon.

16
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,105
Hey, Su Hyeon.

17
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:01,375
(Chicago Typewriter)

18
00:02:23,145 --> 00:02:24,575
You are still here.

19
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,105
No, it's not that.

20
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:29,645
I just came, sir.

21
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,145
Ms. Kang.

22
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:41,475
Right. I forgot that I came home.

23
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:45,105
I am sorry.

24
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:48,175
You kept smiling strangely while sleeping.

25
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,175
And I wondered if you were suffering from the side effect of concussion.

26
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:54,305
Strangely. Did you say I was smiling strangely?

27
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:57,605
Sir.

28
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:02,375
I know you just got involved in a relationship,

29
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,635
but can I be frank with you?

30
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:06,775
I'm not in a relationship.

31
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,905
Go ahead.

32
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:13,435
If your behavior is unsophisticated like that,

33
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,935
you can't win a girl's heart.

34
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:18,475
Unsophisticated?

35
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,905
But I'm a writer with emotions that are complex, sensitive,

36
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:30,105
and delicate. Are you sure you're referring to me?

37
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,905
- Yes. You. - Yes. You.

38
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:35,475
What are you talking about? I'm worried because I have a poker face.

39
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,375
- A poker face? - A poker face?

40
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,405
Do you mean a see-through face?

41
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:40,875
All your emotions show up on your face.

42
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,175
When you don't like someone, you act like a vengeful warrior.

43
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:46,905
Like a fighter who is willing to sacrifice her life for her faith.

44
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:48,505
Like a fighter who aims for your vital points.

45
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:51,675
You become unbelievably blunt when you don't like someone.

46
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:53,175
But when you are in front of someone you like...

47
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,275
Mr. Han?

48
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:00,005
You become like that.

49
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:01,205
Am I your toy?

50
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:02,635
Mr. Han!

51
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:07,735
Your face turns like that.

52
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,205
She's almost like Pavlov's dog.

53
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,335
Pavlov's dog?

54
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,875
Ivan Pavlov was a Russian physiologist,

55
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,905
who did a research on classical conditioning...

56
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:20,705
by checking how much a dog salivates while getting fed.

57
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,505
- Ms. Kang. - And during the experiment,

58
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:26,035
he accidentally found out that the dog salivated even when...

59
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:29,205
he hears the footsteps of the person feeding him...

60
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:31,475
or when he saw his feeding bowl.

61
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,635
Therefore, that dog learned to associate the footsteps...

62
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:37,535
and the bowl with his food.

63
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:39,375
And he started to respond unconditionally.

64
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:44,235
Right. Did you feed Gyun Woo?

65
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:48,535
Should we do a little test?

66
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:52,945
First, I will bring in the person who will help us with the test.

67
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,635
Please come in, Seol.

68
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,005
Mr. Han?

69
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:03,835
Did you see that?

70
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:05,675
Just like Pavlov's dog that salivated...

71
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:07,635
as he heard the footsteps and saw his bowl,

72
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:11,675
you react unconditionally to Seol's name alone.

73
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:15,105
- Ms. Kang. - Mr. Han.

74
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:17,005
You should admit it now.

75
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:18,735
You are very simple.

76
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,875
When it comes to dating, you are a two-dimensional person...

77
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,275
in the three-dimensional world.

78
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:27,375
You only have the front and the back sides.

79
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:30,805
You are two-dimensional and as simple as a paper doll.

80
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:33,975
Am I not charming because of that?

81
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:37,005
Not charming at all. Girls are more touched by...

82
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:38,935
the clumsy words spoken by the man she likes...

83
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:43,805
than the perfect love confession told by the man she doesn't like.

84
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,735
There's not much tension between us.

85
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,375
There's none.

86
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:53,235
As soon as a man catches a fish and puts it in his fish tank,

87
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:55,475
he gets ready to catch another fish.

88
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:59,335
Unfortunately, that's the hunting instinct of men...

89
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:00,905
we were born with.

90
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,435
Dae Han,

91
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:07,235
I think I know why you can't date.

92
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:12,205
What do you mean I've never dated anyone?

93
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:15,605
You learned love through theories in books.

94
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,735
Thank you for your sincere words,

95
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,605
but I will follow my own way.

96
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:26,735
What is your way?

97
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:29,635
There's no U-turn in my love. There's only going straight.

98
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:31,005
I won't play any games.

99
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:33,735
I will just move forward.

100
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:37,035
- I'm leaving. - Why?

101
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:39,405
Food is coming out soon. Aren't you going to eat it?

102
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:40,905
I need sleep more than food.

103
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:44,175
I stayed up a few nights at the clinic, and I'm tired.

104
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,935
Did you stay all night with Se Ju?

105
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,675
Bang Jin, you should take your time.

106
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,335
Dae Han, I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

107
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:59,575
You are a good man, so someone great will show up.

108
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:00,675
Bye.

109
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:02,705
That's not a blessing, is it?

110
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:05,305
She just rejected me. She just pierced a knife through my heart.

111
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:11,205
I heard you are hiring a part-timer.

112
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:13,335
Wait. Dae Han.

113
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:18,835
I'm sorry, but we found one about two days ago.

114
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:19,875
Really?

115
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,035
- Yes. - Is there anything I can do?

116
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:25,875
I quit my other job because I wanted to learn Italian cuisine.

117
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,805
But we don't have any plans to hire more staff.

118
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:30,175
I will clean, serve, and do the dishes as well.

119
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,575
Just let me learn whenever I find time. Please?

120
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,505
Goodness. What do I do?

121
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:38,805
You should hire her, Boss.

122
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:41,375
I heard you're lacking hands these days.

123
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:42,535
Should I?

124
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:44,335
If you say so.

125
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:48,305
He's just like Pavlov's Dog too.

126
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:51,275
Excuse me.

127
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:55,005
Thank you. I got this part-time job thanks to you.

128
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,805
No problem. Your boss is a great man,

129
00:07:57,805 --> 00:07:59,675
so please do your best to help him out. Bye.

130
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:15,305
We're supposed to meet. Why are you calling me instead?

131
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,475
Don't tell me you changed your mind already.

132
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:20,405
You want to change our meeting place?

133
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:36,435
Sit down.

134
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,775
You're braver than I thought.

135
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,545
You had the guts to call me to your workroom.

136
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,275
I couldn't find a better place to talk in private.

137
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:53,805
You can talk to me more comfortably.

138
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:56,975
It's not like I'll stop threatening you even if you act so nicely.

139
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,805
You're only making me feel uncomfortable.

140
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:01,775
What do you want from me?

141
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,705
You're not that smart, are you?

142
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:07,575
What would I want from threatening you? It's obviously money.

143
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:12,105
Would you like to give me cash, or would you prefer wiring the money?

144
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:15,635
Before that,

145
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:17,805
you should take a look at this.

146
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:36,675
You've prepared a strong card.

147
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,045
Did you order someone to tail me?

148
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:40,175
Don't worry.

149
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,605
As long as you don't say anything,

150
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:45,175
I won't be talking either.

151
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:47,305
What do you think?

152
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,205
Does our deal satisfy you?

153
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:52,775
Not really.

154
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:55,705
But I'll admit that you're quite difficult to deal with.

155
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:03,175
I hope you live a great life, Mr. Baek Tae Min.

156
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:06,075
Shall I give you an advice?

157
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:10,975
Your target, Han Se Ju, is not an easy fellow.

158
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:15,505
He's probably on the move to catch you right now.

159
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:25,505
Why do you think my target is Han Se Ju?

160
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:28,575
Then who is it?

161
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:31,675
I don't know.

162
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:35,075
If it's not Han Se Ju,

163
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,735
who do you think it could be?

164
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:45,045
My goodness, it feels so refreshing to drink this after a nice bath.

165
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:48,705
Taking a bath after a long nap...

166
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:50,175
makes me feel so refreshed.

167
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:52,305
It was so hard to scrub off my mom's dead skin cells.

168
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:53,975
I almost broke my wrist.

169
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:55,375
You're like an eraser.

170
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:57,535
The dead skin cells just kept on coming out.

171
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,235
They weren't dead skin cells. You just scrubbed off my skin.

172
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:02,505
You won't believe how much strength this brat put in while scrubbing me.

173
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:05,135
Look here. It's so red.

174
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:07,035
- My goodness, it stings. - She's not kidding.

175
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:09,735
You became so strong after eating so many dishes of seolleongtang.

176
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,105
My gosh, Mr. Han.

177
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:14,105
Hey, you can't fool me anymore.

178
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:15,475
I'm not kidding.

179
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:16,805
Gosh.

180
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:22,435
He's here again. Why does he keep coming here?

181
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:24,205
Don't push me, you brat.

182
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,735
Are you on your way home from the bathhouse?

183
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,335
He shouldn't ask a lady that kind of question.

184
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:42,735
Mr. Han is quite an amateur.

185
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,505
No.

186
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,005
My goodness, did she just lie?

187
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,805
He'll probably know she's lying because she has no makeup on.

188
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:57,205
You didn't run away yet.

189
00:11:58,575 --> 00:11:59,805
Did you try flipping a coin?

190
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:04,235
Why? You said you were going to flip it again.

191
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:08,105
I decided to follow my heart...

192
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:12,105
rather than follow the decisions of the coins.

193
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:15,805
You made a very nice decision.

194
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,535
But why can't you look at me?

195
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:26,705
You must have no makeup on.

196
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:30,475
- My goodness, don't say that. - My goodness, don't say that.

197
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:36,605
If you have more to say, I'll be right back.

198
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:41,035
Did you really quit...

199
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:43,805
working as Tae Min's assistant?

200
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:48,335
Gosh, I need to go inside and at least apply some BB cream.

201
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:51,805
Why are you asking me that again?

202
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,575
Because I don't want you to be around him.

203
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,175
I want you to quit.

204
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:04,205
Can't you also do this for me?

205
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:11,205
Okay, fine.

206
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,535
I'll be right back after I...

207
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:17,575
Would you...

208
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:20,875
like to write the novel with me?

209
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,235
What?

210
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,875
You could be scared because you're uncertain.

211
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,435
Once you find out, it might not be a big deal.

212
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:31,505
We could put together both of our memories.

213
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:35,035
Let's see what's in that box together.

214
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:38,805
Let's write it together.

215
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:40,975
All three of us.

216
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,375
"Three"?

217
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,805
I told you about the mysterious being.

218
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:50,335
The guy who waited almost 100 years...

219
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,805
so that he could meet us.

220
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,175
And...

221
00:13:57,975 --> 00:13:59,075
And?

222
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:03,305
You still look pretty without any makeup.

223
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:13,105
What? They caught the suspect?

224
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:15,335
Yes. The police just called.

225
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:17,475
I'm going to go straight to the police station.

226
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:19,075
Call Se Ju and tell him to meet me there.

227
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:20,235
Call his lawyer too.

228
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,705
While he was running away,

229
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:25,005
there was a car parked nearby. The black box must've caught him.

230
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:29,005
They checked the footage and found his license plate number.

231
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:31,205
The owner of the car called him to handle it with insurance.

232
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,335
That's when he must've thought, "My gosh, I got caught."

233
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:36,705
"I guess I'll have to turn myself in." That's what happened.

234
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:37,875
What does he do?

235
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,405
He has no job. He's one of those cyberbullies.

236
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:43,435
He probably just goes to an internet cafe to write bad stuff about you.

237
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:46,005
A cyberbully tried to attempt terror?

238
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:48,305
That doesn't happen often.

239
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,375
Are you trying to write a novel? Why are you looking for a probability?

240
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,105
He turned himself in.

241
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:53,875
The reason why he tried to harm you is more absurd.

242
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,075
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:58,635
I couldn't find a job,

244
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:01,105
and my family treats me like a nobody.

245
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:05,035
But Mr. Han lives with a crown on his head.

246
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:06,735
He lives a totally different life.

247
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:08,105
He goes on dates with pretty girls.

248
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,305
I suddenly got so angry at him.

249
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:11,505
You little...

250
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:13,775
So that's why you tried to hit him with your motorcycle?

251
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:16,035
Don't you know that the crown carries great responsibilities?

252
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:18,875
You dare to claim the crown when you have no sense of responsibility?

253
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:19,905
You want that crown on your head?

254
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:22,275
What are you doing? Calm down.

255
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:24,275
My goodness.

256
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,005
I'm really sorry. I'll never do it again.

257
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:34,675
Mr. Han. I promise I'll never write bad stuff about you on the internet.

258
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:38,305
Please forgive me just this once. Please, Mr. Han.

259
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:40,775
My gosh.

260
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:43,705
Hey, Se Ju. How can you just let him go like that?

261
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:45,435
He almost killed you.

262
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,435
He said he's sorry.

263
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:49,675
He said he regrets what he did. Why bother taking it further?

264
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,735
Who would actually be confident in that kind of situation?

265
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,505
He only did that because he didn't want to go to prison.

266
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:56,975
He probably wants to believe that he's sorry.

267
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:01,775
Please call the media and deal with them.

268
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:05,135
Please prevent that crazy jerk's identity from getting revealed.

269
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:07,675
What are you talking about? Do you think he's actually sorry?

270
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,175
Those kinds of guys are really diligent in their own ways.

271
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:12,175
I bet he'll change his user name and do something worse.

272
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:13,435
He's young.

273
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:15,775
I just don't want to ruin his future.

274
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,805
Anyway, I'll trust you with this.

275
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:23,275
I don't understand why people think he's difficult.

276
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,775
He's like a foolish donkey.

277
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:28,435
But I wonder if it'll be okay to just let him go.

278
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,575
This doesn't feel right.

279
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:33,135
I got released.

280
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:37,075
You were right. I begged on my knees...

281
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,775
and cried my eyes out.

282
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:40,805
So he just let me go.

283
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:45,975
What? 500 dollars?

284
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,705
My goodness.

285
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:55,075
You little brat.

286
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:58,475
I almost went to prison because of you.

287
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:00,235
But you're only going to give me 500 dollars?

288
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:01,875
You didn't go to prison after all.

289
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,875
I'll give you 600 dollars. That's it.

290
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,875
Otherwise, I'm going to tell the police that you steal motorcycles.

291
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:12,675
I have enough evidence,

292
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,575
so don't even try to threaten me.

293
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,205
Hello.

294
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,675
Hey. I guess you started working here.

295
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:27,405
- Is it fun? - Yes.

296
00:17:27,475 --> 00:17:29,705
I have so much to learn. It's really fun.

297
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:34,635
Is that lunch box for your boyfriend?

298
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:38,905
Well, yes. How did you know?

299
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:40,475
I saw my boss...

300
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,405
crying his eyes out while making that.

301
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:44,875
It must taste salty, then.

302
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:48,175
I'm not sure who your boyfriend is, but he must be so happy.

303
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,975
He has such a sweet and pretty girlfriend like you.

304
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:52,975
Gosh, I'm flattered.

305
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,175
Sapsari.

306
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,335
How did you know I'd be here?

307
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,005
I went to your place to pick you up and was told you'd be here.

308
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:09,275
Oh, I should get back inside.

309
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:10,435
Okay.

310
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:18,745
What is it?

311
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,135
I was just thinking that she looks familiar for some reason.

312
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,375
Familiar, my foot.

313
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:27,535
It must be because she's young and pretty.

314
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:28,905
Men are all the same.

315
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:30,905
Jealousy isn't good for your body.

316
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:31,935
I'm not jealous.

317
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:33,405
I like seeing you jealous though.

318
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:36,805
He's good with words.

319
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:42,675
"When the roses bloom and your heart flutters,"

320
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:45,275
"give me that smile of yours."

321
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,405
"If there's a song you have to sing,"

322
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:50,375
"sing it now."

323
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:53,675
"When your sun goes down,"

324
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,535
"it'll be too late for you to sing it."

325
00:18:57,635 --> 00:18:59,135
"Sing your song..."

326
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:01,675
"right at this moment."

327
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:05,575
Shall we go back to Chicago?

328
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:21,705
Shall we just go back and settle down?

329
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,475
Until we're summoned by those in the upper world.

330
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:37,035
Shall I go back in there...

331
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:41,605
and never come out again?

332
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,335
(Send me back...)

333
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,875
(to Chicago.)

334
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:57,675
Come in.

335
00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:00,475
Hey you, old man. Where are you?

336
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,035
Come out. We have a guest.

337
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:17,035
Has he come out?

338
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:18,575
Is he here now?

339
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:20,805
Yes.

340
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:24,905
He's standing before you right now looking completely dumbfounded.

341
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:36,005
Hello, it's nice to see... Right,

342
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,705
I can't see him.

343
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:42,935
It's nice to meet you.

344
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,405
I'm Jeon Seol.

345
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:48,475
I was Ryu Su Hyeon in my past life.

346
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:57,575
Mr. Han told me all about you.

347
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:05,575
Welcome to this life.

348
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:14,775
He looks like he's about to burst into tears.

349
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,005
But...

350
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,205
is he really here now?

351
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:29,305
You better not be fooling me.

352
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,335
Here we go again.

353
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:34,305
Gosh, how can I prove this?

354
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:39,675
Use a coin.

355
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:43,405
Tell her to flip a coin.

356
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,635
Why should she flip a coin...

357
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,275
Like in "Ghost"?

358
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:55,335
You must carry coins like the bible since your religion worships them.

359
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,335
Take one out.

360
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:06,875
The side with the image means he's here,

361
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,775
and the side with the number means he's not.

362
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:09,775
Okay?

363
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:11,535
Now, toss it.

364
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:52,335
What?

365
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,235
Tell her to open her hand.

366
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:57,975
You're such a nuisance. All right.

367
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:01,035
He's saying you should open your hand.

368
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,175
Yul is really here with us now.

369
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:41,805
If the two of you are done with greeting each other,

370
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:46,135
let's go to the writing room and work on planning the novel.

371
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:48,335
No, wait.

372
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:49,875
Give me a minute.

373
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:52,535
No, just 30 seconds. Come in after 30 seconds.

374
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:56,435
What's the matter with him?

375
00:23:57,175 --> 00:23:59,275
Why? What did he say?

376
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:06,275
Why did he lock the door?

377
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:08,035
(Send me back to Chicago.)

378
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,575
Hey, that's my writing room.

379
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:20,075
My goodness.

380
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,705
The door opened on its own.

381
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,575
That's nothing.

382
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:27,475
Just think that you're at one of those haunted houses at theme parks,

383
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,975
and enjoy it.

384
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,435
Come in.

385
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:47,805
I thought he would've been reincarnated like us,

386
00:24:48,975 --> 00:24:51,305
living his life somewhere in the world now.

387
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,505
What on earth happened to him...

388
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:59,335
for him to have been locked up in that thing for 80 years?

389
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,335
That's what we're trying to find out now.

390
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:07,535
And that's why we want to complete the novel.

391
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,005
When our memories come together,

392
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:13,475
the puzzle might become complete.

393
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,005
I'll do my best.

394
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:18,805
Good.

395
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:22,005
Then shall we write up a contract?

396
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:23,805
Again?

397
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:25,075
Write what?

398
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:29,075
A contract for co-authoring the novel.

399
00:25:32,175 --> 00:25:33,705
The typewriter is typing on its own.

400
00:25:36,805 --> 00:25:38,975
Co-authoring terms and conditions.

401
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:40,975
Clause One. "I, Han Se Ju..."

402
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:42,235
"I, Yoo Jin Oh..."

403
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:43,235
"I, Jeon Seol..."

404
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:46,435
"We will share our memories with each other..."

405
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:49,175
- "until we complete the novel." - Good. "Han Se Ju will..."

406
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:51,805
"The process will be based on trust."

407
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:54,475
"Hence, we must not keep any secrets from each other,"

408
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:56,375
"and we must not betray each other."

409
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:58,035
My turn. "Han Se Ju will..."

410
00:25:58,035 --> 00:25:59,235
A special clause for Jeon Seol.

411
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:02,275
"Even after the novel is completed,"

412
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:07,175
"she will do her best in her relationship with Han Se Ju."

413
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:10,675
Done.

414
00:26:11,575 --> 00:26:12,675
- Done? - Done?

415
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,675
All right. We can sign it later.

416
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,305
Let's have a glass of champagne to celebrate coming together like this.

417
00:26:23,175 --> 00:26:24,305
Well, I...

418
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:26,375
I didn't get to include any clauses that I want.

419
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,235
- Me neither. - Cut it out.

420
00:26:28,235 --> 00:26:29,735
Everything we need is already in it.

421
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:33,435
Only those who are childish and small-minded write long contracts.

422
00:26:34,705 --> 00:26:37,005
- Let's go. - That is true, but it's still...

423
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:38,635
Goodness.

424
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:48,705
I honestly can't get used to it.

425
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:53,735
Now, you must be able to understand how wrongly accused I've been.

426
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:55,805
Of what?

427
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:58,535
Oh, when I thought you're the one who ripped my purse?

428
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:00,805
That's not everything.

429
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:04,175
He's the one who made that earthquake break out here.

430
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:07,605
He's also the one who's been secretly opening doors for you.

431
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:09,205
Well...

432
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:13,305
It's safe to assume that most of the misunderstandings...

433
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,635
you've had about me were caused by this guy.

434
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:17,535
You're at it again!

435
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:20,775
Why do you never tell people about the time I saved your life?

436
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:24,135
What about the fun times the two of you had thanks to me?

437
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:28,035
He's saying something to you now, isn't he?

438
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:29,605
What did he say?

439
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:31,575
Nothing important.

440
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:35,175
He just said that he feels very bad for trying to get between us...

441
00:27:35,435 --> 00:27:37,035
and doing sleazy things.

442
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:39,005
Gosh, when did I...

443
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,505
Goodness. He passed away.

444
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:48,675
- Did someone pass away? - A senior writer.

445
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,675
Writer Moon Seol Woo. You know him, right?

446
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:53,805
- He had been ill. - Shouldn't you go to his funeral?

447
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:55,675
I should get going too.

448
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,075
No. Just stay with him.

449
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:03,175
The hospital is near here, so I'll just drop by and say hi.

450
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:05,135
I didn't know him in person.

451
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:07,305
Then you should take your time.

452
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:09,135
I will play with Gyun Woo.

453
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,075
- No. - Goodness.

454
00:28:12,475 --> 00:28:14,575
You are scarier than the ghost.

455
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:16,075
Why can't I?

456
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:21,235
Gyun Woo is losing his hair because he's too tired.

457
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:24,175
Don't touch him.

458
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:28,505
You.

459
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,105
You remember that you're not supposed to possess someone...

460
00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:34,805
without my consent, right?

461
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:37,435
- That was just with you. - I'm going to call an exorcist.

462
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,005
Why are you whispering for such a long time?

463
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:45,705
Are you two seeing each other?

464
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:50,005
This is what it means to talk nonsense.

465
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,135
I will be right back.

466
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:17,335
Is it okay to leave them by themselves?

467
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:21,675
She can't even see him anyway.

468
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:26,905
It feels like we're on a blind date.

469
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:31,205
You are there, right?

470
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,105
I can't hear you even if you answer me.

471
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,505
Why don't we do this?

472
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:44,805
I will ask you a question.

473
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:48,135
Try to tap the champagne glass with your hand.

474
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:51,475
Then perhaps the drink will ripple.

475
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,575
If the answer is yes, make it ripple. If it's no, make it still.

476
00:29:55,405 --> 00:29:56,475
Shall we try it?

477
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:03,775
Are you there right now?

478
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,175
It works.

479
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:20,175
Then I will ask a proper question.

480
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:25,075
Did you come to a cart bar one time to see me?

481
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:33,975
I knew it.

482
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:37,575
There was nobody else there,

483
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:41,905
but I felt like someone was watching me.

484
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:43,705
It was just like right now.

485
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:58,975
Were you there when my shoelaces were untied?

486
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:11,635
It was you. You were the man Mr. Han mentioned.

487
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:20,405
I want to see your face.

488
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,605
Actually, I know your face, Jin Oh.

489
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,775
I saw you in my dream.

490
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:41,175
Your form is unstable. Don't be afraid to recoil from it.

491
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:44,435
When that happens, your body moves back or your arm sags.

492
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:46,875
Then you lose stability and control.

493
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:50,775
Aim.

494
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:57,335
Shoot.

495
00:31:58,405 --> 00:32:02,235
You were really handsome. You were just like a prince.

496
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,375
You were my shooting instructor, weren't you?

497
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:12,275
Thank you.

498
00:32:12,735 --> 00:32:14,605
Thanks to you,

499
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:18,035
I became a national shooter for a while.

500
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:22,605
Good job.

501
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:24,735
It's all thanks to you.

502
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:27,905
Don't forget.

503
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:30,435
Don't move back because you're afraid of recoiling from it.

504
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:34,775
Don't take your eyes off of the target.

505
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:37,005
It's just like being in love, isn't it?

506
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:43,705
We have the same memories, but we long them differently.

507
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:47,535
I should see you in person and thank you.

508
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:51,135
Please forgive your unworthy pupil.

509
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:56,275
Before I met you, I read a poem like this.

510
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:58,305
Do you want to hear it?

511
00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:01,335
I can understand why Bang Jin can see you.

512
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,175
But Mr. Han sees you too.

513
00:33:04,305 --> 00:33:07,805
How come I can't see you?

514
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:11,805
"When the roses bloom and your heart flutters,"

515
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:15,575
"give me that smile of yours."

516
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:20,435
There must be a way.

517
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:25,235
"If there's a song you have to sing, sing it now."

518
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,535
I knew this would happen.

519
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:36,635
Something came up, and Mr. Han can't come early.

520
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:40,635
It's too bad, but we should end it here.

521
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,335
"When your sun goes down,"

522
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:46,535
"it'll be too late for you to sing it."

523
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,235
I'll get going now.

524
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,375
"Sing your song..."

525
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:55,235
Bye.

526
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,175
"right at this moment."

527
00:33:58,075 --> 00:34:00,675
I will see you again.

528
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:04,175
"Sing your song..."

529
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,435
"right at this moment."

530
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:07,805
Su Hyeon.

531
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:13,275
Ryu Su Hyeon.

532
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:05,005
I can see you.

533
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,582
Why do you think my target is Han Se Ju?

534
00:35:23,982 --> 00:35:26,142
- Then who is it? - I don't know.

535
00:35:27,412 --> 00:35:29,282
If it's not Han Se Ju...

536
00:35:33,452 --> 00:35:34,982
who do you think it could be?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

537
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:39,342
Bingo.

538
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:41,142
Why her?

539
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:43,382
Why Seol?

540
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:45,912
It's much more painful...

541
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:48,812
to lose someone you love before your eyes.

542
00:35:49,342 --> 00:35:50,382
Just like me.

543
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:55,582
The pain of watching your lover who got crippled because of you...

544
00:35:56,842 --> 00:35:58,382
must last longer.

545
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:09,412
Yes, Mom.

546
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:12,542
(Sanghoon Funeral Hall)

547
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:17,182
Be careful.

548
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,312
Be careful.

549
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:25,082
I'm glad you came, Se Ju.

550
00:36:25,412 --> 00:36:27,282
Please take him home well. Okay?

551
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:29,242
Okay. Don't worry, sir. Go home safely.

552
00:36:32,952 --> 00:36:35,012
Can you stand up, sir?

553
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:42,212
Goodness.

554
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:45,342
My boy, Se Ju is here.

555
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:48,712
I'm proud of you.

556
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:51,382
I'm so proud of you.

557
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:53,082
These days,

558
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:57,982
reading your new novel is the most fun thing to do.

559
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:03,482
You know how much I love you, right?

560
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:06,382
Do you know...

561
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:11,182
I have a great expectation of you?

562
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:14,082
Yes.

563
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:19,682
Are you all right, sir?

564
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:29,882
Sir, drink some water.

565
00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:34,342
Let's go when you feel better.

566
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:36,882
Thank you.

567
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,882
I'm sorry, Se Ju.

568
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,412
I drank a lot of alcohol today...

569
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:56,242
because of him.

570
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,982
When I saw you,

571
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:01,542
the clock went backwards.

572
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:05,812
You looked like yourself back when you were in college.

573
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:10,282
I guess I'm getting old.

574
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:14,142
I can't even handle some alcohol.

575
00:38:15,538 --> 00:38:17,268
What's the use of drinking so much?

576
00:38:18,668 --> 00:38:21,238
Drink just as much as you can handle.

577
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:22,338
Drink moderately.

578
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:24,538
Are you nagging me?

579
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:26,268
It's not what I said.

580
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,508
It's what you told me before.

581
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:31,508
Did I?

582
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:34,538
You said that...

583
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:37,378
when you taught me and Tae Min how to drink alcohol.

584
00:38:39,308 --> 00:38:40,438
Right.

585
00:38:42,438 --> 00:38:46,508
That's when you guys just graduated from high school, right?

586
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:14,838
See?

587
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:18,508
Because you guys learned how to drink alcohol from me,

588
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:21,268
you never make mistakes related to alcohol.

589
00:39:22,768 --> 00:39:24,638
We didn't learn.

590
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:27,038
It was more like a punishment.

591
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:30,378
I gave you a punishment?

592
00:39:30,808 --> 00:39:34,068
You always asked us to go hiking with you in the early morning...

593
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:36,168
after drinking the whole night.

594
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:37,878
I did.

595
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:42,338
I don't wish to be younger,

596
00:39:43,168 --> 00:39:46,338
but I wish I can be as vigorous as...

597
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:47,878
back then.

598
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:52,668
Father.

599
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:54,138
Tae Min.

600
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:56,938
You were here. I've been looking for you.

601
00:39:57,338 --> 00:40:00,208
Mother called me to bring you.

602
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:01,968
I see.

603
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:03,908
I called a relief driver. You can go first.

604
00:40:04,108 --> 00:40:05,538
I'll go after paying respect to the deceased.

605
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:09,468
Se Ju, thank you.

606
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,268
Let's go.

607
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:18,268
Thank you.

608
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:21,008
I'll get going then.

609
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,308
Why did you take it back?

610
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,878
I tried to stay a gentleman today...

611
00:40:41,878 --> 00:40:44,038
but he doesn't seem to allow that.

612
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:47,538
What on earth are you talking about?

613
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:50,308
You handed the first draft with the innocent look,

614
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:54,268
and you asked someone to take it back. Why do you play so dirty?

615
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:56,238
The first draft?

616
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:58,638
Are you talking about the first draft of "Fate"?

617
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,468
Forget it. Let's just stop here.

618
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:04,338
Looking at you talking so intimately with Father,

619
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,708
it doesn't seem like you will reveal the truth.

620
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:10,138
I trust you.

621
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:14,638
That's a very interesting way to ask a favor.

622
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:17,838
I'm not asking for a favor. I'm warning you.

623
00:41:22,668 --> 00:41:24,668
It's a warning that I wouldn't let you...

624
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:27,938
mess around with me again.

625
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:32,378
By the way, about Seol...

626
00:41:32,378 --> 00:41:33,838
I've never handed it to you,

627
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:36,138
so there was nothing to take back.

628
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,768
You'd better stay away from Seol.

629
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:43,438
Why do I have to listen to you?

630
00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:45,508
Since you ask...

631
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:49,138
It's because you will put her in danger.

632
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:52,168
- What? - I warned you.

633
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:56,108
This is the last favor I can do for you.

634
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:08,378
Why does everyone want to separate me and Seol?

635
00:42:16,138 --> 00:42:18,968
I can't believe it although I can see you right now.

636
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:20,708
How can I see a ghost?

637
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:24,208
I think you've seen enough of me.

638
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:28,508
How is it possible to touch a ghost?

639
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:31,408
Excuse me, Seol. If you keep doing that,

640
00:42:31,408 --> 00:42:33,038
I'll get tickled.

641
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:36,468
My goodness. You even get tickled.

642
00:42:36,808 --> 00:42:40,068
I can have physical body and power...

643
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:42,138
in front of the person who can see me.

644
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,608
If you're done...

645
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:46,268
- How did you do it? - Sorry?

646
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:47,438
I couldn't see you before.

647
00:42:47,438 --> 00:42:49,168
How can I see you now?

648
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:52,008
Well...

649
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:55,538
It might be a miracle.

650
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:56,668
A miracle?

651
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,168
That sounds good.

652
00:43:02,608 --> 00:43:04,768
That's what I want the most at the moment.

653
00:43:07,538 --> 00:43:08,608
Do you know...

654
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:11,968
to whom this belongs to?

655
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:16,708
This is Hui Young's.

656
00:43:20,168 --> 00:43:21,168
I was right.

657
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,268
I was hoping it wasn't his.

658
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:27,338
I think...

659
00:43:28,508 --> 00:43:32,538
I killed the owner of this pocket watch.

660
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:35,868
No way.

661
00:43:35,868 --> 00:43:37,538
I saw it with my own eyes.

662
00:43:38,538 --> 00:43:41,108
I saw this pocket watch next to the typewriter.

663
00:43:43,308 --> 00:43:44,368
And...

664
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:49,038
I saw myself aiming a gun at Se Ju...

665
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:52,168
sitting in front of the typewriter.

666
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:56,968
That's not possible.

667
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,008
Why would you...

668
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:03,608
Is it possible that I, no, Su Hyeon...

669
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,238
betrayed him?

670
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,838
That's the last thing she would do.

671
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:11,038
Then maybe she mistook him...

672
00:44:11,668 --> 00:44:13,408
as somebody else.

673
00:44:14,408 --> 00:44:16,908
That shouldn't be the case either.

674
00:44:18,268 --> 00:44:19,268
Because...

675
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,508
Why did you suddenly...

676
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:35,038
want me to dress up?

677
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:36,038
It's for a disguise.

678
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:39,368
Boss said you're not a boy anymore. You're a modern girl now.

679
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:42,208
Boss must be really bored.

680
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:44,768
Why would he care about what I wear?

681
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,138
He must have thought it's safer this way.

682
00:44:47,638 --> 00:44:50,208
Anyway, you don't have to be the messenger boy...

683
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:52,608
of Carpe Diem for a while.

684
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:54,738
Stay as a singer, Anastasia.

685
00:45:00,338 --> 00:45:03,738
It seems like the saying, "Fine clothes make the man" is not true.

686
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:07,008
What matters is one's original face.

687
00:45:07,868 --> 00:45:10,608
You look just like how you were even with the fine clothes.

688
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:14,538
Why did you call me?

689
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:16,668
The weather is nice. Let's go for a walk.

690
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:18,508
Let's have a cup of coffee at an outdoor cafe.

691
00:45:18,868 --> 00:45:20,138
Since she's dressed up,

692
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,038
let's go take a picture at a photo studio as a keepsake.

693
00:45:23,538 --> 00:45:26,168
But there's nothing special to remember.

694
00:45:26,968 --> 00:45:28,268
This is helpless.

695
00:45:31,538 --> 00:45:35,538
Hui Young, aren't you writing the novel anymore?

696
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:37,738
No, I don't anymore.

697
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:39,908
Why not?

698
00:45:40,168 --> 00:45:42,668
That's the only good thing you do.

699
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:45,208
I think he has no time to write it.

700
00:45:45,468 --> 00:45:46,538
He's busy.

701
00:45:47,308 --> 00:45:50,768
Why? Is there a new kisaeng in Myeongwolgwan?

702
00:46:00,868 --> 00:46:02,368
That means she wants it, right?

703
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:05,738
Do you want to eat that? Should I buy it for you?

704
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:07,868
No, I was looking...

705
00:46:09,138 --> 00:46:12,738
because it reminded me of my dad who used to buy them for me.

706
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,608
I don't like sweets.

707
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:19,738
My gosh.

708
00:46:22,668 --> 00:46:24,238
She wanted it, didn't she?

709
00:46:24,468 --> 00:46:25,838
Stop teasing her.

710
00:46:26,538 --> 00:46:28,538
It breaks my heart that...

711
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:30,108
she looked so sad in front of the candies.

712
00:46:49,408 --> 00:46:51,338
Aren't you Anastasia?

713
00:46:56,268 --> 00:46:57,768
You're the customer from last time.

714
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:03,408
Aren't you performing today?

715
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:06,868
The bar is closed today.

716
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:09,968
And I only sing on Saturdays.

717
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:11,668
That's too bad.

718
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:15,138
I was thinking of going there this evening to hear you sing.

719
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,468
I'm sorry.

720
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:20,808
Come next Saturday.

721
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:22,108
I should get going.

722
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,308
Then...

723
00:47:27,538 --> 00:47:29,838
Will you say yes if I ask you out on a date?

724
00:47:31,638 --> 00:47:33,508
I keep distance from all customers.

725
00:47:33,538 --> 00:47:35,008
That's my rule.

726
00:47:36,238 --> 00:47:37,268
All right.

727
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:40,238
I'll get going for now, but please accept this.

728
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:42,468
I got it at Mitsukoshi.

729
00:47:44,668 --> 00:47:46,538
Thank you, but I can't accept it.

730
00:47:47,138 --> 00:47:49,408
I wouldn't feel comfortable if I accepted such an expensive gift.

731
00:47:51,108 --> 00:47:52,168
If that's the case,

732
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:53,838
please accept this.

733
00:48:02,138 --> 00:48:04,908
That won't make you uncomfortable, right?

734
00:48:10,368 --> 00:48:13,108
That guy is coercive in a very strange way.

735
00:48:13,668 --> 00:48:14,838
It doesn't feel right.

736
00:48:19,368 --> 00:48:21,768
This is the novel I typed up for him that day.

737
00:48:23,608 --> 00:48:26,668
He must've made it before the rotary press started rolling.

738
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,068
Let's see. "A Burning Night in Kyungsung".

739
00:48:35,768 --> 00:48:37,908
"April 19".

740
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:42,038
That can't be.

741
00:48:43,138 --> 00:48:44,508
"April 19".

742
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:47,468
"10pm".

743
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:49,768
"The target is Min Hwan Shik..."

744
00:48:50,038 --> 00:48:51,138
"at Namdaemun."

745
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:52,668
"Sniper".

746
00:48:53,538 --> 00:48:54,838
"Ryu Su Hyeon"?

747
00:49:02,468 --> 00:49:04,068
Hey, did you pick up the photo?

748
00:49:07,308 --> 00:49:08,768
I guess it didn't turn out well.

749
00:49:09,168 --> 00:49:10,668
Why? Did you close your eyes?

750
00:49:12,608 --> 00:49:14,068
Am I the only one that looks good in it?

751
00:49:18,308 --> 00:49:19,538
What is this?

752
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:24,538
You are...

753
00:49:25,138 --> 00:49:26,468
hiding something from me, aren't you?

754
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:33,438
Because Su Hyeon kept interrogating me so persistently,

755
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:37,368
I had to give it all away.

756
00:49:38,138 --> 00:49:39,438
So Su Hyeon...

757
00:49:40,138 --> 00:49:42,038
already knew that Hui Young was the head of our organization...

758
00:49:48,438 --> 00:49:49,668
What's the matter?

759
00:49:53,538 --> 00:49:54,638
Seol.

760
00:49:55,538 --> 00:49:56,738
Are you okay?

761
00:49:57,868 --> 00:49:58,908
I...

762
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:01,468
just remembered.

763
00:50:02,108 --> 00:50:03,268
What is it?

764
00:50:05,638 --> 00:50:07,138
What I have done...

765
00:50:07,768 --> 00:50:09,038
to Hui Young.

766
00:50:11,752 --> 00:50:12,752
I...

767
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:15,282
just remembered.

768
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,352
What is it?

769
00:50:19,652 --> 00:50:21,152
What I have done...

770
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,152
to Hui Young.

771
00:50:30,352 --> 00:50:32,822
What are you doing right now?

772
00:50:33,252 --> 00:50:34,452
You've been fooling me.

773
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,182
All along from the very beginning.

774
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:39,822
What on earth are you talking about?

775
00:50:40,322 --> 00:50:41,852
Don't you dare lie to my face.

776
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,152
I heard everything from Yul.

777
00:50:45,552 --> 00:50:46,652
Goodness.

778
00:50:47,952 --> 00:50:50,652
What kind of nonsense did he say to you?

779
00:50:50,952 --> 00:50:52,822
You're that masked man who saved me.

780
00:50:54,322 --> 00:50:55,852
You're also the head of the organization.

781
00:50:57,652 --> 00:50:59,522
The one who accepted me into the organization...

782
00:51:00,582 --> 00:51:03,282
and gave me the command to snipe was also you.

783
00:51:07,652 --> 00:51:08,722
So what?

784
00:51:09,582 --> 00:51:12,122
Do you want to put a bullet hole through my head or what?

785
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:34,652
There.

786
00:51:35,322 --> 00:51:36,952
Pull the trigger.

787
00:51:37,152 --> 00:51:38,252
Have you lost your mind?

788
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:40,122
What are you doing now?

789
00:51:40,252 --> 00:51:41,252
Shoot.

790
00:51:41,752 --> 00:51:43,282
It's an order.

791
00:51:49,252 --> 00:51:50,282
See?

792
00:51:51,152 --> 00:51:52,252
You're hesitating.

793
00:51:55,952 --> 00:51:58,452
My orders are the law you must abide by,

794
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:00,482
and snipers must be cold-blooded in order to survive.

795
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:02,922
However, you lost your composure the second you found out...

796
00:52:02,922 --> 00:52:04,422
that I'm the head.

797
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:07,852
You're no longer qualified to be a sniper.

798
00:52:10,622 --> 00:52:11,882
Is there anything else you want to say?

799
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:20,652
That gun.

800
00:52:20,952 --> 00:52:23,122
Put it back to the safety mode...

801
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:25,352
and put it away.

802
00:52:29,852 --> 00:52:30,952
So...

803
00:52:32,852 --> 00:52:34,252
was it because you couldn't trust me...

804
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,382
and thought that I might hesitate?

805
00:52:38,252 --> 00:52:40,022
Is that why you've kept it only from me?

806
00:52:42,652 --> 00:52:43,722
No.

807
00:52:47,382 --> 00:52:49,022
Because I was afraid that I might hesitate.

808
00:52:54,052 --> 00:52:55,052
Seol.

809
00:52:57,652 --> 00:52:59,122
What's going on? Why are you still here?

810
00:53:07,252 --> 00:53:08,322
What's wrong?

811
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:12,722
Did you remember something again?

812
00:53:16,852 --> 00:53:18,452
Are you crying or smiling?

813
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:20,752
Are you sad or happy?

814
00:53:22,552 --> 00:53:24,022
It wasn't you.

815
00:53:24,582 --> 00:53:27,722
- What do you mean? - You're not the person I killed.

816
00:53:28,422 --> 00:53:30,822
- What? - I had remembered it wrong.

817
00:53:31,252 --> 00:53:32,722
It wasn't a sad scene.

818
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:34,722
It was an emotional yet romantic scene...

819
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:36,422
where a couple couldn't be honest to each other.

820
00:53:41,482 --> 00:53:42,982
Jin Oh, you were right.

821
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:44,452
I was mistaken.

822
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:47,752
I'm glad to hear that a happy memory came back to you.

823
00:53:50,322 --> 00:53:51,352
What was that about?

824
00:53:52,552 --> 00:53:53,622
By any chance...

825
00:53:55,782 --> 00:53:56,882
Were you two...

826
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:59,452
just talking to each other?

827
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:03,022
Shall we have a party to celebrate it?

828
00:54:04,382 --> 00:54:05,622
Shall we really do that?

829
00:54:08,152 --> 00:54:09,822
Wait, hold on a second.

830
00:54:09,822 --> 00:54:11,752
Are you saying he has become...

831
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:14,052
visible to you?

832
00:54:15,322 --> 00:54:16,352
- Yes. - Yes.

833
00:54:21,722 --> 00:54:23,382
Why are you suddenly being like this?

834
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:25,252
When did it start?

835
00:54:26,752 --> 00:54:27,782
What do you mean?

836
00:54:27,782 --> 00:54:30,222
When did you become visible to her?

837
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:34,252
That's... It started today, but...

838
00:54:34,452 --> 00:54:35,652
When did you find out?

839
00:54:35,782 --> 00:54:38,182
- Find out what? - Don't make me repeat myself.

840
00:54:39,122 --> 00:54:40,952
How you can become visible to people.

841
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,522
When did you find out?

842
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:46,382
Can we complete the novel first?

843
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:51,552
You're one shameless ghost.

844
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,582
You almost jeopardized our friendship.

845
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:55,582
- How can you try to get out... - Did you...

846
00:54:56,782 --> 00:54:58,452
just say "friendship"?

847
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,122
Friendship.

848
00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:03,782
Did you really say that?

849
00:55:06,522 --> 00:55:09,282
Well, I think I said something similar.

850
00:55:11,082 --> 00:55:12,222
Don't worry.

851
00:55:12,752 --> 00:55:13,752
I promise you...

852
00:55:14,622 --> 00:55:16,322
that I will never do anything...

853
00:55:17,082 --> 00:55:18,752
that could jeopardize our friendship.

854
00:55:32,182 --> 00:55:35,352
Do you hear our friendship breaking up?

855
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:37,652
Don't you worry.

856
00:55:38,352 --> 00:55:39,382
As you know,

857
00:55:40,052 --> 00:55:42,122
I'll disappear eventually because I'm a ghost.

858
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:51,652
Did I sound sad?

859
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:57,322
I just wanted to tell you we don't have much time left together.

860
00:55:57,882 --> 00:55:59,052
- Let's write. - Let's write.

861
00:56:00,252 --> 00:56:01,352
Shall we?

862
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:18,822
- What should we write first? - What should we write first?

863
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:30,652
I should use this.

864
00:56:31,982 --> 00:56:33,452
(Carpe Diem)

865
00:56:34,152 --> 00:56:36,952
Are you asking us to smoke?

866
00:56:37,922 --> 00:56:40,482
No, I'm going to send you two...

867
00:56:40,652 --> 00:56:44,282
to Kyungsung in 1930 with this match.

868
00:56:46,222 --> 00:56:47,252
Pardon?

869
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:50,222
Was it you then?

870
00:56:53,882 --> 00:56:55,382
Step aside.

871
00:56:56,182 --> 00:56:57,482
Step aside.

872
00:57:09,152 --> 00:57:11,552
Is it some kind of time travel?

873
00:57:11,552 --> 00:57:14,952
Kind of. But technically, it's experiencing your past life.

874
00:57:15,222 --> 00:57:18,652
It might not look awesome, but I'm using the rest of my energy for it.

875
00:57:19,052 --> 00:57:20,982
I wish you two have a good time there...

876
00:57:21,122 --> 00:57:22,852
and hope it helps you write.

877
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:26,922
Why do you keep saying "you two"?

878
00:57:28,082 --> 00:57:29,152
Aren't you coming with us?

879
00:57:29,152 --> 00:57:31,352
I can't come with you, not that I don't want to.

880
00:57:31,722 --> 00:57:35,422
Only humans can do this. As a ghost, I can't.

881
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,282
Would you like to try?

882
00:57:40,782 --> 00:57:41,922
No, I'm not going.

883
00:57:42,582 --> 00:57:44,282
I had enough of confusion.

884
00:57:44,622 --> 00:57:45,722
I'm out of this.

885
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,652
I'm definitely going.

886
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,952
If you're not coming, I'll go alone.

887
00:57:51,952 --> 00:57:53,152
You can't go alone.

888
00:57:53,452 --> 00:57:55,282
What if something happens to you?

889
00:57:57,252 --> 00:57:58,322
Fine.

890
00:58:03,322 --> 00:58:05,552
Are you ready?

891
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:15,952
Then let's go.

892
00:58:37,622 --> 00:58:38,722
Run!

893
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:40,982
- Hurry up! - Run!

894
00:58:43,222 --> 00:58:44,522
What are you doing? Run!

895
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:47,522
- Stop! - Stop there!

896
00:59:17,452 --> 00:59:19,422
It has worn out over the years.

897
01:00:46,982 --> 01:00:49,982
(Chicago Typewriter)

898
01:00:49,982 --> 01:00:53,222
How about we write together?

899
01:00:53,352 --> 01:00:55,722
The three of us. Hello, it's nice to meet you.

900
01:00:55,722 --> 01:00:57,782
Su Hyeon. Ryu Su Hyeon.

901
01:00:58,452 --> 01:00:59,652
I can see you.

902
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:03,582
I will send you to Kyungsung in 1930 with this match.

903
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:06,622
- Run! - What are you doing? Run!

904
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:11,122
What is this? Why are Hui Young's things...

905
01:01:17,122 --> 01:01:18,782
That's me.

906
01:01:19,882 --> 01:01:21,222
Who is he waiting for?

907
01:01:21,582 --> 01:01:22,852
I'm sorry I have kept you waiting.
