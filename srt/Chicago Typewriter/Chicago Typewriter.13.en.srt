1
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:28,575
Run!

2
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,015
- Hurry up! - Run!

3
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:31,215
- Run! - Come on!

4
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:32,215
Hurry up!

5
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,167
What are you doing? Run!

6
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,727
- Get them! - Stop there!

7
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:38,167
Stop!

8
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:43,927
Stop there!

9
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:47,867
- Run! - Hey!

10
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:58,297
Where is it coming from?

11
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:16,427
That's me.

12
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:18,967
Ryu Su Hyeon.

13
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:46,667
What is this?

14
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:49,767
Why is Hui Young's stuff with me?

15
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:55,397
(Chicago Typewriter)

16
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:02,297
That way!

17
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:16,297
Let's go.

18
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:20,827
- Get them! - Where is it coming from?

19
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:29,367
What is this?

20
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,427
Are we invisible?

21
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:33,997
We must be like ghosts here.

22
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:35,727
Look, they can't see us.

23
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,467
They're running away! Get them!

24
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:45,567
Over here!

25
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,367
(Episode 13)

26
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,527
Anastasia?

27
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:06,527
Are you okay?

28
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:09,967
Oh, it's you.

29
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:13,467
What are you doing here at this hour?

30
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:18,227
I heard gun shots on the way from my composer.

31
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:21,027
I was so terrified.

32
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:24,297
So I hid myself in the backstreet.

33
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:28,667
My heart is still pounding.

34
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:30,297
The terrorist attack has stopped for now,

35
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:31,697
but it's still dangerous around here.

36
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:33,867
You should hurry and go home.

37
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:36,367
Well...

38
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,497
I'm sorry to ask this,

39
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:42,667
but could you walk me to the main street?

40
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,227
I'm still very shocked.

41
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:46,867
Sure.

42
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:50,567
You're very kind.

43
00:03:58,397 --> 00:03:59,567
Is that...

44
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:02,297
Mr. Baek?

45
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:05,027
His name is Heo Young Min here.

46
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,567
You already knew about this?

47
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:11,097
You knew Tae Min is related to our past lives?

48
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:13,127
I don't know the details yet.

49
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,767
I just know that he was a secret agent of Japan.

50
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:17,567
A secret agent?

51
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:21,827
Then isn't this too dangerous?

52
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,167
Su Hyeon doesn't seem to know that.

53
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,827
Let's follow them.

54
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,127
I can walk alone from here.

55
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,627
I can walk you to Carpe Diem.

56
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:05,127
If my boss finds me with a customer,

57
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:06,937
I'll get in trouble.

58
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:11,367
I'll never forget your kindness.

59
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:12,497
See you.

60
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:26,767
I'll follow Su Hyeon.

61
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,867
You follow Young Min.

62
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,027
Okay. Meet me here in an hour.

63
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:43,197
I gave you all the information.

64
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,567
How could you miss him?

65
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:48,127
I had no idea the sniper was there.

66
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:50,767
Where did the sniper go?

67
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:52,227
No one knows.

68
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:55,367
But according to some witnesses,

69
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:59,097
it's the same sniper from Min Hwan Shik's case.

70
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,967
There must be some traces left.

71
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,427
Find evidence by all means.

72
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:05,567
Yes, sir.

73
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,697
Your guest is here, sir.

74
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:35,567
You were aware that there would be an attack...

75
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:39,867
at the house of the vice-president of Siksan Bank.

76
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:44,127
And you still failed to arrest any Joseon Youth Alliance members.

77
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:46,497
Is that true?

78
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:48,867
I have nothing to say.

79
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,597
Why did you withdraw the troops?

80
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,467
We should not waste our military force...

81
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,127
over only a few people.

82
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:02,127
Shouldn't you still arrest them and get them to talk?

83
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:03,397
Joseon Youth Alliance...

84
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:06,797
operates under absolute secrecy.

85
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,997
They don't know themselves where they belong.

86
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:13,627
We better take our time and...

87
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:19,397
I believe I already gave you enough time!

88
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,497
I'll make sure...

89
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:32,227
to arrest the leading members of Joseon Youth Alliance soon.

90
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:36,497
A trap has already been set up.

91
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:39,797
A trap?

92
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:52,797
Who is he waiting for?

93
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:59,127
Have you been waiting long?

94
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:02,797
Oh, you're here.

95
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:13,827
Get in the car.

96
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,197
Let's talk on the way.

97
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:16,997
Sure.

98
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:32,597
What took you so long? Everyone's been worried.

99
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:35,367
I took a detour to ditch the tail.

100
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:42,827
Mom.

101
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:50,197
Thank you, Su Hyeon.

102
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,537
You saved my life.

103
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:55,227
Thank your parents instead.

104
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:57,037
They gave you a long life.

105
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,037
By the way, wasn't something...

106
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:03,067
fishy today?

107
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:06,697
What do you mean?

108
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:09,167
They showed up so early.

109
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,537
As if they were expecting us.

110
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:14,397
It seemed like they knew about our escape routes.

111
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,537
I hope it's just a coincidence.

112
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,627
And the streets of Kyungsung are not complicated.

113
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:23,167
I don't think so. It doesn't feel right.

114
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,967
There might be...

115
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:29,567
secret agents hiding within our organization.

116
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:40,297
Secret agents?

117
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:43,897
What are you doing here?

118
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,067
Su Hyeon is in there with her comrades.

119
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:52,827
They're suspecting there are secret agents in the organization.

120
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:53,827
Secret agents?

121
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:36,097
If you're going to shoot, shoot now.

122
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:37,627
If not, put it down.

123
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,665
It's the doctor guy.

124
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:46,435
How many are wounded?

125
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:47,435
Let's go in.

126
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:54,935
What happened?

127
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,235
Why were we brought back?

128
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:02,205
My apologies. I got distracted for a second.

129
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:05,665
Goodness, you should've taken us to a nice place.

130
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,535
Out of all places, you took us to a gunfight.

131
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:10,805
That's not under my control.

132
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:14,405
You must've gone to where your subconscious led you.

133
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:17,305
Are you saying I wanted to go there?

134
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:18,665
Not really.

135
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:23,435
That's where you and Seol's subconscious met.

136
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:28,235
Did you...

137
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:31,665
feel anything different from the last time?

138
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:33,305
Anything different?

139
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:37,605
Yes, there was.

140
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:42,065
Last time, other people could see me.

141
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:45,535
We even did things together in the past life.

142
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,035
But this time,

143
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,305
it seemed like they couldn't see me.

144
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:51,335
In the past,

145
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,135
you were confused because you didn't know you were in your past life.

146
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:57,805
But now you can distinguish between your present and past lives.

147
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:03,735
So...

148
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,335
did you find anything out?

149
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,435
- What? - What?

150
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:29,865
There was a secret agent in the organization.

151
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:32,365
Mom also said something.

152
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:34,805
I remember things from my past life.

153
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:37,935
Don't get involved with that man.

154
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:39,605
Don't meet him.

155
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:42,705
You guys must not cross paths.

156
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:44,335
Was Mom...

157
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:46,665
You must not let any of the ill-fated relationships repeat.

158
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:49,165
Was she the secret agent who betrayed the leader?

159
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,205
Young Min said he laid traps to catch the leaders...

160
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:54,765
of Joseon Youth Alliance.

161
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:56,535
Have you been waiting long?

162
00:12:56,865 --> 00:12:57,905
And...

163
00:12:58,335 --> 00:12:59,865
Oh, you're here.

164
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,035
No way.

165
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,665
Was Shin Yul the secret agent?

166
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:10,605
Seol said she shot someone next to the typewriter.

167
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:13,235
And...

168
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:17,205
Was the person who shot me...

169
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:19,065
Ryu Su Hyeon?

170
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:29,335
What's this?

171
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,365
Who are you looking at?

172
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:42,735
What is it? If you have something to say, say it.

173
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:46,305
Have you forgotten?

174
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:50,535
Until the novel is finished, we will share each other's memories.

175
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:53,035
And trust will be at the heart of that practice.

176
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:55,505
We shall not keep any secrets from each other...

177
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,535
nor betray each other.

178
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:04,165
We said that,

179
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,135
but we didn't sign any papers yet.

180
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:08,465
- Right. - Right.

181
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:12,835
More than anything, I'm very tired today.

182
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:14,335
- Right. - Right.

183
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:17,665
Experiencing the past life is quite exhausting, isn't it?

184
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:20,035
- That's what I'm saying. It is. - It really is.

185
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,435
Then let's stop here today.

186
00:14:24,435 --> 00:14:27,305
When we meet next time, we will sign the contract...

187
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:30,805
and resume writing my novel together. Okay?

188
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:31,805
- Okay. - Okay.

189
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:40,893
I was right.

190
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:41,893
What do you mean?

191
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:46,763
You were a great, confident, and brave sniper.

192
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:49,193
See?

193
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:51,193
Once you opened it up, there was nothing terrible in it.

194
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:54,263
In the end, I wasn't the one you killed.

195
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:57,633
I told you that you have nothing to lose when you listen to me.

196
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:00,463
Why don't you stop there? It's no fun if you go on.

197
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:04,593
The boss will personally take you home today.

198
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:06,293
All right, Boss.

199
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,363
Let's go.

200
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,063
Then...

201
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:39,963
who did I kill?

202
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:46,463
I still have the feeling in the tip of my fingers.

203
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,663
Whenever I thought about it, I become too sad.

204
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,463
It was painful.

205
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:53,993
It broke my heart so much...

206
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:56,133
that my hand used to tremble.

207
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:03,363
It looks like...

208
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,063
I killed the owner...

209
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,363
of this pocket watch.

210
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:12,063
Does it mean I'm the person Seol killed?

211
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:17,963
Why would Su Hyeon kill me?

212
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,363
What on earth happened between the three of us?

213
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:45,463
If Shin Yul...

214
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:49,233
was the secret agent who betrayed our organization...

215
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:53,833
If that was the reason why he had to wander as a ghost,

216
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,463
should I tell him?

217
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,363
Why don't we go get some beer?

218
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,933
(Send me back to Chicago)

219
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,993
(Send me back to Chicago)

220
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,063
Do you...

221
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,693
want to go back to Chicago?

222
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,163
What's the reason?

223
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:49,133
Is it because I was too hard on you?

224
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:56,463
All right.

225
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:00,163
I won't abuse you anymore,

226
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:05,463
so don't go...

227
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:08,363
to Chicago.

228
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,633
Why do you keep looking at me?

229
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,163
Do you hate feeding me that much?

230
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,063
Did it look like that?

231
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,533
My eyes are at fault.

232
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,803
I'm sorry. Keep eating.

233
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:07,033
I think I'm going to get indigestion.

234
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:10,733
You...

235
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,093
- Yes. - Chicago...

236
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,593
I mean, secret agent...

237
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,763
What is a Chicago secret agent?

238
00:19:16,803 --> 00:19:18,663
I've heard of a Chicago gang,

239
00:19:18,663 --> 00:19:20,493
but I've never heard of a Chicago secret agent.

240
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,363
I got the question messed up.

241
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:26,193
- What I'm trying to say is... - Se Ju!

242
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:28,533
Where's my Se Ju?

243
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:32,533
There you are.

244
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:36,563
What's all this?

245
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:40,803
Did you know that I'd be coming? I'm so hungry right now.

246
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:44,033
You read my mind.

247
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:48,863
What's wrong with this? It tastes so bland.

248
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:51,463
Everything tastes like that after ghosts eat it.

249
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:53,993
Just think that you're eating at a memorial service.

250
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,233
Is your personal chef from Andong?

251
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,303
- Se Ju. - Yes?

252
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,663
Don't you think it's about time you start spicing things up?

253
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,133
- Was it that bland? - Yes.

254
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:09,063
Throw in some hot chili powder or soybean paste. It can be anything.

255
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:10,803
Let's enrich it.

256
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,093
All right. I'll talk to my chef.

257
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:17,263
No, I'm talking about your novel, "Chicago Typewriter".

258
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:22,163
Is it a romance, fantasy, hard-boiled or action novel?

259
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:23,833
Let's be clear on the genre.

260
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:26,763
You won't be able to fix it later if you miss the right time.

261
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:29,333
What's your point?

262
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:32,733
To be honest with you,

263
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:34,493
this novel is too pure.

264
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:38,093
That's why the comments say that the story is too loose...

265
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:41,263
and old. People are even saying that you're a fanatic patriot.

266
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:43,193
Ji Seok.

267
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:45,693
With this novel,

268
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,633
I want to continue writing it in my own way.

269
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:51,033
Do that. You always wrote in the way you want.

270
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:54,433
You never worried about what those in the literary circle would say...

271
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,333
and kept writing novels that the public were craving.

272
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,793
That's exactly why I always had to worry about what people would think.

273
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:02,863
And I had to put what they wanted before what I wanted to write about.

274
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,693
Of course, you have to. We can earn money because of them.

275
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,093
I told you before.

276
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:10,493
I felt lost as to what to write about and why I had to write.

277
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:12,363
But I've found the answer.

278
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,263
I went through hoops to find it. I just want to write about that.

279
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:23,763
So you're insisting that you want to write something that won't sell.

280
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:26,363
I'll obviously do my best,

281
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:28,193
but if people don't like it,

282
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:30,593
I'll have to deal with it.

283
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:32,633
Hey, Se Ju.

284
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:35,433
You said we should never be jaded. How can you say such a thing?

285
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:37,263
I've said everything I had to say.

286
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:39,793
You should get back to work, Boss.

287
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,233
Fine! Do whatever you want.

288
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:43,793
You never listen to me anyway.

289
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:48,493
Are you mad at me?

290
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:53,833
Come on, Ji Seok. I won't feel good if you leave like this.

291
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:59,433
You're not about to cry, are you?

292
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:01,763
Ji Seok?

293
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,633
Ji Seok?

294
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:05,363
Why are you trying to sound so friendly?

295
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,363
Gosh, please don't.

296
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:12,133
I said, don't.

297
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,733
Because of what you said, I've been working like a money-making machine.

298
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,993
You wanted a clear line between work and personal matters, so I listened.

299
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:23,193
I've been catering to everything you wanted and needed.

300
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:24,693
But how can you do this to me?

301
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:27,693
I don't think I've done anything you should be this upset about.

302
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,533
Do you really not know what you've done wrong?

303
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:33,293
Gosh, don't talk like you're my girlfriend.

304
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:35,433
I didn't want to look petty, so I wasn't going to say this,

305
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:38,593
but let's be honest. You put out extra food because you're lonely,

306
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:41,063
yet you've never even invited me over for a meal.

307
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:44,033
Well, that's...

308
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,363
"That tender-hearted guy is just putting up a tough front."

309
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:49,493
"He'll open up to me eventually." I really tried to understand you.

310
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:53,563
But you putting up a wall like this hurts my feelings a lot.

311
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:56,163
When did I put up a wall?

312
00:22:56,163 --> 00:22:57,193
No.

313
00:22:58,263 --> 00:22:59,493
Mr. Han,

314
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:01,633
you have changed a lot.

315
00:23:04,193 --> 00:23:05,233
Ms. Kang.

316
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,633
When I see you these days, I can't help but wonder...

317
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:12,433
if you actually need me.

318
00:23:13,863 --> 00:23:16,033
Ms. Kang, why are you being like this?

319
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:19,333
Of course, you're always...

320
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:21,193
- indispensable to me. - Right.

321
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,863
I used to be.

322
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,763
But I'm only allowed to come in here at set times these days.

323
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:27,993
I used to know everything about your writing schedule...

324
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:30,763
and even checked whether you're out of dental floss or not.

325
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:34,263
Now, I have to ask around to know your schedule...

326
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:49,893
Gosh, these high-end brands sure know what they're doing.

327
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,193
Thanks, Se Ju.

328
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:53,993
Who says you're cold? You're so warm-hearted and generous.

329
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:58,833
I don't know if it's okay for me to accept this, but wearing this...

330
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:00,633
means that I must bear the weight of it,

331
00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:02,733
so I'll do my best, Mr. Han.

332
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,663
I'm glad you like it.

333
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:11,133
By the way, I thought we wouldn't have to deal with crazy stalkers...

334
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:13,333
after that stalker committed suicide.

335
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,293
I guess people already forgot about it.

336
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,793
Speaking of which, I think we should have taken...

337
00:24:18,793 --> 00:24:21,263
strong action towards the culprit of the motorcycle incident.

338
00:24:21,263 --> 00:24:23,563
That's what I'm saying. Se Ju.

339
00:24:23,993 --> 00:24:27,363
Let's talk to the police again and capture that jerk.

340
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:29,063
We should make sure the media covers it too.

341
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:33,363
That way, prospective terrorists will be careful.

342
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:36,593
My apologies.

343
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:41,563
Gosh, I'm so sorry. We'll give you a new one.

344
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:42,693
Sang Mi, what are you doing?

345
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:47,733
I'm sorry. She's new.

346
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:50,993
Your dessert will be on the house.

347
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,963
Oh, I'm assuming this 80-year-old weasel here won't have any.

348
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:04,793
You want to do what with Jin Oh?

349
00:25:06,493 --> 00:25:08,333
Gosh, why are you being like this?

350
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:12,463
You promised me that you'd properly introduce me to Jin Oh.

351
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:14,993
When did I say that?

352
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,693
I asked you to arrange something for me to meet him.

353
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:22,333
Were you not listening to me at all or what?

354
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:25,933
How many times do I have to tell you? I can't introduce you to him...

355
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,693
even if I want to.

356
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:31,293
Why? Why on earth can't you introduce me to him?

357
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,833
Do you...

358
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:38,993
believe in supernatural beings?

359
00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:43,363
What do you mean by "supernatural"?

360
00:25:43,963 --> 00:25:45,363
For example,

361
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:47,593
things like ghosts.

362
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:56,933
You should just say that you're keeping him on the hook.

363
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:59,093
That'd be less cruel, you wench.

364
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:04,963
I was telling her the truth.

365
00:26:12,493 --> 00:26:16,133
What is this crack?

366
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:23,593
(Sungsoocheong)

367
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:37,063
Let's see.

368
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,433
Darn it. I thought I should give it a try because I get no customers,

369
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,363
but no one is visiting this either.

370
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:46,133
Gosh, my eyes are blurry.

371
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:51,933
What just happened?

372
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:55,033
Is the window open?

373
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:57,663
It's not.

374
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:13,533
Who are you?

375
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,693
Someone is here, right?

376
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:19,733
Goodness.

377
00:27:19,993 --> 00:27:21,533
Who... Who are you?

378
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:25,993
I'm sorry for visiting you again. I'd like your advice.

379
00:27:26,193 --> 00:27:29,263
By any chance, are you that guy who came here with Bang Jin?

380
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:33,233
Yes, I am.

381
00:27:36,193 --> 00:27:38,463
What is it? Why are you here again?

382
00:27:40,363 --> 00:27:44,533
Random cracks are starting to appear on my body.

383
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:48,493
You're getting cracks?

384
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:53,763
How many years have you been wandering around as a ghost?

385
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:58,933
I've spent 80 years locked up in a typewriter.

386
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:02,293
What? You're locked up in an object?

387
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:07,663
How did Bang Jin get involved with this poor soul?

388
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:12,363
Please answer my question.

389
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,633
In short, it's a sign that you'll perish soon.

390
00:28:18,993 --> 00:28:20,133
Perish?

391
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:23,093
In other words, you don't have much time left in the worldly realm.

392
00:28:24,463 --> 00:28:25,933
Why all of a sudden...

393
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:28,863
Either the object you're in is at its life's end, or...

394
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,793
- That is not the case. - Then...

395
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:34,133
you probably got involved in people's affairs, played tricks,

396
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:35,933
and abused your power.

397
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:43,633
When such cracks appear, your power starts to disperse little by little.

398
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:46,493
If you continue to use your power and energy,

399
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,763
the cracks will spread and deepen.

400
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:53,693
Then one day, you'll perish completely.

401
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:59,033
You were supposed to quietly stay inside that object.

402
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,693
All of this is happening...

403
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:03,093
because you interfered in the worldly realm.

404
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,363
You should have just quietly stayed inside that thing.

405
00:29:29,763 --> 00:29:30,963
Jin Oh!

406
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:35,133
You came.

407
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:38,433
I thought you'd never come here again.

408
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:40,363
Bang Jin.

409
00:29:40,993 --> 00:29:43,193
You told me that we'd never see each other again,

410
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:45,633
and Mom kept telling me not to see you for no reason.

411
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,693
Then Seol spewed a load of nonsense...

412
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:50,093
about how she can't introduce me to you because you're a ghost.

413
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:54,533
Who are you, really?

414
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:56,463
Do you work for National Intelligence Service?

415
00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:58,133
Just let him go.

416
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:01,763
Mom.

417
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:04,633
Let him go. You two aren't meant to be.

418
00:30:05,593 --> 00:30:06,993
What? Why not?

419
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:09,693
What is it? Are we supposed to be incompatible?

420
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,893
It's because he's not human.

421
00:30:15,893 --> 00:30:17,663
This guy is a ghost.

422
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:20,893
What's this nonsense now?

423
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:22,663
I can clearly see him.

424
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:24,663
I can touch him too.

425
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:27,293
Have you lost your ability to differentiate ghosts from humans?

426
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,493
You're the only one who can see him.

427
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:32,933
I don't even see anything, you wench.

428
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,363
You can't see him?

429
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,863
That's completely crazy.

430
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:51,963
Are you really...

431
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:56,133
You're not, right?

432
00:30:56,993 --> 00:30:59,863
What your mother said is right.

433
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,563
- I wanted to tell you sooner but... - You're lying.

434
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,663
I'm sorry...

435
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,293
that I'm a ghost.

436
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:24,693
No way.

437
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:30,093
That can't be!

438
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:42,893
She said I'll perish.

439
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:46,993
Does that mean I'll cease to exist?

440
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:51,533
There are still so many things that I have to do.

441
00:31:53,593 --> 00:31:55,963
My memories aren't back yet either.

442
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:03,563
You're a ghost, yet you act just like us humans.

443
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:06,633
You even opened the door with your hand.

444
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:13,033
I guess you only flaunt your tricks in front of other people.

445
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:15,433
Are they for bluffing?

446
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:20,093
I want to reserve my power.

447
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:22,933
Where are you coming from?

448
00:32:22,993 --> 00:32:26,993
Pardon? Oh, I was... I had to take care of something.

449
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:30,763
Follow me.

450
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:41,293
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

451
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,133
Me? What do you mean?

452
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:55,133
(Send me back to Chicago.)

453
00:32:57,193 --> 00:33:00,333
Why do you want to go back to Chicago all of a sudden?

454
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,633
I was just bored.

455
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,033
I wanted to practice typing.

456
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:12,463
- Really? You were practicing? - Yes.

457
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,493
You're already so good though. You don't need to practice.

458
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:19,233
What a diligent ghost.

459
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,233
You seem very happy to hear...

460
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,233
that I'm not leaving.

461
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:27,833
Me?

462
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:30,363
Sorry, that was my mistake.

463
00:33:31,263 --> 00:33:34,203
By the way, did you drink this much...

464
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:36,133
to ask me that?

465
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:37,563
Because you needed the courage?

466
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:39,633
Actually,

467
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:44,093
there's something else that's been on my mind.

468
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:46,363
Ask away, whatever it is.

469
00:33:59,293 --> 00:34:00,333
Well...

470
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:04,263
On the day I experienced my past life thanks to you,

471
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:06,363
I saw you...

472
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:09,463
secretly meeting with Heo Young Min.

473
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:14,663
It was the day we robbed the house of Siksan Bank's vice-president.

474
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:17,733
- Su Hyeon was covering fire... - Oh, right.

475
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:20,363
I remember that day.

476
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,493
I met up with Heo Young Min that day because...

477
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,833
Here's the invitation you asked for.

478
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,233
My gosh, thank you.

479
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:32,363
I can get my hands on such a privileged invitation...

480
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:34,763
because you, my friend, are from a family of barons.

481
00:34:36,163 --> 00:34:38,063
Many VIPs have been invited to this meaningful event...

482
00:34:38,063 --> 00:34:40,563
for promoting donations towards war fund.

483
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,363
It's a perfect opportunity to build connections with powerful people.

484
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:45,263
I'm looking forward to meeting...

485
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:48,563
and leaving a lasting impression on those influential high-ups.

486
00:34:50,363 --> 00:34:53,863
Oh, right. I got you two tickets so that Hui Young can come too.

487
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:56,233
Right. He'd love to come.

488
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,593
He won't say no to such a meaningful party.

489
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,163
He loves to drink and party.

490
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:10,993
Here. I got you the invitation.

491
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:12,933
Good work.

492
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,233
A party for promoting donations towards war fund...

493
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:24,333
I guess the rich who are blinded by power will be there.

494
00:35:24,993 --> 00:35:27,363
And they'll exploit the commoners...

495
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:29,033
in a more cruel way.

496
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:33,363
All that money will smell putrid.

497
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:38,133
Important figures in the General Government, high-up officials,

498
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:40,363
and diplomats from various countries will be there,

499
00:35:40,863 --> 00:35:42,863
so it's the perfect occasion for us to carry out the plan.

500
00:35:43,703 --> 00:35:46,563
And the blind money they'll collect should be used...

501
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:49,093
for the rebel forces, not as war fund.

502
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:50,263
It'll also...

503
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:54,203
show the world how determined we are to fight for Joseon's independence.

504
00:35:54,893 --> 00:35:57,563
But won't it be too dangerous?

505
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:02,093
Those high-up officials alone will bring a bunch of bodyguards.

506
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:04,133
We've been invited,

507
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,033
so accepting the invitation would be a polite thing to do.

508
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:10,703
You know that it's a trap Heo Young Min has set up to catch us.

509
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,433
They'll use all of their resources in order to make sure...

510
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:15,833
that not even a single rat could escape the trap.

511
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,363
That's right.

512
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:23,963
That's why we have to pretend that we've bitten the bait.

513
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,133
In order to make him believe that things are going as he planned,

514
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:49,833
we, at Joseon Youth Alliance,

515
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,133
will officially prepare for attending the party...

516
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:54,593
but get ready to carry out the operation.

517
00:36:56,033 --> 00:37:00,363
It's because they might have planted secret agents in our organization.

518
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:02,993
On the day of the operation,

519
00:37:03,093 --> 00:37:06,733
most of the police force will be at the party.

520
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:10,163
We'll use our agents to attack them from behind.

521
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:13,933
You and I will be the only ones who know the full picture...

522
00:37:13,933 --> 00:37:16,893
until the day. No one else can know.

523
00:37:19,893 --> 00:37:22,133
It was a feint operation where we acted like we had fallen...

524
00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:25,093
into their trap while working on attacking them from elsewhere.

525
00:37:25,363 --> 00:37:27,763
Then you're saying we knew it from the beginning...

526
00:37:27,893 --> 00:37:29,863
that Heo Young Min was Japan's secret agent.

527
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:32,833
Joseon Youth Alliance had a lot of Intel.

528
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:35,993
And don't underestimate Boss' keen insight.

529
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:38,663
What's with you? Why are you flattering him all of a sudden?

530
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:42,203
He staged everything as a coincidence to approach us,

531
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:44,933
but the first time we met him was so memorable...

532
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:47,833
that we started digging up Intel on him right away.

533
00:37:48,203 --> 00:37:49,203
So?

534
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:51,733
Did the operation succeed?

535
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:55,703
That... I don't know.

536
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:58,233
I only remember up to right before...

537
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:01,433
we carried out the operation.

538
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:07,493
Anyway, one thing puts my mind at ease.

539
00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:09,963
What do you mean?

540
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:15,063
The fact that you didn't betray me.

541
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:17,203
I'm relieved to know that.

542
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:25,033
I've been betrayed so many times by those whom I once trusted.

543
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,233
If I was betrayed by a ghost whom I've finally befriended,

544
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:33,293
I'd be very hurt.

545
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:40,463
Oh, there's one more thing I'm curious about.

546
00:38:41,063 --> 00:38:44,793
If all the pieces of memories come together...

547
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:46,363
and the novel gets completed,

548
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:48,063
what will happen to you?

549
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,533
Then you will have fulfilled your wish.

550
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:53,093
Will you ascend to the upper world...

551
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:54,533
You won't, right?

552
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:58,063
Why are you asking?

553
00:38:58,133 --> 00:39:00,433
Well... I'm just curious.

554
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,463
Keeping you around...

555
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:05,703
won't be too bad.

556
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,533
You'll continue to age,

557
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:14,093
and I'll stay young like this.

558
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:16,733
Won't you get jealous?

559
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:18,893
That I envy.

560
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:22,733
It's a sign that you'll perish soon.

561
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,063
In other words, you don't have much time left in the worldly realm.

562
00:39:26,593 --> 00:39:27,863
Then one day,

563
00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:30,363
you'll perish completely.

564
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:31,793
Why aren't you drinking?

565
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:34,793
I will. Cheers.

566
00:39:36,703 --> 00:39:37,703
Bottoms up.

567
00:39:41,703 --> 00:39:42,833
You still have some left.

568
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:44,533
Okay.

569
00:39:48,363 --> 00:39:49,633
There's still some left.

570
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:55,933
There are many definitions of novels that were published in the 90s.

571
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,033
I'd like to...

572
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:00,863
define them with the word "mixture".

573
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,963
This phenomenon arose from a crisis in the literary world.

574
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:06,463
The crisis of literature...

575
00:40:06,893 --> 00:40:09,563
no longer being the center of culture.

576
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:21,563
The pressure of having to compete with visual media.

577
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:25,363
These issues led to a diversity in novels.

578
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,733
You really know how to surprise people.

579
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,463
I do?

580
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,993
You're the one who wanted to see me.

581
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:36,833
In that kind of situation,

582
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,203
normal people would first reply with a yes or no.

583
00:40:39,363 --> 00:40:41,333
Then they'd talk about where and when to meet.

584
00:40:41,463 --> 00:40:42,863
You can't just pop out of the blue...

585
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:44,433
Gosh, this is no fun.

586
00:40:45,263 --> 00:40:47,863
I wouldn't have come if I knew you were going to lecture me on manners.

587
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,933
I wanted to meet because I had something to ask you.

588
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,993
Why did you tell me about...

589
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:56,033
your long-cherished plan?

590
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:58,233
You don't even know me that well.

591
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:00,733
What will you do if I tell...

592
00:41:00,863 --> 00:41:02,293
Se Ju everything?

593
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:05,203
No way.

594
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:07,593
You can never do that.

595
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,033
Why do you think that way?

596
00:41:10,993 --> 00:41:13,733
While my brother was busy researching about Han Se Ju,

597
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:17,563
I was busy collecting information about you.

598
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:19,733
That's when I found out...

599
00:41:20,963 --> 00:41:23,863
that you're always hidden behind Han Se Ju's shadow.

600
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:26,263
"He must be miserable."

601
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:29,063
"He must want to die."

602
00:41:30,203 --> 00:41:31,703
"Or maybe..."

603
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:34,263
"he wants to..."

604
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:36,863
"kill him instead."

605
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:44,633
I'm pretty sure you want Han Se Ju to be miserable as much as I do.

606
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,663
For me, it's about my brother's death.

607
00:41:48,663 --> 00:41:50,863
But for you, it's about yourself.

608
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:54,063
Am I wrong?

609
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:03,263
Mr. Han.

610
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:06,233
They found a new video regarding...

611
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:10,293
the motorcycle terror incident. They sent it to us via email.

612
00:42:10,593 --> 00:42:11,933
Would you like to see the video?

613
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:15,203
Let's just...

614
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,863
let go of that incident.

615
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:18,593
We already decided to end it.

616
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:21,763
Okay. Then I'll delete the file.

617
00:42:21,893 --> 00:42:22,893
Wait.

618
00:42:25,703 --> 00:42:27,163
They already sent it to us,

619
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:28,533
so let's just take a look.

620
00:42:44,263 --> 00:42:45,293
Mr. Han.

621
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,633
What's wrong?

622
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:48,763
I...

623
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:51,733
wasn't the target.

624
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:57,993
Mr. Han, look at this.

625
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:01,063
I think that person is too small to be a man.

626
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,833
Why? Did you forget something again?

627
00:43:07,693 --> 00:43:10,293
Yes, I know. You want the white cucumber, not the green one.

628
00:43:10,293 --> 00:43:12,593
You want the thin one, right?

629
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,563
You're really taking full advantage of me.

630
00:43:16,963 --> 00:43:18,863
Okay, I'll hurry up and get it for you.

631
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:53,733
Seol!

632
00:43:57,793 --> 00:43:59,593
Did you get hurt? Are you okay?

633
00:43:59,893 --> 00:44:01,193
Are you okay, Seol?

634
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:05,333
I guess I'm alive.

635
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:14,233
Are you saying that...

636
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:16,193
the target was me?

637
00:44:19,163 --> 00:44:21,563
Unfortunately, yes.

638
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:23,333
That doesn't make sense.

639
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:25,163
Do you think what just happened makes sense?

640
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:27,593
That motorcycle...

641
00:44:27,993 --> 00:44:29,433
didn't even have a license plate number.

642
00:44:30,093 --> 00:44:32,963
That means it was all planned beforehand.

643
00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:35,293
Then I guess it won't end...

644
00:44:35,663 --> 00:44:36,833
with just one try.

645
00:44:42,463 --> 00:44:44,133
You guys shouldn't worry too much.

646
00:44:44,593 --> 00:44:46,993
If that person was really trying to hit me with his motorcycle,

647
00:44:46,993 --> 00:44:49,063
he would've done so even before I sensed anything.

648
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:50,993
I'm sure he was only trying to scare me.

649
00:44:52,763 --> 00:44:55,263
Anyway, I'll still be careful.

650
00:44:55,463 --> 00:44:57,993
No. That won't be enough.

651
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,963
Stay here...

652
00:45:00,663 --> 00:45:02,293
until the culprit gets caught.

653
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,463
- What? - This place is much safer...

654
00:45:04,463 --> 00:45:06,363
than where you're living right now.

655
00:45:06,463 --> 00:45:08,263
I'm the one who put you in danger,

656
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,793
so I should be the one to take responsibility.

657
00:45:11,763 --> 00:45:13,863
But still...

658
00:45:14,163 --> 00:45:15,993
I came out to shop for groceries.

659
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:18,463
And now, you want me to live with a guy and a ghost?

660
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:20,493
I'm not Madame Freedom.

661
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:21,633
Do as I say.

662
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:25,433
I'm going to find out who's behind this and why.

663
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:28,533
I'm going to catch the culprit with my own two hands.

664
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:31,993
So stay by my side until then.

665
00:45:33,593 --> 00:45:35,463
You should do as he says, Seol.

666
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:47,675
Am I supposed to be happy or not?

667
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,815
I don't know. I don't know.

668
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:06,215
I brought you this. You can wear this to bed.

669
00:46:08,345 --> 00:46:09,345
Here.

670
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:10,715
Okay.

671
00:46:18,145 --> 00:46:19,175
Well,

672
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:23,175
I was in France when "Stalker" got published.

673
00:46:23,545 --> 00:46:26,675
A designer I met was a fan of mine, and she gave it to me as a gift.

674
00:46:27,715 --> 00:46:29,445
This T-shirt is one of a kind.

675
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,815
It sounds so precious. How can I wear it to sleep?

676
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,315
It's okay. Just wear it.

677
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:38,575
I'm the one who invited you here. You deserve this much.

678
00:46:39,245 --> 00:46:40,245
Thank you.

679
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,875
Well, okay. You should rest.

680
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:49,875
I'll be off then. Goodnight.

681
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,745
Keep your door locked.

682
00:46:53,075 --> 00:46:54,115
You never know.

683
00:46:59,175 --> 00:47:00,215
What's wrong, Mr. Han?

684
00:47:01,975 --> 00:47:04,845
I didn't know which color you'd prefer.

685
00:47:04,845 --> 00:47:07,275
It's made of organic cotton, so the texture is very soft.

686
00:47:08,315 --> 00:47:10,745
It does look soft. Thank you so much.

687
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:11,915
Okay.

688
00:47:13,075 --> 00:47:14,115
Goodnight.

689
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,445
Okay. Goodnight.

690
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:23,715
You didn't forget to keep the door locked, did you?

691
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:25,945
Why do you keep telling me to lock the door?

692
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:27,715
You should be the one to stop visiting me.

693
00:47:27,815 --> 00:47:29,315
Why are you getting annoyed?

694
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:30,915
It's always safe to be careful.

695
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:32,415
Why are you here again?

696
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:36,515
I brought you pajama pants. I thought you might need them.

697
00:47:37,815 --> 00:47:39,675
Was this made by an Italian master artisan?

698
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,945
Bingo. How did you know that?

699
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:44,115
You have good eyes.

700
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:48,975
You must be tired. Go to sleep.

701
00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:00,675
My gosh, you startled me.

702
00:48:02,745 --> 00:48:04,115
I thought you might need this.

703
00:48:05,915 --> 00:48:07,645
Are they competing against each other?

704
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:08,745
What's their problem?

705
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:15,045
My goodness.

706
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,675
Mr. Han, why are you doing this?

707
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,175
Mr. Han.

708
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:20,615
- Mr. Han. - What?

709
00:48:22,975 --> 00:48:24,545
Gosh, what's wrong with...

710
00:48:25,115 --> 00:48:26,415
What did I do?

711
00:48:26,515 --> 00:48:28,575
I really can't trust you.

712
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:30,675
I want you to sleep here with me tonight.

713
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,345
What?

714
00:48:32,575 --> 00:48:35,675
Are you asking me to sleep in the same bed?

715
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:38,975
Seol can't take a full rest because of you.

716
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:41,915
Because of me? Are you sure it's not because of you?

717
00:48:42,575 --> 00:48:43,615
Anyway,

718
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:45,975
while she's staying here,

719
00:48:46,245 --> 00:48:48,745
any kind of independent action after sunset will not be permitted.

720
00:48:49,215 --> 00:48:50,715
You better keep that in mind.

721
00:48:52,545 --> 00:48:53,745
What is this?

722
00:48:54,745 --> 00:48:56,545
Must you take it this far?

723
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,215
Yes, I must.

724
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:05,215
I'm a ghost. What can I possibly do?

725
00:49:06,115 --> 00:49:07,815
From what I know,

726
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:11,445
you're a ghost who can pretty much do everything.

727
00:49:12,815 --> 00:49:14,215
Shut it and go to sleep.

728
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:22,945
You're really something.

729
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:27,875
Thanks to you, I've been eating all three meals. It's become a habit.

730
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,375
I'm so fulfilled.

731
00:50:20,615 --> 00:50:22,445
Happiness isn't anything grand.

732
00:50:23,015 --> 00:50:25,275
I felt so uneasy earlier because of both the terrorist...

733
00:50:25,545 --> 00:50:28,245
and the unexpected happening of having to suddenly live here.

734
00:50:29,315 --> 00:50:33,015
But right now, the only thing I can think of is that I'm really sleepy.

735
00:50:33,715 --> 00:50:36,515
Now that I think of it, sleeping is really important,

736
00:50:36,775 --> 00:50:38,515
although it seems like nothing.

737
00:50:40,445 --> 00:50:41,915
You guys are so simple-minded.

738
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:45,645
I can't believe you guys are talking about happiness over noodles.

739
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:49,875
What about you? When was the happiest moment for you?

740
00:50:50,275 --> 00:50:52,545
- Me? - I want to know too.

741
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,945
When was the happiest moment in your life?

742
00:51:01,745 --> 00:51:05,175
It was when I got a call that my novel won the rookie award.

743
00:51:06,645 --> 00:51:08,345
It sounded like a lie.

744
00:51:09,445 --> 00:51:12,745
My heart was filled up with excitement.

745
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:18,115
"I guess all my efforts are paying off now."

746
00:51:19,315 --> 00:51:21,975
"Someone must've recognized all the effort I've put in."

747
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:26,275
This is what you call happiness, right?

748
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:31,115
What a pity. If I knew you back then, I would've congratulated you.

749
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:35,075
I know it's too late, but congratulations, Mr. Han.

750
00:51:38,115 --> 00:51:40,445
Hey, you. The ghost who's been living for 80 years.

751
00:51:41,345 --> 00:51:43,075
When was your happiest moment?

752
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:47,115
Or will you feel the happiest when your soul rests in peace?

753
00:51:48,915 --> 00:51:49,945
Mine...

754
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,075
is right now.

755
00:51:54,915 --> 00:51:57,445
- Right now? - Yes, right now.

756
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,745
The moment where the three of us have gathered together again.

757
00:52:03,945 --> 00:52:06,975
We don't have to worry about what might happen tomorrow.

758
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:11,875
We also don't have to worry about our country's independence.

759
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:14,845
This moment right now is as light as a feather.

760
00:52:17,775 --> 00:52:22,175
This moment where we don't have to feel guilty about enjoying...

761
00:52:23,215 --> 00:52:24,615
a bowl of noodles.

762
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:34,575
Even now, when I close my eyes, I can clearly remember my friends,

763
00:52:35,115 --> 00:52:36,575
whom I miss very much.

764
00:52:38,145 --> 00:52:40,675
I can remember the faces of my friends...

765
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:44,245
who had to smile for each other...

766
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:48,375
while hiding their fear and anxiety.

767
00:52:50,175 --> 00:52:51,445
The big day...

768
00:52:52,815 --> 00:52:54,175
is almost here.

769
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:58,445
It's time to show our thoughts through our actions.

770
00:52:59,215 --> 00:53:01,615
On behalf of our leader who couldn't join us here today,

771
00:53:02,415 --> 00:53:03,775
I will deliver his message to all of you.

772
00:53:10,445 --> 00:53:13,545
"The pain and anger you've felt for Joseon as a colony..."

773
00:53:14,215 --> 00:53:17,345
"will be a stepping stone to change this country's reality."

774
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:20,545
"The tears and blood you've shed..."

775
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:24,245
"will be a foundation for this country's future."

776
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:27,515
"The power that drives you to take action until the very end..."

777
00:53:28,145 --> 00:53:32,075
"derives from the love you have for this country, Joseon."

778
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:34,815
"It is for our parents, brothers,"

779
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:37,345
"children,"

780
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:39,445
"precious friends, lovers,"

781
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:41,775
"and all of you who are in this together."

782
00:53:44,245 --> 00:53:47,075
"We are doing this out of love and compassion for the country..."

783
00:53:47,275 --> 00:53:48,715
"that our loved ones will be living in."

784
00:53:50,315 --> 00:53:52,875
The fighting spirit and anger flame up easily,

785
00:53:52,945 --> 00:53:55,375
but they also easily die out when faced with reality.

786
00:53:55,715 --> 00:53:59,075
Idealism and passion are noble, but they also fade very easily.

787
00:53:59,675 --> 00:54:02,445
However, the desire for my loved ones to be happy...

788
00:54:03,215 --> 00:54:04,445
can never change.

789
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:07,615
I wish for a world where our kids don't have to starve.

790
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:10,115
A world where they can smile and run around freely.

791
00:54:10,745 --> 00:54:14,215
A world where there is no persecution and discrimination.

792
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:18,075
My Joseon Youth Alliance friends, let us never give up.

793
00:54:18,445 --> 00:54:23,015
"Let us greet the day when Joseon gets liberated!"

794
00:54:23,445 --> 00:54:25,415
- Let us greet that day! - Let us greet that day!

795
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:29,875
- We can do it! - We can do it!

796
00:54:35,345 --> 00:54:36,875
- Let us greet that day! - That's right.

797
00:54:47,415 --> 00:54:49,875
- Cheers! - Cheers!

798
00:54:50,715 --> 00:54:53,015
- Please give me more. - Here you go.

799
00:54:56,128 --> 00:54:58,328
- Here. Enjoy. - My gosh.

800
00:55:02,509 --> 00:55:04,075
Thank you.

801
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,775
Everyone, listen up.

802
00:55:08,145 --> 00:55:10,275
Don't just fill yourselves with alcohol.

803
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,245
Make sure you eat some food.

804
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:15,245
You might get sick tomorrow and ruin everything.

805
00:55:15,675 --> 00:55:17,445
She's right.

806
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:20,615
- Don't get too drunk. - Okay.

807
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:22,775
Now that everyone's here together,

808
00:55:23,575 --> 00:55:25,745
let's take turns and talk about...

809
00:55:25,975 --> 00:55:28,215
what we'd like to do once our country gets liberated.

810
00:55:30,445 --> 00:55:31,445
To be honest,

811
00:55:32,975 --> 00:55:34,445
I haven't planned anything grand.

812
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:37,215
I just want to retrieve my stolen rice paddy...

813
00:55:37,445 --> 00:55:40,445
and live peacefully in the countryside with my mother.

814
00:55:40,845 --> 00:55:41,915
That's all.

815
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:47,975
My son wants to become a police officer.

816
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:51,315
My dream is to see him become a police officer of Joseon, not Japan.

817
00:55:52,045 --> 00:55:53,715
- That's great. - Applause.

818
00:55:53,775 --> 00:55:56,075
My goal is to meet...

819
00:55:56,645 --> 00:56:00,445
my first love and start dating her.

820
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:05,015
Wait a minute.

821
00:56:05,315 --> 00:56:07,375
We should hear what Su Hyeon has in mind.

822
00:56:08,275 --> 00:56:09,315
Me?

823
00:56:09,615 --> 00:56:13,645
Yes. What would you like to do once Joseon gets liberated?

824
00:56:15,445 --> 00:56:16,515
I don't know.

825
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:19,775
I haven't thought about it much.

826
00:56:23,315 --> 00:56:26,345
But where's Mr. Jo?

827
00:56:27,615 --> 00:56:30,375
His wife is giving birth today.

828
00:56:30,915 --> 00:56:35,375
My goodness. I guess it's his way of showing patriotism.

829
00:56:36,745 --> 00:56:38,015
But what should we do?

830
00:56:38,215 --> 00:56:40,445
No one knows the way as well as Mr. Jo.

831
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:42,415
We'll have to find someone else to guide the way.

832
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:43,975
We can't ask him to come...

833
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:46,575
when his baby is just born.

834
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:54,415
I'm sorry for being late.

835
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:58,715
I heard your wife is giving birth. How did you get here?

836
00:56:58,775 --> 00:57:01,615
She safely delivered our baby a while ago.

837
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,515
- It's a girl. She's beautiful. - It's a girl.

838
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:16,075
Look at him. He must've run all the way here to boast.

839
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:19,545
Now that I have a child,

840
00:57:20,115 --> 00:57:22,015
I really couldn't stay still and do nothing.

841
00:57:23,075 --> 00:57:25,715
I should help this country get liberated as soon as possible...

842
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:27,945
for the sake of my child.

843
00:57:34,815 --> 00:57:37,345
I'll prescribe some medicinal herbs for your wife.

844
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,775
You should go to my cousin's pharmacy.

845
00:57:40,445 --> 00:57:43,715
He'll give you what you need if you tell him that I sent you.

846
00:57:46,575 --> 00:57:47,675
Thank you.

847
00:57:49,975 --> 00:57:51,075
Cheers.

848
00:57:51,575 --> 00:57:52,645
Here.

849
00:58:12,045 --> 00:58:13,845
Why the long face?

850
00:58:15,515 --> 00:58:18,815
But then again, you always had that face before an important day.

851
00:58:20,645 --> 00:58:23,145
I think about this every time before a mission.

852
00:58:23,975 --> 00:58:25,715
"How many of those men out there..."

853
00:58:27,145 --> 00:58:29,275
"will survive in the end?"

854
00:58:31,115 --> 00:58:32,215
It hurts to say this,

855
00:58:33,615 --> 00:58:35,315
but sacrifice is inevitable.

856
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:39,175
I'm always responsible for putting them in danger.

857
00:58:39,445 --> 00:58:41,715
I make those naive people...

858
00:58:42,745 --> 00:58:44,145
hold guns in their hands.

859
00:58:44,615 --> 00:58:47,015
They even sacrifice their lives at times.

860
00:58:49,115 --> 00:58:50,975
I wonder what I'm doing.

861
00:58:54,575 --> 00:58:57,145
I sometimes hate who I am.

862
00:58:58,045 --> 00:58:59,215
What are you talking about?

863
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:01,515
If it wasn't for you, Joseon Youth Alliance wouldn't even exist.

864
00:59:02,345 --> 00:59:03,415
This time,

865
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:06,875
even you could be in grave danger.

866
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:11,445
Heo Young Min set up a trap because of me.

867
00:59:11,545 --> 00:59:13,845
He's obsessed with finding the leader.

868
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:18,075
You're probably on the top of his list of suspects.

869
00:59:18,275 --> 00:59:19,845
So if anything happens,

870
00:59:22,175 --> 00:59:24,175
take Su Hyeon and go to Manchuria.

871
00:59:26,315 --> 00:59:28,815
I understand what you're worried about.

872
00:59:33,775 --> 00:59:35,415
But right now, you're at Carpe Diem.

873
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:37,445
Just enjoy this moment.

874
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:39,745
Can't you hear the music?

875
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:43,945
Oh, right.

876
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:46,145
What about you?

877
00:59:47,175 --> 00:59:48,745
What do you want to do...

878
00:59:49,845 --> 00:59:51,075
once Joseon gets liberated?

879
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:53,145
I don't know.

880
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:57,575
Shall we go fishing?

881
00:59:59,515 --> 01:00:00,675
Then what if...

882
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:04,015
you were born again after Joseon got liberated?

883
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:06,615
What would you like to be?

884
01:00:35,575 --> 01:00:38,045
I just wanted to get some air.

885
01:00:39,275 --> 01:00:41,275
Then come inside after you get some air.

886
01:00:43,115 --> 01:00:44,445
It's okay.

887
01:00:45,615 --> 01:00:47,245
You don't need to avoid me anymore.

888
01:00:49,115 --> 01:00:51,375
I've settled my feelings now.

889
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:55,145
If I were Mae Hyang, the best kisaeng of Myeongwolgwan,

890
01:00:55,145 --> 01:00:56,975
I would've given it a shot.

891
01:00:59,975 --> 01:01:02,345
But I can't risk our country's independence.

892
01:01:06,045 --> 01:01:08,175
But in our next life,

893
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:13,015
if we get to be born in Joseon again after it gets liberated,

894
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:16,375
promise me...

895
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:20,015
that you'll think of me as a woman.

896
01:01:25,745 --> 01:01:27,745
Don't hesitate.

897
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:31,145
Don't reject me completely.

898
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:34,245
Don't lie.

899
01:01:35,345 --> 01:01:37,015
Don't endure pain all by yourself.

900
01:01:38,275 --> 01:01:39,975
I want you to be honest...

901
01:01:40,745 --> 01:01:42,245
and tell me everything.

902
01:01:46,445 --> 01:01:49,345
Promise me that you'll do everything you couldn't do in this life.

903
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,515
Why do you keep talking about the next life?

904
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,215
Hurry up and promise me.

905
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:04,975
Then I want you to promise me something.

906
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:10,975
Make sure you come back alive.

907
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:15,775
It's an order.

908
01:03:50,275 --> 01:03:53,015
(Chicago Typewriter)

909
01:03:53,815 --> 01:03:56,315
Shall I start the morning of a successful mania?

910
01:03:56,675 --> 01:03:58,175
If you're reminded of something you have to do,

911
01:03:58,575 --> 01:03:59,745
do it now.

912
01:03:59,945 --> 01:04:02,315
If I were to be born in Joseon after it gets liberated,

913
01:04:02,745 --> 01:04:06,015
I wish I'll be with you guys again.

914
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,345
He's not a nice ghost.

915
01:04:08,415 --> 01:04:10,045
He's going to perish soon?

916
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:14,715
Seol is going to die because of you.

917
01:04:14,715 --> 01:04:16,845
Where is she, you jerk?

918
01:04:18,245 --> 01:04:19,515
What are you doing?

919
01:04:20,175 --> 01:04:21,175
Let go of me!
