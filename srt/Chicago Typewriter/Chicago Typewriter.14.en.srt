(Episode 14)

2
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,001
In the next life,

3
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:40,831
give her up.

4
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:54,207
Hey, Yul.

5
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:56,447
What are you doing here alone?

6
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,247
Everyone wants you to join them.

7
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:03,507
Come on. Let's go.

8
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:09,747
Look. Over there.

9
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,547
What if you were born again after Joseon got liberated?

10
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:26,047
What would you like to be?

11
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:33,977
If I were to be born again after Joseon gets liberated,

12
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:36,207
then...

13
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:38,577
Then...

14
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:40,907
Then...

15
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:43,407
Even then,

16
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:46,877
I hope I will be beside you...

17
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:49,007
and everyone else here.

(Chicago Typewriter)

19
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,747
Bang Jin, please close the curtains.

20
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:38,677
Shall I start the morning of a successful mania?

21
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:44,507
I said I'll do it by myself. You can go back inside.

22
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:48,177
I get that you're trying to earn brownie points from Seol.

23
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:51,607
Human beings can serve food for ghosts for ancestral rites,

24
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:54,877
but no ghost has ever prepared breakfast for a human being.

25
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:56,677
You're the one who should go inside.

26
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,877
Don't underestimate me. The first place I arrived as a ghost...

27
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,207
was a historic restaurant in Europe.

28
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:05,207
I learned a lot by watching the chef cook.

29
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:08,107
I guess that chef never shut his mouth while he cooked.

30
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:12,307
I've collected a lot of data about cooking for a long period of time.

31
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,877
My cooking skills are as good as a chef's.

32
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:17,877
Then I guess we could let Seol choose today's menu for breakfast.

33
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:19,777
What are you guys doing?

34
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:21,477
Did you sleep well?

35
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:22,877
You're awake.

36
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:25,507
We're preparing breakfast.

37
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,147
Did you guys always cook breakfast for yourselves?

38
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,647
Of course, we didn't. I told the workers to take a few days off.

39
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,177
Are you going to cook everything here for breakfast?

40
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:40,477
Didn't you guys eat noodles with me last night?

41
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:42,777
That's already been digested.

42
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:44,177
Shouldn't you guys stay in shape?

43
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:46,107
Men also take care of their figures these days.

44
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,107
I heard that they do.

45
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:52,447
But I was born with a great figure, so I never really felt the need to.

46
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,207
You were doing pushups like crazy earlier.

47
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:56,647
I think you did about 200 pushups.

48
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,477
So what's for breakfast?

49
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:28,547
Gyun Woo, here's your breakfast.

50
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,547
I cooked this just for you.

51
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:33,707
If you're reminded of something you have to do,

52
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:35,207
do it now.

53
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:37,447
Let's take a bath.

54
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,347
That's a good boy.

55
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:44,207
How cute.

56
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:45,977
I'll do it.

57
00:04:46,277 --> 00:04:48,147
The sky may be clear today,

58
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,977
but it might be cloudy tomorrow.

59
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:52,477
Hurry up and get him.

60
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:53,977
Gyun Woo.

61
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:55,377
Hey!

62
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:01,407
Yesterday is no longer yours.

63
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:03,017
So do it now.

64
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:05,107
Gyun Woo.

65
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:08,477
Hey, Gyun Woo!

66
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:10,107
Good boy.

67
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,047
You look good.

68
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,347
- Good boy. - Come here.

69
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:20,647
You're so cute.

70
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:26,647
Good boy.

71
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:35,007
Good boy. You're so handsome. That's a good boy.

72
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,347
My goodness.

73
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,447
Good boy.

74
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,607
That's a good boy.

75
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,347
Good boy.

76
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:56,207
If you wish to say something kind,

77
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:58,007
say it now.

78
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:02,407
- There might not be a tomorrow. - Come here.

79
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:06,847
The person you love...

80
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:09,807
won't always be next to you.

81
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:34,777
If you wish to show affection,

82
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:36,477
show it now.

83
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,377
If you wish to smile,

84
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,177
smile right now.

85
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:55,847
Do it...

86
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:57,607
right now.

87
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:02,477
Do it...

88
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:04,607
before your friend disappears.

(Han Se Ju, Yoo Jin Oh, Jeon Seol)

96
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:20,277
Here.

97
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:26,077
Okay. Now that we've signed the contract,

98
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:29,207
shall we begin writing our novel?

99
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,377
First, let's start with sharing your stories...

100
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:35,477
of what you've experienced in your past life.

101
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:39,707
I'm sure there was a secret agent in our organization.

102
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:43,447
Shin Yul meeting Heo Young Min was all part of the plan,

103
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:46,507
so that confirms that you weren't the secret agent.

104
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:50,547
Then who in world was the secret agent?

105
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:58,207
It could be...

106
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:00,647
someone I know.

107
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,277
Someone you know?

108
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:04,347
Who could that be?

109
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:07,207
My mom.

110
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,577
What are you talking about?

111
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:12,747
Why would your mom do that?

112
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:18,477
To be honest, she recently came over and told me...

113
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:22,347
that she also remembers her past life.

114
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:26,207
She told me that I was part of that memory.

115
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:30,947
And back when I experienced my past life,

116
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:33,307
I saw my mom's face.

117
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,507
Who was she?

118
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,207
She was the manager of Carpe Diem.

119
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:46,347
Madam Sophia?

120
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:00,307
Why aren't you keeping your promise?

121
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:03,207
You promised to get my son out of prison if I gave you information.

122
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:07,007
He killed a Japanese policeman.

123
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:09,177
Did you think you could save a murderer...

124
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:11,747
with such useless information?

125
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:15,807
All I know is the date and place of the mission.

126
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:18,447
I need to know who the leader is.

127
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:19,947
I told you that I don't know.

128
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:21,777
I'm nothing but a manager.

129
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:23,677
I've never even seen the leader's shadow.

130
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:27,547
That's why I'm asking you to do your best and find out who he is.

131
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:30,377
I can't keep doing this.

132
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:33,047
If I continue, I'll get caught.

133
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,277
If you get me the leader,

134
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:37,907
not only will I get your son out of prison,

135
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,647
but I'll also help you both escape to a safe place.

136
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:43,617
From what I know, anyone who betrays the organization...

137
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,747
will end up getting severely punished.

138
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,547
There's also...

139
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:51,707
one more thing I'd like you to do.

140
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:55,477
Mom clearly said it.

141
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:57,647
She said she left me because she was afraid...

142
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:58,977
that the ill-fated relationship of the past life would repeat.

143
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:03,977
I went to see her to find out about that ill-fated relationship.

144
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:06,477
But she was already gone,

145
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:08,147
and I couldn't meet her.

146
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:10,607
How can this happen?

147
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:13,507
I've been thinking since then.

148
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,977
What was the ill-fated relationship she was referring to?

149
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:21,577
What was the past life event that shouldn't be repeated?

150
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:25,347
Then I remembered.

151
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:27,447
Remember what?

152
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:31,507
How the ill-fated relationship with Mom began.

153
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:38,507
I was convinced that Mom was the secret agent.

154
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,947
Also,

155
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:45,377
I figured out how I got involved in that mission.

156
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:48,177
Who did you say asked for me?

157
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,747
Heo Young Min. He's the son of Mr. Nam, the writer.

158
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,877
Why would he ask for me?

159
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,207
Am I a kisaeng or something?

160
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:59,407
He wants to invite you to sing at the charity party...

161
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:01,207
for high officials.

162
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:07,307
I heard another singer was hired for that event.

163
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:09,677
She was rushed into a hospital due to acute indigestion.

164
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:13,277
That's why he wants to invite you.

165
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:16,477
And he won't take no for an answer.

166
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,277
I don't want to go.

167
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,277
Tell him I was rushed into the hospital as well.

168
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:30,747
Do you think the high officials will care about your condition?

169
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:33,407
If you lose their favor,

170
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:36,207
Carpe Diem will also be marked.

171
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,007
A guest singer? What kind of nonsense is that?

172
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:42,107
At that time, you have to guard our comrades at Hwanggeumjeong.

173
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:43,147
You forgot?

174
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,277
But Madam Sophia has a point.

175
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,307
It's a party for high officials. So if I keep refusing to attend,

176
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,877
he might start suspecting me.

177
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:53,777
You can't go. Refuse it no matter what.

178
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:56,177
It might affect our whole plan for today.

179
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:57,577
Besides,

180
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:00,507
it seems like he's interested in you too.

181
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:01,647
It doesn't feel right.

182
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:04,907
I think...

183
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:06,877
he threw a bait.

184
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,377
It might even be a trap.

185
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:10,477
Wouldn't it be better for me to go...

186
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:13,547
than to create suspicion before an important mission?

187
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:15,777
It makes a good alibi.

188
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:17,577
If things ever go wrong,

189
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,207
I might be able to help.

190
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:20,677
Didn't you hear me?

191
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,447
What are you doing, Boss? You should stop her.

192
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:26,947
Su Hyeon.

193
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,977
Are you confident that you won't be busted?

194
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:33,147
- Boss. - Of course.

195
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,207
Contact Mr. Nam immediately.

196
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:43,647
Tell him to fill in for Su Hyeon and guard at Hwanggeumjeong.

197
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:46,047
- Boss. - Starting right now,

198
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,477
we will change our plan.

199
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:50,547
Change the plan?

200
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,207
How did I change the plan?

201
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,347
I don't know. That's all I remember.

202
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:58,007
Is this a TV drama?

203
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,507
Why do you keep cutting it?

204
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:01,377
Can't I watch the full episode at once?

205
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:03,647
I think...

206
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:05,507
it's your turn next.

207
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,007
But I don't remember it at all.

208
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:13,977
Well, if I were to make use of my brain...

209
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:17,147
I think Su Hyeon...

210
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:18,777
brought about the change of the plan.

211
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,207
But what could it be?

212
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:27,747
Mr. Han, I have something urgent to tell you.

213
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,147
Hide the contract.

214
00:14:31,477 --> 00:14:32,647
Come in.

215
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:38,407
I didn't know you two were together.

216
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,147
It doesn't matter.

217
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:41,907
You can go on.

218
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:45,507
Mr. Son dropped another bomb.

219
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:49,747
Does he think he is an independent fighter or what?

220
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:50,877
Why does he keep dropping bombs?

221
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,207
So what is it this time?

222
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:57,377
I told you. I know nothing about it.

223
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:58,977
What do you mean it's plagiarized?

224
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:01,877
That's such a nonsense.

225
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:04,347
I don't know with what motive...

226
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:06,977
Mr. Han claimed such accusation,

227
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:11,547
but that is the work of Mr. Baek.

228
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,807
I have nothing more to say. So I will hang up now.

229
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,307
Han Se Ju.

230
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:35,877
You scum.

231
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:38,847
How dare you...

232
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,577
pay us back with grudge?

233
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:49,007
Well,

234
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:50,977
why are you speechless?

235
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,877
You said we could trust him.

236
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,347
You said we should trust him because he won't open his mouth.

237
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:57,677
Is this what I get for trusting him?

238
00:15:58,477 --> 00:16:02,207
You are his father. How could you let this happen?

239
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:04,777
Who said Se Ju is the source of the rumor?

240
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:06,107
Who else would it be?

241
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:07,877
You're still on his side.

242
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:09,647
How can you remain so indifferent?

243
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:11,647
Check who wrote that article.

244
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:14,307
It's Mr. Song, the person you trust wholeheartedly.

245
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,547
I told you!

246
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,577
Se Ju...

247
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:20,677
I told you we should get rid of Se Ju because he would...

248
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:23,907
get in the way of Tae Min one day.

249
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:27,847
Even if Se Ju let it out first,

250
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:31,277
we have nothing to say.

251
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,947
You should...

252
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,677
persuade Tae Min.

253
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:38,677
It's going to be tough, but he should confess.

254
00:16:39,577 --> 00:16:41,447
That's the only way he can survive.

255
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,807
Is that the only way you can think of with your smart brain?

256
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:47,207
You are his father, and the only solution you thought of...

257
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:49,547
is to bury him alive. Is that it?

258
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:51,977
It won't bury him. It will revive him.

259
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:55,207
He should admit his faults and reflect on himself.

260
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:58,377
Only then he will be able to put everything behind and move forward.

261
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,077
If Tae Min doesn't do it, I will...

262
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:03,207
If you do that,

263
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,747
I won't...

264
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:08,947
forgive you.

265
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:13,407
We're being flooded with requests for fact verification.

266
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:15,447
How should I respond to this, sir?

267
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:17,777
Hold off the official statement.

268
00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:19,547
Tell them to wait until we hear from both writers and...

269
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,317
release an official statement.

270
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:22,747
And contact the public relations team.

271
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:24,847
Tell them to write the first draft of Golden Bear's official statement.

272
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,077
Tell them to send it to my email.

273
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:27,177
Okay, sir.

274
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:28,907
Goodness.

275
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:31,047
For 10 long years,

276
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:34,107
how could he not show it for even once?

277
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:35,817
What a brat.

278
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:38,207
He's such an idiot.

279
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,077
What are you doing?

280
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:44,547
Did you see this?

281
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,347
No way. Is this real?

282
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:48,277
Baek Tae Min is ruined.

283
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:49,447
What will he do?

284
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:51,317
He won't be making any money anymore.

285
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:57,977
How brazen can he be?

286
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,177
His face must be made of steel. Don't you think?

287
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:01,547
He's a general material.

288
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:04,277
He plagiarized the whole thing.

289
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:05,677
He doesn't deserve to be a professor of literature.

290
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,547
How can he manage to eat?

291
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:09,707
Let's go.

292
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,207
He's here.

293
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:23,877
- Mr. Baek. - Mr. Baek.

294
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:26,407
Is it true that Mr. Han is the original writer of "Fate"?

295
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:30,077
Can you explain to us how Mr. Han is your ghost writer?

296
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:32,977
Is there another work of yours written by Mr. Han?

297
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:35,107
- How do you feel right now? - Please tell us something.

298
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:37,177
- How do you feel? - Answer us, please.

299
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:43,877
I wondered why your mother was so rude to Se Ju.

300
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:45,317
Now I get it.

301
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:48,207
I never knew there was such a crazy story behind it all.

302
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,977
I knew Se Ju was going to hate it.

303
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,977
But I signed with you nonetheless.

304
00:18:55,977 --> 00:18:57,107
Do you know why?

305
00:18:58,377 --> 00:18:59,947
It's because of "Fate".

306
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:03,477
I was mesmerized by "Fate". That's why I wanted you.

307
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,777
I did something very wrong to Se Ju.

308
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:08,547
Shouldn't you give me a chance to explain?

309
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,507
No. You can go elsewhere to give your excuses.

310
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:17,347
If I stay longer, I might do something wrong.

311
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:18,407
I will go now.

312
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,077
Of course, our contract is canceled.

313
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:27,947
And tell this to your mother.

314
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,647
If she bothers Se Ju again,

315
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:32,377
then I...

316
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:34,907
won't stand it anymore.

317
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,547
It's useless now.

318
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:51,207
I didn't intend to publish it anyway.

319
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:55,007
You made me helpless.

320
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:57,277
And stabbed me in the back.

321
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:00,447
You jerk.

322
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:10,817
Why did you want to see me again?

323
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,407
The world has turned because of "Fate".

324
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,777
Do you still want to...

325
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:18,877
take your revenge on Se Ju?

326
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,407
Why? Are you going to join me?

327
00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:24,347
You must've come to your senses...

328
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:26,207
after getting attacked by Se Ju.

329
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:27,847
It's not that.

330
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:30,147
You are the one who should come to your senses.

331
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:32,407
What do you mean?

332
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:35,447
Your threat is no longer effective.

333
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:37,207
But...

334
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,507
what I have in my hand...

335
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,277
is still effective.

336
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,547
In other words,

337
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,947
I'm holding onto your leash.

338
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,677
What is it that you want from me?

339
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:54,207
You will join my plan from now on.

340
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:56,817
It won't do you any damage.

341
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:01,547
If you join me, you will be able to take your revenge.

342
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:03,817
If you do well,

343
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:06,577
I will give enough money for you to escape to another country.

344
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:08,817
How does it sound?

345
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:12,377
Isn't it a good deal?

346
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:15,477
Why did you do something I didn't ask for?

347
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:19,147
He must pay for his wrongdoing.

348
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:22,817
I told you that I want to give him another chance.

349
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:26,977
I wouldn't have done this if he showed any signs of regret.

350
00:21:27,477 --> 00:21:29,947
I told him that I will never reveal it to the public.

351
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:32,207
That's why I stepped in.

352
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,047
He needs to be punished.

353
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,477
It isn't only Tae Min who will fall into the bottomless pit.

354
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:40,107
Even Mr. Baek will.

355
00:21:40,317 --> 00:21:42,507
Looking on someone doing something wrong...

356
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:45,507
also isn't forgivable.

357
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:49,677
If the past is put behind without a proper apology,

358
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:52,807
neither the people nor the world will change.

359
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:55,447
I will be the judge of that.

360
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:57,747
It's none of your business.

361
00:21:58,377 --> 00:22:01,777
Why would you act without my consent and complicate things?

362
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:03,277
Who are you to do that?

363
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,777
You and Seol's mother are the same.

364
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:08,877
Why would you drag on the ill-fated relationship of the past life?

365
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:13,947
Why can't we just live the current life as it is?

366
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:16,447
- Mr. Han. - Do not meddle with my life.

367
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:19,877
You are a ghost, so act like one.

368
00:22:58,307 --> 00:22:59,307
Hey.

369
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:01,777
Stop it if you're here to tell me to reconcile with him.

370
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:03,177
I'm not here for that.

371
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:07,007
I've come to confess something.

372
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:10,507
It's such a random timing for a confession.

373
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:13,147
Thinking back,

374
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,177
I realized that I had quite a big crush on Tae Min.

375
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:19,577
- What? - How could I not?

376
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,907
He wrote an amazing debut work called "Fate".

377
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:26,777
But it turns out the original writer is Mr. Han Se Ju.

378
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,907
How can he get more charming as I get to know him?

379
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,877
It's almost like a Mobius strip.

380
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,677
I can't get away from you.

381
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:43,277
Good job...

382
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:47,877
in hiding everything and trying to keep it in.

383
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:52,847
You must've felt so bad after losing your work to another man.

384
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:56,207
Both Hui Young and Se Ju...

385
00:23:56,377 --> 00:23:59,407
have so many secrets.

386
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:02,507
Tell me everything from now on.

387
00:24:03,047 --> 00:24:05,007
Remember what you promised me in the past life?

388
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:10,677
You promised me not to torture yourself and to express yourself.

389
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:13,607
How much more can I express myself?

390
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:17,307
- Should I cry? - You can cry if you want.

391
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:18,607
What if I cry?

392
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:21,177
Will you hug me?

393
00:24:23,447 --> 00:24:24,547
Throw yourself.

394
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:39,447
By the way, your number one fan deserves to be treated better.

395
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:43,847
Without Jin Oh, I would've been mistaken all along.

396
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:48,677
In that sense, I'm glad that the truth got revealed.

397
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:53,407
Don't try to make me reconcile with him.

398
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:57,577
Clearly, he should be the one to apologize.

399
00:24:58,847 --> 00:24:59,907
Why are you so immature?

400
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,677
Hey, Jin Oh.

401
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:13,877
If you're here to tell me to reconcile with him, stop it.

402
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:16,107
I'm not here to do that.

403
00:25:16,707 --> 00:25:19,077
Honestly, Mr. Han was out of line.

404
00:25:19,077 --> 00:25:20,577
He was being unreasonable.

405
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:22,877
He almost killed you with his words.

406
00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:24,777
What's gotten into you?

407
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:27,547
I thought you'd side with Mr. Han.

408
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:30,977
But you were right. The truth must be known.

409
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:33,847
Does it make sense to bury such an important fact?

410
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:37,277
I'm sure he didn't want to hurt...

411
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:39,347
someone who was once very close to him,

412
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:41,647
even if he himself was very hurt.

413
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:47,207
Even so, it's not like you did something wrong.

414
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:51,077
You did what was only right. Mr. Han shouldn't have been that angry.

415
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,447
But I did that without discussing it with...

416
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:57,377
You did it for his sake, but he didn't appreciate your good faith.

417
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,707
Good faith doesn't always end with a good result.

418
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:04,877
You are such a generous person.

419
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:08,707
There's a petty man in the writing room...

420
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:11,207
who can't apologize because of his pride.

421
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:15,207
- Perhaps you should try to... - No.

422
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:25,507
I'm sorry, but I need him...

423
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,347
to apologize to me first.

424
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,207
Why are you so immature?

425
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:40,607
How can we write a novel together like this?

426
00:26:40,847 --> 00:26:44,847
You have to look at each other and talk to write a novel together.

427
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:47,677
Never mind. Are we lovers? Why would we look at each other?

428
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:51,047
See? This is why I don't want to apologize to him.

429
00:26:53,507 --> 00:26:56,107
If we are not going to write the novel, I'm going home.

430
00:26:56,677 --> 00:26:57,947
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

431
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:03,707
Then will you reconcile with each other?

432
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:10,507
Are you going to make up with each other or not?

433
00:27:11,177 --> 00:27:12,277
I'm leaving now.

434
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:13,677
- We will. - We will do it.

435
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:19,207
Then shake hands and reconcile with each other.

436
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,577
And you two should talk casually to each other from now on.

437
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:41,947
You've been friends for over 80 years.

438
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:44,447
It doesn't make sense that only one of you talks informally.

439
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:46,977
- Right? It's strange, right? - Yes.

440
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:49,877
What's strange about it? I feed him, dress him...

441
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:51,607
Well, I don't dress him.

442
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,507
I offer free accommodation and work.

443
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,807
Of course he should talk to me as he would talk to his boss.

444
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:57,807
Better yet, he should be serving me like his master.

445
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:00,207
But I beg to differ, my dear friend.

446
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:02,407
- Do you want to die? - I'm already dead though.

447
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,707
Talk to me with respect. How dare you!

448
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:07,107
- Do you want me to prove my age? - Do you have any way to prove it?

449
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:09,707
I could prove it with my passport or a driver's license.

450
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:12,747
- Do you even have those? - Stop it already.

451
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:22,177
Did you drink all of this by yourself?

452
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,807
You should have a good time with Se Ju.

453
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:28,007
Why did you come here?

454
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,207
Your mom called me in the morning.

455
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:34,747
She said her only daughter is about to die because of a ghost.

456
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:36,647
I wish I could just die.

457
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:40,647
Then I would be able to date him in the other world.

458
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:48,307
Stop talking nonsense and try to sober up.

459
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:51,347
I don't want to sober up. When I'm myself,

460
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:55,507
I miss him too much.

461
00:28:55,977 --> 00:28:57,977
Then go see him. I brought him here.

462
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:01,907
You brought him? Who?

463
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,547
I came with Jin Oh.

464
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:05,047
Really?

465
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,407
Did you really come with him?

466
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,677
Did he come to see me?

467
00:29:11,107 --> 00:29:12,507
Of course he did.

468
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,977
You didn't move at all when I told you to get up.

469
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:23,647
Drink this if you're going out.

470
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:25,347
Okay.

471
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:34,277
I'm sober now.

472
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:40,207
Goodness.

473
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:45,607
I got dark circles! Gosh.

474
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:05,007
I'll buy you another one. I'll buy you another one. Okay?

475
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:10,047
- I'll buy you another one. Come on. - Mom.

476
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:12,047
- I'll buy you another one. - Mom.

477
00:30:12,707 --> 00:30:14,147
- Let's go. - Mom.

478
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,077
- Mommy will buy you another one. - Mom.

479
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:17,177
- Okay? Let's go. - Mom.

480
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:29,707
What happened?

481
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:32,177
I got it!

482
00:30:33,107 --> 00:30:34,377
That's amazing.

483
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:00,177
Bang Jin.

484
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,947
It looks like you've lost weight in the last couple of days.

485
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:07,447
It's all because of an irresponsible ghost...

486
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:10,107
who disappeared after saying sorry.

487
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,877
- I'm really sorry. - No.

488
00:31:15,277 --> 00:31:16,947
You didn't do anything wrong.

489
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:19,447
I'm the one who went ahead and fell for you.

490
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:22,077
I hope...

491
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:24,847
you don't get your heartbroken because of me.

492
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:27,577
I'm a ghost which means...

493
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:28,847
I can vanish anytime.

494
00:31:32,277 --> 00:31:33,347
I...

495
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:37,177
don't care even if you're a spirit.

496
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:39,447
I also don't care even if you're a ghost.

497
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:43,207
Oh, are they the same thing?

498
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:46,707
Anyway, I just like you.

499
00:31:48,147 --> 00:31:49,207
Thank you.

500
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:53,307
I'd like to ask you out on a date to thank you.

501
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:55,607
Will that be okay with you?

502
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:02,077
Gosh, why... Why are you crying?

503
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,577
Did I do something wrong again?

504
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:07,907
Please don't keep smiling like that.

505
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:10,447
It makes me keep falling for you.

506
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:13,947
I keep falling for you more.

507
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:50,647
Don't worry too much.

508
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:54,347
That ghost Bang Jin likes is pretty decent.

509
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,077
He'll make her feel better and send her home.

510
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:58,107
A nice ghost, my foot.

511
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:00,177
He'll vanish soon anyway.

512
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,947
What do you mean he'll vanish soon?

513
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:08,147
Why would a ghost stay in the worldly realm forever?

514
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,847
He should vanish when the time comes.

515
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:15,177
Anyway, I feel bad to see you so upset.

516
00:33:15,947 --> 00:33:18,447
Tell me. Does she have differently shaped eyes...

517
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:19,947
or triangular nostrils?

518
00:33:19,947 --> 00:33:22,777
Why would she want to date a ghost when she doesn't lack anything?

519
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,377
Gosh, she's so bullheaded.

520
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:28,777
I'd get it if she doesn't know, but she knows now.

521
00:33:28,777 --> 00:33:30,277
She should know how to give up.

522
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:32,707
That's not Bang Jin's fault. It's your fault.

523
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:36,877
- What did you say? - Because she takes after you,

524
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:39,207
she has a heart of gold.

525
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:42,677
She always has to help those who are in need of help.

526
00:33:42,677 --> 00:33:45,147
And when she opens up to someone, she stays loyal to that person.

527
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:49,407
Gosh, why does she take after me who's no good?

528
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:51,077
Why are you saying you're no good?

529
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:52,607
I think you're so lovely.

530
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:55,107
Stop teasing me, you wench.

531
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,807
- Hello? - Seol.

532
00:34:03,947 --> 00:34:06,077
This is Sang Mi, the part-timer at Riccardo.

533
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,907
Oh, Sang Mi.

534
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:11,217
Seol. I heard that you're a veterinarian, right?

535
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:13,007
What's wrong? Did something happen?

536
00:34:13,577 --> 00:34:17,577
Mimi has been in so much pain all night.

537
00:34:19,277 --> 00:34:20,947
Please save Mimi's life.

538
00:34:23,877 --> 00:34:25,377
Sang Mi, where are you now?

539
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:28,877
Yes, I know where it is. I'll see you in 30 minutes.

540
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:34,577
Are you going to stay silent hoping that it'd blow over?

541
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:37,107
It might blow up and hit you hard if you just leave it like this.

542
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:39,007
I know.

543
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,877
Tae Min's mom won't let it slide,

544
00:34:43,377 --> 00:34:46,807
and the media will pour out articles based on speculation.

545
00:34:47,107 --> 00:34:49,717
You know so well. And you still don't want to deal with the media?

546
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:51,877
I'm going to think of it as my fate as a popular author...

547
00:34:51,877 --> 00:34:53,407
and let it slide.

548
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:56,277
There were times when I thought I'd be willing to pay...

549
00:34:56,947 --> 00:34:59,977
a bigger price than this in order to become a famous author.

550
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:02,147
I should endure it.

551
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:06,147
Hey, stop maturing up.

552
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,777
You're starting to become no fun.

553
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:11,347
Anyway, you better get ready.

554
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:12,847
Reporters will swarm around here.

555
00:35:12,907 --> 00:35:16,077
It'll probably be worse than when the stalker committed suicide.

556
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,547
I know for a fact that it won't be easier.

557
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:20,107
The stalker...

558
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:23,217
It must've surprised you a lot.

559
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,947
I think my sister tipped off a reporter.

560
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:29,377
- Your sister? - I told her not to do it,

561
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:31,347
but I guess she was angry thinking that it's unfair.

562
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:35,007
Oh, I should get back inside.

563
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,007
Okay.

564
00:35:39,547 --> 00:35:40,607
What is it?

565
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,677
I was just thinking that she looks familiar for some reason.

566
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:49,077
Now I know...

567
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:52,107
whom she resembles.

568
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:55,107
What do you mean?

569
00:35:55,347 --> 00:35:56,577
Who resembles whom?

570
00:35:56,577 --> 00:35:59,047
Ji Seok, let me ask a favor of you.

571
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:01,217
What is it?

572
00:36:01,347 --> 00:36:02,807
Jo Sang Cheol.

573
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:05,777
I want to know where his sister is now and what she's up to.

574
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:07,077
Please find out.

575
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:08,677
Jo Sang Cheol...

576
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:12,217
Jo Sang Cheol is... He's that stalker, right?

577
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:13,777
Why are you asking about his sister?

578
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:16,307
There's something I'd like to check.

579
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,577
As soon as possible.

580
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:20,777
You made it.

581
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:22,907
My place isn't nice, but please come in.

582
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:34,277
Do you live alone?

583
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:36,647
Yes.

584
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:38,747
I had an older brother,

585
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:40,717
but he died this year.

586
00:36:42,177 --> 00:36:44,507
Gosh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you that question.

587
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,077
Don't worry. It's okay.

588
00:36:46,717 --> 00:36:48,277
I'm the one who should apologize.

589
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,507
I'm asking a big favor of you out of the blue.

590
00:36:52,447 --> 00:36:53,847
Now that my brother is dead,

591
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:55,907
Mimi is the only family...

592
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:58,177
I have left.

593
00:37:02,177 --> 00:37:03,447
Don't cry.

594
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,217
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

595
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:08,107
By the way, where's Mimi?

596
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:10,307
Over here.

597
00:37:14,217 --> 00:37:16,877
Mimi, you made me look like a liar.

598
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:18,907
Why did you act like you were sick?

599
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,447
That happens sometimes.

600
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:23,947
Even when we're really ill,

601
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:27,147
the pain can stop right in front of a hospital, you know.

602
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,547
Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.

603
00:37:30,907 --> 00:37:31,907
I should get going.

604
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:33,847
Wait, Seol.

605
00:37:35,507 --> 00:37:38,047
Stay for a drink since you came all the way here.

606
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,007
I'll feel bad if I just let you go like this.

607
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,747
Gosh, it's okay. I have to get going.

608
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:45,847
Give me a second. I'll go bring something to drink.

609
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,477
Do you like orange juice?

610
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:05,147
Thanks.

611
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:07,347
Drink it while it's still cold.

612
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,260
It's me.

613
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,760
What's happening with Seol?

614
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,830
She must've been tired. She fell asleep.

615
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,430
She's sleeping like a log.

616
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,100
What should I do now?

617
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,160
Stay with her and keep a watchful eye on her.

618
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,900
Do not let her go until I tell you to do so.

619
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,730
If you do that,

620
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,130
you'll get your hands on a big sum of money as I promised you.

621
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,760
You should let me in on the plan since we're in this together.

622
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,200
What in the world are you planning to do?

623
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,700
You thought we're in this together?

624
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,630
Don't be delusional.

625
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,560
I'm paying you.

626
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,860
You just need to do exactly as I say.

627
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,970
I have to go.

628
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,730
(Email has been sent.)

629
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,160
Hey, Seol. Why aren't you picking up?

630
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,900
This is the third message I'm leaving in your voice mail.

631
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,900
You're with that ghost right now, aren't you?

632
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,930
Everything is okay, right?

633
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,630
Call me as soon as you get this.

634
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,060
It's an order.

635
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,900
Hold on.

636
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,900
(Sungsoocheong)

637
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,430
(Wang Bang Wool Fairy)

638
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,100
Fairy...

639
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,730
Hello? This is the incredibly clairvoyant...

640
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,030
Hello, this is Han Se Ju.

641
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,970
Do you remember me?

642
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,360
My goodness. Of course.

643
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm calling because...

644
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,060
I can't get a hold of Seol at the moment.

645
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,500
Is she there now by any chance?

646
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,600
No, she isn't.

647
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,830
She did come by, but left after getting a phone call.

648
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,430
Why do you ask?

649
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,200
It's nothing.

650
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,130
If she comes back, please let her know that I'm waiting for her call.

651
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,660
Yes, thank you.

652
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:52,970
Hey, Seol.

653
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,130
I didn't want to believe it,

654
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,360
but can you not get a hold of Seol now by any chance?

655
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:00,970
How...

656
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,060
How do you know?

657
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,660
I sent you an email. Check that first.

658
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,560
This is...

659
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,660
What does this mean?

660
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,800
What do you want from me?

661
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,700
It's not like I'm calling you because I wanted to.

662
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,860
Hadn't Seol's life been on the line,

663
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,630
I wouldn't even have called you.

664
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,130
Whose life is on the line?

665
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,500
Jo Sang Mi.

666
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,030
Age 22.

667
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,860
You must already know since you've read the email,

668
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,700
but she's Jo Sang Cheol's sister.

669
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,800
Thanks to her brother who knew everything about you,

670
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,400
she also learned about the sad story...

671
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,500
behind the novel, "Fate".

672
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,360
She's been using it to blackmail me,

673
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,260
so I hired someone to dig up information on her.

674
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,730
Cut to the chase.

675
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,900
Thanks to you, "Fate"...

676
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,630
made it into the trending keywords list once again today.

677
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,260
That means Jo Sang Mi has lost her prey,

678
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,930
but she called me again to threaten me with something else.

679
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,900
Don't you understand the phrase, "Cut to the chase"?

680
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,130
She's holding Seol hostage.

681
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,330
I don't know what she thinks my relationship with Seol is,

682
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,470
but she threatened me.

683
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,200
She told me to bring money if I want Seol to be alive.

684
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,030
But I don't think it's something I should take care of.

685
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,900
Where are they now?

686
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,800
I don't know either.

687
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,760
But I'll forward you the address I received.

688
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,830
Try going there first.

689
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,300
You must know very well since it's your area of expertise,

690
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,730
but you should really try...

691
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,400
not to provoke the kidnapper.

692
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,030
If you want to protect Seol,

693
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,800
you should keep this confidential...

694
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,200
and go alone.

695
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,430
This is fun.

696
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,430
Mr. Han, I have an update for you.

697
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,330
We looked into finding out more about the motorcycle terrorists...

698
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,960
Do they have a connection with Jo Sang Mi?

699
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,530
How did you know...

700
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,160
Oh, we also tracked down those guys who damaged the clip...

701
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,160
By any chance,

702
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,630
is Tae Min affiliated with them?

703
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,530
How did you know that?

704
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,960
Anyway, the employee of the errand services who damaged the clip...

705
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,960
said that Jo Sang Mi has been blackmailing Mr. Baek.

706
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Because of that, he hired them to tail her.

707
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:59,330
Shall I ask the police to be on the lookout for Jo Sang Mi?

708
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,500
No, please don't do anything yet.

709
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,730
Instead, please stay here and be on call,

710
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,830
so that I can get a hold of you whenever I need to.

711
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,630
Mr. Han. Mr. Han!

712
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,360
You came.

713
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,500
Where is Seol?

714
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,960
Where is she right now? You scum.

715
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,900
I told you...

716
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,030
not to provoke the kidnapper.

717
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,230
If you keep this up,

718
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,060
you won't be able to save the woman you love.

719
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,300
I'm saying Seol...

720
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,300
will die because of you, jerk.

721
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,800
Were you behind Jo Sang Mi this whole time?

722
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,960
"Kidnap her."

723
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,400
"Hit her with the motorcycle."

724
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,660
Were you behind everything all along?

725
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,930
What kind of person do you think I am?

726
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,500
Let me tell you exactly what's true and what's false.

727
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,200
The fact that Jo Sang Mi blackmailed me...

728
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,230
is true.

729
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,930
I told you that I don't know where Seol is.

730
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
It was a lie.

731
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,700
What are you trying to get by making me come here?

732
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,430
I'll make sure you can accomplish your goal.

733
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,630
First, tell me where Seol is now.

734
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,630
This is what I thought as soon as I saw the article.

735
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:19,400
"I should beg him."

736
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,060
"I should ask him to take down the article and help me just this once."

737
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,360
Then this thought suddenly popped up in my head.

738
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,700
"No matter how desperately I beg him,"

739
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,500
"he'll never do it for me."

740
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,130
That's why things got this messed up.

741
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,530
I'm saying...

742
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,100
it's all your fault, you scum.

743
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,730
Mr. Han.

744
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,200
Seol.

745
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,700
Is anybody here?

746
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,100
Tell me where Seol is first.

747
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,960
Why did you write about something so dangerous...

748
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,130
and make someone take his own life?

749
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,660
That young girl, Jo Sang Mi, is thirsty for revenge.

750
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,060
I'm not sure if Seol would still be alive.

751
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,300
When such cracks appear,

752
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,460
your power starts to disperse little by little.

753
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,400
If you continue to use your power and energy,

754
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,260
the cracks will spread and deepen.

755
00:47:42,123 --> 00:47:43,123
The choice is yours.

756
00:47:43,953 --> 00:47:45,993
If you want to save Seol's life,

757
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:48,593
you'll have to cover up the situation yourself.

758
00:47:49,093 --> 00:47:51,093
Call that piece of trash, Reporter Son,

759
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:53,523
and tell him that the whole thing was staged by you.

760
00:47:54,893 --> 00:47:56,953
Then I'll tell you where Jo Sang Mi is.

761
00:47:58,523 --> 00:48:02,053
After kidnapping someone, you're harassing and even threatening me.

762
00:48:03,523 --> 00:48:05,523
How low are you willing to go?

763
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,823
Don't you think you're at rock bottom now?

764
00:48:10,093 --> 00:48:11,323
Like I've already told you,

765
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,523
that girl is capable of doing anything.

766
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,123
I tamed her a little by offering her a large sum of money,

767
00:48:18,293 --> 00:48:19,793
but it's only a matter of time.

768
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:22,523
No one can stop her now.

769
00:48:23,353 --> 00:48:25,123
No one knows what kind of ruse she'll cook up.

770
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:31,053
I bet you're the one who cooked up all this, not her.

771
00:48:33,753 --> 00:48:37,223
- What? - Sure, she probably threatened you.

772
00:48:37,423 --> 00:48:42,053
But I'm sure you tied her down using the clip you obtained.

773
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:46,793
Then the article came out unexpectedly.

774
00:48:47,453 --> 00:48:48,593
Make your choice.

775
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,123
Do you want her to live or not?

776
00:48:51,123 --> 00:48:52,523
Let's see.

777
00:48:54,753 --> 00:48:58,123
Now that Jo Sang Mi's card is gone, what would you have done...

778
00:48:58,123 --> 00:48:59,823
had this been the only card you have?

779
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:03,693
You'd probably have threatened her.

780
00:49:05,123 --> 00:49:07,023
I've sure you've spent quite a bit of money as well.

781
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:08,253
That mouth.

782
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:13,453
Shut it and make your choice.

783
00:49:34,023 --> 00:49:35,993
That girl, Jo Sang Mi,

784
00:49:36,593 --> 00:49:38,753
must be waiting for your call while holding Seol...

785
00:49:39,453 --> 00:49:41,353
captive somewhere.

786
00:49:41,793 --> 00:49:43,953
No, you're wrong.

787
00:49:44,623 --> 00:49:46,253
I'm the one who was threatened.

788
00:49:46,723 --> 00:49:49,823
All I did was make you come here, which she told me to do.

789
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:53,053
The police will find out the truth.

790
00:50:01,153 --> 00:50:02,253
Ms. Kang.

791
00:50:03,023 --> 00:50:06,893
Please call the police immediately and ask them to find Jo Sang Mi.

792
00:50:12,123 --> 00:50:13,623
I'll save Seol's life on my own.

793
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:15,753
I do not need your help.

794
00:50:26,793 --> 00:50:27,993
Let's just...

795
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,793
Hey, what are you doing now?

796
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:34,953
Let's just put an end to everything now.

797
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:36,493
Have you lost your mind?

798
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:44,023
I...

799
00:50:45,993 --> 00:50:47,693
I can't let you walk away like that.

800
00:50:48,353 --> 00:50:50,693
If you don't help me cover it up,

801
00:50:51,723 --> 00:50:55,523
this is the only choice I can make.

802
00:50:55,923 --> 00:50:57,023
Come down.

803
00:50:58,093 --> 00:50:59,593
Come down right now!

804
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:02,223
No,

805
00:51:02,953 --> 00:51:04,253
I don't want to.

806
00:51:04,993 --> 00:51:06,053
I told you before.

807
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,093
I'd much rather die.

808
00:51:09,123 --> 00:51:11,023
I cannot tolerate people looking at me...

809
00:51:12,993 --> 00:51:14,353
with utter contempt.

810
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,623
I won't be able to stand it.

811
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:20,593
I'm...

812
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:25,053
exhausted, Se Ju.

813
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:33,923
Hey, hey!

814
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:39,893
Move. Don't block me, you jerk.

815
00:51:40,153 --> 00:51:41,193
Get out of my way!

816
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:43,293
Hey, no!

817
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:45,453
No!

818
00:51:45,623 --> 00:51:47,553
- Let go. - No.

819
00:51:47,553 --> 00:51:49,953
- No! - Let go. Let go!

820
00:51:50,593 --> 00:51:51,623
Let go of me!

821
00:52:11,093 --> 00:52:15,153
I'm sure the two of you will have a great time.

822
00:52:20,393 --> 00:52:22,353
- Drink up. - Cheers.

823
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:18,853
You two made it.

824
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:22,123
My gosh. I love the ambiance at this party, Young Min.

825
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:25,523
I must say, you look dashing today, Yul.

826
00:53:26,153 --> 00:53:28,593
I bought this suit at Mitsukoshi for tonight.

827
00:53:30,393 --> 00:53:33,323
Thank you for inviting me. I'm not even a fitting guest.

828
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,223
That's not true at all. You should be invited, of course.

829
00:53:37,353 --> 00:53:38,953
I'm sure the two of you...

830
00:53:40,823 --> 00:53:42,823
will have a great time tonight.

831
00:53:44,223 --> 00:53:45,353
I'm looking forward to it.

832
00:53:46,153 --> 00:53:48,323
I'm already having a great time.

833
00:53:53,823 --> 00:53:56,553
I have to excuse myself to greet other guests. Sorry.

834
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:02,895
The final goal of our mission today...

835
00:54:03,295 --> 00:54:06,725
is achieving two objectives through a feint operation.

836
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:09,525
- Cheers. - Cheers.

837
00:54:09,725 --> 00:54:11,795
Expecting Joseon Youth Alliance's attack, they will...

838
00:54:12,055 --> 00:54:15,755
make sure the entire police force guards the area around the venue.

839
00:54:16,555 --> 00:54:20,155
We'll use that situation to our advantage.

840
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:24,355
They look as if they've received a gift, not caught in a trap.

841
00:54:44,825 --> 00:54:46,855
While all of their eyes and ears...

842
00:54:46,855 --> 00:54:50,155
are focused on the party venue where the high-up officials are,

843
00:54:50,155 --> 00:54:53,355
Team 2 and 3 who are hiding in Hwanggeumjeong will start moving...

844
00:54:53,755 --> 00:54:57,955
to throw bombs at Siksan Bank and Oriental Development Company...

845
00:54:57,955 --> 00:55:00,355
which have been aiding Japan in their brutal colonization of Joseon.

846
00:55:00,695 --> 00:55:02,895
Then it'll turn into a street battle,

847
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,055
and we'll distribute the Declaration of Joseon's Independence...

848
00:55:06,155 --> 00:55:07,925
to let the world know of our determination.

849
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:10,055
That's our first goal.

850
00:55:20,155 --> 00:55:21,425
What happened?

851
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:24,495
There were bombings at Siksan Bank and Oriental Development Company.

852
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,925
Who did it? Did you guys catch the culprit?

853
00:55:27,225 --> 00:55:29,895
It looks like it was done by an organization.

854
00:55:29,895 --> 00:55:31,425
They're distributing propaganda flyers...

855
00:55:31,425 --> 00:55:33,455
while causing a street battle and running away at the same time.

856
00:55:34,055 --> 00:55:35,195
Is it Joseon Youth Alliance?

857
00:55:35,195 --> 00:55:36,895
Send the police force there immediately.

858
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:40,395
Capture every one of them without an exception.

859
00:55:40,495 --> 00:55:42,995
If anyone resists, you can shoot him on the spot.

860
00:55:43,995 --> 00:55:46,395
Why are you just standing there? Go sort it out right now!

861
00:55:46,755 --> 00:55:47,925
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir.

862
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:52,425
You should prepare yourself for the consequences of this.

863
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,925
Once the police force starts moving towards Hwanggeumjeong,

864
00:55:59,295 --> 00:56:02,325
Team One on site will infiltrate into the banquet venue.

865
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:05,625
We'll steal the money donated for war fund for our rebel forces.

866
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:10,155
Then we'll assassinate all the pro-Japan authorities...

867
00:56:10,355 --> 00:56:11,795
and the leading members of their military.

868
00:56:12,695 --> 00:56:14,525
That's our second goal.

869
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:21,125
Those who are disguised as catering staffs will...

870
00:56:21,195 --> 00:56:24,195
sneak the weapons into the venue along with food ingredients.

871
00:56:25,455 --> 00:56:28,755
Those of you who are disguised as the high-up officials' entourage...

872
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:32,525
will have to take care of their real entourage in advance.

873
00:56:34,355 --> 00:56:35,525
And...

874
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:38,625
our comrade, Su Hyeon,

875
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:42,855
will kick-start our key mission.

876
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:01,595
Did they know what time the bombs would go off?

877
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:05,055
Stop. Stop!

878
00:58:36,195 --> 00:58:37,255
What's going on?

879
00:58:37,525 --> 00:58:39,495
- Why did the lights go off? - What's happening?

880
00:58:40,095 --> 00:58:41,555
- What is this? - What's going on?

881
00:58:41,555 --> 00:58:43,255
- What is happening? - Why did the lights turn off?

882
00:58:55,925 --> 00:58:57,495
- My gosh! - The lights...

883
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,995
As a member of Joseon Youth Alliance,

884
00:59:05,325 --> 00:59:07,795
I hereby announce that we'll keep fighting for Joseon's independence,

885
00:59:07,995 --> 00:59:10,125
and that we will assassinate those who are in the way...

886
00:59:10,525 --> 00:59:11,755
of our country's independence.

887
00:59:56,495 --> 00:59:59,295
(Chicago Typewriter)

888
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,725
If we meet again in our next lives,

889
01:00:01,825 --> 01:00:03,925
please think of me as a woman.

890
01:00:03,955 --> 01:00:06,095
In the next life, give her up.

891
01:00:06,255 --> 01:00:08,395
Remember what you promised me in the past life?

892
01:00:08,395 --> 01:00:10,225
How much more can I express myself?

893
01:00:10,455 --> 01:00:12,555
And you two should talk casually to each other from now on.

894
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:14,355
You've been friends for over 80 years.

895
01:00:14,355 --> 01:00:16,225
Better yet, he should be serving me like his master.

896
01:00:16,225 --> 01:00:17,725
But I beg to differ, my dear friend.

897
01:00:17,725 --> 01:00:19,495
- Do you want to die? - I'm already dead.

898
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:21,895
From this moment, we're changing the plan.

899
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:22,895
Boss.

900
01:00:23,055 --> 01:00:25,825
Su Hyeon, you must come back in one piece.

901
01:00:26,784 --> 01:00:28,014
It's an order.
