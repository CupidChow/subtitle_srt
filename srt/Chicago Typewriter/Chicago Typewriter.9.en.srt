00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:19,697
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,971
What is that? What are you doing again?

3
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:05,333
I asked you what you are doing.

4
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:11,763
I can't decipher. I will delay the judgment.

5
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:16,763
I don't think you will answer it even if I ask you, so I won't ask.

6
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,263
What's up with her?

7
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,463
Boss! Boss!

8
00:01:23,463 --> 00:01:24,763
Ae Rang ran away.

9
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:35,563
Where will I find a replacement?

10
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,893
Who's going to perform tonight?

11
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,663
It'd be best if I...

12
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:42,133
What if your voice cracks again?

13
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:51,893
Libera, didn't I tell you to give up on becoming a singer?

14
00:01:54,863 --> 00:01:57,563
Don't worry. I've found the perfect replacement.

15
00:01:58,263 --> 00:02:00,033
You found one already?

16
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:03,163
Of course. It's someone...

17
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,463
refreshingly new.

18
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,133
Let go of me! Right now!

19
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,033
I said I don't want to do it. I'm not going to do it.

20
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:27,193
Gosh, you're like an uncontrollable beast.

21
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:30,263
Madam, can't I sing instead?

22
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:31,693
I can do a good job.

23
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:32,993
Get out.

24
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,233
Why me, of all people?

25
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:41,263
I've heard you sing along with Ae Rang before.

26
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,763
- You were pretty good. 
- I was just...

27
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,993
humming along for fun.

28
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:50,193
If you're worried your cover will be blown, don't worry.

29
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:53,463
It's been years already.

30
00:02:54,563 --> 00:02:56,663
No one will recognize you even if you dress like a girl.

31
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,163
It'll be just on the stage.

32
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,463
What do you think? I'm not going to force you.

33
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,733
Let me just remind you that you should probably pay back...

34
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:10,563
Mr. Yoo for taking you in and feeding you all these years.

35
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,963
Gosh, you're making me feel bad.

36
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,533
Fine, I'll do it. Are you happy now?

37
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,933
I can roughly picture you on the stage.

38
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:31,463
It might actually help our undercover operation.

39
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,663
Undercover operation?

40
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,133
It's none of your business.

41
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:41,933
Well, let me paint your face now, okay?

42
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:51,563
Gosh, we're in the red again.

43
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,533
All right, come on out.

44
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:59,433
Let me introduce our Saturday singer, Anastasia, to you.

45
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,463
Gosh, I feel so awkward.

46
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:05,193
Don't be shy, and come down here.

47
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:06,663
You should get used to the high heels now.

48
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,263
Darn it.

49
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:21,933
Be confident.

50
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:23,793
Try walking forward.

51
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:51,663
Yul, I look awkward, don't I?

52
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:59,033
I got feelings for her before he did.

53
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:08,133
But there's nothing I can do in this life.

54
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:25,433
(Chicago Typewriter)

55
00:06:27,393 --> 00:06:28,693
Are you done crying now?

56
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:32,193
If I cry again, will you hug me again?

57
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,093
How can you be so shameless?

58
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:46,063
Are you that scared?

59
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,333
What do you mean?

60
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,263
Are you that scared of seeing your previous life?

61
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:58,193
Do you want to hear a scary story?

62
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,763
If it's about ghosts, forget it.

63
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:02,433
It won't scare me at all.

64
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,893
It will. It'll make you very scared.

65
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,363
Once upon a time,

66
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,163
there lived in a countryside...

67
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,433
a woman and her daughter alone.

68
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,163
Mom, am I pretty?

69
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,533
Of course, you are.

70
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:32,433
Are you serious?

71
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:36,393
Of course. Seol, you're really pretty.

72
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:39,033
- Really? 
- Really.

73
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,433
Even if I killed a person?

74
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:49,393
Seol, what did you just say?

75
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,463
A long time ago, I shot a person.

76
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,393
Play with your friend over there.

77
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:12,633
Okay.

78
00:08:20,263 --> 00:08:21,633
She's not one of our people.

79
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,233
She doesn't have supernatural powers.

80
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,463
She won't become a shaman, so don't worry.

81
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:27,933
If it's not supernatural powers...

82
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,193
Well...

83
00:08:30,263 --> 00:08:32,093
Maybe she remembers her previous life.

84
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:38,133
Her previous life?

85
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:41,463
I'm just saying.

86
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:44,133
Anyway, you don't have to worry.

87
00:08:45,063 --> 00:08:48,463
They say your children were your enemies in the previous life.

88
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:51,863
You probably owed her a lot in your previous life.

89
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:54,663
In order to work out your karma, take good care of her,

90
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:56,263
and give her much love.

91
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:07,003
Mom, don't go.

92
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:09,193
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:12,763
I'll never say such a thing again.

94
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:22,163
She must have been scared.

95
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,463
Her little kid would wake up from a nap...

96
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:30,863
and say, "I shouldn't have killed the person,"

97
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:32,763
crying her heart out.

98
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:40,463
It wasn't your fault.

99
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,763
You were just telling her what you were seeing.

100
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:51,093
I know. Actually, my mom...

101
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,363
left me for a guy.

102
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,193
Still,

103
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:01,363
if I were normal, would she have left me?

104
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:05,733
Would she have sent me to her ex-husband...

105
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,163
as if I'm a package?

106
00:10:09,263 --> 00:10:10,363
I don't think so.

107
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:13,003
She would have taken me with her.

108
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,093
How is it now?

109
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:20,893
Do you still see it?

110
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,263
No. Not at all.

111
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,393
I'm completely normal now.

112
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:52,793
I see.

113
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:55,933
That's great.

114
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,133
I guess. It's a good thing.

115
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:19,963
Go in. I'll get going.

116
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,593
If I cry again, will you hug me again?

117
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,733
What's wrong? Do you have a fever again?

118
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:43,633
You have fever.

119
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,033
Go inside and rest. I'll go now.

120
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:53,393
Hey, Seol.

121
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:56,693
I'm...

122
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,633
I'm not scared of you at all.

123
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,593
I don't think you are abnormal.

124
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,893
It's because...

125
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,533
I'm even crazier than you.

126
00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:19,763
Also, you are mistaken about something.

127
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,033
I don't abandon people.

128
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,793
I wouldn't accept people if I were to abandon them.

129
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:28,933
It's because...

130
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,333
I had been...

131
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:36,633
abandoned before.

132
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,933
So...

133
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:46,033
So?

134
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,933
So...

135
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:56,893
I won't abandon Gyun Woo.

136
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,863
I will raise him well. Don't worry.

137
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:00,863
Bye.

138
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:23,033
- Look at these people! 
- That's funny.

139
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:26,333
Sir, it will be over soon.

140
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,933
- Aren't you going to leave? 
- Goodness.

141
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:31,793
There's a ghost...

142
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:33,893
living in my house.

143
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:36,633
This show is really fun. Do you want to watch it with me?

144
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:40,233
And the ghost loves to watch TV.

145
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,193
- They continue to... 
- Goodness.

146
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:46,733
There are 101 boys I want to possess.

147
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:50,563
Which boy do you think will take the center?

148
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:53,133
He's very interested in the entertainment industry too.

149
00:13:55,063 --> 00:13:57,693
You should've saved So Joon instead of me.

150
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:00,063
Just now, the leading character...

151
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,163
sacrificed himself...

152
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:04,533
for his lover.

153
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,193
On top of that,

154
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:08,563
he also loves romance dramas.

155
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:10,333
This is so sad.

156
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:13,833
I want him out of my sight.

157
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:17,433
The food is ready, sir.

158
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:22,763
You never watched TV before, but you watch it a lot these days.

159
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,333
That's because I don't have much to do these days.

160
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:36,733
Let's eat.

161
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,163
Sure.

162
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:00,863
Ms. Kang.

163
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,233
Yes, sir.

164
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:06,963
Can you prepare one more serving?

165
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:08,733
Pardon?

166
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:10,993
Are we expecting a guest?

167
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,093
No.

168
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,563
I'm too bored to eat alone.

169
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:17,733
Please.

170
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:19,593
Sure.

171
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,733
Thank you. You may leave now.

172
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:33,733
Sure. Enjoy your meal.

173
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:44,733
It's been a long time since someone fixed a meal for me.

174
00:15:45,593 --> 00:15:48,793
I did it only because you were eying on my food.

175
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,263
Don't be too moved by it.

176
00:15:58,263 --> 00:15:59,433
It's good.

177
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,733
It's been 80 years since I had a meal with somebody.

178
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,493
When I opened my eyes one day,

179
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:11,963
I was in another country, indwelled in the typewriter.

180
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:14,063
I was lonely.

181
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:17,163
I always missed this land...

182
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:19,263
where I used to be with my friends.

183
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:23,263
That's why I was so thrilled...

184
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,933
when I saw you at the cafe in Chicago.

185
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,493
I won't buy your story. Don't sell it.

186
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:28,993
Okay.

187
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:38,693
Well, tell me if there's something you want to eat.

188
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,193
I will tell them to prepare it.

189
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:45,933
Mr. Han!

190
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:47,733
Mr. Han!

191
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,563
Goodness.

192
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:54,163
It's not the time to enjoy your meal like this.

193
00:16:57,663 --> 00:16:59,633
The investors are making strange moves.

194
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:01,793
What are you talking about?

195
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:04,393
I've been going around busily and begged them to wait...

196
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,233
until the publication resumes.

197
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:09,393
But suddenly, the investors are calling for an assembly.

198
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:13,433
Someone must be nudging the investors from behind.

199
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:18,333
Didn't you tell them we're putting a stop to the project?

200
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,463
The publisher's life depends on it. How can we stop the project?

201
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,263
I made it clear, didn't I?

202
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:25,263
I said we are stopping this project.

203
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,533
Anyway, you have to step in before this goes out of hand.

204
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:34,703
If they sue you, 10 million dollars won't be the problem.

205
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:36,263
You and I will be completely over.

206
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:39,033
Se Ju, save me this time for once.

207
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:42,893
I clearly told you my position.

208
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:46,393
Tell them the truth now,

209
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,663
and take the responsibility for your action.

210
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:52,133
Whatever result we get, I am ready to accept it.

211
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:57,093
Se Ju.

212
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,163
Se Ju!

213
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:05,163
Shouldn't you be doing something?

214
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:09,833
I probably will be paying an unbelievably large penalty.

215
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:15,563
I will probably lose all my wealth.

216
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,433
You can start publishing the novel again.

217
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,433
I can't do that.

218
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:23,563
Seol might read the novel and remember the past life.

219
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,863
But Seol read every novel published up until now...

220
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:29,133
and didn't realize that it's about her past life.

221
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:32,063
There's no guarantee that she will continue to not figure it out.

222
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:34,633
To Seol, her past life...

223
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:37,663
is not a beautiful memory.

224
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,263
It's a trauma for her.

225
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,233
Not everything about her past life...

226
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:46,933
is traumatic.

227
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:50,093
She must have good memories too. Why would you only think that?

228
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:53,263
Why should she remember the things she doesn't have to know?

229
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:56,133
This novel...

230
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,763
should remain only between us.

231
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:11,333
Then why don't we do this?

232
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,033
- What is he saying? 
- What?

233
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:18,333
You should tell us if something is wrong with the project.

234
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,133
I don't know what you heard,

235
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:23,733
but there's nothing wrong with the project.

236
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,493
- What? 
- What about the rumor?

237
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,663
The rumor that Se Ju stopped writing has spread everywhere.

238
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,033
Do you think it makes sense that there's nothing wrong?

239
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:34,963
- What are you doing here, Ms. Hong? 
- Oh, right.

240
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,493
I am the largest investor of this project.

241
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,333
What?

242
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,663
As the largest investor,

243
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:45,363
I have the right to know the facts,

244
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:50,133
especially when there's a chance the project will be canceled.

245
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:53,793
Se Ju will resume writing the novel soon.

246
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,633
It's been a little delayed,

247
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:57,233
but the project will not be canceled.

248
00:19:57,233 --> 00:20:00,963
As investors, we can't just sit and watch.

249
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,203
All right. If the project gets canceled,

250
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:08,133
we are willing to sue and ask you for a large sum of penalty.

251
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:11,933
Of course, we might also sue you for...

252
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,233
violation of your duty and fraud.

253
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,393
Ms. Hong.

254
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:16,533
We demand...

255
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:21,063
Mr. Han to explain about this rumor himself right now.

256
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:22,363
Otherwise...

257
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:23,533
As you asked,

258
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:26,233
- What? 
- I will explain it myself.

259
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,633
- Is that Mr. Han? 
- It's Mr. Han.

260
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:28,633
Mr. Han.

261
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:32,093
What happened?

262
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:34,593
It's Mr. Han.

263
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,093
Let's see what he has to say.

264
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:37,893
What's going on?

265
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:40,633
No way.

266
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:43,433
Se Ju's novel resumed publication just now.

267
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:46,093
I see. It's nothing new.

268
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:49,333
What? Did you already know about it?

269
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:50,733
Of course.

270
00:20:51,593 --> 00:20:52,593
How?

271
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,763
But this news just came up.

272
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:59,203
This is what happened.

273
00:20:59,203 --> 00:21:00,263
What's this?

274
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:01,263
(Chicago Typewriter, 3rd week script)

275
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,893
Is this the third week script of Chicago Typewriter?

276
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:09,163
Yes.

277
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,703
Are you resuming the publication?

278
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:15,993
Only if you are okay with it.

279
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:19,263
This isn't happening.

280
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:20,963
Are you...

281
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:23,833
waiting for my approval?

282
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,393
What am I, your court lady? I'm not waiting for your approval.

283
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:29,933
Take a look at it first.

284
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,363
All right.

285
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:37,033
I feel like I should wear gloves and flip the pages using tweezers.

286
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:04,163
How is it?

287
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,533
It's superb.

288
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:12,363
I've been so curious about how the three of them met each other.

289
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,363
It's beginning with the scene where the Kyungsung trio first met.

290
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:19,263
What an excellent strategy.

291
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:22,863
How do you feel?

292
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:26,233
How do you feel now? Are you feeling all right?

293
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:28,663
What? My feelings?

294
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,563
Do you mean how I feel in general?

295
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:34,833
It's a long story.

296
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,693
Could you answer me first?

297
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:42,263
Maybe I haven't given him enough compliments.

298
00:22:45,693 --> 00:22:47,793
I was so touched and moved. I got goose bumps.

299
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:50,633
Do you want more?

300
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:54,093
See? She has no idea that it's about herself.

301
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:56,993
It seems like there's no problem with it.

302
00:22:57,363 --> 00:22:59,793
- I will... 
- "I will..."

303
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:00,993
contact you soon.

304
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,533
"contact you soon."

305
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:08,733
Did he really say like that?

306
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:14,093
I really don't understand why on earth he finds you attractive.

307
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:19,993
But why does he have to show you the script he wrote?

308
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:21,893
As if he's asking for your permission.

309
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,163
He's being respectful to his very first fan.

310
00:23:29,393 --> 00:23:32,793
It's about time people react to his new novel.

311
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:39,363
What's wrong with that?

312
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:41,493
Is it an alarm?

313
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:43,693
What do you mean?

314
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:45,563
I got a phone call.

315
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:51,763
Hello, Mr. Baek.

316
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:56,133
Did you take the original book of "Introduction to Veterinary"?

317
00:23:58,093 --> 00:24:00,733
Yes, I have it.

318
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:03,263
There's something I want to look up in the book.

319
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,333
Should I bring it to your workroom then?

320
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:12,533
- Look at the comments. 
- This is incredible.

321
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:19,493
- My gosh. 
- I knew it was going to be a hit.

322
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:20,663
What do you think?

323
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:24,093
Is it enough to prove the rumor that I'd quit writing...

324
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:28,993
was just a rumor, and I'm taking this project seriously?

325
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:31,233
- It seems like it. 
- I think so.

326
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:32,633
I don't think he'll quit writing.

327
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:34,993
- Why are we gathered here? 
- What should we do?

328
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:39,563
You've become pretty talkative.

329
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:42,433
You're still arrogant.

330
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:44,633
You made me strong.

331
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:46,863
- What are we doing here? 
- He's right.

332
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:49,893
Everyone, what do you want now?

333
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:51,433
If you still want to get your investment back, you can.

334
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:53,563
If you want to expel him, you can do that too.

335
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:59,593
Ms. Hong. Why did you invite us here?

336
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,133
This is absurd.

337
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,133
Mr. Gal, I'm sorry for what happened.

338
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:07,863
You don't need to be. It's big money. I understand.

339
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:10,463
- Let's go. 
- Why did we come here?

340
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:12,193
Let's get going.

341
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,033
You're doing a great job.

342
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:16,493
I apologize.

343
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,593
I'm sorry that...

344
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:35,063
I couldn't live silently like a ghost.

345
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:08,593
You arrived earlier than I...

346
00:26:14,763 --> 00:26:15,763
Father.

347
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,133
("Fate")

348
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,393
It seems like it's quite popular already.

349
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,363
I heard it's already in its fifth printing.

350
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:43,163
Have a seat. The tea will get cold.

351
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:51,393
What brings you here by the way?

352
00:26:51,863 --> 00:26:53,563
You normally don't visit my workroom.

353
00:26:58,363 --> 00:26:59,763
Mr. Baek.

354
00:27:01,793 --> 00:27:06,133
Don't you think it's time to stop?

355
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:08,793
What do you mean?

356
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:10,893
- Quit what? 
- Stop pretending...

357
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,363
to be the author of the book someone else wrote.

358
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,193
It's time to stop.

359
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:29,163
Until when will you smart under the pricking of...

360
00:27:30,193 --> 00:27:31,863
your conscience?

361
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:35,263
Others might not know,

362
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,893
but you and I know that.

363
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:44,063
Let's start over.

364
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,193
Let me help you.

365
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,393
Stop pretending to be a victim.

366
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:52,233
You didn't hush it up for me.

367
00:27:57,263 --> 00:27:58,363
I know...

368
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:00,633
you were afraid...

369
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:05,563
that I might damage your reputation.

370
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:08,133
- Tae Min. 
- You're also a part of this.

371
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:14,793
Do you want me to reveal everything by myself?

372
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:19,163
No, I don't want to.

373
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:23,393
I will shoulder the responsibility for what I did.

374
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:26,163
You take responsibility for what you did.

375
00:28:27,593 --> 00:28:31,563
Don't you dare think you can be excused through me.

376
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:36,263
Se Ju has...

377
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:40,793
the original draft of "Fate".

378
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:50,663
Neither Se Ju nor I will bring it up first.

379
00:28:57,533 --> 00:29:00,263
The one who tied the knot...

380
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:02,263
should untie it. Don't you agree?

381
00:29:06,863 --> 00:29:07,893
I'm leaving.

382
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:23,533
Hello.

383
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:27,593
My name is Jeon Seol. I'm the assistant of Mr. Baek.

384
00:29:31,193 --> 00:29:32,863
You must be Baek Do Ha.

385
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:35,433
I'm really honored to meet you.

386
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:39,793
Please be supportive of him.

387
00:29:41,463 --> 00:29:42,463
You're here.

388
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:49,533
I was about to leave. See you next time.

389
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,333
All right.

390
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,533
- Goodbye. 
- Bye.

391
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:57,363
Come in.

392
00:30:07,363 --> 00:30:11,193
I brought the book and some documents that might be helpful.

393
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:15,563
Hey.

394
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,933
Do you want to go have a drink with me?

395
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:22,733
Oh, I don't know.

396
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:26,733
Actually, I drank too much alcohol recently and I don't feel well.

397
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:32,133
I don't know if you overheard it from outside,

398
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:35,893
but I had an argument with my father.

399
00:30:37,863 --> 00:30:39,563
You heard it, didn't you?

400
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:44,833
Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

401
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:49,833
I was thinking of leaving since it sounded serious,

402
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,833
but then Mr. Baek came out.

403
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:56,493
Don't worry. I didn't hear the details.

404
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:07,193
I'm not in a good relationship with my father.

405
00:31:10,193 --> 00:31:12,933
He has always been comparing me to Se Ju...

406
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,193
since I was young.

407
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:18,033
No matter what I do,

408
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:20,933
he doesn't seem to like me.

409
00:31:27,563 --> 00:31:29,763
(Hangover Cure)

410
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:33,563
Is this some kind of cocktail?

411
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,963
Let's drink these first.

412
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:41,763
You're so well-prepared.

413
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,263
How much are you planning to drink?

414
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:47,093
When I meet the other writers,

415
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,933
I often end up drinking too much.

416
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:50,733
If you drink these beforehand,

417
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:52,433
you feel a lot better the next morning.

418
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,893
Like I said, I can't drink a lot.

419
00:31:56,893 --> 00:31:58,493
I know.

420
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,093
Just be here with me.

421
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:07,263
Imagine this as our aperitif. Cheers.

422
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:25,893
Thank you.

423
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:28,463
For what?

424
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,263
Are you going to make me pay for the drinks?

425
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:34,263
For drinking with me.

426
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:37,833
When I'm with you,

427
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:40,393
I strangely feel at ease.

428
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,063
You make me laugh.

429
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:46,833
When I'm not with you, I miss you.

430
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,233
Well, Mr. Baek.

431
00:32:51,493 --> 00:32:55,033
I know you're going to push me away again.

432
00:32:55,963 --> 00:32:59,133
I won't ask you to be my girlfriend.

433
00:32:59,763 --> 00:33:02,133
Please just be my friend.

434
00:33:06,363 --> 00:33:08,963
Probably because I never meet his expectations,

435
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:11,493
my father is always cold to me.

436
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:14,733
My mother is always busy defending him.

437
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:18,033
I thought Se Ju was my friend,

438
00:33:19,093 --> 00:33:20,463
but he's keeping a distance from me.

439
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,033
Everyone around me pushes me away.

440
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:29,733
I just need one person I can feel comfortable around.

441
00:33:33,863 --> 00:33:36,363
Wait, you're not answering me.

442
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:38,993
All right.

443
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:42,863
I'll drink until you promise me you'll be my friend.

444
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:50,463
- Give me another shot. 
- Hold on.

445
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:52,093
Thanks.

446
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:01,433
One more.

447
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:06,169
- 20 years ago... 
- Aren't you going to work?

448
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:08,229
- The 50th anniversary... 
- It's gone.

449
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:09,429
What are you talking about?

450
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:13,429
- The General Government Building. 
- A building is being torn down.

451
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,339
It's been forever since that building was torn down.

452
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:19,729
- Is it really gone? 
- The General Government Building...

453
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:22,269
- Oh, my. 
- used by the Japanese...

454
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,529
I should have let you know. I'm sorry...

455
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,699
- you didn't know it was torn down. 
- for 36 years.

456
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,839
Then what is in Gwanghwamun now?

457
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,069
Candles.

458
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:32,529
Sorry?

459
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,199
Turn off the television now.

460
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:39,369
Don't you remember we started writing again?

461
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,469
It's going to be a war from now on.

462
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:44,369
Can't we go there?

463
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:46,429
I'd like to see it for myself.

464
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,099
Do you mean the candles?

465
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:51,999
No. I mean Gwanghwamun without the General Government.

466
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:55,499
The streets full of freedom.

467
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:56,999
We can't.

468
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:01,399
You don't seem to be aware of how scary the deadline is.

469
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:05,269
Soon, your chair will start to feel like an electric chair.

470
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,769
You'll learn what it feels like...

471
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:10,499
to be tortured.

472
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:22,999
A ghost lives in my house.

473
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:26,839
He often looks so miserable.

474
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:30,839
Do you want to go there that much?

475
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,529
He sometimes looks like a huge dog.

476
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,299
I can't stand the sight of him.

477
00:35:40,899 --> 00:35:44,269
You're visiting downtown for the first time.

478
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:46,729
You should freshen up your style.

479
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:50,369
By the way, how do you get changed?

480
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:52,399
Do I need to burn the clothes or something?

481
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:54,799
That's an old-fashioned way.

482
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,769
You can do this nowadays.

483
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:08,769
- Look at you. 
- See?

484
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:15,899
Once your wish is granted,

485
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,599
you'll start working on the novel.

486
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:19,669
I think it'd be even better...

487
00:36:19,669 --> 00:36:21,869
If you want better clothes, buy them yourself.

488
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:24,699
Why don't we ask Seol to come too?

489
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:53,999
I don't mean to make you feel bad,

490
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:57,169
but the driver and I carried you all the way here.

491
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,929
From your friend,

492
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:00,129
Seol.

493
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:07,729
Mr. Baek.

494
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:09,999
I was about to call you.

495
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,429
How do you feel?

496
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,299
I feel good, thanks to you.

497
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:15,929
I gave you a hard time yesterday, didn't I?

498
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:19,299
You should thank the driver, not me. I just helped...

499
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:23,299
- What are you doing? 
- I'd like to buy you dinner.

500
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:26,299
- I'll pick you up... 
- Don't you dare come here.

501
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:31,229
Call this number once more, and you'll be dead meat.

502
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:34,569
Hang up and delete this number right away.

503
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:41,629
We need to go somewhere.

504
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:45,569
Don't you see I'm working?

505
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:48,729
I do. I'll wait outside until you finish your work.

506
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:11,469
Why don't we come back later?

507
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,199
Are we on a stakeout?

508
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:15,999
Tae Min might come.

509
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:17,999
Then we'll stay here.

510
00:38:18,169 --> 00:38:19,629
Should I contact the headquarter?

511
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:37,729
Gosh, you've become so healthy.

512
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:41,399
You're so pretty.

513
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:45,729
You've become so healthy. That's great.

514
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:09,969
Seol, you can go now.

515
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:13,369
What? We're not closing until a few hours later.

516
00:39:14,129 --> 00:39:17,899
I mean it's like a detective keeping an eye on a suspect.

517
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:21,569
You should just go now because it doesn't look good for our clinic.

518
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,299
Still...

519
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:26,069
Please go, will you?

520
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:28,069
You filled in for me the other day.

521
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:29,929
We'll be even if you go now.

522
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:33,799
Gosh, I'm causing you so much trouble.

523
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,729
He's such a bother.

524
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:46,269
Oh, my. I can't believe this.

525
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:49,169
Are you from the countryside?

526
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:51,269
Why would you want to look around Seoul?

527
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:54,229
- It's amazing. 
- It's for my new novel.

528
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:57,269
This is incredible.

529
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,969
Goodness.

530
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:01,399
I can't believe this.

531
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,669
Oh, my goodness.

532
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:06,069
Will you please quiet down?

533
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:08,429
My goodness.

534
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:11,169
Who's on the phone? Why are you so aggressive?

535
00:40:11,169 --> 00:40:13,429
There's this person from Chicago.

536
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:15,369
He's so weird.

537
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:17,069
I'm hanging up.

538
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:19,369
That's Gyeongseong Station.

539
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:21,529
Can you take a picture of me in front of it?

540
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:31,469
You should have told me beforehand.

541
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:40,199
There. Are we good now?

542
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,899
My gosh, you even got that car on the road in the frame.

543
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:50,569
Cameras these days can certainly capture such fast-moving objects.

544
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:54,069
You have no idea as you've never experienced technologies like this.

545
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:55,929
It's very impressive.

546
00:40:57,299 --> 00:40:59,839
Why don't you take Seoul Station out on a date instead?

547
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:03,529
Oh, my.

548
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:07,599
Let's take a look.

549
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:08,969
Welcome.

550
00:41:10,229 --> 00:41:12,099
- You can use these as wallets. 
- I see.

551
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,969
Take a look around.

552
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,169
Hey, how do I look?

553
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:20,839
How much is this?

554
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:26,629
(Letter of wishes)

555
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,669
(Please help him be more stable.)

556
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,799
Please help him be more stable.

557
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:41,599
My gosh, Mr. Han.

558
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:44,299
The wastewater-filled Cheonggyecheon has changed so much.

559
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:47,769
Mr. Han, it looks like there is a lantern festival this evening.

560
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:50,699
Mr. Han, there's a place I'd like to visit later.

561
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,599
Mr. Han, let's eat something first.

562
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,729
Mr. Han, actually...

563
00:42:53,729 --> 00:42:55,829
Gosh, can you stop calling me like that?

564
00:42:56,999 --> 00:43:00,399
I've been calling you like that all along. Then how should I...

565
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:02,769
Well, I meant...

566
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:07,299
If you keep calling me like that in public spaces like this,

567
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:09,129
people will recognize me.

568
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,299
I haven't thought about that.

569
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,669
Then how would you like me to address you?

570
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:17,129
Han Se Ju?

571
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:19,199
That would be worse.

572
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:23,729
Then... How about Ju?

573
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:27,329
I'd much rather hear you call me Brother.

574
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:29,669
Then what should I call you?

575
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:31,099
Shall I really call you Brother?

576
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:33,799
Can't you hear me?

577
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:36,499
I refuse to be treated by Hui Young.

578
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:41,299
Brother sounds great. Let's do that.

579
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:43,199
Are you serious?

580
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:45,599
Are we related or what?

581
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:47,799
You're so weird.

582
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:50,929
By the way, doesn't it feel like it's gotten quiet around here?

583
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:55,199
What's the matter? Are you looking for something?

584
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:56,669
By any chance, have you seen Yoo...

585
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:59,229
There's no way you would've seen him.

586
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:02,999
Where did he go?

587
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:04,999
Wait for me here. I'll be right back.

588
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:07,569
Wait. Brother, Brother!

589
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:09,729
Where are you going?

590
00:44:20,999 --> 00:44:22,299
It's really gone.

591
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:24,669
I told you so.

592
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,069
There was nothing we could do.

593
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:31,999
Our youth was the only thing we could give.

594
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:36,369
That's why so many youth perished like that,

595
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:39,269
but we won.

596
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:44,329
You better not cry.

597
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:45,929
I'll ditch you if you do.

598
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:49,399
I also...

599
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:52,169
want to live in 2017.

600
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,099
I'd love to live in a world like this.

601
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,869
I told you.

602
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:04,469
No matter which era you live in,

603
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,369
life is an agony.

604
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:11,369
There is no such thing as perfect world.

605
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:14,769
Every era has its own problems...

606
00:45:15,669 --> 00:45:17,099
and things you'd want to resist.

607
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:21,329
We resist, struggle,

608
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:24,329
fight, and win.

609
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,899
That's how we shape the world we live in.

610
00:45:33,729 --> 00:45:34,899
Thanks.

611
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:39,069
Thanks to the youth you guys sacrificed,

612
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:41,729
we can live in a world like this now.

613
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:45,469
Pass this message along to the youth of the time.

614
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:48,429
You fought hard.

615
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:51,129
And I thank them...

616
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:53,629
for creating this world for us.

617
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:01,699
You fought hard too.

618
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:06,799
You were one of the youth of the time.

619
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,469
Brother!

620
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:16,929
Gosh, what are you thinking?

621
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,969
You can't even hear me.

622
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:21,969
And there's another one of the youth.

623
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:24,429
Don't you think you need a hearing aid?

624
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,199
Mr. Han.

625
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:29,129
I'd like to ask a favor of you.

626
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,999
To the left. A little bit more.

627
00:46:36,999 --> 00:46:37,999
Is this good?

628
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:41,399
A little more.

629
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,669
Gosh, you're so fussy.

630
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,369
Like this?

631
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:09,169
Do you mind taking a photo of me and Seol?

632
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:11,069
A photo?

633
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:14,899
You won't even be visible. Why do you want to take a photo?

634
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:17,869
I know.

635
00:47:18,399 --> 00:47:21,729
But I still want a photo of myself with her.

636
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:23,599
Would it be okay?

637
00:47:34,129 --> 00:47:35,529
Give me a bigger smile.

638
00:47:57,769 --> 00:47:58,999
Oh, excuse me.

639
00:47:59,729 --> 00:48:01,599
- Could you take a picture of us? 
- Sure.

640
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,599
Thank you.

641
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:09,999
Okay. 1, 2, 3.

642
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,171
Are you sad?

643
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:33,801
Does the fact that you couldn't capture the moment...

644
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:36,901
with Seol in a photo make you sad?

645
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:42,071
Well, I'd be lying if I told you that I'm not sad at all.

646
00:48:42,271 --> 00:48:43,271
I'm okay though.

647
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:48,371
Even though it's not visible, the memories will last forever.

648
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,071
You're bluffing again.

649
00:48:52,201 --> 00:48:53,201
I'm glad.

650
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:57,971
She's still jolly, healthy, and brave. She seems happy too.

651
00:49:00,201 --> 00:49:02,201
She's trying very hard to appear that way.

652
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:05,871
Haunted by the memories of her past life,

653
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:08,341
she even had to give up her dream.

654
00:49:09,141 --> 00:49:10,541
It's not exactly a happy life.

655
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:12,971
That is too bad.

656
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,001
Hadn't she quit shooting, she would certainly have...

657
00:49:16,201 --> 00:49:17,871
made a name for herself as a markswoman.

658
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:23,901
I'm curious about something.

659
00:49:25,641 --> 00:49:26,771
How did Su Hyeon...

660
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:29,471
come to learn how to shoot?

661
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:36,841
The success of Yun Bong Gil's bombing operation in Shanghai...

662
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,371
has solidified the position of the provisional government.

663
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:42,341
Sadly, the plan to assassinate the Japanese minister has failed,

664
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:45,641
but it showed how determined we are to fight for independence.

665
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:50,171
We, at Joseon Youth Alliance, should work harder as well.

666
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:55,041
You should continue working as the head secretary at Office of Records.

667
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:56,241
We need you in that position...

668
00:49:56,241 --> 00:49:58,571
to figure out how much assets those high-ranking officials have.

669
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:02,171
All right. But I can't do it for a long time.

670
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:06,041
Having to flatter those officials is eating me up inside.

671
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:07,501
Mr. Yang,

672
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:11,401
I heard that you've been frequenting the stock exchange.

673
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:13,641
You could ruin everything for you and your family,

674
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:15,141
so you should stop going there.

675
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:18,871
All right.

676
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:42,001
Hey, Brother! Gosh, I looked everywhere for you.

677
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:46,701
We have a big problem. Libera is fighting with a customer.

678
00:50:46,741 --> 00:50:49,271
- Oh, okay. 
- The customer is holding...

679
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:51,771
a barrel of oil, saying he'd set the entire bar on fire.

680
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:53,471
All right. Wait for me there.

681
00:50:54,071 --> 00:50:56,341
Gosh, you don't have time to waste like this.

682
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:57,801
What are you even doing here?

683
00:50:57,901 --> 00:50:59,241
- Hurry up. 
- Okay.

684
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:08,471
Yul...

685
00:51:10,271 --> 00:51:11,571
didn't go home, right?

686
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:17,801
He's in there, isn't he?

687
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:21,471
We'll soon receive instructions for the next step.

688
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,941
Until then, please do your best in your positions.

689
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:27,141
By the way, when will we get to meet the head in person?

690
00:51:27,571 --> 00:51:29,171
Our organization was formed a year ago.

691
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:31,941
Shouldn't he at least show us his face as our comrade?

692
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:33,441
He's right.

693
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:36,541
We can't keep following orders from someone whom we don't even know.

694
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:38,871
He'll reveal himself when the right time comes.

695
00:51:39,241 --> 00:51:40,301
Soon, we will...

696
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:29,201
You...

697
00:52:30,741 --> 00:52:31,771
I want in too.

698
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:35,071
- What? 
- If you don't let me join you,

699
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:39,401
I'll run to Jongno Police Station and tell the police everything.

700
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,641
I know him. You can drop your guns.

701
00:52:45,141 --> 00:52:46,371
I told you to drop your guns!

702
00:52:57,701 --> 00:52:59,071
I'll sort this out.

703
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:02,001
All of you should leave now.

704
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:27,541
What do you think you're doing?

705
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:31,741
I've been wondering where all the money from Carpe Diem was going to.

706
00:53:32,601 --> 00:53:33,901
You've been supporting the rebel forces.

707
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:36,641
Do you even know what we're trying to do?

708
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:39,001
I do.

709
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:42,401
You're trying to teach Japan a lesson.

710
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,941
Teach me how to shoot a gun.

711
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:52,941
I'll put bullet holes through the heads of those who killed my dad.

712
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:56,071
I can't teach you if it's for vengeance. I absolutely can't.

713
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:58,771
I'll be avenging my nation by avenging my father's death.

714
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:00,441
Let me fight too.

715
00:54:06,771 --> 00:54:08,141
I don't have the authority to do so.

716
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:13,271
Okay.

717
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:16,471
Then I'll head over to Jongno Police Station...

718
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,901
I'll ask the head of our organization, but...

719
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:28,001
Mark my words.

720
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:32,871
If you talk about what you saw here today, I won't forgive you.

721
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:38,771
Just go get his permission.

722
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:42,901
I'm ready to sacrifice my life.

723
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,241
We did let our guards down.

724
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:05,071
I also think she's been keeping an eye on us for a long time.

725
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:11,041
What should we do, Boss?

726
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:16,241
Did you hear me, sir?

727
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,071
If she's willing to make effort and has the talent,

728
00:55:24,341 --> 00:55:26,141
it wouldn't be bad to groom her into a sniper.

729
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:29,201
Do you really mean it?

730
00:55:29,501 --> 00:55:32,771
A female sniper would be useful for disguise purposes.

731
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:36,471
If she's that enthusiastic, she'll give impetus to our endeavors.

732
00:55:39,741 --> 00:55:41,601
She looks like a tomboy,

733
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:44,671
but she's still a weak woman.

734
00:55:46,201 --> 00:55:47,341
Won't it be too risky?

735
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:50,201
Weak? You think she's weak?

736
00:55:51,671 --> 00:55:53,471
She'll do a great job.

737
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:55,071
Who knows?

738
00:55:55,441 --> 00:55:58,301
She might become another deadly sniper.

739
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:03,971
Then...

740
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:09,271
are you saying the person who made her shoot...

741
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:12,141
was me?

742
00:56:14,201 --> 00:56:15,201
Yes.

743
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:19,301
That means the person who gave her trauma...

744
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:21,441
of guns...

745
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:26,401
It was also me.

746
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:31,271
Hey.

747
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:34,871
Don't you think she'll become pretty useful with a bit of training?

748
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:38,371
She learns everything very quickly.

749
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:40,571
I'm done.

750
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:42,741
20 seconds.

751
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,071
Do you know what this gun's nickname is?

752
00:56:45,741 --> 00:56:48,841
Because its gunshot is similar to a typewriter sound,

753
00:56:48,841 --> 00:56:50,341
it got the nickname "Chicago Typewriter".

754
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:51,801
So what?

755
00:56:51,871 --> 00:56:53,301
You should write something good.

756
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:57,071
Don't write to gain fame and women.

757
00:56:57,171 --> 00:56:58,971
Write something magnificent.

758
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:06,801
Mr. Han, are you okay?

759
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:09,271
By any chance,

760
00:57:10,671 --> 00:57:14,501
did Seol kill someone she shouldn't have killed in her past life...

761
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,671
because of Hui Young's command?

762
00:57:19,941 --> 00:57:22,971
That's... I don't know either.

763
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:25,671
Then...

764
00:57:28,141 --> 00:57:30,801
Su Hyeon must've gotten shot by a gun that time...

765
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:34,501
because of me.

766
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:51,301
Do you have the time?

767
00:57:58,601 --> 00:57:59,641
It's 12pm.

768
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:01,901
When will Jung Gil go back?

769
00:58:03,071 --> 00:58:04,671
It'll probably be tomorrow.

770
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:06,801
Thank you.

771
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:11,871
Yoon Jung Gil will leave in 10 minutes. Hurry up.

772
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:16,641
I told you to write something magnificent.

773
00:58:17,141 --> 00:58:21,071
Publishing that third-rate novel is a waste of newspaper space.

774
00:58:22,441 --> 00:58:23,941
Hey, Su Hyeon!

775
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:53,501
At 10pm on April 19.

776
00:58:53,941 --> 00:58:56,041
The target is Min Hwan Shik at Namdaemun.

777
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:58,771
Ryu Su Hyeon and Jang Ki Bong will be the sniper team.

778
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:03,071
Yang Hyung Shik and Choi Mong Gyu will deliver the goods.

779
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,441
Other comrades must secure an escape route.

780
00:59:07,371 --> 00:59:10,401
This is Su Hyeon's first mission. Will she be okay?

781
00:59:11,971 --> 00:59:14,841
She has to pull it off in order for us to accept her as our comrade.

782
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:22,801
Did they fail?

783
00:59:23,371 --> 00:59:25,201
The escape route is this way.

784
00:59:26,971 --> 00:59:28,341
It's that way. Get him!

785
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:34,771
What are you doing? You should run. Do you want to die?

786
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:50,941
Hurry up. Run.

787
00:59:58,771 --> 00:59:59,771
Over there!

788
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:01,241
Follow them!

789
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:09,001
This way.

790
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:14,771
What are you doing?

791
01:00:14,971 --> 01:00:16,341
If you don't want to die, be quiet.

792
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,171
It's you.

793
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:46,941
You're the masked man who saved me.

794
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:53,001
What are you talking about?

795
01:00:58,941 --> 01:01:02,041
Where have they gone? I told you to keep eyes on them!

796
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:05,571
Instead of writing cheap romance novels,

797
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:08,741
why don't you do something that helps our country like this?

798
01:02:34,601 --> 01:02:37,341
(Chicago Typewriter)

799
01:02:37,871 --> 01:02:39,341
She might remember more...

800
01:02:39,641 --> 01:02:41,841
after reading the novel.

801
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:44,701
You're the masked man who saved me, aren't you?

802
01:02:45,071 --> 01:02:48,471
We've met a very long time ago.

803
01:02:48,771 --> 01:02:50,041
- "Carpe Diem." 
- "Carpe Diem."

804
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:53,001
You're right. I can't believe this.

805
01:02:53,601 --> 01:02:56,401
You're still living like a rat.

806
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:57,541
Who are you?

807
01:02:57,801 --> 01:02:59,571
Who did Su Hyeon love?

808
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:03,001
I also remember my past life.

809
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,271
I don't believe in what you say.
