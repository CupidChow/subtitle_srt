1
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,373
As a member of Joseon Youth Alliance,

2
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,933
I hereby announce that we'll keep fighting for Joseon's independence,

3
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:41,533
and that we will assassinate those who are in the way...

4
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,203
of our country's independence.

5
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:12,733
Move faster!

6
00:01:13,403 --> 00:01:16,103
The comrades who manage to survive will gather at the halfway point,

7
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:18,933
move to Kyungsung Station, and get on the train to Manchuria.

8
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,573
I hope you will all make it through.

9
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:36,863
Move it.

10
00:01:37,603 --> 00:01:38,633
Move it.

11
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,533
They couldn't have gotten far. Go chase them!

12
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:07,763
(Chicago Typewriter)

13
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,203
Sniper Ryu Su Hyeon...

14
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,533
will leave the banquet hall as soon as she comes down the stage...

15
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,933
and join the group at the halfway point.

16
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,263
She will escort the comrades to Kyungsung Station.

17
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,603
Anastasia?

18
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:27,033
Aren't you Anastasia?

19
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,733
It is you, Anastasia.

20
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:45,363
Are you on the way to meet that composer again?

21
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:50,003
- Open it. - Yes, sir.

22
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,403
Oh, dear.

23
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:05,933
You play a very dangerous instrument.

24
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:17,803
- You're here. - Is everyone safe?

25
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:22,033
Everyone is fine, except for the ones who sacrificed themselves.

26
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,863
Did you get injured, Mr. Shin?

27
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,133
Oh, it's nothing serious.

28
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:31,003
It won't get in the way of our plan, so don't worry.

29
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,763
Let's now go to Kyungsung Station since everyone is here.

30
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:35,763
Wait.

31
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,633
Su Hyeon isn't here yet.

32
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:41,563
I clearly saw her getting out of the banquet hall...

33
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:43,503
with everyone else.

34
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,903
If she got out of the banquet hall before we did,

35
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:48,133
she should be here by now.

36
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:52,003
Do you think she got caught on her way here?

37
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:03,503
I only invited you to use you as bait...

38
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:06,933
to catch the leader of Joseon Youth Alliance.

39
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:11,263
But I can't believe you were the sniper of Joseon Youth Alliance.

40
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:16,903
I feel like I caught something bigger than I expected.

41
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:19,963
I told you already.

42
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:23,203
I have no idea what Joseon Youth Alliance is.

43
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,563
A guest I met at the banquet hall gave me some money...

44
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,503
and asked me to carry that case.

45
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:32,733
I had no idea that there would be a gun inside.

46
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:35,433
What a pity.

47
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,233
I also gave some money to my subordinate...

48
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:42,063
and asked him to do something for me.

49
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:50,303
I told him to keep an eye on you and track every single move you make...

50
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,563
as soon as you entered...

51
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:54,703
the banquet hall.

52
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:58,533
What a pity.

53
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:02,933
Why did you waste your time and effort on such a useless matter?

54
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,933
Who's the leader of Joseon Youth Alliance?

55
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,803
It's a shame.

56
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:09,833
I'd fully cooperate if you'd ask me a question...

57
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,363
I was capable of answering.

58
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:18,133
Don't you want to know why you are brought here?

59
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:22,603
I don't know what you're keeping me here for,

60
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,773
but you've chosen the wrong bait.

61
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:27,303
It's the look in your eyes.

62
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:32,733
It's because I saw the look in your eyes.

63
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:39,563
Gosh.

64
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:55,663
Okay.

65
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,633
Shall we start playing detective now?

66
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:02,763
Here's one hypothesis.

67
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,433
Either Shin Yul or Seo Hui Young...

68
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,663
is the leader of Joseon Youth Alliance.

69
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:13,063
Now, here's the truth.

70
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:18,433
They're both in love with you.

71
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,333
Here's my prediction. Therefore,

72
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:25,733
they will both come to your rescue.

73
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:27,163
I told you already!

74
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,003
I don't know anything about Joseon Youth Alliance!

75
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:31,733
Let's see about that.

76
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:35,463
Bring her in.

77
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:47,403
Are you really just going to leave Kyungsung?

78
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,963
We can't abandon Su Hyeon. We need to go save her.

79
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:51,963
We'll end up missing the train.

80
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,003
We can't lose any more time.

81
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:58,303
Then you guys should go first. I'll go look for Su Hyeon...

82
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,833
Do you even know where she is?

83
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:02,963
I'll have to figure that out.

84
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:05,033
With that injured body of yours?

85
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,403
So are you saying that we should leave her behind?

86
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,203
Su Hyeon is our comrade.

87
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:12,033
The ones who died at Hwanggeumjeong and the banquet hall...

88
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:14,433
were also our comrades.

89
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,033
The moment we all decided to fight for our country...

90
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:23,063
is the moment we were obligated to save our own lives.

91
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:25,863
That's our destiny.

92
00:07:26,163 --> 00:07:27,163
Hui Young.

93
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:28,363
If we don't get there in time,

94
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:30,403
we won't be able to proceed with our next mission.

95
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:35,333
Let's all head to Kyungsung Station.

96
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,263
It's me.

97
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:41,763
Was that you?

98
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,663
You were supposed to arrive at Kyungsung Station before us...

99
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,463
and spy on what's happening over there.

100
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:50,633
Kyungsung Station is crawling with policemen.

101
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,033
It's not just Kyungsung Station.

102
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,233
There are policemen in every part of the city.

103
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,763
They're carrying out a very thorough inspection.

104
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:02,603
Also, I don't know who leaked the information, but there are...

105
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:06,333
policemen sitting in the cabin that we were supposed to be sitting in.

106
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,533
Is she the sniper?

107
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,303
Do you want your son to die?

108
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:40,833
Answer me. Is she the sniper?

109
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:03,703
Take her out.

110
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:04,803
Yes, sir.

111
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:20,503
Let's all scatter for now...

112
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,703
and observe how the situation unfolds.

113
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,803
Those of you whose identity hasn't gotten revealed yet...

114
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:28,103
shall carry on with your life like nothing ever happened.

115
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,873
If any one of you feel like you are being watched,

116
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,163
go and hide yourself at the hideout...

117
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,403
and contact each other like we always do.

118
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:37,603
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

119
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,533
Let's go.

120
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:52,703
Hui Young, we need to save Su Hyeon first.

121
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:55,133
Your injury might get infected.

122
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:56,603
You need to get treated first.

123
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:17,333
I heard this was Joseon Youth Alliance's hideout.

124
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:20,633
My goodness, what will happen now? They might have to shut down.

125
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:28,403
You were lucky.

126
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:31,633
Thankfully, you won't need to get stitches.

127
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:40,303
My mother always prayed at dawn in front of freshly drawn water.

128
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:42,803
She prayed for me...

129
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:47,433
to stay healthy at all times.

130
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:50,933
I guess I got lucky thanks to her prayers.

131
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,963
Boss, we have a situation.

132
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,803
I think Su Hyeon...

133
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:03,063
got caught by Heo Young Min.

134
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:10,463
Did he find out that Su Hyeon is the sniper?

135
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:14,263
If Sophia told them about her identity...

136
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:17,903
What do you mean? Why would Sophia say anything?

137
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:22,403
Are you saying that Madam Sophia is the secret agent?

138
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:23,603
I'm certain she is.

139
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:26,903
Sophia disappeared right before our mission,

140
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,403
and one of our comrades saw her entering the General Government.

141
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:36,103
Su Hyeon is in danger.

142
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,203
Do you think you can avoid...

143
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:41,163
getting investigated with your injured body?

144
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,963
Why don't you just go around...

145
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:47,563
and tell everyone that you got in a gun fight...

146
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,703
as a member of Joseon Youth Alliance?

147
00:11:52,063 --> 00:11:53,463
Then are you saying we should do nothing?

148
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,963
Su Hyeon isn't the type to inform on us.

149
00:11:57,863 --> 00:12:00,263
She'll eventually get tortured and die.

150
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:02,833
We need to save her.

151
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,203
Put that gun down.

152
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,803
If you're not going,

153
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,863
I'll go alone.

154
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,863
Stop right there, Shin Yul.

155
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,863
It's an order.

156
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,163
Did you forget already?

157
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25,633
Our comrades who bombed...

158
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,363
Hwanggeumjeong that night...

159
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:30,703
all committed suicide...

160
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:33,103
before they got arrested.

161
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,963
They did that to protect our alliance...

162
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:37,463
and to save their comrades.

163
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:39,263
Hui Young.

164
00:12:39,703 --> 00:12:43,533
Where and for what we decide to sacrifice our lives on...

165
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,533
is up to our own selves.

166
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,333
We must also protect ourselves...

167
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,033
with our own power.

168
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:55,563
Su Hyeon cannot be an exception.

169
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:57,733
- Hui Young! - After getting out of Kyungsung,

170
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,033
our plan was to prepare for battle.

171
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,803
Then with the money we stole, we would've gathered weapons...

172
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:03,703
and prepared for our next battle.

173
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:06,663
That was the ultimate goal of our mission.

174
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:08,903
The ones who have survived...

175
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:12,303
have the obligation to fulfill that goal.

176
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:16,103
That is how we can mourn for our fellow comrades...

177
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,633
who have died before us.

178
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:24,733
Mr. Jo.

179
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:28,003
Please check which of the comrades survived.

180
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:29,303
Once you have the number,

181
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:33,233
we will find the way to get out.

182
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,233
All right, Boss.

183
00:14:03,403 --> 00:14:04,403
Eat up.

184
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,863
You'll need this to survive.

185
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:27,003
If you keep acting stubborn,

186
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:28,803
you will suffer a lot.

187
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:31,533
You will experience pain beyond your imagination.

188
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:33,563
You will...

189
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:36,003
beg them to kill you.

190
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:38,303
How could you manage to eat...

191
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,633
after betraying your comrades?

192
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:44,563
Just give up. Then you'll feel better.

193
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:46,163
Boss...

194
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:47,903
will take care of the rest.

195
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:50,433
When did you become a betrayer?

196
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:54,003
Are you the one who leaked information on the last mission?

197
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,233
Why did you do that?

198
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,403
How can you do this?

199
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:03,063
Everyone thought of you as a sister.

200
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,033
You were just like a mother to me.

201
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,263
What else could I have done?

202
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:09,033
My son was going to die otherwise.

203
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:12,303
I couldn't even breast-feed him once...

204
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:15,703
because I didn't want him to be called the son of kisaeng.

205
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:18,933
The joy of watching him from a distance...

206
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,633
helped me endure this tough life.

207
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:22,633
Who doesn't have a personal story?

208
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,733
That boy...

209
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,203
is locked in jail waiting to die.

210
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,463
He was charged for killing a Japanese detective...

211
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,233
who raped a school girl from Joseon.

212
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:33,363
If I can save him,

213
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,763
I would do anything.

214
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:39,703
Then how about our comrades?

215
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:43,033
How about our comrades who trusted you like their own sister?

216
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:44,363
Why should I care?

217
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,063
At the end of the day, they are all strangers.

218
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,163
My son comes first in any case.

219
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:49,933
Saving my son...

220
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:51,933
comes before saving my country.

221
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,633
Why do I have to save Joseon...

222
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,263
when it hasn't done anything for me?

223
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:59,803
Then you shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.

224
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,403
Shut your mouth!

225
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,233
Come out.

226
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:10,903
I won't forgive you.

227
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,403
I will never forgive you.

228
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:15,503
As long as I'm alive...

229
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:16,663
No, even when I'm dead,

230
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:19,203
I will never forgive you!

231
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:47,033
Hey, how can you get married when you're so clumsy?

232
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,133
Goodness.

233
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:53,033
More rice falls on the table than on your mouth.

234
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,003
Please give me a bowl too.

235
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:58,003
Sure.

236
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,003
Is someone chasing you?

237
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:03,073
Do you have to go set out fire after you finish?

238
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,233
No. I'm going to eat fast and earn my keep.

239
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,433
Nobody is telling you to do so.

240
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,633
How can I slack until someone tells me...

241
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,663
to be money's worth?

242
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:17,733
A man must earn his keep and live a worthy life before he dies.

243
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,163
Only then I can be considered worthwhile.

244
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:22,963
Slow down.

245
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,033
You won't be able to get married if you keep eating like that.

246
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:29,833
Don't worry. I already have someone to marry.

247
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:33,073
You do?

248
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:34,573
Who could that be?

249
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,603
It's the masked man who saved me.

250
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:39,863
I'm going to find him and marry him.

251
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,833
I fell in love with him at first sight.

252
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,463
Do you have a way to find him?

253
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,333
I'll have to find him somehow.

254
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,863
And then?

255
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:57,403
Then you're going to marry him.

256
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,863
- Yes. - How can you be so confident?

257
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:05,363
- What do you mean? - He must have a say about this.

258
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,633
Do you think he will thank you...

259
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:10,233
and marry you if you tell him you want to marry him?

260
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,573
Are you...

261
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:15,233
that charming?

262
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:21,803
You're unbelievable too.

263
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:23,863
How can you marry him simply because he saved you?

264
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,233
If you marry everyone who saved you,

265
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,503
how many husbands should you have?

266
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:32,503
Don't worry. I'm not into having multiple husbands.

267
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,303
From now on,

268
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,233
I'm going to protect my own life.

269
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,073
It was you, wasn't it?

270
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:55,363
You're the masked man who saved me that time.

271
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,203
What are you talking about?

272
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:10,403
Where did she go?

273
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:11,963
Go that way!

274
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,003
If you are going to keep writing trashy romance novel...

275
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:15,663
that doesn't help our country in any way,

276
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,803
do this to help our country.

277
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:30,703
You know that man...

278
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:33,403
who saved me when I was little...

279
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:35,803
You're talking about that again.

280
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:38,663
Until when will you...

281
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,573
He was very arrogant and cocky.

282
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,833
A young kid asked if she could see his face,

283
00:21:46,503 --> 00:21:48,033
but he was so stubborn.

284
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:50,403
He didn't even tell me his name.

285
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:55,833
He said this to me.

286
00:21:57,803 --> 00:22:00,233
He told me not to be tormented even if I survive alone.

287
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,963
He told me to become stronger.

288
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,663
That advice...

289
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:09,433
supported and comforted me...

290
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,533
throughout my life.

291
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,333
Perhaps I can't meet or marry him.

292
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:20,103
But I really want to...

293
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,503
tell him how thankful I am.

294
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:28,103
Aren't you really...

295
00:22:30,463 --> 00:22:32,363
the masked man who saved me?

296
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:38,433
Yul will be sad if he hears this.

297
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:43,303
But why do I keep feeling like...

298
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:47,003
you're lying?

299
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:51,103
And why does that lie...

300
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:55,403
keep making me sad?

301
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:23,863
Don't worry. You don't have to avoid me anymore.

302
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,933
I've completely given up.

303
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:30,463
But in our next lives...

304
00:23:32,503 --> 00:23:35,233
If we're born again in liberated Joseon,

305
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:38,603
you should...

306
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:42,163
think of me as a girl, okay?

307
00:23:47,863 --> 00:23:49,903
Don't hesitate...

308
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,463
or push me away.

309
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:56,503
Don't lie to me...

310
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,303
or suffer alone either.

311
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:01,933
Tell me everything...

312
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:04,363
honestly.

313
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:11,563
Promise me you'll do everything you didn't do for me in this life.

314
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,563
Why do you keep talking about our next lives?

315
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,833
Promise me one thing.

316
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:28,203
Come back alive by all means.

317
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:31,433
It's an order.

318
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:38,033
I'll keep the promise.

319
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:41,903
I'll go back alive by all means.

320
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,433
What are you doing here all alone?

321
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:18,433
How much painkiller did you give me? I almost couldn't get up.

322
00:25:18,863 --> 00:25:20,333
Were you trying to kill me?

323
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,433
Hadn't I done that,

324
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:27,133
you would have dashed to the General Government with bombs.

325
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,633
Why didn't you let me?

326
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:33,633
Your youth is too precious for that.

327
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:37,533
I guess I'm useful enough for you to want me to stay alive.

328
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:40,863
As long as you behave yourself.

329
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:46,803
Hui Young.

330
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:49,333
Go ahead.

331
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:53,203
I think it's time for us to part ways.

332
00:25:57,663 --> 00:26:00,433
What do you mean?

333
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:05,103
I'll remain in Kyungsung. You go to Manchuria with comrades.

334
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,763
You shouldn't.

335
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,263
Kyungsung is dangerous.

336
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,903
Flee to Manchuria for now.

337
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:18,463
- Come back here in... - Don't worry.

338
00:26:19,363 --> 00:26:22,803
Since my father cooperated with Japan, I'll be safe.

339
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:24,163
So...

340
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,503
whatever I do from now on,

341
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,203
don't worry about me.

342
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,203
I'll survive by all means.

343
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:40,203
- Yul. - Also,

344
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,663
I'll give up on her in my next life.

345
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:49,233
But...

346
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:55,163
in this life, please let me save her.

347
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:38,233
It's nice to see you again.

348
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:41,833
How have you been?

349
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:45,103
Where is Su Hyeon right now?

350
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,203
Su Hyeon?

351
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:55,763
Do you mean Anastasia?

352
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:58,733
Don't try to act innocent.

353
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:02,863
Thanks to my father, I know some people in the General Government.

354
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:05,963
I see.

355
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:10,503
Then I'm sure you also understand...

356
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:15,203
we can't release a sniper of Joseon Youth Alliance so easily.

357
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,263
I'm sorry,

358
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,733
but money can't solve everything.

359
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,103
Then...

360
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,833
would you exchange her...

361
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:30,163
with the leader of Joseon Youth Alliance?

362
00:28:38,826 --> 00:28:39,856
Boss.

363
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:42,056
What's the matter?

364
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,726
The leader of the Joseon Youth Alliance has been arrested.

365
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,856
What are you talking about?

366
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:51,456
To save Ms. Ryu, Mr. Shin must have...

367
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:54,026
made a false confession.

368
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:00,486
Don't worry.

369
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:04,386
Since my father cooperated with Japan, I'll be safe.

370
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:06,186
So...

371
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:09,586
whatever I do from now on,

372
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:12,256
don't worry about me.

373
00:29:13,456 --> 00:29:15,186
I'll survive by all means.

374
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:19,956
It's a good thing. As long as they believe they got the leader,

375
00:29:19,956 --> 00:29:22,456
they'll relax their vigilance. We should take the chance...

376
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,826
and escape Kyungsung now.

377
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:29,256
We don't have much time.

378
00:29:29,456 --> 00:29:32,926
Mr. Shin's family will find a way to save him.

379
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:36,026
We should hurry while Mr. Shin is occupying them...

380
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:39,186
for our future plans.

381
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:45,526
If you're the leader of Joseon Youth Alliance,

382
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,126
you must know the members better than anyone else does.

383
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:52,426
You could even draw an organization chart right away.

384
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:54,526
As you might know,

385
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:57,756
the alliance is built upon secrecy and disguise.

386
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:00,026
Even though I'm the leader,

387
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:02,586
I don't know every member in the alliance.

388
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:04,986
You might not know all members in the lower ranks,

389
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:07,956
but if you don't know even the key members,

390
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:09,856
wouldn't that be absurd?

391
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:14,286
- If you are the leader, that is. - Sadly,

392
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:17,226
all key members...

393
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:20,226
killed themselves...

394
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,556
after the Hwanggeumjeong operation.

395
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,086
Is that so?

396
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,856
Bring her in.

397
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:40,826
Su Hyeon.

398
00:30:50,026 --> 00:30:51,056
Who is he?

399
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:01,256
The owner of Carpe Diem.

400
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:04,086
Is he the alliance leader?

401
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:10,956
I said, I don't know who the leader is!

402
00:31:12,126 --> 00:31:15,726
You're a sniper. You must have received orders from the leader!

403
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:17,526
Heo Young Min!

404
00:31:22,556 --> 00:31:23,586
That's enough.

405
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:25,756
- Take her out. - Yes, sir.

406
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:28,826
Su Hyeon.

407
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,256
Don't tell him.

408
00:31:35,056 --> 00:31:37,726
Never say his name.

409
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:40,056
Can you do that?

410
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:43,026
Will you hold out?

411
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:45,756
Answer me, Yul.

412
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:51,326
Su Hyeon.

413
00:31:58,556 --> 00:32:00,686
Aren't you a citizen of Joseon?

414
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:04,786
Who is the alliance leader?

415
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,926
I said, I am the leader!

416
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:12,126
No, you aren't.

417
00:32:12,856 --> 00:32:13,956
Do you know why?

418
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:17,256
The leader of Joseon Youth Alliance...

419
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:19,756
has never left any clue.

420
00:32:21,326 --> 00:32:23,786
The leader of Joseon Youth Alliance...

421
00:32:24,186 --> 00:32:26,226
would not be foolish enough to check his watch...

422
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:29,556
to see whether the bombs are about to go off.

423
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:33,156
He'd also never reveal his emotions...

424
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:35,956
as it'll end up being a weakness people can use against him.

425
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:37,456
Most of all,

426
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:40,386
he wouldn't do all this just for a woman, to save her life.

427
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:44,156
He'd never be dumb enough to walk into the General Government for it.

428
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,926
I was dumb too.

429
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:51,326
I admit it.

430
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:54,856
I set up the trap and threw the bait.

431
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:57,656
"Fall for the trap. Bite the bait."

432
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:59,256
I waited and finally caught you guys,

433
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:02,856
but something felt off.

434
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:05,186
That's when I realized it.

435
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:06,486
Right.

436
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,586
I thought, "This has been too easy."

437
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,126
"It's certainly different from the patterns..."

438
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,456
"which the leader of Joseon Youth Alliance has shown so far."

439
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:22,426
Answer me if you're following what I'm saying.

440
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:24,656
Who's your leader?

441
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:27,856
I already told you.

442
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:31,086
I'm the leader.

443
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:33,656
If you don't tell me,

444
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:36,426
your woman will die.

445
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,056
Don't worry.

446
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:46,386
We won't even lay a finger on you.

447
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:50,456
We can't mistreat someone from such an influential family.

448
00:33:52,626 --> 00:33:54,226
I'm worried though.

449
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:56,986
Until you give me the answer,

450
00:33:59,026 --> 00:34:02,656
Anastasia will be tortured in your place.

451
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:06,726
I'm not sure if she'll be able to hold out until then.

452
00:34:13,256 --> 00:34:16,256
Mr. Shin's father is doing everything in his power...

453
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:18,696
in order to get him out of there,

454
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:22,696
but he keeps insisting...

455
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:25,696
that he's the leader of Joseon Youth Alliance,

456
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:27,556
so nothing his father is doing is working.

457
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:31,196
I have no idea why he's being so unreasonably stubborn.

458
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:34,196
All he has to do to get released is say no.

459
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:39,226
Have you heard anything about others...

460
00:34:39,656 --> 00:34:41,226
who used to be at Carpe Diem?

461
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:42,886
Not really.

462
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:46,156
After the rumor spread that it was Joseon Youth Alliance's secret base,

463
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:47,786
everyone got scattered.

464
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,526
I heard the woman who was the madam...

465
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:52,286
went missing.

466
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:56,256
I also heard that the singer, Anastasia or whatever her name is,

467
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:59,196
was actually Joseon Youth Alliance's sniper.

468
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,886
Oh, is that right?

469
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:04,026
If that wench gives away the leader's name,

470
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,226
Mr. Shin will be released right away.

471
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:09,986
From what I heard, even the harsh torture isn't making her budge.

472
00:35:10,696 --> 00:35:13,056
Gosh, what a stubborn wench.

473
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:25,726
You really don't get what I'm saying, do you?

474
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:29,326
You said you studied law at Kyungsung Imperial University.

475
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:34,356
We already drew the organization chart for you.

476
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:36,986
All you need to do is fill out the names.

477
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:48,086
Bring her in.

478
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,196
As always, we should see if she...

479
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:06,286
had a good night's sleep.

480
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:11,286
Anastasia, how are you holding up?

481
00:36:12,956 --> 00:36:16,156
I want to stop torturing you as well,

482
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:20,456
but Yul here isn't cooperating.

483
00:36:22,886 --> 00:36:26,086
It looks like you'll need to tolerate it a bit longer.

484
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:29,726
- Take her. - Yes, sir.

485
00:36:40,986 --> 00:36:44,226
(Organizational Chart)

486
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:47,156
(Leader)

487
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:54,786
(Leader)

488
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,586
Are you writing an obituary right now?

489
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:13,086
The leader's name is still left blank,

490
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:17,056
and you've only filled out names of those who died at Hwanggeumjeong.

491
00:37:19,986 --> 00:37:21,086
Bring her again!

492
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:06,556
It seems Anastasia finds it hard to keep going back and forth.

493
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:09,626
From now on, we'll...

494
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:12,826
do it right here in front of you.

495
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:17,356
Is she outside?

496
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:20,056
Please... Please...

497
00:38:26,126 --> 00:38:27,426
Get up!

498
00:38:33,426 --> 00:38:34,886
No, no!

499
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:37,656
No...

500
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:45,356
So write his name, you scum.

501
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,586
Is it that difficult to spell out his name?

502
00:38:50,456 --> 00:38:52,086
You should not tell him.

503
00:38:53,426 --> 00:38:54,586
You won't, right?

504
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:56,696
You'll stay strong, right?

505
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:07,326
Say it. Tell me who your leader is right now.

506
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:15,026
Tell me. I said, tell me right now.

507
00:39:19,086 --> 00:39:23,356
All right. Let's see how much longer you can hold out.

508
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,586
Seo Hui Young!

509
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,226
Seo Hui Young.

510
00:39:57,196 --> 00:39:58,826
Our leader...

511
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:05,126
The leader is...

512
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:22,196
Is everyone here?

513
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:23,256
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

514
00:40:23,326 --> 00:40:26,586
Mr. Lee, did you look into what I asked you to find out?

515
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:27,756
As per your order,

516
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,756
I found a ship that is supposed to leave Port of Incheon in two days.

517
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:32,356
Mr. Kang.

518
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:34,456
I got fake identification documents made for all of us.

519
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:37,926
Have you all familiarized yourselves with your new identities?

520
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:38,926
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

521
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:42,756
Then we'll leave in 30 minutes.

522
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:44,656
Each person must take his designated route...

523
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:47,696
and arrive at Port of Incheon before the designated time.

524
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,356
We'll get ourselves organized there...

525
00:40:50,226 --> 00:40:51,856
and head to Dalian.

526
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:53,886
Got it.

527
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:55,956
This place is no longer safe.

528
00:40:56,026 --> 00:40:57,056
We must hurry.

529
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,196
Mr. Kang.

530
00:41:04,156 --> 00:41:05,356
Spare me a second.

531
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:12,456
What did you just say?

532
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:15,696
I asked you to stand in for me...

533
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:20,726
and lead our comrades all the way to Manchuria.

534
00:41:21,486 --> 00:41:22,626
What about you, Boss?

535
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:25,886
I'll stay in Kyungsung.

536
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,026
Boss.

537
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:29,426
There's something I must do here.

538
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:31,956
Staying in Kyungsung alone in this situation...

539
00:41:32,026 --> 00:41:33,326
is too dangerous.

540
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:34,526
I'll join you guys...

541
00:41:34,986 --> 00:41:36,986
after I finish what I have to do here.

542
00:41:37,256 --> 00:41:39,586
Until then, please lead them on my behalf...

543
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:42,886
Are you going to save Mr. Shin and Mr. Ryu?

544
00:41:47,426 --> 00:41:48,786
Please do it for me.

545
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:56,456
- We'll go with you. - Mr. Kang.

546
00:41:56,456 --> 00:41:58,856
Both Mr. Shin and Mr. Ryu are our comrades too.

547
00:41:59,756 --> 00:42:01,456
It's something I have to do.

548
00:42:02,696 --> 00:42:04,356
If all of us move together now,

549
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,726
it'll be way too risky.

550
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:08,386
Why are you trying to bear all the burden alone?

551
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:13,256
No.

552
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:15,486
I'm actually trying...

553
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:18,256
to unburden myself from my responsibilities as the leader...

554
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:20,756
and be...

555
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,786
a normal...

556
00:42:23,326 --> 00:42:24,886
friend to them at least for one day.

557
00:42:27,426 --> 00:42:29,156
I'm trying to be a man.

558
00:42:33,526 --> 00:42:35,126
I'll be sure to rescue them...

559
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:36,556
and join you all.

560
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:37,886
Until then,

561
00:42:38,126 --> 00:42:40,086
please take good care of our comrades.

562
00:42:47,986 --> 00:42:49,656
Live as a friend for just one day.

563
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:53,056
Live as a man for just one day.

564
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:54,426
Instead,

565
00:42:54,686 --> 00:42:56,056
you must come back in one piece...

566
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:57,926
and bring the two of them with you.

567
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:13,573
- Let's go. - Let go of me.

568
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,318
I don't see Seo Hui Young anywhere.

569
00:43:21,488 --> 00:43:23,358
Search everywhere in the vicinity!

570
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:43,588
It must be Hui Young. Get moving!

571
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:44,588
Yes, sir!

572
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:08,158
Mr. Kang.

573
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:13,318
Mr. Kang, Mr. Kang!

574
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:17,618
Get moving and carry out the final operation.

575
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:19,558
- Boss. - It's an order.

576
00:44:19,588 --> 00:44:20,588
Hurry up!

577
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:25,688
Descend.

578
00:44:26,218 --> 00:44:27,218
Descend.

579
00:44:27,588 --> 00:44:28,588
Get out of this mountain!

580
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:31,958
Over there.

581
00:44:58,688 --> 00:44:59,718
What are you guys doing?

582
00:44:59,758 --> 00:45:01,158
Chase him!

583
00:45:43,288 --> 00:45:44,288
Get him!

584
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:48,758
I told you guys that you have to capture him alive.

585
00:46:08,758 --> 00:46:09,758
I'm...

586
00:46:10,658 --> 00:46:12,088
exhausted, Se Ju.

587
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:24,688
Move.

588
00:46:24,958 --> 00:46:26,088
Don't block me, you jerk.

589
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:27,358
Get out of my way!

590
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,458
Hey, no!

591
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:31,388
No!

592
00:46:31,818 --> 00:46:32,858
Let go.

593
00:46:49,658 --> 00:46:51,488
No. No!

594
00:46:51,488 --> 00:46:52,958
Let go. Let go!

595
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:54,588
Let go of me!

596
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:44,418
Mr. Han. Mr. Han!

597
00:47:58,288 --> 00:47:59,958
Mr. Han. Mr. Han!

598
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:08,218
Jin Oh... I'm not dead.

599
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:11,058
Are you all right?

600
00:48:13,688 --> 00:48:14,818
What happened?

601
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,958
I think I just flew in the sky.

602
00:48:18,918 --> 00:48:20,618
You were in a very dangerous situation.

603
00:48:21,058 --> 00:48:22,918
I went into your body without your approval.

604
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:24,958
So the fact...

605
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:26,988
that I'm okay now...

606
00:48:28,218 --> 00:48:30,218
means you successfully possessed my body.

607
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:32,688
It wasn't done perfectly,

608
00:48:33,658 --> 00:48:35,618
but I did manage to save your life.

609
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,188
- Since when? - Pardon me?

610
00:48:51,118 --> 00:48:54,288
When did you become capable of entering people's bodies?

611
00:48:55,388 --> 00:48:57,188
It actually started today.

612
00:48:57,588 --> 00:49:00,018
I guess we can call it a miracle.

613
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:08,318
Why do you keep flickering?

614
00:49:09,818 --> 00:49:11,388
This isn't anything serious.

615
00:49:12,018 --> 00:49:14,388
I think flaunting my tricks used up too much of my energy.

616
00:49:15,258 --> 00:49:17,058
I'm totally fine though.

617
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:21,758
Now, you just need to find a way to become immortal.

618
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:27,488
Seol.

619
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:28,958
Seol...

620
00:49:30,118 --> 00:49:31,218
Mr. Han.

621
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:32,988
Mr. Han, are you okay?

622
00:49:33,488 --> 00:49:36,418
Jo Sang Mi kidnapped Seol.

623
00:49:37,658 --> 00:49:39,388
I must go save her now.

624
00:49:43,488 --> 00:49:45,558
Then you should go and save Seol.

625
00:49:46,118 --> 00:49:47,858
I'll catch Baek Tae Min.

626
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:50,158
All right.

627
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:14,588
Who are you?

628
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:15,918
You...

629
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:17,858
What are you?

630
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:19,788
Get off while I'm still talking nicely to you.

631
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:23,418
It's time for you to pay for what you've done.

632
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:47,158
Yes, Ms. Kang.

633
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:49,288
Has Jo Sang Mi been caught?

634
00:50:49,488 --> 00:50:50,558
Not yet.

635
00:50:50,558 --> 00:50:53,688
It took a while to track her down as she has moved around a lot.

636
00:50:53,688 --> 00:50:55,418
The police are on their way to catch her now.

637
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,488
Mr. Han, what's wrong?

638
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:01,288
Did something happen to you?

639
00:51:01,488 --> 00:51:02,618
Ms. Kang.

640
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:06,988
Please listen carefully to what I'm going to say to you now.

641
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:09,058
Seol...

642
00:51:11,058 --> 00:51:13,058
has been kidnapped by Jo Sang Mi.

643
00:51:14,258 --> 00:51:15,318
Are you serious?

644
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:17,318
Please let the police know...

645
00:51:17,918 --> 00:51:20,018
that arresting Jo Sang Mi shouldn't be their priority.

646
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:23,218
It's more important to...

647
00:51:23,688 --> 00:51:25,488
Seol and keep her in one piece.

648
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:28,588
We must keep her safe.

649
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,188
I got that, sir.

650
00:51:32,158 --> 00:51:35,218
Tell me the address. I'll head there right away.

651
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,488
- Mr. Gal. - Ms. Kang.

652
00:51:47,158 --> 00:51:49,188
Jo Sang Mi kidnapped Seol.

653
00:51:49,188 --> 00:51:51,058
What on earth are you talking about? Kidnap whom?

654
00:51:51,258 --> 00:51:53,788
- Why would she kidnap Seol? - Is that true?

655
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:55,088
I'm pretty sure.

656
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:57,588
Mr. Han wants to make sure she's safe,

657
00:51:57,588 --> 00:51:59,718
rather than to catch the culprit.

658
00:51:59,818 --> 00:52:01,688
It's highly likely that she's locked up in the house.

659
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:04,818
In case Sang Mi figures out, just the two of us are going in.

660
00:52:05,488 --> 00:52:08,558
The rest of you should watch if anyone escapes and wait here.

661
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:09,688
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

662
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:16,018
Don't worry. She's like a rat in the trap now.

663
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:18,658
Anyway, what takes so long for Se Ju to come here?

664
00:52:40,188 --> 00:52:42,258
Jo Sang Mi, are you in there?

665
00:52:42,688 --> 00:52:45,488
Jo Sang Mi, open the door! Jo Sang Mi!

666
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:47,658
Jo Sang Mi!

667
00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:50,588
Is anybody there? Jo Sang Mi!

668
00:52:53,788 --> 00:52:54,818
Break the door.

669
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:07,988
Are you all right?

670
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,658
Yes, I think so.

671
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:12,258
- Are you Jeon Seol? - Yes.

672
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:16,958
Could you tell me what's going on?

673
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:18,618
Do you know Jo Sang Cheol?

674
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:23,988
He's the stalker of Han Se Ju who killed himself.

675
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,918
Jo Sang Mi is that stalker's sister.

676
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:29,358
But why me?

677
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:32,618
It seems like she kidnapped you to take revenge on Se Ju.

678
00:53:41,858 --> 00:53:42,888
Se Ju.

679
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:50,788
- Where is Seol? - Hey.

680
00:53:50,918 --> 00:53:52,218
What's wrong with your face?

681
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:54,988
I asked where Seol is!

682
00:53:57,488 --> 00:53:58,818
Are you sure you're all right?

683
00:53:59,488 --> 00:54:02,758
I'm all right. I can walk alone.

684
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:04,658
You still look pale.

685
00:54:08,658 --> 00:54:09,758
Mr. Han.

686
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,488
You're alive.

687
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:21,958
Thank goodness.

688
00:54:22,558 --> 00:54:23,718
Of course, I am.

689
00:54:24,488 --> 00:54:26,588
I won't die so easily.

690
00:54:30,388 --> 00:54:34,018
By the way, you don't look well.

691
00:54:34,388 --> 00:54:35,558
Did something happen?

692
00:54:36,988 --> 00:54:39,258
What happened? Why are you bleeding?

693
00:54:41,788 --> 00:54:43,018
I'm so relieved...

694
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:45,888
that I didn't come late this time.

695
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:49,818
- Mr. Han! - Se Ju!

696
00:54:49,888 --> 00:54:52,288
- Call an ambulance! - Mr. Han!

697
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,688
- Mr. Han! - Somebody call an ambulance!

698
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:56,318
Se Ju.

699
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,018
Mr. Han.

700
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:00,858
Mr. Han.

701
00:55:02,058 --> 00:55:04,488
Mr. Han. Wake up.

702
00:55:07,418 --> 00:55:08,488
Mr. Han.

703
00:55:10,588 --> 00:55:11,788
Mr. Han.

704
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:18,988
Soo Hyeon.

705
00:55:21,058 --> 00:55:22,118
Yul.

706
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:25,018
I remember everything now.

707
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:30,918
Now I remember how we've become separated.

708
00:55:37,218 --> 00:55:38,288
Get him!

709
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:43,058
I told you guys that you have to capture him alive.

710
00:56:19,788 --> 00:56:23,058
I won't let myself be captured by you alive.

711
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:25,888
Don't you try to mess with me.

712
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:28,418
Your head belongs to me.

713
00:56:29,088 --> 00:56:31,718
I would rather kill myself than...

714
00:56:32,658 --> 00:56:34,488
disgrace Joseon Youth Alliance...

715
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:39,058
and myself by being captured by you.

716
00:57:23,658 --> 00:57:24,818
You're here.

717
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:31,258
It must have been a tough journey.

718
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,558
It must have been tough...

719
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,758
waiting for me.

720
00:57:49,618 --> 00:57:50,658
No.

721
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,018
I'm sorry to have let you deal with it all by yourself.

722
00:58:03,818 --> 00:58:05,688
If it wasn't for you,

723
00:58:07,118 --> 00:58:09,558
I'd have been dead already.

724
00:58:12,118 --> 00:58:14,718
Because you saved my life,

725
00:58:17,318 --> 00:58:19,418
I've lived at least 10 more years.

726
00:58:19,888 --> 00:58:21,918
Otherwise, I'd have been dead already.

727
00:58:30,058 --> 00:58:31,158
Su Hyeon.

728
00:58:33,588 --> 00:58:34,588
Yes.

729
00:58:39,618 --> 00:58:40,688
I love you.

730
00:58:47,158 --> 00:58:49,118
I'm sorry I've been mean to you.

731
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:53,488
I'm sorry I've been ignoring...

732
00:58:55,918 --> 00:58:57,588
your feelings towards me.

733
00:59:01,418 --> 00:59:03,018
I won't do that in my next life.

734
00:59:05,658 --> 00:59:06,758
I promise.

735
00:59:08,388 --> 00:59:12,658
Why do you keep talking about the next life?

736
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,958
In my next life,

737
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:23,418
I will be the first to recognize you.

738
00:59:28,788 --> 00:59:30,058
I'll come back.

739
00:59:32,218 --> 00:59:33,358
No matter what,

740
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:36,558
I'll come back to meet you.

741
00:59:40,418 --> 00:59:42,118
I won't be late then.

742
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:52,858
Are you leaving?

743
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:57,318
Don't go.

744
01:00:00,158 --> 01:00:01,358
Don't go.

745
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:03,958
Don't go!

746
01:00:05,688 --> 01:00:08,258
Don't go!

747
01:01:11,188 --> 01:01:12,858
I missed you.

748
01:01:14,618 --> 01:01:15,718
Su Hyeon.

749
01:02:17,718 --> 01:02:20,658
(Chicago Typewriter)

750
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:24,018
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my word...

751
01:02:24,288 --> 01:02:25,558
from my past life.

752
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:27,718
Are you sure you can handle...

753
01:02:28,058 --> 01:02:29,618
whatever I tell you?

754
01:02:29,618 --> 01:02:32,188
Why did you do that? Why?

755
01:02:32,618 --> 01:02:34,358
Please kill me with your own hands.

756
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:37,088
- Jin Oh! - Mr. Yu!

757
01:02:37,558 --> 01:02:40,688
Su Hyeon, it's not your fault.

758
01:02:41,118 --> 01:02:44,588
Seo Hui Young and Shin Yul's novel might be finished,

759
01:02:44,858 --> 01:02:49,158
but Han Se Ju and Yu Jin Oh's novel isn't finished yet.
