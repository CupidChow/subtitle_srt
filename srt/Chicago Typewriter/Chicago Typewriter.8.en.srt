1
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:19,321
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,333
- Gosh. - What do you think you're doing?

3
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:31,473
That's my question to you. What do you think you're doing?

4
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:34,403
- What did I do? - At this late hour.

5
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,533
you and the man were alone...

6
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,443
in the closed room.

7
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:45,073
You two showed a typical cliche in the rain.

8
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:47,473
Are you jealous right now?

9
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:49,303
What?

10
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,203
Do you like me?

11
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:56,203
- Hey. - Did someone have you do this?

12
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:05,403
Do you believe...

13
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:09,673
in a magical being?

14
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:23,003
I'll answer.

15
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:24,903
To what?

16
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:27,173
I'll tell you the reason I am acting like this.

17
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:34,573
Okay. but be honest.

18
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,773
When I see you.

19
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,433
my heart beats.

20
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:55,203
but I'm not sure about...

21
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,133
whether it's because of you...

22
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:02,833
or it's because of someone...

23
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:06,733
I met long time ago. I'm confused.

24
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:10,973
Her face overlaps...

25
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:13,333
when I see your face.

26
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,903
Then. my heart beats.

27
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:21,303
I don't know which one makes my heart beat. I'm confused.

28
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:22,773
Gosh.

29
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,273
You mean...

30
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,573
someone is better than no one?

31
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:30,873
What?

32
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,703
What is this nonsense?

33
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:45,403
I was being honest but what's wrong with her?

34
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:58,873
Who are you? Why do you keep showing up in front of me?

35
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,573
Who are you? Why do you appear in my dream.

36
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,703
in my head.

37
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:08,803
and in my novel? Why!

38
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:11,033
Was it like that?

39
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,073
He was sometimes kind to me.

40
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:16,403
He sometimes changed his attitude.

41
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,573
Was it all because of that?

42
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:22,233
Was it just because I resemble his first love?

43
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,033
He has seen her so far.

44
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:29,273
not me.

45
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,133
I don't understand. seriously.

46
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:42,933
Why on earth was she angry?

47
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:49,103
You've never dated anyone. have you?

48
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,603
Who said I've never been in a relationship?

49
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,973
How could you compare her with another woman there?

50
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:57,803
Did I? I just said I'm confused.

51
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:59,503
That's comparing.

52
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:02,433
What kind of woman would like a man who sees another woman through her?

53
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,003
It's just normal to get angry.

54
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:06,203
Hey. let me set the record straight.

55
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:09,133
According to your logic. Jeon Seol...

56
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,373
is Ryu Su Hyeon after her rebirth.

57
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:12,733
You mean she's angry at herself?

58
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:15,373
Jeon Seol doesn't know.

59
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,233
She doesn't remember her former life.

60
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,073
What's your IQ?

61
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:27,503
Can't you imagine how your words will hurt others' feelings?

62
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,133
You brat.

63
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:31,403
Hey. get out of here.

64
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:34,843
A novel or anything? I won't work with you. Get out now!

65
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,633
(Chicago Typewriter)

66
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:00,803
Who are you there?

67
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:10,703
Seol. are you okay?

68
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,903
Why do you sweat a lot?

69
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,933
I can't do it.

70
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,803
It's just a beginning. Mr. Han.

71
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,203
No. I can't.

72
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:45,503
I want nothing. Why do I have to stand in their romance?

73
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,503
I do have many things on my mind.

74
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:50,303
If you try more...

75
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,773
I've been afraid that I would sin...

76
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,673
with my writing during my whole life.

77
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,903
Do I have to care about my words?

78
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,903
I can't do it.

79
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:03,603
- Once a man draws a sword... - Even if he does.

80
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:05,073
he should put it back in the place when it's not right.

81
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,773
That's real spirit of man. I'm sorry.

82
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:12,203
The deal's off. Goodbye.

83
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,403
Hope you enter nirvana.

84
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,133
Can't you just do it?

85
00:06:32,803 --> 00:06:36,273
Please just take that away.

86
00:06:36,303 --> 00:06:38,073
I don't feel like eating anymore.

87
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:49,633
- Please. - You startled me.

88
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:51,733
Don't.

89
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,373
Can I ask you something?

90
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:07,733
Why are you so obsessed with Seol?

91
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:12,133
For me. protecting her is as important as finishing the novel.

92
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:16,203
Did you love her in your past life or something?

93
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,903
- What if I did? - Give up.

94
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:24,173
You probably couldn't enter nirvana because of your obsession.

95
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:31,373
You really haven't had any experience of being in love.

96
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:33,473
What?

97
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:36,873
If you have ever been in love.

98
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:40,033
you wouldn't tell me to give up so easily.

99
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:41,203
Look.

100
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:44,773
you are a ghost and Seol is a human being.

101
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:47,703
She can't even see you.

102
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,503
That's why I'm asking you to protect her...

103
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:53,803
while I find a way to show myself.

104
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,003
What if...

105
00:07:57,033 --> 00:08:00,603
she likes me first during the process. What would you do?

106
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:03,833
That's impossible.

107
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:06,433
If you keep on acting like this...

108
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:09,273
that would never happen.

109
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,533
Are you laughing at me?

110
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,303
What was left of my sympathy for you has disappeared.

111
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,503
I won't. Go away. I won't help you.

112
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:24,133
All right. Our deal ends here.

113
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,873
Your confusion and slump...

114
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,833
are yours to handle.

115
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:34,633
Wait.

116
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,403
What's the matter?

117
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:45,633
All right. I'll do it.

118
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:48,503
I will. All right?

119
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:51,133
No. I want a written contract.

120
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:52,203
What do you want to write?

121
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:54,473
A contract for writing and living together.

122
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:07,503
Let's start.

123
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,003
(Co-writing Contract)

124
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,303
Contract for co-writing clause one.

125
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:17,443
- I. Han Se Ju... - And I. Yoo Jin Oh...

126
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,133
will share everything together until we finish the novel.

127
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:22,203
Wait.

128
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,203
Let's just say we live together. not share everything together.

129
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,103
We will live together.

130
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:34,203
Han Se Ju will never. under any circumstances.

131
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:37,943
tell Yoo Jin Oh to get lost.

132
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:41,333
I only said that a few times. We don't need that in the contract.

133
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,833
"Only a few times?"

134
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:45,443
Get lost. Get lost.

135
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,703
Get lost. Get lost. Get lost. now!

136
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,703
All right. My turn.

137
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:55,443
Yoo Jin Oh will never try to unnecessarily entertain Han Se Ju...

138
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,173
and interrupt his daily life.

139
00:09:58,173 --> 00:10:01,443
I only did that a few times.

140
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,833
"Only a few times?"

141
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,033
- Gosh. - Gosh.

142
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:15,133
Wait. Seol.

143
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:20,533
All right. My turn.

144
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:23,073
Han Se Ju will never use violence...

145
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,103
on Yoo Jin Oh both physically and mentally.

146
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:28,533
I only did that a few times.

147
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:30,903
Hey.

148
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:32,573
Hey.

149
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:35,203
Let go!

150
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:39,443
My turn.

151
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,873
Yoo Jin Oh will never interrupt Han Se Ju during a conversation...

152
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:47,803
and cause any confusions.

153
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:49,173
My turn.

154
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:54,333
Han Se Ju has to find a way for Yoo Jin Oh to show himself.

155
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,703
And before I get the ability to possess human beings.

156
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:01,803
he has to protect Jeon Seol from other men.

157
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:05,603
My turn. Yoo Jin Oh will never...

158
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:09,703
try to possess Han Se Ju.

159
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,003
My turn.

160
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,303
Han Se Ju will...

161
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:20,873
(Co-writing Contract)

162
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:23,473
So do we have a deal?

163
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:27,033
A deal with the ghost.

164
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,203
I can't believe this.

165
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:33,573
Now that we're partners. can we be friends?

166
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:34,703
No.

167
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:36,333
All right.

168
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,073
Post a postponement notice...

169
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:04,273
for the Literature Camp.

170
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:05,603
Pardon?

171
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:07,603
What should we say?

172
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,903
Don't mention Se Ju's absence.

173
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:12,203
Just say it was postponed due to the publisher's problems.

174
00:12:12,303 --> 00:12:15,033
What if they want a refund?

175
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,633
Give them a refund.

176
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,773
If they are angry. say we're sorry.

177
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:22,503
We should at least carry on with Mr. Baek's camp.

178
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,633
One author is not enough.

179
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:28,903
We were trying to use Han Se Ju's fame to make this work.

180
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:32,833
What should we say to Mr. Baek when he comes here for the camp?

181
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,533
Say something that sounds right.

182
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,873
Do I have to teach you everything?

183
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,073
(Jeon Seol)

184
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:03,273
Hello. Did you get home safe that night?

185
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:04,533
Yes.

186
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:07,503
I wanted to contact you. but...

187
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,503
Did you catch a cold?

188
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:13,273
It's nothing serious.

189
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:16,973
We sent you a message that Baek Seol can leave the hospital.

190
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,703
but you didn't reply.

191
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,773
It must have been during my lecture.

192
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,003
I'll go to the hospital.

193
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:44,733
You look seriously ill. Drink up.

194
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:48,133
You could have a sore throat. You should drink water often.

195
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:50,203
Thank you.

196
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,473
But why were you standing in the rain?

197
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:54,333
Did you breakup with someone?

198
00:13:58,473 --> 00:14:00,173
When I see you.

199
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:02,903
my heart beats.

200
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:05,333
but I'm not sure about...

201
00:14:06,273 --> 00:14:08,333
whether it's because of you...

202
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:14,873
or it's because of someone I met long time ago.

203
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,033
I'm confused.

204
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,373
It's something like that.

205
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:02,133
I know you are excited...

206
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:04,633
but they're looking at me. not you.

207
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:05,733
I know.

208
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:10,033
But walking with you makes me feel like human again.

209
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,573
No one looks at a ghost.

210
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:17,533
When I was at Keijo Imperial University. I would walk around...

211
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:20,833
with Hui Young. and girls would look at us affectionately.

212
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:23,203
Of course they did.

213
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:26,173
And of course. I was more popular.

214
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:30,633
You lie without batting an eye.

215
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,433
So where are we going now?

216
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,873
You need to fulfill the contract.

217
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:39,733
What are we doing?

218
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,033
We ripped Jeon Seol's purse last time.

219
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:44,203
We need to buy her a new one.

220
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:52,033
You are the one who ripped it. and yet I'm the one paying for it.

221
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:56,133
As you know well enough. I am a ghost who doesn't earn a lot.

222
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,503
How about this one?

223
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:03,433
You don't have any taste.

224
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:05,503
Don't you like anything?

225
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:10,073
I don't have any taste? I used to be a fashionista back in my day.

226
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,803
This is a popular product.

227
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:15,473
Don't you know that whenever my photos are taken at the airport.

228
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:18,033
My clothes. my shoes. my bags. and even my glasses

229
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:20,303
get sold out. Didn't you know that?

230
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:22,533
I do know. Mr. Han.

231
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:25,103
Take your time and look around.

232
00:16:37,973 --> 00:16:41,973
I don't know why I have to deal with the trouble you made.

233
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:45,033
Be aware that I'm trying my best.

234
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:49,603
Yes. I will. I'll try my best to help with your novel writing.

235
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:15,803
Her face overlaps...

236
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:18,803
when I see your face.

237
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,703
Then. my heart beats.

238
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:29,533
What's up? I am very busy.

239
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,273
What's this?

240
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:43,533
You'll see if you take it out.

241
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,203
I'm sorry...

242
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,873
for tearing your purse apart last time.

243
00:17:58,173 --> 00:18:00,673
Do you admit it's you who tore it?

244
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:04,003
When I thought about it at home.

245
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:06,903
in that distance. I might have torn it apart.

246
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:10,533
Fine.

247
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,173
You apologized.

248
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,473
I got this for some compensation.

249
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,503
You finished your business. right?

250
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,073
I am at work now. Bye.

251
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:24,773
Is that all?

252
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,373
What if it's not all?

253
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,203
This is a purse.

254
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:32,503
It's a brand purse made of the best quality leather.

255
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:35,903
Won't you show me some reaction?

256
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:43,403
Do you have a cold?

257
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:20,373
What is this?

258
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:23,703
Did you get a purse during that short time?

259
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,433
No.

260
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:28,273
Someone gave it to me.

261
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,073
It's so good.

262
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:33,733
That person has an eye for it.

263
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:38,143
Right. It's my style.

264
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:53,003
I told you to buy the purse I chose.

265
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:55,673
You don't really listen to me.

266
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,573
Is it true...

267
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:01,903
women like purses? Is it!

268
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:04,673
Do you really know women well?

269
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:05,933
According to the article 1. clause 4.

270
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:09,533
Han Se Ju must not use both physical and verbal violence to Yoo Jin Oh.

271
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:12,273
- Another thing... - Pardon?

272
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:15,403
Do you have any idea on another thing Seol is likely to love?

273
00:20:17,273 --> 00:20:18,933
Are you going to meet her again?

274
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:22,773
I want to win after a long time.

275
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:24,433
There is.

276
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,403
There is something she'd really love.

277
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:32,173
This contains red ginseng. It's good for bones.

278
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:35,903
I had pets in my hospital eat it. It may be good since they like it.

279
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,103
Give me one pack.

280
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,203
Give me 10.

281
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:46,873
I want the best quality dog food for my dog. Han Gyun Woo.

282
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:50,273
Gyun Woo.

283
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:53,903
- Oh. my. - How cute.

284
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,673
- How have you been? - So cute.

285
00:20:55,803 --> 00:20:57,273
He's so cute.

286
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:00,433
You...

287
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,433
He's nice.

288
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:06,933
I felt sorry that I didn't have any photos with you.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

289
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,933
Thank you for coming.

290
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:11,473
Isn't he so cute?

291
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:14,643
That's enough. Jin Oh.

292
00:21:15,803 --> 00:21:17,573
1. 2. and 3.

293
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:24,833
This came out great.

294
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,203
You're so cute.

295
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,773
Which one do you like best?

296
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:32,073
Look. I like it best.

297
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:36,003
That's enough! Get away!

298
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:43,673
Seol.

299
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:48,143
There you are. Mr. Baek. Wait a minute.

300
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:55,203
I think we meet too often.

301
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:07,273
Are you leaving without doing anything?

302
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:08,303
If not. what can I do?

303
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,403
With Gyun Woo. you and Seol can take a walk. throw a frisbee.

304
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:12,573
and have a talk. It was you plan.

305
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:13,673
Mr. Baek.

306
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:18,573
Do you have time to drink some tea?

307
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:19,633
Sounds good.

308
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,933
Do you want to go to the suburb with me?

309
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,933
I know a quiet and an atmospheric cafe.

310
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:27,733
- No. I can't because I'm at work. - I see.

311
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:30,803
Shall we go to a cafe nearby?

312
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:32,433
Okay. Wait a minute.

313
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:35,433
Should I go and bite him?

314
00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:38,203
Should I go and take a big bite?

315
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:45,633
Why are you leaving? You should follow and separate them apart.

316
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:46,803
No. I won't.

317
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:49,703
That's enough for me today.

318
00:22:49,873 --> 00:22:52,373
It's your turn to fulfill the condition.

319
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,633
As written in the contract. let's write a novel.

320
00:23:05,273 --> 00:23:08,833
I'm a little nervous. What are you going to say?

321
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:11,873
It's nothing.

322
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:15,803
It's about the work of an assistant.

323
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:17,103
No way.

324
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,273
Don't tell me that you are going to quit.

325
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:23,133
It's not that I want to quit.

326
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:28,133
I don't think I need to go to your workroom for the work.

327
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:30,773
Did Se Ju tell you not to come to my workroom?

328
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:34,073
What do you mean? It has nothing to do with him.

329
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:39,303
Then why are you drawing a line? It hurts very much.

330
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:43,903
It's been long since I stopped reading references. I forgot many.

331
00:23:43,903 --> 00:23:47,533
I want to read the books in the library and do it well.

332
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:49,473
Let's do it together in the library.

333
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:51,833
It's better to check it out face to face.

334
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,273
I'll send drafts to you by email.

335
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:56,003
It's more convenient. I think.

336
00:23:57,173 --> 00:24:00,173
I'll make sure I won't delay your publication schedule.

337
00:24:02,803 --> 00:24:05,003
Okay. do as you want.

338
00:24:05,873 --> 00:24:07,733
Thank you for understanding me.

339
00:24:08,003 --> 00:24:11,133
No. I asked you too much in the first place.

340
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:38,203
You don't want to make a personal relationship with me?

341
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:43,073
I told you. I won't let you take her.

342
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:45,173
One author is not enough.

343
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:49,403
We were trying to use Han Se Ju's fame to make this work.

344
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:09,873
Aren't you writing a novel?

345
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:13,173
Be quiet. I'm trying to focus.

346
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:15,803
Unless you write the novel right now.

347
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,803
I have a favor to ask.

348
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:21,673
Look at this shameless ghost.

349
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:24,033
What favor are you going to ask of me again?

350
00:25:25,973 --> 00:25:29,173
I'm working on possession training.

351
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:32,133
I chose several people for the training.

352
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,273
I cannot choose one.

353
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:38,573
Which one do you think Jeon Seol will like?

354
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:44,603
Use all three in turn.

355
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:46,803
That's good. right?

356
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:48,573
Well.

357
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:52,673
could you ask this to Jeon Seol. please?

358
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:56,273
Do you think I'll do such a ridiculous thing for you?

359
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,033
Which one is closest to your type of men?

360
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:13,533
I see.

361
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:16,573
I am the one. right?

362
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:22,673
Did you ask me out for the question?

363
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,073
What?

364
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:33,533
If you don't have any further question. can I go back?

365
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:37,203
Hold on a second.

366
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,303
Do you still have questions?

367
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,833
Do you like Tae Min?

368
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:58,033
That's why you came here.

369
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,533
Do you like Baek Tae Min...

370
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:02,803
in a romantic way?

371
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:12,033
Regardless of gender. Tae Min...

372
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,703
"Regardless of gender"? Why do you keep saying that?

373
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,703
Don't writers have gender? Are they hermaphrodites?

374
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,673
I was just answering your question. Why are you upset?

375
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,833
All right. Fine.

376
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:25,673
So you don't like him in a romantic way. right?

377
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:32,273
I should get going.

378
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:35,203
What kind of person is she?

379
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:38,203
Who?

380
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:42,203
The person who resembles me.

381
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,533
- Let's go... - Let's go for a walk.

382
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:27,673
You're not answering.

383
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:31,133
What is the person who resembles me like?

384
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:34,873
A cool woman.

385
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:38,803
She's bold and determined.

386
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:42,033
She's good at shooting and patriotic.

387
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,003
She told me...

388
00:28:46,203 --> 00:28:49,173
to write something magnificent.

389
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:54,573
It sounds like Ryu Su Hyeon.

390
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:01,903
Do you know her?

391
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:04,473
Do you know who she is?

392
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:09,003
Of course I do.

393
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,873
It's the main character in your novel.

394
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,973
So she was the basis.

395
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,573
So what happened to her in the end?

396
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,173
It didn't seem like it's going to be a happy ending.

397
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:35,633
I don't remember how it ended up.

398
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:40,133
It must have been a painful memory...

399
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:43,173
you wanted to erase.

400
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,573
Oh. no.

401
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,433
What are you doing?

402
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:56,773
Why did you hold me and then stepped back?

403
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:00,933
I have a bad memory of being brutally hit...

404
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:04,003
from when I tried to check someone's forehead.

405
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,873
I wonder who is missing me so much.

406
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:16,433
They say when one of my shoelaces is untied. someone is missing me.

407
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:19,803
But no one would be missing me. It's just a superstition.

408
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,273
There's someone who misses you.

409
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,303
There's a person who...

410
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:34,503
has been waiting for you for almost 100 years.

411
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,733
There's a person who can't leave you...

412
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:42,573
because of the destiny.

413
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:55,033
You might not be aware of this.

414
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:57,973
but he's watching you from nearby.

415
00:30:59,003 --> 00:31:00,703
So be brave.

416
00:31:08,073 --> 00:31:09,103
Who is it?

417
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:11,203
Is it a magical being?

418
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:15,873
I'm hungry.

419
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:18,973
What about buying me some noodles?

420
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,433
Why do you not write the novel anymore?

421
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,773
You said you're not my fan anymore.

422
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:34,333
Why do you wait for it?

423
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:38,433
I'm your very first fan. I have a right.

424
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:42,103
We're the main characters. I have a share.

425
00:31:51,773 --> 00:31:52,803
You...

426
00:31:53,403 --> 00:31:56,403
You just thought about her again. didn't you?

427
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:01,333
Your eyes are moving.

428
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:05,433
I can tell by just looking at you.

429
00:32:06,303 --> 00:32:08,503
I can tell you're looking at someone else than me.

430
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,173
I don't feel well.

431
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:15,133
It's just two of us. but I feel like there are three people here.

432
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:21,403
Why did you quit shooting?

433
00:32:25,203 --> 00:32:27,033
Why do you want to know that now?

434
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,933
You don't even want to be friends with me.

435
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,333
Everyone who learns about my secret leaves.

436
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:36,203
Are you going to leave as well?

437
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:38,533
Who left you like that?

438
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:43,933
My mom left me and my dream left me.

439
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,203
I don't care.

440
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:53,573
It was nonsense from the first place that I'd tell you when we're closer.

441
00:32:54,403 --> 00:32:56,403
Why would I tell you that when we become closer?

442
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,133
You might leave.

443
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:02,733
If it's such a bad memory. you don't need to answer.

444
00:33:02,803 --> 00:33:04,303
When I grab a gun.

445
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:07,203
I see my past life.

446
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:14,103
I see...

447
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:18,033
myself in the past life shooting and killing someone.

448
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:28,433
Who is it?

449
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:31,873
I don't know.

450
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:35,073
I can only see the person's back.

451
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,633
But...

452
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:42,373
the person must be someone I shouldn't have killed.

453
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:50,133
Whenever I think of that moment.

454
00:33:52,703 --> 00:33:54,303
I feel very sad...

455
00:33:55,203 --> 00:33:56,603
and bad.

456
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:00,403
And it breaks my heart.

457
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:05,273
I can't stop...

458
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:09,433
trembling my hands.

459
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,833
I couldn't hold guns anymore.

460
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:24,633
What do you think?

461
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:27,133
It's scary. isn't it?

462
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,058
I didn't know she also had the memory...

463
00:34:56,218 --> 00:34:57,348
of the past life.

464
00:34:59,188 --> 00:35:03,718
She doesn't seem to know Ryu Su Hyeon is herself in the past life.

465
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:09,348
Once the novel you write is publicized.

466
00:35:10,848 --> 00:35:13,088
she will soon recognize it.

467
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:19,418
Is it possible the person she killed...

468
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:23,448
is one of us?

469
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,188
Do you think we should...

470
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:31,818
carry on with this novel?

471
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:38,948
Co-writing Contract article 100. clause 1.

472
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:41,748
Whatever happens with the novel.

473
00:35:45,218 --> 00:35:46,948
we must finish it.

474
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:50,988
All right.

475
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:54,488
Let's carry on with it.

476
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:58,948
We can decide if the world will get to see the novel...

477
00:36:01,418 --> 00:36:04,348
or if it will stay here forever...

478
00:36:04,948 --> 00:36:06,318
after we finish.

479
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:12,588
When did the three of us meet and why?

480
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:19,888
When Heroic Corps brought the guns and explosives to Kyungsung.

481
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:24,518
someone called Ryu Sang Jin hid some of them for us.

482
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:31,588
Su Hyeon was his only daughter.

483
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:35,888
And it was...

484
00:36:36,748 --> 00:36:39,118
the day her father died.

485
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,648
The information leaked out.

486
00:36:57,718 --> 00:37:00,618
Do they know about the weapons too?

487
00:37:05,288 --> 00:37:06,948
Ryu Sang Jin committed a suicide.

488
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,488
Find the daughter who ran away.

489
00:37:08,848 --> 00:37:12,788
She's our only evidence leading to the weapons. Capture her alive.

490
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:13,918
- Yes. sir. - Yes. sir.

491
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:39,948
It was worth waiting here.

492
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:43,688
Are you Ryu Su Hyeon. the daughter of Ryu Sang Jin?

493
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:44,848
No.

494
00:37:55,288 --> 00:37:58,148
How dare she?

495
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:16,558
Who are you?

496
00:38:16,618 --> 00:38:17,688
Stand up.

497
00:38:17,818 --> 00:38:21,348
The Japanese soldiers will be here soon because of the gun shots.

498
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,818
We can't keep moving together.

499
00:38:47,288 --> 00:38:48,918
I'll try to distract them.

500
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:51,148
You should run as fast as you can.

501
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,748
On the way. you'll see an abandoned house.

502
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:56,648
Hide for a while. And then when it gets quiet.

503
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:58,518
go to this place.

504
00:38:58,648 --> 00:39:00,558
(Carpe Diem)

505
00:39:00,558 --> 00:39:02,648
Carpe Diem?

506
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:04,918
Find someone called Shin Yul.

507
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:07,018
She'll help you.

508
00:39:12,888 --> 00:39:13,988
Don't cry.

509
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:18,788
You don't need to be tormented by the fact that you survived.

510
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,218
You need to be stronger.

511
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:23,788
Your father would want that too.

512
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:27,748
Do you know my father?

513
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:32,488
We don't have time. We need to hurry.

514
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:45,118
What is your name?

515
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:47,688
You are a daring girl.

516
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:50,518
You dare ask the name of a masked person.

517
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,688
You can't make me take my mask off.

518
00:39:56,288 --> 00:39:58,688
Tell me your name.

519
00:39:59,388 --> 00:40:01,188
You saved my life.

520
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:03,688
We don't have time.

521
00:40:56,148 --> 00:40:57,948
Call me Shin Yul.

522
00:40:58,518 --> 00:41:01,888
I'll talk to the madam. You need to stick to your male disguise.

523
00:41:01,948 --> 00:41:04,318
You need to hide for a while.

524
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:12,748
You must have gone through so much trouble to come here.

525
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:15,948
I'm sorry...

526
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:18,558
about your father.

527
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:24,348
My friend. are you here?

528
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:34,718
Who's this kid?

529
00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:38,288
He will run errands for us.

530
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:41,648
A new errand boy?

531
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:45,218
Welcome. I'm Seo Hui Young.

532
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:48,518
My old friend.

533
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:52,318
Wait. did you drink?

534
00:41:55,188 --> 00:41:57,518
I think it's the alcohol from last night.

535
00:42:01,948 --> 00:42:03,488
By the way. kid.

536
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:07,058
you look like a girl.

537
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:09,118
Who are you calling a girl?

538
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:11,918
Look at that. He gets upset like a girl.

539
00:42:12,588 --> 00:42:14,118
Stop teasing.

540
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:20,088
If you keep calling me a girl.

541
00:42:20,148 --> 00:42:22,188
you won't be able to eat anything but soup.

542
00:42:22,648 --> 00:42:24,688
He's a daring boy.

543
00:42:25,648 --> 00:42:27,648
Come here. Come here.

544
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:37,518
You are an adult. Don't be a crybaby.

545
00:42:38,148 --> 00:42:39,288
You.

546
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:42,288
I'll hit you one day.

547
00:42:55,688 --> 00:42:57,448
Stop right there.

548
00:42:57,518 --> 00:43:00,148
Let me see what you wrote.

549
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:02,818
Let me see.

550
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:05,548
So we spent years together...

551
00:43:05,788 --> 00:43:08,788
until Su Hyeon became an adult.

552
00:43:12,648 --> 00:43:15,048
So Jeon Seol and I...

553
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:18,788
used to fight a lot in the past life too.

554
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:20,688
You did.

555
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:26,618
So. what's next?

556
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,388
You told me Su Hyeon was once shot.

557
00:43:31,848 --> 00:43:33,148
What happened?

558
00:43:33,788 --> 00:43:35,688
That one?

559
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,718
That is...

560
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,688
Contract article 20. clause 12.

561
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,318
One story a day.

562
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:48,918
Did we have an article like that?

563
00:43:48,948 --> 00:43:50,518
If I tell you everything...

564
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:53,148
you might kick me out as I am useless.

565
00:43:53,518 --> 00:43:55,848
So this is the end of the story for today.

566
00:43:56,848 --> 00:43:58,048
Are you sure he quit writing?

567
00:43:58,088 --> 00:44:00,918
There was a postponement notice.

568
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:03,718
And Mr. Gal looks tired.

569
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:07,048
It doesn't seem like a groundless rumor.

570
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:11,548
All right.

571
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:18,188
Can you get the list of investors for that 10 million dollar project?

572
00:44:19,418 --> 00:44:22,088
That could be possible. But why do you want that?

573
00:44:22,288 --> 00:44:23,648
Do me a favor.

574
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:25,818
I'll give you as much as you want.

575
00:44:26,848 --> 00:44:29,488
Let me hear you out.

576
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:31,188
Spread rumors to the investors...

577
00:44:31,488 --> 00:44:34,418
that Han Se Ju quit writing.

578
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:38,018
And if someone tries to withdraw his investment. tell me right away.

579
00:44:38,148 --> 00:44:40,588
- What will you do? - What do you think?

580
00:44:41,118 --> 00:44:43,888
I'll try to get everything from that house.

581
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:45,018
All right.

582
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:47,448
You want to be able to control him.

583
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:50,388
I'll make sure he's beyond recovery if possible.

584
00:44:50,518 --> 00:44:52,888
All right. I'll try.

585
00:44:53,018 --> 00:44:55,018
Okay. Don't let me down.

586
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:04,288
Mr. Jung. can I ask you something?

587
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:08,648
If a contract gets cancelled due to one's fault.

588
00:45:09,488 --> 00:45:12,848
how much cancellation charge can you get me?

589
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,188
("Chicago Typewriter")

590
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:19,618
(Sorry. but the author is taking a break for private reasons.)

591
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,088
("Chicago Typewriter")

592
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:36,188
(What's going to happen to Su Hyeon and Hui Young?)

593
00:45:43,218 --> 00:45:46,648
It seemed like you have something you shouldn't keep in the workroom.

594
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:00,948
What are you doing?

595
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:21,948
Hello. Mr. Kim. How have you been?

596
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,388
Mr. Han didn't make it to the deadline?

597
00:46:29,718 --> 00:46:30,718
Did you just say...

598
00:46:31,618 --> 00:46:33,548
he quit writing?

599
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:41,679
I was worried you might not be at home.

600
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,280
but good that you're here.

601
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,010
You're...

602
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,710
visiting me often these days.

603
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,810
If your wife figures it out. she'll be quite upset.

604
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,710
I heard you quit writing.

605
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,380
Don't tell me you really mean it.

606
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,450
You're the one who always wanted me to quit writing.

607
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,280
It seems like you have a wrong idea about me.

608
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:16,350
Did you just say "a wrong idea"?

609
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,750
Se Ju.

610
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,480
I never wanted you to quit writing.

611
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,150
If I tell you not to quit.

612
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,450
would you?

613
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,580
Stop being hypocritical.

614
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,010
I'm not the 16-year-old boy anymore...

615
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,480
who used to think of you as my savior.

616
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,780
What do you mean?

617
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,250
If you read Tae Min's novel that won the writing contest.

618
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,880
you must have noticed already...

619
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,780
that it's not written by Tae Min.

620
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,280
Then...

621
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,880
are you the one who wrote "Fate" or what?

622
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,350
Why do you pretend not to know it?

623
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,980
Tae Min and I have obviously different writing styles.

624
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,210
Well.

625
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,080
I'm not sure.

626
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,110
How can you prove you wrote "Fate"?

627
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,380
I understand...

628
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,880
you must be jealous that Tae Min won the contest before you.

629
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:36,810
but somethings don't work like that.

630
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,250
I thought you were different.

631
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,080
You're Tae Min's father after all.

632
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,480
Well. I'm not sure what you're talking about.

633
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,410
I see.

634
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,950
Considering the kindness you showed me.

635
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,410
I'll cover it up this time.

636
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,580
Thank you for...

637
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,680
being my father...

638
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,450
and my teacher.

639
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,380
Thank you and stay healthy.

640
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,180
I will never set foot...

641
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,910
in this house again.

642
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,910
Back then. I wanted to trust Tae Min.

643
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,450
I knew he had always been overshadowed by you.

644
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,980
but...

645
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,950
I was always cold to him.

646
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,210
I wanted to trust him...

647
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,410
not as a writer nor as your teacher...

648
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,180
but as his father.

649
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,280
Then...

650
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,180
you shouldn't have brought me here from the first place.

651
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,010
You shouldn't have made me trust and respect you.

652
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,210
You shouldn't have made me think of you as...

653
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,280
my father and my savior.

654
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,980
Do you know why I'm still keeping the original draft of "Fate"?

655
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,910
Whenever I become slack in my work...

656
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,550
and I want to rely on someone.

657
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,710
I told myself I shouldn't trust others.

658
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,450
I shouldn't let others help me.

659
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,980
and I should live on my own.

660
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,910
It was sort of a stimulant that reminded me of those things.

661
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,280
So?

662
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,380
So what are you going to do with that?

663
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,380
Don't worry.

664
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,380
I'm going to keep my word.

665
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,580
I won't tell anyone about it.

666
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,650
It's a shame...

667
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:22,180
that I can't change your mind even with my heartfelt request.

668
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,280
At least...

669
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,510
when I asked you not to quit writing.

670
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,580
I meant it.

671
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,910
I will get going.

672
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:07,550
I want to be alone. Leave me alone.

673
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:10,280
You shouldn't be alone in this kind of situation.

674
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,380
- You should be with friends... - You're not my friend yet.

675
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,580
or someone who you think of when you have a hard time.

676
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,710
There's no such a person.

677
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,080
Please be quiet.

678
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,450
Are you alive now?

679
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,580
What?

680
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,650
Watching you for the last few days.

681
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,410
you didn't seem so different from me who is a ghost.

682
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,580
Don't compare me to you.

683
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,380
You showed your anger because you were angry.

684
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,280
Why do you feel bad?

685
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,280
Did I say I felt bad?

686
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,710
If you're angry. you can show your anger.

687
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,110
If you feel bad. you can make an apology.

688
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,080
If there's a misunderstanding. you can straighten it out.

689
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,180
If you did something wrong. you can ask for forgiveness.

690
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,850
That's life.

691
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,910
Your heart beats.

692
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,150
You can do everything.

693
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,410
Can you tell who is human and who is ghost...

694
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:16,180
between us two?

695
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,610
Are you expecting for someone's visit?

696
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:35,850
Pardon?

697
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,580
No. I was just wondering if it's raining.

698
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,010
I don't think it'll rain.

699
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,980
Right? It doesn't seem like it.

700
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,480
Do you wish it rains?

701
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,280
I should organize the diagnosis chart before I leave.

702
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,010
You shouldn't be alone in this kind of situation.

703
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,080
You should be with friends...

704
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,280
or someone who you think of when you have a hard time.

705
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,410
That's life.

706
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,080
I must have gone crazy.

707
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,780
Why did I say that?

708
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,680
He'll never come again. will he?

709
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,550
But then again. I even got abandoned by my own mom.

710
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,480
This is nothing compared to that.

711
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,710
Nice timing.

712
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:16,480
I was wondering how I should call you out.

713
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,850
I came here to give you this.

714
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,010
although I might be a little late.

715
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,380
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

716
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:58,910
You weren't even moved when I gave you a purse.

717
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,850
I thought you'd never come see me again.

718
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,280
"He'll be scared of me now."

719
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,380
"He'll think I'm crazy."

720
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,450
So I was trying to console myself that it's okay to not see you again.

721
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,650
That's how I thought.

722
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,850
That's how you thought.

723
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:33,550
But I found myself hoping...

724
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:38,710
that you'd come see me at least once...

725
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,480
That's what I was thinking.

726
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:55,380
Are you here with Ryo Su Hyeon again?

727
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,450
Is she also here today?

728
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,510
Who are you looking at?

729
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:08,010
Is it her?

730
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:16,550
I'm looking at you.

731
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,010
There aren't three people here.

732
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:23,580
It's just us.

733
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,510
It's just me and you.

734
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,980
(Chicago Typewriter)

735
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,880
It was great.

736
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:56,080
I really hope you finish writing that story.

737
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,480
I'm confused.

738
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,980
My heart keeps getting stirred up.

739
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,580
I don't know if it's because of Ryu Su Hyeon from my past life...

740
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:07,680
or if it's because of Jeon Seol from my current life.

741
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:11,180
Are you here with Ryu Su Hyeon again?

742
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,610
Who are you looking at? Is it her?

743
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,350
I'm looking at you.

744
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,780
There aren't three people here. It's just us.

745
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:21,980
It's just me and you.
