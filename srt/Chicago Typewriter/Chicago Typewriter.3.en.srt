1
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,455
I should die.

2
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:27,315
A writer who can't write is dead anyway.

3
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:30,818
Well, why do I have to die?

4
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:33,288
Think about all the things I've been through to get here. Darn it.

5
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:35,758
Giving something and taking it away is the worst thing one can do!

6
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:51,388
Your life is very close with death.

7
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:55,818
You'll meet someone every time but you can't tell good from bad.

8
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:03,988
Soon, you will have two special encounters.

9
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:26,958
Try hard. You can only survive that way.

10
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:35,718
If you ever end up in the same situation, I'll just let you die.

11
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:37,158
I won't help you!

What are you doing?

14
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:17,288
Are you trying to read the flow of the energy?

15
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:19,418
Seol's name means "snow", right?

16
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:22,588
Yes, it does. Why are you asking out of the blue?

17
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:29,518
What is it, Wang Bang Wool fairy?

18
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:32,488
It's going to rain. Bring in the clean laundry.

19
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:37,088
Doesn't the forecast say that? Stop pretending you're so psychic.

20
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:40,958
Everyone in the industry knows that you're not that sharp anymore.

21
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:45,488
I'm not sure whether them crossing paths is a good thing or not.

22
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,718
I hope things don't get all tangled up.

23
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:54,688

I'm an avid fan of yours.

28
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,148
Please don't worry about a thing. You'll recover soon.

29
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,978
I'll take good care of you.

30
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:08,878
Where am I?

31
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:11,878

"Misery".

35
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:40,138
You woke up.

36
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,838
Who is she, really?

37
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:44,178
You were very lucky.

38
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,608
All the money you spent on your expensive car was worth it.

39
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:50,408
Does she always have to hold things like a shovel and a syringe?

40
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:52,738
Also, I happened to pass by you...

41
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:56,508
at the perfect timing, which was lucky for you.

42
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,778
What do you say? Isn't it amazing enough to be called a miracle?

43
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:06,208
For goodness' sake. What is this? Does she think I'm a dog?

44
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,278
I can't really say no.

45
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:10,908
What? Can she read my mind?

46
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,378
- Is she really a psychopath? - No.

47
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:18,508
Unfortunately, the heavy rain has seriously affected the road,

48
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:20,308
so the rescue team can't come right away.

49
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:25,278
I gave you first-aid treatment with things I could find in this cabin.

50
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:28,008
All right. Now...

51
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:36,238
Don't move.

52
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,708
- If you keep moving like that... - If I keep moving... What?

53
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,378
What are you going to do? Will you shoot me?

54
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:44,338
Will you break my leg with a hammer?

55
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:56,308
I told you to stop moving.

56
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:58,838
I'm nervous too because I've never done this to a person before.

57
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:23,108
What's this?

58
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,408
It's liquid diet.

59
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:28,038
I was going to spoon-feed you, but there is no spoon here.

60
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:30,708
You should've told me first.

61
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,208
After you eat, you have to take the medicine.

62
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:36,138
No. How can I possibly know what it's for?

63
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,738
You were supposed to, but I thought it would be too tough for you.

64
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:42,408
So I ground it and put it in the liquid diet.

65
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,178
Darn it.

66
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:48,638
Why didn't you tell me first?

67
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:52,478
You just took a strong painkiller, so you'll feel sleepy.

68
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,908
Don't worry and take a nap.

69
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,878
How can I not worry?

70
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:02,878
How would I know what you're going to do while I'm asleep?

71
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,378
I can't fall asleep.

72
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:11,908
I can't fall asleep.

73
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,708
I should write.

74
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:19,778
It's 10 o'clock. Is it here?

75
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:20,838
It's not here.

76
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:24,538
- What do we do? - This is crazy.

77
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:43,838
What about Mr. Han?

78
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:46,138

is it strange to live with me for the first time?

Right. I have a gift for you.

107

I found this in the snow when I went hiking.

but doesn't it look like it would bear a great story?

Look at it. The second hand...

112
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:32,778
is made with gold, rather than the hour hand.

113

What I am saying is...

122
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:05,578

I engraved your advice in my heard like a tattoo,

128
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:24,378
and I'm always trying to enjoy my life.

133
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:41,878
Of course.

She scattered his ash in that mountain.

135
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:48,408
So around this time every year, she goes there alone and spend days.

136
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:50,338
She also goes there when she fills frustrated.

137
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:52,808
So that's where she's gone.

138
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:54,738
I thought it was something else.

139
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,938
She's been out of touch for a month, so I thought something happened.

140
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,538
What's the bad news then?

I told you that you can't escape because we are isolated.

Don't come near me.

You're not well. So why do you do this?

151
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:47,008

No!

What? It's a spoon.

155
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,138
You had a spoon.

How can I dare to feed you with that dirty spoon?

159
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,638
Unspecified individuals have used them.

160
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:21,838
Then did you tie me up because unspecified individuals...

161
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,178
have used my body?

162
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:24,678
I was worried that your bones were fractured.

163
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:27,238
That's why I tied you up before putting on the cast.

164
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:30,008
I released you only because you seemed to be fine.

165
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,508
You're just taking revenge on me, aren't you?

You're holding a grudge on me, aren't you?

167
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:37,808
The former is wrong, and the latter is right.

168
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,738
Goodness.

169
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:43,238
Your grudge is as great as the Great Wall.

170
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:47,478
I'm thankful to you for providing me good materials.

171
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:52,538
Where are you going in the middle of the conversation?

172
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:54,078
Where are you going?

173
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:55,978
Can't you hear me?

174
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:01,378
Where are you going with that shovel?

175
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,038
I must have something to dig.

176
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,708
Are you going to dig my grave?

177
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,738
Goodness, aren't you imaginative?

178
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:11,178
I didn't think of that.

179
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:15,608
Will you keep being sarcastic?

180
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,808
What is it that you want to know?

181
00:16:18,038 --> 00:16:19,278
Why are you here?

182
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:22,308
Because you grabbed me.

183
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:28,338
How did you know I was going to get into an accident here?

184
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:31,778
How did you manage to be here just on time for it?

185
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:35,308
Why? Do you think I planned this too?

186
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:38,608
Are you suggesting that I did something to your car?

187
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:42,178
Isn't it strange that there are too many coincidences?

188
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:45,138
What do I have to do to make you stop suspecting me?

189
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,478
This is my father's cabin. Are you happy now?

190
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:49,178
I was on the way to find the keepsake from my father...

191
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,478
which I lost while carrying you.

192
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:53,008
I'm taking a shovel because I'm worried it might've been buried.

193
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:57,408
I am the one who's curious about why you are here.

194
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,478
Are you happy? Are you happy now?

195
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,008
Stop screaming like a pig.

196
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:07,778
I was crazy. I shouldn't have saved you again.

197
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:09,738
Hey.

198
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,238
What you just said...

199
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,778
is very cheap.

200
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:15,978
"He must have changed."

201
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:18,138
"He'll learn something if I save him this time."

202
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,948
"What will he say when he wakes up?"

203
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:23,378
"If he apologizes for last time and thanks me for saving him,"

204
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:27,078
"I'll forgive him." I was an idiot to think so.

205
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:32,778
Don't be so harsh on yourself.

206
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:35,508
Remember, we're isolated.

207
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:39,508
Your body is wrecked, and you have no one but me here.

208
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:43,008
If you want to survive, stop yelling at me and ask me for help.

209
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:47,038
Didn't you say you'd never need anyone's help?

210
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,838
What's with her attitude?

211
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:44,578
Write. Stop acting so weak and start writing.

212
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:47,808
It's been a month. You're not in your right mind.

213
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:49,638
We need a solution!

214
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:55,948
We'll lose so much if the 10 million-dollar project goes wrong.

215
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:49,948
(Stalker)

216
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:10,308
You said we've met before, right?

217
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,408
When was it?

218
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,678
Replenish your energy.

219
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:44,238
I'm your first fan.

220
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:08,338
Here we go.

221
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:27,308
See?

222
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:30,108
If you save my life,

223
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:33,338
I save yours too.

224
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,178
That's who I am.

225
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:05,178
We're too close.

226
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:11,908
If this turns out to be your trick, you'll be dead meat.

227
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:16,108
Come here.

228
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:23,438
I'm sorry for last time.

229
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,538
Thank you...

230
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:29,538
for this time.

231
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:34,008
Gosh, it makes me cringe.

232
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:39,038
Don't get me wrong. I'm bad at saying these things.

233
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:43,508
That's why I try not to create situations where I have to say them.

234
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:46,308
Why can't you trust people?

235
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:48,938
Do you want to look like a celebrity?

236
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,938
I've been stabbed in the back too many times.

237
00:23:51,938 --> 00:23:54,408
That must be why.

238
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:56,978
Everyone gets stabbed in the back now and then.

239
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:01,838
Let me ask you something.

240
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:03,608
Go ahead.

241
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:06,908
Why aren't you laughing?

242
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:09,708
You used to laugh so much.

243
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:13,478
It's because you said I remind you of "Misery".

244
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:17,478
I'm not your fan anymore because you think I'm a stalker.

245
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:20,708
Then why is your heart beating so fast?

246
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:24,038
What are you talking about?

247
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,438
Your heart.

248
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:27,178
Don't you feel it?

249
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,538
Your heart is pounding right now.

250
00:24:32,578 --> 00:24:33,738
Gosh.

251
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:32,808
I understand.

252
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,508
I understand everything.

253
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,808
You can't fall asleep, right?

254
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:44,738
This situation is what any fan would dream about.

255
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:48,238
You don't have to try to hide your feelings.

256
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:54,308
It'll only make you suffer.

257
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,638
It's not only you.

258
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,438
Don't feel too embarrassed.

259
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,378
People say,

260
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:08,638
once you fall in love with me, it's impossible to get over me.

261
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:14,178
I now know that you're not a stalker.

262
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:19,338
You're just a girl who is a little clumsy.

263
00:26:21,138 --> 00:26:23,208
All the misunderstandings have been cleared up.

264
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:27,208
Now you can continue to be my fan, right?

265
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:44,208
What is she, really?

266
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:09,078
Gosh, I almost choked in here.

267
00:27:23,878 --> 00:27:27,038
Mr. Han. Are you okay, Mr. Han?

268
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:29,538
Mr. Han. Are you all right?

269
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:35,578
Gosh, what should I do?

270
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:44,738
Wait just a little. I'll go bring a doctor or a rescue team.

271
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:46,638
Please hang in there.

272
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:48,678
Don't go.

273
00:27:55,338 --> 00:27:56,578
Don't go.

274
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:59,438
If you go back now,

275
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:04,778
an abyss would unfold.

276
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:11,478
I'm a little scared.

277
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:17,738
Right now...

278
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:25,578
I feel like I'd be okay even if I die like this now.

279
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:27,908
Mr. Han.

280
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:32,678
I don't want to go back to the old days.

281
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:39,138
The time 10 years ago was like a nightmare.

282
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:43,838
It was absolutely horrible.

283
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:48,038
I don't want to go back.

284
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:54,238
I don't know what happened,

285
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:57,808
but we have to go back.

286
00:29:03,938 --> 00:29:05,708
I heard that your talent...

287
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,838
will be taken away when you can't overcome an obstacle.

288
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:11,438
I don't want...

289
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:15,678
to see you losing the talent you have.

290
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:22,278
Your writings saved my life 10 years ago.

291
00:29:23,738 --> 00:29:27,678
So please. Don't lose your talent.

292
00:29:28,378 --> 00:29:29,838
For you...

293
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:32,508
and for me.

294
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:54,861
What happened?

295
00:29:56,677 --> 00:29:58,377
Why am I here?

296
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:12,511
Is it you, Ji Seok?

297
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:51,581
("Chicago Typewriter" 1st week script)

298
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,311
What is this?

299
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:02,781
Who wrote this manuscript in my place?

300
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,381
Let's hire a ghost writer. Only until you overcome the slump.

301
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:08,181
No one would find it out.

302
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:20,081
Hey, Se Ju. You woke up.

303
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,211
Are you all right?

304
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:24,641
Have you fully recovered?

305
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:26,641
Is it you?

306
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:30,581
Yes, it's me. Can you recognize me?

307
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,581
Gosh, Se Ju...

308
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:36,281
Doctor Park visited every day to treat you.

309
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:38,511
You'd already be dead if it weren't for her.

310
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:40,281
It looks like you got proper first-aid treatment.

311
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:42,881
Do you know that you were unconscious for two full days?

312
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:45,841
It was due to overwork and hangover. You also took too much anxiolytics.

313
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:48,511
I'm so glad that you only got a few bruises and scratches.

314
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:52,081
Thank goodness. I was really worried about you.

315
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:57,311
I'm going to ask you once again. You better answer properly.

316
00:31:57,941 --> 00:31:58,981
Answer what?

317
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:01,781
Did you do it?

318
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:05,541
Why would I do such a thing?

319
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:07,781
Then who is it? Who did it?

320
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:09,641
You did it to yourself! Who do you think did it?

321
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:12,581
You're the one who took anxiolytics and drank until you dropped.

322
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:15,381
I'm not talking about that.

323
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:18,481
That serial novel.

324
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:19,981
What about it?

325
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,911
You faxed us the manuscript on the morning of the accident.

326
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:26,811
I faxed it to you?

327
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,141
Yes! You sent it. It came from your fax number.

328
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:31,741
Didn't you send it because you wanted us to post it?

329
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,841
It's getting so many views and comments. What's your problem?

330
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:39,611
- Are you serious? - Yes, you punk!

331
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:42,411
From the number of views and comments to the ratings,

332
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:43,941
it's become a huge hit.

333
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:47,541
Even the investors are grinning from ear to ear.

334
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:51,111
Gosh, Se Ju. You little monster.

335
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:53,011
You're a lovely little monster.

336
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,711
Do a good job next week too, okay?

337
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:06,381
Gosh, he has a good instinct. I almost got caught there.

338
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:09,641
You didn't actually get caught, so all is good.

339
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:13,381
The manuscript is done. Will there be no issues?

340
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:16,641
You're very cruel though. He's done so much work over the years.

341
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:19,381
How can you try to threaten him just because he whined a little?

342
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:24,711
I admit that it was a bit cruel. But if this is the only way to survive,

343
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:26,811
there's no need to avoid it.

344
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:33,841
This is why they say sinful people are reincarnated as writers.

345
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:35,081
Goodness.

346
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:59,481
Did I really write this?

347
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:03,381
It is the story I wanted to write.

348
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:05,451
Who did this?

349
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:11,881
Right.

350
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:14,341
That night, I took anxiolytics and drank.

351
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:16,181
After that...

352
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:23,381
Did I write it that night when I was half-unconscious?

353
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,641
Did I forget all about it due to amnesia?

354
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:29,951
- Or... - You did it to yourself!

355
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:32,281
You're the one who took anxiolytics and drank until you dropped.

356
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,511
What about it?

357
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:36,181
You faxed us the manuscript on the morning of the accident.

358

More than one million people have read it!

Only five episodes are out so far, and I'm dying to read the rest.

Who are the lame people that read Han Se Ju's new novel?

375
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:17,541
It's an action romance period novel, and his soul's in it.

378
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,311
I wrote it.

379

I must've written it.

Unless someone opened my brain,

381
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:31,881
no one could never write down my ideas as precisely as this.

382

So...

383
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,331
I must've written it.

("Chicago Typewriter" production press conference)

387

First, I will introduce Director Koo Bon Hee,

00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:54,241
who will direct the film. The shoot is to begin early next year.

Cartoonist Min Ji will be drawing the cartoon.

Lastly, I'll introduce the person who is at the core of this project.

392
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:10,801
He's Korea's Stephen King.

- He's the idol writer. - Goodness, he's so handsome.

I know.

395
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:23,941
I wouldn't write if I were him. I'd be an actor.

I know.

397
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:27,101
He could've given me his face.

398
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:29,401
It's a shame that he only stays in his writing studio.

It's about love and youth about a man and a woman.

403
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:43,841
It's hard to say it now.

I won't ask you to.

I won't hear about that boring novel called "One Roof" something.

Your novel is fun.

434
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:17,871
The composition is original,

435
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:20,541
and I loved that you changed your writing style to fit the subject.

436
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,771
Would that be the reason?

437
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:25,711
At first, it didn't feel like your novel, and it felt strange.

438

What do you mean by that?

439
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:35,211
Why do you look so serious?

440
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:36,741
Why do you pretend to be stupid?

441
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,571
I'm asking what your real intention is.

442
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,301
What real intention?

443
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:44,501
You almost abhor dating.

444
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:46,501
And you wrote a romance novel.

445
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:48,801
So I was surprised by it.

446
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:50,211
That's all I meant.

447
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:59,341
How can a writer have that hairstyle?

448
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:01,171
Doesn't it bother you when you write?

449
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:04,371
Because people call you the idol of literary world,

450
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:06,941
don't pretend to be a celebrity.

451
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:09,501
Stop going to a hair salon...

452
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:11,771
and write more like me.

453
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:14,171
Write like crazy.

454
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:47,711
Did you call me, Dad?

455
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:58,241
Did you read my script?

456
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:06,211
What did you think?

457
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:09,171
I fixed it according to your advice.

458
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:10,901
Writer Baek Tae Min.

459
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:13,541
Yes.

460
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:19,741
You're not going to hand it to the publisher like this, are you?

461
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:23,441
I still need to fix it a little more,

462
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:25,071
but I think it's much better than the first draft.

463
00:41:25,071 --> 00:41:27,211
You should rewrite it from the start.

464
00:41:30,271 --> 00:41:33,711
A sentence that doesn't contain the writer's soul is like garbage.

465
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:37,771
Until when will you be conscious of Mr. Han when you write?

466
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:40,801
I was never conscious of him.

467
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:43,341
If you are not confident to surpass the person you imitated,

468
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:45,241
don't even try to imitate him from the start.

469
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:48,001
If you were planning on publishing this garbage,

470
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:50,711
you'd disappoint me greatly.

471
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:54,971
Take this.

("Unfair Game")

Stop! Stop!

475
00:42:26,971 --> 00:42:29,711
How many times did I tell you not to do that?

476
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:31,441
Why would you do that again? Why?

477
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:32,941
What did she do this time?

478
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:36,271
She was praying to a bowl of water to become good at writing.

479
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:37,841
She did that last time,

480
00:42:37,841 --> 00:42:39,901
and it only made her go shopping more.

481
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:43,171
She spent all the money that I was left with no money at all.

482
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:47,301
That's why I'm working at the bookstore and paying you back.

483
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:49,171
How dare you yell at me?

484
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:51,171
What are you going to do if you get possessed?

485
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:54,271
Gosh, don't worry. She's so distracted...

486
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,771
that even ghosts won't be able to stand her.

487
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:57,971
What?

488
00:42:58,771 --> 00:43:02,001
It will just repeat going in and out of her, and it will just go out.

489
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:04,101
- Seol. - Seol.

00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:07,041
You are still the same.

491
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:10,971
I am back, everyone!

492
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:13,071
Welcome back!

493
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:15,471
You're back!

494
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:18,201
Let's celebrate Seol's safe return.

495
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:20,741
- Cheers. - Cheers.

496
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:26,541
- Bam, bam, bam. - Bam, bam, bam.

497
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:29,071
You stayed in the mountain for one month.

498
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:30,871
What did you do there?

499
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:35,741
I just received the good energy of the wintery mountain.

500
00:43:36,571 --> 00:43:38,471
And I said hi to Dad.

501
00:43:38,471 --> 00:43:42,201
I read some books, saved animals and a man...

502
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:48,101
It was a meaningful time.

503
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:50,701
Something happened.

504
00:43:51,571 --> 00:43:52,971
Nothing happened.

505
00:43:52,971 --> 00:43:55,841
I was just isolated because of the heavy rain.

506
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:59,271
I've been telling fortune for 30 years.

507
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:00,941
You can't fool me.

508
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:03,701
Were you with a man?

509
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:06,371
You're silly.

510
00:44:06,371 --> 00:44:08,271
That was so gross.

511
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:10,901
Right. It seems like...

512
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:13,501
Han Se Ju has overcome the slump.

513
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:15,001
He recently started publishing his new serial novel,

514
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:16,501
and it's a big hit.

515
00:44:16,801 --> 00:44:18,141
Did you say he began publishing a new serial novel?

516
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:19,171
Yes.

517
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:21,571
Has it been about five days?

518
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:25,371
Stop. You've had enough for the day.

519
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:29,841
Mom, you drank eight bottles alone.

520
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,941
We're just on our third shots.

521
00:44:31,941 --> 00:44:32,941
Shut it.

522
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:34,671
You succeeded...

523
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:36,441
- to get back on your feet. - It will help me with my power.

524
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:39,041
When you finish publishing the next script by 10am tomorrow,

525
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:41,171
you will be free for a while.

526
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:43,901
Are you okay with the deadline?

527
00:44:45,671 --> 00:44:47,101
Should I fix it?

528
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:49,501
No.

529
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:52,341
It will be out on time.

530
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:54,441
Okay, sir.

531
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:56,801
Mr. Han,

532
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:01,301
I am really glad...

533
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:03,541
that you overcame the slump.

534
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,301
Well, then.

535
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:24,701
At first, it didn't feel like your novel, and it felt strange.

536
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:28,341
I am really glad...

537
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:30,441
that you overcame the slump.

538
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,301
Hey, buddy.

539
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:10,971
Who are you?

540
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,641
I asked who you are.

541
00:46:17,471 --> 00:46:19,041
I'm Seo Hwi Young.

542
00:46:20,201 --> 00:46:21,771
Seo Hwi Young?

543
00:46:57,901 --> 00:46:59,701
Step aside!

544
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:01,641
Step aside!

545
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:22,371
- Welcome! - Hello!

546
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:24,671
- Come and have a look. - Step aside.

547
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:32,241
That way! Go!

548
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:37,141
Why aren't you running? Do you have a death wish?

549
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:47,641
Darn it.

550
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,201
Run! Run as fast as you can!

551
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:53,071
Run as fast as you can!

552
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:59,001
- Why don't you step aside! - Step aside!

553
00:48:20,971 --> 00:48:22,801
I told you to keep your eyes on them!

554
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:24,771
- Gosh. - Darn it.

555
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:31,801
Instead of writing such crappy romance,

556
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,441
why don't you do something that helps our country like this?

557
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:38,771
Find them!

558
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:04,201
It seems like you did a great work the country today.

559
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,101
What was...

560
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:10,641
Stop acting innocent.

561
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:12,971
I know you are a playboy.

562
00:49:16,101 --> 00:49:19,071
Take this. Didn't you say it's a keepsake from your father?

563
00:49:19,701 --> 00:49:20,941
A keepsake from my father?

564
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:25,771
Are you saying...

565
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,101
this is mine?

566
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:28,601
What are you talking about?

567
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:31,201
You've been making a fuss over it as if it was your secret wife.

568
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,001
You wouldn't even let me touch it.

569
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:36,671
Anyway, this clears my debts.

570
00:49:37,771 --> 00:49:38,801
You...

571
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:43,941
Why are you being chased?

572
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:47,801
If you are going to stay indifferent then keep it that way to the end.

573
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:50,541
You wouldn't want to be hurt because of your curiosity.

574
00:49:51,301 --> 00:49:52,301
Hey.

575
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:57,201
Don't fall for me because of what happened today.

576
00:49:57,201 --> 00:50:00,641
It was just for the revolution.

577
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:11,981
This is...

578
00:51:12,721 --> 00:51:15,321
what I dreamed just now.

579
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:20,851
What on earth is going on?

580
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,858
Mr. Han. Is your work...

581
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:42,458
You wrote it with a typewriter again.

582
00:51:42,658 --> 00:51:45,198
Let me type it on the computer and send it.

583
00:51:47,828 --> 00:51:48,958
Mr. Han?

584
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,028
This isn't what I wrote.

585
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:55,498
Mr. Han. Do you want to correct it?

586
00:51:57,098 --> 00:51:58,198
This is...

587
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,058
not...

588
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:01,928
my work.

589
00:52:03,858 --> 00:52:05,158
Mr. Han.

590
00:52:15,628 --> 00:52:18,958
I'm going to type it up and send it.

591
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:42,158
Thank you for the article about Se Ju's stalker.

592
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,098
I'm glad you liked it.

593
00:52:44,158 --> 00:52:45,898
I consider it as one of my masterpieces.

594
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:49,458
I like buying masterpieces.

595
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,958
You can consider it as a commission fee.

596
00:52:52,658 --> 00:52:54,958
What do you have in mind?

597
00:52:55,328 --> 00:52:56,628
Do you have any idea?

598
00:52:56,628 --> 00:52:57,828
What about a scandal?

599
00:52:57,828 --> 00:52:59,958
A scandal would rather prove that he's a famous man.

600
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:01,098
I want...

601
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:04,158
Han Se Ju to be completely ruined.

602
00:53:04,158 --> 00:53:05,528
Then...

603
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,358
How about making a rumor that he has a ghostwriter?

604
00:53:10,158 --> 00:53:14,358
Combined with a scandal, it'd make a new story.

605
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,198
I see.

606
00:53:16,828 --> 00:53:18,398
I like the idea.

607
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:19,928
I'll buy it.

608
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:32,928
It was you who did that, right?

609
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:36,998
What do you mean?

610
00:53:37,198 --> 00:53:39,758
You hired a ghostwriter behind my back.

611
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:42,228
How did you know that?

612
00:53:43,928 --> 00:53:47,058
I told you I'd do it. I told you I'd write it!

613
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:49,998
I told you I'd write it no matter what!

614
00:53:49,998 --> 00:53:52,898
Se Ju. Calm down and listen to me.

615
00:53:52,898 --> 00:53:55,358
Who is it? Tell me.

616
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:58,698
I suppose you already know this, but I called Mr. Yoo.

617
00:53:58,698 --> 00:54:01,258
It's always good to have a spare tire.

618
00:54:01,258 --> 00:54:04,628
But you've been writing without being stuck, so we don't need that.

619
00:54:04,628 --> 00:54:07,158
So I canceled the deal a long time ago.

620
00:54:07,158 --> 00:54:08,758
That's rubbish!

621
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:10,958
I'm telling you the truth!

622
00:54:11,058 --> 00:54:13,698
Mr. Yoo was upset that I changed my mind.

623
00:54:13,698 --> 00:54:16,358
I had to convince him with money.

624
00:54:16,558 --> 00:54:19,658
Don't be like this to me. I'm really stressed.

625
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,758
You faxed us the manuscript on the morning of the accident.

626
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:31,928
Yes! You sent it. It came from your fax number.

627
00:54:31,928 --> 00:54:34,158
Didn't you send it because you wanted us to post it?

628
00:54:49,428 --> 00:54:50,598
It's a fog again.

629
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:17,628
This is where the accident happened.

630
00:55:19,428 --> 00:55:20,858
Why am I here?

631
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,598
The broken watch?

632
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:35,628
Yes. It's a shame I couldn't find it.

633
00:55:36,028 --> 00:55:39,698
Wouldn't it be impossible to find it in the mountain?

634
00:55:39,698 --> 00:55:41,058
I know.

635
00:55:41,228 --> 00:55:44,828
I searched everywhere for three days, but it was nowhere.

636
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:48,058
My mom said old objects can...

637
00:55:48,158 --> 00:55:50,428
have spirits in them.

638
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:52,828
Free will, so to speak.

639
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:55,198
Hey, that's creepy.

640
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:59,298
Didn't you say that your father picked up that watch in a mountain?

641
00:55:59,528 --> 00:56:01,198
- Yes. - See?

642
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:05,298
The watch must have wanted to go back to its original place.

643
00:56:12,928 --> 00:56:16,198
Maybe it wanted to go back to its original owner.

644
00:56:17,228 --> 00:56:18,658
Who would that be?

645
00:56:19,028 --> 00:56:21,628
That watch is more than 80 years old.

646
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:24,258
If its original owner is still alive, let me see...

647
00:56:24,328 --> 00:56:26,158
10, 20, 30, 40...

648
00:56:26,928 --> 00:56:28,858
That person must be almost 90 by now.

649
00:56:29,058 --> 00:56:30,758
How could such an old person climb a snow-covered mountain?

650
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:33,128
Anyway, just forget it.

651
00:56:33,128 --> 00:56:35,358
The watch is broken anyway.

652
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,958
It's at least right twice a day.

653
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,798
My goodness. That makes it sound wonderful.

654
00:56:39,098 --> 00:56:42,598
It proves that the watch doesn't belong to you.

655
00:56:42,658 --> 00:56:46,058
It won't go. It's not doing its job.

656
00:56:46,628 --> 00:56:49,528
Maybe it doesn't agree with this age.

657
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:04,058
Take this. Didn't you say it's a keepsake from your father?

658
00:57:04,098 --> 00:57:05,698
This is my father's cabin.

659
00:57:05,928 --> 00:57:07,598
I was on the way to find the keepsake from my father...

660
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:09,098
which I lost while carrying you.

661
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,328
I don't know what happened,

662
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,598
but we have to go back.

663
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,828
I heard that your talent...

664
00:57:51,428 --> 00:57:53,598
will be taken away when you can't overcome an obstacle.

665
00:57:57,328 --> 00:57:58,458
I don't want...

666
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:02,928
to see you losing the talent you have.

667
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,158
Who are you?

668
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:22,798
I asked. Who are you?

669
00:59:25,098 --> 00:59:26,528
As you can see,

670
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:29,258
I'm Mr. Han Se Ju's...

671
00:59:29,428 --> 00:59:30,758
ghost writer,

672
00:59:32,298 --> 00:59:33,658
Yoo Jin Oh.

673
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:10,228
(Chicago Typewriter)

674
01:00:10,228 --> 01:00:11,598
Do you know a man called Yoo Jin Oh?

675
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:13,158
How do you know him?

676
01:00:13,398 --> 01:00:15,158
My first fan, my foot.

677
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,258
You like just about everyone.

678
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,458
- Why are you here? - I fell in love with you.

679
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:22,858
Do you have a death wish?

680
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:24,158
That's Mr. Baek.

681
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:27,958
You should learn how to play.

682
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,058
Would you like to grab a beer with me?

683
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,828
Tae Min looks a lot better in real life.

684
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,628
Why did you meet Baek Tae Min? What about me?

685
01:00:33,728 --> 01:00:34,798
Mr. Han.

686
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:36,728
I picked it up on the street.

687
01:00:36,998 --> 01:00:38,658
Are you trying to look like a cold guy?

688
01:00:38,998 --> 01:00:41,928
Where did you learn that line? Do you read web novels?

689
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:43,828
Come with me. I'll treat you to some nice food.

690
01:00:44,158 --> 01:00:46,098
I'll compensate you for finding my heart.

691
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:49,418
You were with her in an isolate cabin?

692
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:53,148
Han Se Ju's girlfriend is in the errand service.

693
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:54,248
I can't believe this.

694
01:00:54,248 --> 01:00:57,648
It's going. The repairman said it was impossible to fix it.

695
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:59,958
- Let's sing - Let's sing

696
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:01,876
- People on the street - People on the street

697
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,065
Why do you keep appearing?

698
01:01:04,255 --> 01:01:05,995
Why do you keep appearing in my dreams,

699
01:01:06,055 --> 01:01:07,895
in my head,

700
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:12,295
and in my novels? Why?
