1
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,398
Do you even know what I've been through to get here?

2
00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:23,098
I will not fall because of a punk like you!

3
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:38,238
By any chance,

4
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:42,068
did you use to be a ghost writer yourself too?

5
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:47,839
(Episode 5)

6
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,169
Until when will you be conscious of Se Ju when you write?

7
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,169
If you are not confident to surpass the person you imitated,

8
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,199
don't even try to imitate him from the start.

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,470
What are you reading?

10
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,240
I saw it on your desk and just got curious.

12
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,040
What is it?

13
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,241
Keep reading.

14
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:45,801
Can I read it?

15
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,771
Why are you even asking?

16
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:50,171
You've always been the first to read everything I write.

17
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,701
You get cranky about it at times though.

18
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:55,171
I guess you're confident about this one.

19
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:58,071
You can pick up your stick after reading it,

20
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,772
but give me some carrots here and there while reading it too.

21
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:05,572
I know that criticism helps me grow and improve, but it does hurt.

22
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,912
Goodness, you're such a cry baby.

23
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:38,002
- How is it? - What?

24
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:39,672
I'm asking what you think about it.

25
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:44,002
Hey, I'm just on the fourth page now.

26
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:48,058
That's no good. That tells it all.

27
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:52,128
It's a fail if the reader isn't captivated by the first two pages.

28
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:54,288
I mean, it's only a short story.

29
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:57,758
I shouldn't show it to Mr. Baek.

30
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,228
Were you planning on showing this to my dad?

31
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:04,958
He told me to bring it.

32
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:07,358
But I probably shouldn't.

33
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:12,258
I can tell from the look on your face that he'll say nothing nice.

34
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:21,258
Did you write Baek Tae Min's "Fate" for him?

35
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,128
Were you his ghost writer?

36
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:30,728
Get out.

37
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:39,088
I...

38
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:42,888
I'd much rather let someone steal my writing...

39
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:45,958
than taking credit for someone else's work.

40
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:12,958
("Fate")

41
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:22,788
Where have you been?

42
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:28,988
I didn't even know you left. I'm asking where you were!

43
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:33,358
Can you not hear me? Am I invisible to you?

44
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,488
Or are you pretending you can't hear me?

45
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:40,528
Do you spend all of your time trying to figure out a way...

46
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:44,698
to make me more miserable instead of writing when you're stuck here?

47
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:48,028
Don't ask me questions that are not worthy answering,

48
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,698
and just cut to the chase.

49
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:57,228
Try to find a day and time you're available.

50
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,828
They're saying there's a big demand for a joint interview to promote it.

51
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:04,128
You should help out because it's for your son.

52
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:05,828
They're still pushing for it?

53
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:08,058
He said no, but that obviously didn't work.

54
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,928
He thought he should at least ask you what you think.

55
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:13,198
That's why he turned around and came back after he left for his trip.

56
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:15,788
- When is good for you? - I don't have any time for it.

57
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:17,158
I can't do it.

58
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:20,028
You can't? Why not?

59
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,828
You can't even do that for your own son?

60
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,928
So is this what you're doing for your son's sake?

61
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:31,928
Digging someone else's grave just to protect that third-rate novel?

62
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:36,888
You know, you should just go shopping instead which you love.

63
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:38,828
Or start painting again.

64
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:41,958
What's wrong with it?

65
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:47,088
That woman ruined my life, and her son...

66
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:49,288
is blocking my son's future.

67
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,558
I can do anything.

68
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:56,158
In this line of work, what matters is ability and talent.

69
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,088
He has to shine on his own.

70
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:00,988
If he needs my name to make a name for himself,

71
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:04,158
he should quit writing for both of our sakes.

72
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:05,528
That will be for the best.

73
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:25,388
Seol.

74
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:27,988
Go away.

75
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:30,988
I can't play with you today.

76
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,888
Your debut novel, "Fate". I was so touched by it.

77
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,488
I guess you didn't like the novels I wrote after that.

78
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:43,988
Oh, that's...

79
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:46,188
Mr. Han Se Ju?

80
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,558
Han Se Ju.

81
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:02,528
Han Se Ju...

82
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,128
Seol.

83
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,858
Why are you being like this?

84
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:13,288
I'm doing some thinking right now.

85
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:22,458
I told you to go away.

86
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:26,128
I said I can't play with you right now.

87
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,228
Even you...

88
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:34,028
are going to slight me?

89
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,128
You can't.

90
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,828
(Chicago Typewriter)

91
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:54,158
Thank you for calling Do Anything. This is...

92
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,188
I curse you, witch.

93
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:00,028
- We love all of our customers. - You piece of...

94
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:02,258
I'm going to pick your eyeballs out and throw them around.

95
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:04,958
How dare you hover around Se Ju? A ghost writer?

96
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:07,858
Shall I kill you so that you can actually become a ghost?

97
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:11,928
My gosh, it doesn't sound like you enjoyed your school lunch today.

98
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:14,958
Shut it! I have all of your personal information. You better watch out.

99
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,428
I'm going to plaster cement all over you the second I spot you.

100
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,158
What a potty mouth.

101
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:38,688
Do you think you're mentally invincible? Just ignore the calls.

102
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:41,358
Give it back. It could be a customer calling.

103
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:45,058
Customer, my foot. They're all crazy fans of Han Se Ju.

104
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,988
How many calls have you gotten today after the scandal broke out?

105
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,158
25 calls.

106
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:53,798
- Do you think it was a question? - No.

107
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:02,028
My mom wasn't entirely wrong.

108
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:04,958
She said something unfortunate might happen to you.

109
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:08,828
You shouldn't have gotten involved with Han Se Ju.

110
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:14,088
I think I betrayed my country in my past life.

111
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:15,988
What are you talking about?

112
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,128
Shooting, being a vet, and working for Do Anything.

113
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:22,888
Whenever I try to do something, something stops me.

114
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:24,928
You are so naive.

115
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:28,658
The descendants of independent fighters live more poorly now.

116
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:33,158
The descendants of the betrayers are richer and live better lives.

117
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:34,688
If you wanted to be born rich,

118
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:37,298
you should've been a pro-Japanese faction in the past life.

119
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:38,328
Is that right?

120
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:40,888
It sounds strangely convincing.

121
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:43,028
I think it turned out well.

122
00:09:43,558 --> 00:09:46,688
You won't be able to turn this on now.

123
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:48,458
Just use this chance to quit Do Anything...

124
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,888
and return to being a vet.

125
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:52,228
You said your friend is going to make you the assistant director.

126
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,758
I already decided to do that.

127
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,028
Really?

128
00:09:57,588 --> 00:09:59,228
Are you okay now?

129
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:02,358
No, I will be working only Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for now.

130
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,958
I'm going to slowly adjust to it.

131
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,728
Good job. Good job.

132
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,488
Let's celebrate it with some beer.

133
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:11,188
Wait here. I'll be right back.

134
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:38,258
Mr. Yoo?

135
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:49,458
What are you doing here?

136
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:59,928
Did you come to meet me?

137
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,758
No, the towel.

138
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:11,358
Darn it.

139
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,088
What brings you here?

140
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:20,628
Actually,

141
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:24,428
I got kicked out of my house after having an argument.

142
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:27,588
Are you married?

143
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:31,628
No. I am not taken yet.

144
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:36,188
Should we go somewhere and get some beer?

145
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:41,088
Is Jeon Seol asleep?

146
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,988
Do you know Seol?

147
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:50,988
Is Seol happy here?

148
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,388
Wait here. I will call her.

149
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:03,028
What? Wait. You don't have to...

150
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:50,058
Your stance is unstable.

151
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,858
You can't be afraid of the recoil.

152
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:55,158
If you are, your body will move back or your arm will droop down.

153
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,558
Then you lose stability and control.

154
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:01,958
Aim for it.

155
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:08,428
Fire.

156
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,158
What's this?

157
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:22,128
Hey, Jeon Seol, go outside.

158
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:24,288
Someone came for you.

159
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:26,528
For me?

160
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,928
- Who is it? - How would I know?

161
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,658
What's wrong with you?

162
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:41,158
Hey! Your identity has gotten out, and yet you're fearless.

163
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:42,688
You should wear a hat.

164
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:44,228
Okay.

165
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:53,128
You lucky wench.

166
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:56,258
She must've betrayed her country a big time in her past life.

167
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:13,458
What? Who's looking for me?

168
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:01,128
I am sorry.

169
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:02,688
It's okay.

170
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:50,058
Have you succeeded?

171
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:52,288
Taking the eight 'o clock train bound for Sinuiju,

172
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:55,028
Choi Min Gyo will deliver the campaign fund to Manchuria.

173
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:57,228
Our head will be happy.

174
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:04,088
A gunfight broke out sporadically.

175
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:06,828
Let me see.

176
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,228
You should stay away. The police are following me.

177
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:50,388
I am sorry. If you're done watching,

178
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:53,658
will you shut the door?

179
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:58,128
The girls have to get changed to prepare for the performance.

180
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:02,788
I am sorry.

181
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,788
This is a girl's changing room.

182
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:09,458
We prepared a space for you.

183
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:23,828
When I meet him, he always smell of hair oil

184
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:29,158
Cuckoo cries sadly for fading Spring

185
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:32,558
Crying and crying

186
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:40,828
The wind blows and the spider web chokes my neck

187
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:46,288
Oh dear, it hurts

188
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:49,228
Please save me

189
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:54,998
Please save me

190
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:06,128
Seol.

191
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:07,958
Seol.

192
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,558
Jeon Seol.

193
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:14,428
Bang Wool.

194
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,528
It...

195
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,928
started again,

196
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,628
right?

197
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:36,028
"I killed someone."

198
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:40,028
"I killed someone I shouldn't have killed."

199
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:42,158
That's what you said when you were 10.

200
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:47,658
That was so sudden. I wasn't ready to hear.

201
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,558
- "I killed someone." - Why are you repeating it?

202
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:57,888
You wanted to be ready.

203
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,128
Forget it.

204
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,058
Why didn't Mom take me to a doctor?

205
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,288
Why did she take me to a shaman?

206
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,058
Do you think she didn't take you to a doctor?

207
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:11,788
The doctor said you were just too imaginative...

208
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:15,858
and extremely intelligent.

209
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:18,858
But your mom didn't believe it.

210
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:22,558
What did you say to her then?

211
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:25,288
I told her there was no chance of you becoming a shaman.

212
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:26,428
Are you happy now?

213
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:29,258
Was that all and you got paid?

214
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,188
When you die,

215
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:34,828
you cross the river of oblivion.

216
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:36,958
You're making that up again.

217
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:42,228
But if you have regrets about your life,

218
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:44,758
have passion left inside you,

219
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:49,028
or have unforgettable people or memories,

220
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:51,258
you look back.

221
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:57,158
You're not supposed to look back while crossing the river.

222
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:00,858
It gives you residues of memories.

223
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:03,888
Is that a punishment?

224
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,028
You can't really say that.

225
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,288
As the memories are not perfect, you become afraid of them.

226
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:16,228
I wonder...

227
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:19,688
why I got residues of memories.

228
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:21,628
What's the point of knowing that?

229
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:25,688
Just live your life.

230
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:29,728
In order to have no regrets, passion,

231
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,028
or sad stories left inside you when you leave the world,

232
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,728
do your best in your life.

233
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:44,458
Was it regret...

234
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,228
or passion?

235
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,828
Or...

236
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:54,488
were there people or stories...

237
00:21:57,158 --> 00:21:59,028
I didn't want to forget...

238
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:02,288
or I wasn't supposed to forget...

239
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,328
even after I died?

240
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:49,828
Even though we lost our country,

241
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:53,188
no one can take my words away from me.

242
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:57,458
If I can't write,

243
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:00,628
I'll be no different from a ghost.

244
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:03,758
When Joseon is liberated,

245
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:07,328
I'll write whatever I want with passion.

246
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:14,358
She's beautiful.

247
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,728
Aren't you going to watch the performance?

248
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:18,788
I can't.

249
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:25,258
The deadline is in an hour.

250
00:23:25,758 --> 00:23:27,928
You used to be praised as a genius.

251
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:31,028
Are you going to keep writing those dime novels?

252
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,058
Are you teasing me?

253
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:37,758
I'm on the blacklist and there are eyes on me.

254
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,728
What else could I write?

255
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:42,228
Is that why you're writing dime novels?

256
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:44,328
Why don't you just give up writing altogether?

257
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:47,858
Even though we lost our country,

258
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:52,458
no one can take my words away from me.

259
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:55,558
If I can't write,

260
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:59,258
I'll be no different from a ghost.

261
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:01,988
When Joseon is liberated,

262
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:07,058
I'll write whatever I want with passion.

263
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:13,558
I guess there will be no blacklist once Joseon is liberated.

264
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:16,488
Of course not. That's what it means to be liberated.

265
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,528
What about you? Aren't you going to start writing again?

266
00:24:20,988 --> 00:24:24,488
I don't think so. I think I'll start dating instead.

267
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:26,858
Who are you going to date?

268
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:03,028
Please keep writing.

269
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:07,228
That novel has to be completed...

270
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:10,158
for me...

271
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:13,458
to live.

272
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:39,458
Ms. Kang.

273
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:44,858
You don't have to come here for the time being. Why are you here?

274
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:50,828
Take a shower.

275
00:25:51,088 --> 00:25:52,688
I have something to tell you.

276
00:25:55,158 --> 00:25:56,958
What did you just say?

277
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,188
I had someone look into it,

278
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:04,388
and there have been transactions between Reporter Son and Ms. Hong.

279
00:26:05,088 --> 00:26:08,628
Reporter Son's malicious articles about you...

280
00:26:08,628 --> 00:26:10,888
must have something to do with the transactions.

281
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:16,758
What would you like to do?

282
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:20,158
Would you like to continue with the lawsuit?

283
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,028
Mr. Han.

284
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:35,928
Let's forget about it.

285
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:39,858
I'll...

286
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:42,458
withdraw the suit.

287
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,488
Are you concerned about...

288
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:48,428
Mr. Baek Do Ha?

289
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:52,328
I see that you have something writers should not have.

290
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:55,758
Wouldn't it be wise to get rid of things that could become problems?

291
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:57,458
I'm just going to think that I didn't see it.

292
00:26:57,858 --> 00:26:59,028
Put this away.

293
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:02,158
I know he used to be your teacher...

294
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,288
and he's like a father to you.

295
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:07,288
I understand you don't want to...

296
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:09,628
- get him in trouble. - Thank you for your work.

297
00:27:10,158 --> 00:27:11,688
You can go home now.

298
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,528
Mr. Gal seems to be preparing for a lawsuit using Ms. Jeon.

299
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:19,428
Why don't we...

300
00:27:19,528 --> 00:27:20,728
Who is...

301
00:27:22,158 --> 00:27:23,688
using who?

302
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:37,558
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

303
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:39,258
Well...

304
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,958
I'm Gal Ji Seok at Golden Bear.

305
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,158
I have no business cards. I'm Jeon Seol.

306
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:49,628
- Please sit down. - Okay.

307
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:56,788
You were very upset about the article, right?

308
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:58,658
A bit.

309
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:01,458
Is Mr. Han okay?

310
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:06,888
I'm not sure. He says he's okay,

311
00:28:07,088 --> 00:28:09,358
but he's just a human being. I'm sure he got hurt.

312
00:28:09,358 --> 00:28:12,728
He must be frustrated and infuriated.

313
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:15,488
Then why won't he make any statement about it?

314
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:19,628
People won't believe what he says anyway.

315
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:21,058
They'll just want to criticize him.

316
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,028
They'll look at him like this.

317
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:27,688
They'll do that.

318
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:32,458
"I see." They never be nice like this.

319
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:37,028
I'm neither his girlfriend nor his ghost writer.

320
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:40,288
- I'm just a fan. - I know that.

321
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:42,228
Reporter Son, that jerk...

322
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:46,728
Yellow papers...

323
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,658
don't care a bit about truths.

324
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,658
Mr. Han himself denied it. How could he do this?

325
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,958
On that note, Ms. Jeon, Let's teach...

326
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,828
Reporter Son a serious lesson.

327
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:08,488
What should we do to teach him a serious lesson?

328
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:14,358
Let's shoot an awesome drama set in the court of law.

329
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:20,288
Are you asking me to sue Reporter Son...

330
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:22,928
in place of Mr. Han?

331
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:27,588
You're so intelligent, and you understand things very quickly.

332
00:29:27,858 --> 00:29:30,728
We'll take care of all the legal fees, of course.

333
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,028
Ms. Jeon.

334
00:29:35,188 --> 00:29:39,228
You saved Se Ju's life twice.

335
00:29:40,588 --> 00:29:42,388
Help him once more and make it three times.

336
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:46,328
How does Mr. Han feel about it?

337
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:50,658
I'm afraid that me getting involved might cause trouble for him...

338
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:52,528
You don't need to worry about that.

339
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:54,558
Se Ju thinks exactly what I think.

340
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:56,828
- He and I always think... - That's what you think.

341
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,628
Gosh, you totally startled me.

342
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:03,128
I don't want to sue him. That's what I think.

343
00:30:04,088 --> 00:30:05,128
Well...

344
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,158
Get up.

345
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:10,958
We're talking right now.

346
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,628
- Just get up. - Se Ju.

347
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:15,828
Se Ju. Se Ju, please.

348
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,388
I've clearly warned you.

349
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:20,958
If you don't stop immediately,

350
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:23,758
you and I will have to quit.

351
00:30:32,388 --> 00:30:35,488
What is he being like that? Is he back to being a moody stranger?

352
00:30:36,088 --> 00:30:38,228
Gosh, I'm getting acid reflux. Thanks.

353
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:42,928
Hey, Doo Yeob. Delete that photo right now, okay?

354
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:45,628
And all of you, get back to work!

355
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:54,828
- Don't do it. - What?

356
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:56,428
Don't sue him.

357
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:00,258
No matter what Ji Seok tells you to coax you into it,

358
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:02,528
don't do it. Never.

359
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:05,588
- Why not? - Don't ask me why.

360
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:10,928
You're not even telling me the reason. Do I have to listen to you?

361
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:13,488
I'm telling you not to meddle in my business. Why don't you get it?

362
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:16,828
This isn't just your business. I'm a victim too.

363
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:19,358
My safety is being threatened as my personal information got revealed.

364
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:22,628
I can't even work because I'm getting harassing calls nonstop.

365
00:31:22,628 --> 00:31:23,858
- Also... - I'll compensate you.

366
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:25,688
How much do you want?

367
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:29,388
Do you know how much I hate you when you do things like this?

368
00:31:29,728 --> 00:31:32,828
I'm glad that you don't already hate me enough.

369
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:36,058
How much would be enough?

370
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,358
Tell me.

371
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:41,758
I'm not doing this because I need money.

372
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:44,288
I'm saying I can help if revealing the truth will help you.

373
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:46,558
And I'm telling you that I don't need your help.

374
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:50,358
For goodness' sake. I just don't get you.

375
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:53,128
I get that you're a writer, but don't you think you're too moody?

376
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:55,428
Getting angry like that won't help you resolve the issue.

377
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,788
I've been through things like this many times.

378
00:31:58,388 --> 00:32:00,358
"My neighbor's dog is barking again."

379
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,128
Just think that and this too shall pass.

380
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:06,428
If we just leave it, it'll end quietly like a contained storm.

381
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,458
So please...

382
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:10,928
Don't make things worse, please.

383
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:12,828
Then you should at least make me understand.

384
00:32:13,158 --> 00:32:16,388
You're just telling me not to do it and not to even ask you why.

385
00:32:17,928 --> 00:32:19,388
Are you feeling guilty about something?

386
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:22,128
Do you actually have a ghost writer in your writing room?

387
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:26,358
That's not the case. I'm sure you're mad at the false accusations.

388
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:29,958
You've done nothing wrong. Why can't you say it's not true?

389
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,758
Why are you letting them stomp all over you?

390
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:33,588
From law to the media, use everything to bring the truth...

391
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:35,858
Why do you have to help me?

392
00:32:35,858 --> 00:32:38,128
It's because I don't hate you enough yet, okay?

393
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:43,628
Then do whatever you want.

394
00:32:45,428 --> 00:32:49,258
Instead, don't show up before me ever again.

395
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:54,258
Ever since I met you,

396
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:57,658
nothing has been going my way.

397
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:03,588
I bet that made you hate me enough.

398
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:06,628
So...

399
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:12,388
don't try to help me and just turn a blind eye to it.

400
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,228
I'm going to figure it out on my own.

401
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:41,058
You've done nothing wrong. Why can't you say it's not true?

402
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:45,758
I'm Mr. Han Se Ju's ghost writer,

403
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:47,758
Yoo Jin Oh.

404
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:51,328
I see that you have something writers should not have.

405
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:57,158
Wouldn't you be in trouble too?

406
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:59,928
If the police come, they'll ask what I was doing here.

407
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:01,728
Then I'll have no choice...

408
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:04,728
but to tell them that I was writing your manuscript in your place.

409
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:08,958
This is an accident, a mishap I can't laugh about.

410
00:34:09,528 --> 00:34:11,588
It's just a fleeting mistake.

411
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,228
I can make everything go back. I can do it.

412
00:34:17,988 --> 00:34:21,988
Back to the beginning. That will solve everything.

413
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:43,228
I must write. In order to turn this ridiculous situation around,

414
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:46,788
I have to write no matter what. On my own, with my own ability.

415
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:50,488
I must prove to the world that I still got it.

416
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,288
It's not too late yet.

417
00:35:27,398 --> 00:35:29,288
Hey, what's up?

418
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,028
Yes, it's me.

419
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:34,258
I read the manuscript.

420
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:42,188
You must've been really stressed out.

421
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:45,928
Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.

422
00:35:45,928 --> 00:35:49,558
Right, we should be able to say anything to each other.

423
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,858
The manuscript you sent me...

424
00:35:53,428 --> 00:35:55,158
As I was reading it,

425
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:58,728
I got these icky feelings for some reason.

426
00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:02,288
I can't quite pinpoint it,

427
00:36:02,558 --> 00:36:05,428
but the style of writing is quite stiff. And the storyline...

428
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,898
doesn't pull me in either.

429
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:10,288
In short,

430
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:13,188
it doesn't look like it was written by you.

431
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:16,788
Because of all the gossips that you have a ghostwriter,

432
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,188
you probably couldn't help but feel more pressure unconsciously.

433
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,528
But you know, I can completely understand.

434
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:24,398
Okay? That being said, I went ahead and...

435
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:27,758
I told them it'd be put on pause.

436
00:36:32,928 --> 00:36:33,928
Se Ju?

437
00:36:35,128 --> 00:36:36,188
Se Ju?

438
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:41,188
Oh, sorry. I was actually just about to call you.

439
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:46,288
I checked and realized that I sent you the wrong file.

440
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,158
Right? I knew it!

441
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:51,328
Gosh, I thought it was so strange.

442
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,528
I was wondering if you actually had a ghost writer write this.

443
00:36:55,188 --> 00:36:58,588
Hey, just a second. Let me call them and cancel what I said.

444
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:01,898
- Hey, hold on a second. - Can you send it in 10 minutes?

445
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:06,058
Well, not really. I'm working out right now.

446
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:10,158
For me to go back to the writing room and send it... About an hour?

447
00:37:10,158 --> 00:37:12,028
No, about two hours?

448
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:15,488
Yes. Just give me two hours.

449
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:37,488
Even though we lost our country,

450
00:37:39,488 --> 00:37:41,958
- no one can take my words away... - If I can't write...

451
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:45,658
- If I can't write... - If I can't write,

452
00:37:46,828 --> 00:37:48,788
- When Joseon is liberated... - I'll be no different from a ghost.

453
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,228
When Joseon is liberated...

454
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:56,028
- Even though we lost our country, - If I can't write...

455
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:59,658
- no one can take my words away. - When Joseon is liberated...

456
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:02,058
If I can't write...

457
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:08,228
- What I want to write about is... - Gosh.

458
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:12,028
- Although we've lost our country... - I'll be no different from a ghost.

459
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:26,588
Sir, wait! Just a moment, please.

460
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:01,898
Did you not find it?

461
00:39:03,628 --> 00:39:06,488
Didn't you go outside to find the script you burnt?

462
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,328
Get out,

463
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:12,288
before I call the police.

464
00:39:13,758 --> 00:39:15,188
This is my last warning.

465
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:17,028
I have another copy of the script.

466
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,258
If you want it,

467
00:39:30,088 --> 00:39:31,528
I will give it to you.

468
00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:37,258
But,

469
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:40,898
there is one condition.

470
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:44,458
Condition?

471
00:39:45,898 --> 00:39:47,588
You sneaky man.

472
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:51,488
You have no reason or purpose for approaching me.

473
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:52,928
Yet you have a condition.

474
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:57,828
I need you to finish this novel.

475
00:39:58,558 --> 00:40:00,788
For giving this script to you,

476
00:40:01,658 --> 00:40:04,328
let me stay here with you.

477
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,558
I will stay here until you finish the novel.

478
00:40:08,398 --> 00:40:09,758
Why would I?

479
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:14,258
I can barely stop myself from choking you right now.

480
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:20,588
I have the script for the third week script, and you need it.

481
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:24,288
Am I wrong?

482
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,128
Why don't you admit it now?

483
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,788
Without me, you cannot go on with the novel.

484
00:40:33,758 --> 00:40:37,128
However, if we come together,

485
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:39,828
you can finish this novel.

486
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:48,858
What would you do?

(Send)

492
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:36,928
What kind of a writer do you want to be?

493
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,398
I want to be an original writer.

494
00:42:40,628 --> 00:42:42,288
The writer who imitates nobody.

495
00:42:42,788 --> 00:42:46,458
No. The writer whom nobody can imitate.

496
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:48,028
- Chateaubriand. - Chateaubriand.

(Third episode of "Chicago Typewriter")

498
00:42:57,028 --> 00:42:58,758
I've been cheering for you since then.

499
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:02,058
"I hope that desperate attempt turns into something solid."

500
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:05,028
"I hope he can soon make a living through writing alone."

501
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:10,058
And I prayed for you.

502
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:14,058
"I hope his tough life doesn't stall him."

503
00:43:16,788 --> 00:43:19,458
I hoped that it'd just be a fleeting ordeal you had to go through...

504
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,958
to be groomed into a phenomenal writer.

505
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,528
I hoped that all the suffering...

506
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:27,858
would just be a training process for you.

507

("Chicago Typewriter" will be published exclusively on Kakao.)

508
00:44:05,024 --> 00:44:07,124
(We won't be publishing "Chicago Typewriter" this week.)

509
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:09,084
What?

510
00:44:10,454 --> 00:44:11,754
Is he not well?

("Chicago Typewriter")

512
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:18,154
The writer's got no backbone.

513
00:44:18,154 --> 00:44:20,624
He's only published 10 episode, and he's already taking time off.

514
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:23,754
The ghost writer must've gone on a strike. Give him a raise.

515
00:44:23,754 --> 00:44:26,284
If you can't write, bring back your ghost writer.

516
00:44:26,284 --> 00:44:29,084
You idiots.

520
00:44:46,454 --> 00:44:47,924
What did I just do?

521
00:44:48,984 --> 00:44:51,524
I must be stupid.

522
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:53,384
I'm such an idiot.

523
00:44:54,954 --> 00:44:58,924
Seol, I am sorry. I'm late.

524
00:44:59,124 --> 00:45:00,784
Did everything go well at the conference?

525
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,484
I was asleep half of the time.

526
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:06,584
I'm sorry to make you stay late. You should go home.

527
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:38,584
Why are you following me?

528
00:45:38,754 --> 00:45:40,184
Did I look like I was?

529
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:42,754
What if you did? Are you going to say that I'm mistaken again?

530
00:45:42,754 --> 00:45:45,924
No, you are right. I am following you right now.

531
00:45:48,754 --> 00:45:51,854
You told me not to be in your sight ever again.

532
00:45:52,254 --> 00:45:55,454
That's why I came to you this time. I came to see you.

533
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,024
I came so you can see me.

534
00:46:05,454 --> 00:46:06,824
Aren't I great?

535
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:08,524
Honestly, I was a little great, wasn't I?

536
00:46:09,484 --> 00:46:11,184
How did you know I was here?

537
00:46:11,184 --> 00:46:13,054
It wasn't even my work day.

538
00:46:13,424 --> 00:46:18,284
Didn't you know? I am very connected.

539
00:46:18,524 --> 00:46:20,024
Did you think that was a question?

540
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,424
Did it sound like an answer?

541
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:23,124
Why are you here?

542
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:25,524
I have something to ask you.

543
00:46:26,124 --> 00:46:27,754
So you're not here to apologize.

544
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:29,484
I'll apologize first if that's what you want.

545
00:46:30,484 --> 00:46:34,324
Never mind. If you have something to ask me, hurry up and ask me.

546
00:46:36,884 --> 00:46:39,784
I got a little stuck while writing the novel.

547
00:46:40,454 --> 00:46:42,754
I want to know more about the psychology of women.

548
00:46:42,754 --> 00:46:45,184
Of course it's for work.

549
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:47,424
I wondered how you spared your precious time for me.

550
00:46:47,584 --> 00:46:48,584
Listen.

551
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:52,024
There's the universe's biggest star.

552
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:56,184
There's an ordinary female fan.

553
00:46:56,924 --> 00:46:57,954
One day,

554
00:46:58,684 --> 00:47:00,854
that universe's biggest star finds out that he's terminally ill...

555
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:03,124
and that he's going to die the next day.

556
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:10,924
He wants to do something for that fan...

557
00:47:11,054 --> 00:47:13,584
when he's still at the top.

558
00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:15,624
What would that fan want?

559
00:47:18,024 --> 00:47:19,254
Are you dying tomorrow?

560
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:21,084
It's a novel.

561
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:22,524
What kind of a shabby novel is that?

562
00:47:22,524 --> 00:47:24,524
Just give me the answer. I don't have time.

563
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:27,754
Well.

564
00:47:28,984 --> 00:47:31,124
Perhaps she would want to brag it to her friend first.

565
00:47:32,654 --> 00:47:35,784
(Sinseon Seolleongtang)

566
00:47:36,224 --> 00:47:38,424
It's hot, so be careful.

567
00:47:40,784 --> 00:47:41,784
Goodness.

568
00:47:42,284 --> 00:47:44,284
The soup is lightly seasoned,

569
00:47:44,854 --> 00:47:46,654
so eat as you wish.

570
00:47:47,584 --> 00:47:50,554
Why do you do this to me?

571
00:47:51,254 --> 00:47:53,054
You must've betrayed your country a big time.

572
00:47:57,354 --> 00:47:59,224
Have you betrayed your country?

573
00:47:59,924 --> 00:48:01,954
I must've done that in my past life.

574
00:48:02,924 --> 00:48:04,554
I don't think so.

575
00:48:04,754 --> 00:48:06,154
You must've rather been an independence activist.

576
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:08,124
A sniper, for example.

577
00:48:09,284 --> 00:48:10,724
How do you know?

578
00:48:12,084 --> 00:48:15,054
How do you know about my past life?

579
00:48:31,124 --> 00:48:33,184
Because you're radical.

580
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:34,924
And you used to be a shooter.

581
00:48:35,024 --> 00:48:37,724
So I was just saying. Don't take it too seriously.

582
00:48:39,924 --> 00:48:41,054
I see.

583
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:48,024
Am I the actual basis of Yoo Su Hyeon...

584
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:50,324
from "Chicago Typewriter"?

585
00:48:50,984 --> 00:48:52,024
What?

586
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:55,124
Does that mean I'm your muse?

587
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:56,284
Hey.

588
00:48:56,524 --> 00:48:59,524
I told you not to go too far.

589
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:01,484
Stop being ridiculous and just eat.

590
00:49:01,584 --> 00:49:04,354
If you go any further, you wouldn't be able to come back.

591
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:07,224
You always seem to add an unnecessary comment.

592
00:49:08,624 --> 00:49:10,654
I was a fool to expect that.

593
00:49:12,224 --> 00:49:14,824
Walking in a crowded street with a star.

594
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:21,724
You really want to do this?

595
00:49:22,784 --> 00:49:24,254
You don't get it.

596
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:26,124
This is the dream of all the fans.

597
00:49:26,124 --> 00:49:28,524
"Look, I'm this close with him."

598
00:49:28,524 --> 00:49:30,884
I can enjoy all the envious eyes looking at me.

599
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:33,054
But why do we have to wear the mask?

600
00:49:33,884 --> 00:49:35,954
You said you'd like to enjoy seeing others looking at you.

601
00:49:36,984 --> 00:49:41,054
Because of someone, now everyone knows me and I need to be careful.

602
00:49:51,554 --> 00:49:52,684
I'm sorry.

603
00:49:56,024 --> 00:49:57,154
And...

604
00:49:59,224 --> 00:50:00,424
"I love you?"

605
00:50:04,524 --> 00:50:05,654
Let's do that.

606
00:50:06,454 --> 00:50:07,454
(Shooting)

607
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:15,384
Why do you suddenly want a stuffed animal?

608
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:24,184
I want this.

609
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:26,784
Did you already choose one?

610
00:50:26,984 --> 00:50:28,884
If you want one, do it yourself.

611
00:50:30,054 --> 00:50:33,024
Please. I need to check something.

612
00:50:57,384 --> 00:50:58,954
You're trembling.

613
00:51:01,384 --> 00:51:03,584
Make sure the butt plate is set.

614
00:51:05,784 --> 00:51:07,484
Balance the shoulders.

615
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,984
Are you aware of that I used to be a shooter?

616
00:51:12,084 --> 00:51:14,484
Do you know how many gangster novels I've written?

617
00:51:15,184 --> 00:51:16,884
I know the theories as well as professionals.

618
00:51:16,884 --> 00:51:18,684
If you're so good, why don't you just do...

619
00:51:22,184 --> 00:51:24,024
Fear comes from...

620
00:51:25,724 --> 00:51:27,854
the distrust of yourself...

621
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:30,054
and the anxiety about the unknown.

622
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,554
If you don't want the fear to take over you,

623
00:51:36,784 --> 00:51:38,584
you must trust yourself.

624
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:43,024
Trust yourself and focus only on the target.

625
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:51,884
Aim.

626
00:51:58,124 --> 00:51:59,284
Fire.

627
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:11,724
You weren't an alcoholic after all.

628
00:52:12,554 --> 00:52:15,724
You never ask why I'm like that, though.

629
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:18,524
You told me you'd tell me when we become closer.

630
00:52:18,984 --> 00:52:20,284
Do you want to become closer with me?

631
00:52:20,454 --> 00:52:23,154
- If we're a little closer... - Bad timing.

632
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:25,984
I don't think...

633
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:28,624
we'll be closer from now on.

634
00:52:28,624 --> 00:52:30,784
Why is it a bad timing?

635
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:33,024
It's been nicer than any other day.

636
00:52:36,524 --> 00:52:39,354
Are you really going to die?

637
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:41,254
Are you really terminally ill?

638
00:52:44,624 --> 00:52:46,654
It sounds like you wish I was.

639
00:52:46,924 --> 00:52:48,554
You're not, are you?

640
00:52:48,554 --> 00:52:50,254
Don't worry. I'm not going to die.

641
00:52:52,384 --> 00:52:54,424
I'm not going to die.

642
00:52:58,454 --> 00:52:59,954
I should get going.

643
00:53:01,524 --> 00:53:02,584
Goodbye.

644
00:53:05,554 --> 00:53:07,824
You're playing hard to get.

645
00:53:10,984 --> 00:53:12,324
Jeon Seol.

646
00:53:16,324 --> 00:53:18,024
Thank you for everything.

647
00:53:19,284 --> 00:53:22,354
What's going on? Why do you suddenly say that?

648
00:53:22,454 --> 00:53:24,754
I won't forget that...

649
00:53:27,424 --> 00:53:28,984
you were the first fan of mine.

650
00:53:43,124 --> 00:53:45,354
What kind of farewell is that?

651
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:47,384
It makes me feel restless.

652
00:54:14,624 --> 00:54:15,624
Get out.

653
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,054
Why are we here?

654
00:54:21,184 --> 00:54:22,254
Follow me.

655
00:54:28,354 --> 00:54:30,454
It seemed like the new episode wasn't updated.

656
00:54:30,824 --> 00:54:33,424
Wasn't my script helpful?

657
00:54:34,654 --> 00:54:36,484
You'd better look for a new place to live.

658
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:39,254
I thought we're going to live together until it's finished.

659
00:54:39,984 --> 00:54:41,724
No.

660
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:44,054
Because...

661
00:54:46,824 --> 00:54:48,824
I don't need you anymore.

662
00:55:19,753 --> 00:55:21,413
What are you doing? Come in.

663
00:55:24,653 --> 00:55:25,713
Come join me.

664
00:55:26,953 --> 00:55:28,713
- Who is he? - What's going on?

665
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,553
(Urgent press conference)

666
00:55:34,553 --> 00:55:35,953
- What's going on? - What is it?

667
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:42,413
Have a seat.

668
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:44,983
Have a seat.

669
00:56:01,853 --> 00:56:03,383
What is he trying to do?

670
00:56:06,683 --> 00:56:09,313
First of all, I'd like to thank...

671
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:12,553
and apologize to you at the same time.

672
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:18,153
Today,

673
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:24,313
I'm going to close the matter about the rumor...

674
00:56:25,853 --> 00:56:27,553
that I have a ghostwriter.

675
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:48,653
Don't worry. I'm not going to die.

676
00:56:49,353 --> 00:56:51,383
I'm not going to die.

677
00:56:54,913 --> 00:56:57,313
Miss.

678
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:00,853
This is my new dish.

679
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:03,783
I'd like you to be the first person to try it.

680
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:05,753
Thank you.

681
00:57:06,213 --> 00:57:08,583
I won't forget that...

682
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:11,583
you were the first fan of mine.

683
00:57:13,383 --> 00:57:16,283
I made it with love.

684
00:57:16,953 --> 00:57:18,113
It's called...

685
00:57:19,553 --> 00:57:22,583
"my heart".

686
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:25,013
Seol, you're my heart.

687
00:57:26,053 --> 00:57:27,413
Gosh.

688
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:32,513
You don't like the name?

689
00:57:32,513 --> 00:57:34,313
Why so serious?

690
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:37,253
You don't like it?

691
00:57:38,013 --> 00:57:39,953
I feel uncomfortable.

692
00:57:42,483 --> 00:57:43,483
I see.

693
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:45,653
You feel uncomfortable.

694
00:57:46,483 --> 00:57:47,583
Just eat it.

695
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:53,913
Seol, did you hear?

696
00:57:54,213 --> 00:57:56,183
- What do you mean? - Se Ju is holding...

697
00:57:56,183 --> 00:57:58,483
a press conference regarding the ghost-writer rumor.

698
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:00,853
It's on the internet.

699
00:58:03,553 --> 00:58:07,313
Whenever people suspected I had a ghost writer,

700
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,483
it bothered me a lot.

701
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:13,613
People treated it as just another rumor,

702
00:58:14,013 --> 00:58:18,313
but I had to relentlessly recover my damaged pride...

703
00:58:19,953 --> 00:58:21,883
as a writer every time.

704
00:58:24,313 --> 00:58:25,583
Sometimes,

705
00:58:27,813 --> 00:58:29,813
out of frustration,

706
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:33,113
I questioned myself why I became a writer in the first place.

707
00:58:34,313 --> 00:58:38,353
I could only overcome the frustration...

708
00:58:39,053 --> 00:58:41,253
because of my belief...

709
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:45,613
that I write novels that only I can write.

710
00:58:45,613 --> 00:58:47,913
What is he trying to say?

711
00:58:48,783 --> 00:58:50,313
Well, Mr. Han.

712
00:58:50,713 --> 00:58:54,453
Now, I'll announce my position on the persistent rumor...

713
00:58:54,453 --> 00:58:58,183
that I have a ghost writer.

714
00:59:06,613 --> 00:59:08,713
In short,

715
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,153
it was wrong in the past,

716
00:59:15,983 --> 00:59:17,553
but it is right at the moment.

717
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:20,413
- What? - What did he say?

718
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,513
Do you admit that you have a ghost writer?

719
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,383
Where is your ghost writer right now?

720
00:59:46,713 --> 00:59:50,213
"Chicago Typewriter", which is running serially right now,

721
00:59:53,253 --> 00:59:54,583
was written by this man.

722
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:03,783
This man is my ghost writer.

723
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:16,213
I am solely responsible for the situation.

724
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:19,753
I'll humbly accept all the consequences,

725
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:22,513
even if it means that I have to give up writing.

726
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:24,683
I beg you...

727
01:00:25,613 --> 01:00:30,013
to stop dragging someone innocent into this.

728
01:00:30,783 --> 01:00:34,983
The woman mentioned in the article...

729
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:38,853
is someone who saved my life...

730
01:00:41,453 --> 01:00:43,813
and a fan of my novels.

731
01:00:44,453 --> 01:00:46,583
Please stop digging out her personal information.

732
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:49,053
Please stop blackmailing her.

733
01:00:50,683 --> 01:00:51,913
I beg you.

734
01:01:04,153 --> 01:01:08,383
If you have any questions, this man will answer you.

735
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,653
Thank you for listening to me.

736
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:26,783
Mr. Han. Mr. Han.

737
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,653
He's out of his mind.

738
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:48,853
Thank you for your hard work so far.

739
01:01:50,413 --> 01:01:52,053
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang.

740
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,813
You trusted me to the end.

741
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:57,913
I betrayed your trust and expectation.

742
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:01,253
- Mr. Han. - For the time being,

743
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:05,253
I'd like to spend some time alone, contemplating things.

744
01:02:06,183 --> 01:02:07,813
I'm not sure how long it'll take.

745
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:10,553
I might...

746
01:02:11,183 --> 01:02:13,753
never be able to hire you again.

747
01:02:14,983 --> 01:02:19,283
If that becomes the case, I'll offer you a severance pay.

748
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:25,613
Thank you so much.

749
01:02:25,853 --> 01:02:28,813
Ms. Kang, I'll call you soon.

750
01:03:02,353 --> 01:03:05,883
"Chicago Typewriter", which is running serially right now,

751
01:03:08,397 --> 01:03:09,827
was written by this man.

752
01:03:09,997 --> 01:03:11,927
This man is my ghost writer.

753
01:03:15,897 --> 01:03:16,997
What is this?

754
01:03:18,827 --> 01:03:21,327
What is going on?

755
01:03:23,197 --> 01:03:25,327
He was sitting right there.

756
01:03:30,528 --> 01:03:33,098
Are you okay? Are you very surprised?

757
01:03:37,998 --> 01:03:41,128
You... Who are you?

758
01:03:42,498 --> 01:03:45,998
Those pictures and videos...

759
01:03:46,498 --> 01:03:48,198
What happened?

760
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:53,198
Who are you?

761
01:03:55,268 --> 01:03:56,998
I already told you.

762
01:03:57,298 --> 01:04:01,068
I'm your ghost writer, Yoo Jin Oh.

763
01:04:03,129 --> 01:04:05,399
- The thing is... - The thing is?

764
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:11,069
I am really a ghost.

765
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:20,869
A ghost?

766
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:49,599
(Chicago Typewriter)

767
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,000
Am I possessed or something?

768
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,370
- Is he borrowing my body? - I think he's crazy.

769
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:59,501
- I want to be seen. - Why?

770
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,271
I want to confess my feelings to Seol.

771
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:05,401
- You're not a man. - Then?

772
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:08,072
Do you have feelings for Seol too?

773
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:09,132
Are you crazy?

774
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,572
The only person you love is yourself.

775
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:17,532
Was Seol in your previous life you talked about?
