2
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:01,163
Don't be so ridiculous.

3
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:04,063
No idiot would let a novel ruin his life.

4
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,823
You're the one who ruined your life.

5
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:30,123
What are you waiting for? Go ahead and call the police.

[<i>Episode 2</i>]

00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:41,663
- My gosh. - Make way.

10
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:43,463
- Goodness. - What on earth happened?

11
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:46,023
- I have no idea. - I heard a gunshot.

12
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:47,023
I heard the gun shot.

13
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,523
- That is scary. - That is scary.

14
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:49,623
Is that right?

15
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:51,893
Goodness.

16
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:57,793
Thank you for your cooperation.

17
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,763
I will call you again if something comes up. I'll get going then.

18
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,223
Can we talk now?

19
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,063
By the way,

20
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:17,763
I feel a little dizzy right now.

21
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:19,223
Can we go inside and...

22
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,763
Can't you grasp the situation?

23
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:25,793
After checking if you are the stalker's accomplice or not,

24
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,923
I'm going to decide whether or not to hand you over to the police.

25
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:30,263
- I... - So why would I let you inside?

26
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,893
I am not his accomplice.

27
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:34,693
I was just trying to help you.

28
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:36,393
So answer me.

29
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,863
How did you get in a while ago?

30
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:45,293
The gate and the front door were open.

31
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:47,893
I think the stalker...

32
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:49,763
left them open.

33
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:55,323
The police can check that, so let's pass that.

34
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:56,963
How did you know and come back?

35
00:07:57,363 --> 00:08:00,163
How did you know I was in danger and come back?

36
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:01,893
That's because...

37
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:05,723
the dog suddenly barked, so I followed him.

38
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,423
You're saying it was because the dog barked.

39
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:11,123
Yes. By the way...

40
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:17,463
I... I feel...

41
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:21,193
I feel a little dizzy right now.

42
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:31,023
Hey! Wake up! Hey!

43
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:14,263
No!

44
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:20,963
What?

45
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:35,833
Oh, my gosh!

46
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:46,423
Yes.

47
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:49,493
Where are you? Why are you still not home?

48
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,893
You're supposed to type for me today.

49
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:54,963
Is it because I'm not paying you enough?

50
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:57,363
I am sorry, but I can't talk right now.

51
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:01,833
Why do you sound so secretive?

52
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:03,593
Where are you right now?

53
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:05,793
I am in the bedroom of Writer Han Se Ju.

54
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,223
What?

55
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:09,523
Why are you there?

56
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,863
I don't know. I lost my memory. I have to go. Bye.

57
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:16,563
No way.

58
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,863
I guess when you desperately yearn for something,

59
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:22,423
you will have it in the end.

60
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:26,063
Is nobody here?

61
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,293
Look at these books.

62
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,063
Where is the front door?

63
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:16,563
This place is so great.

64
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:19,993
Look at the books.

65
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:45,693
What are you doing here?

66
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:52,163
Get out.

67
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:55,863
Gosh.

68
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:57,963
Wait, Mr. Han.

69
00:12:58,423 --> 00:12:59,563
Wait.

70
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,923
Why do you keep entering my writing room without my consent?

71
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:05,223
I am sorry. The door just opened.

72
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:07,123
Goodness.

73
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:09,463
It's nothing.

74
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:11,723
Who are you really?

75
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:13,493
Are you an elevator girl?

76
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,723
Why does the door open every time you appear?

77
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:17,693
Do you believe that now?

78
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:18,793
What if I believe it?

79
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:22,493
Will you just enter it without bothering to plan strategies?

80
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:26,023
Why? Did you split up with that dog?

81
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:28,493
Did he quit because the pay is too low?

82
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:32,293
So you still don't believe what I said about the dog.

83
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,263
Why are you interested in that typewriter?

84
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:37,993
Are you checking if the candid camera is well?

85
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:40,593
What are you... When did I... How could I...

86
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:43,223
You brought it, so it's not impossible.

87
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,763
When did I...

88
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,423
A parcel is delivered to you. Wait!

89
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:49,923
Is that parcel...

90
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:50,923
Never mind.

91
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:52,723
You pretended like you were never going to...

92
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:54,163
wake up for a million years.

93
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,893
Why did you come down?

94
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,723
Just focus on the ramyeon.

95
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,663
Have it quietly.

96
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,693
If you can't ruminate like a cow,

97
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:30,993
you should chew your food.

98
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:32,593
I can't call the doctor twice.

99
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,123
Okay.

100
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:37,763
By the way, are you here because you don't want me to eat alone?

101
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:38,893
Stop dreaming.

102
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:40,763
I am watching you because I am afraid of...

103
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:42,623
where you will go and what you will do.

104
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:44,293
I see.

105
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,123
Then do you believe that I'm not a stalker...

106
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:48,423
Don't expect it.

107
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:51,593
I'm still suspecting you.

108
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,823
But I even saved your life. You are very cold-hearted.

109
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:59,193
Let's straighten things out.

110
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:03,223
I didn't even ask for help, and you jumped in.

111
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:05,463
Like I said,

112
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:07,093
I am a martial artist.

113
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:09,763
I could've taken him down alone.

114
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,493
But didn't you put me here instead of a hospital because...

115
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:18,493
you were slightly worried and slightly thankful...

116
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:20,923
There were reporters everywhere.

117
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:22,593
The society and culture section of every newspaper will be filled...

118
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:23,923
with articles about me by tomorrow.

119
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,823
Do I have to take over the gossip section too?

120
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:29,493
You are tenser than the Military Demarcation Line.

121
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:31,223
There's no demilitarized zone.

122
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:37,593
Have you learned shooting?

123
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:41,063
You handled the gun very skilfully.

124
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:48,893
Have you never learned it?

125
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:55,493
I learned it a very, very long time ago.

126
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:00,963
What do you mean by a very, very long time ago?

127
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:02,863
When is that?

128
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:07,023
When I was in high school.

129
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:09,323
I was a member of a national shooting team.

130
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:10,893
I quit in my 11th year.

131
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:12,893
In high school.

132
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:17,593
Are you developing a little bit of...

133
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:18,863
- interest in me... - Give up your hope.

134
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,593
I am not interested in other people.

135
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:25,863
Why do you keep telling me to abandon things? Am I a monk?

136
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:31,723
- Why did you quit? - Pardon me?

137
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:33,863
Why did you quit shooting?

138
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,893
Is it because of your trembling hand?

139
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,663
It's a top secret.

140
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:41,693
It's a sore spot for me.

141
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:42,863
Are you an alcoholic?

142
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:45,463
No. Everyone leaves me once they know my secret.

143
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:49,163
I'll tell you about it when we become close.

144
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:54,023
That's too bad.

145
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:57,163
That means I'll never find out what it is.

146
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:03,093
Go if you're done.

147
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:05,693
I wish you much happiness.

148
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,163
Shall I type it for you?

149
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,263
Why?

150
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,923
Did inhaling that bowl of ramyeon perk you up enough...

151
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,723
to come up with a new ruse?

152
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:29,493
It seems to be urgent, but you can't type well right now.

153
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:33,463
I have a word processing certificate. I can type very fast.

154
00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:35,823
I can type from 700 to 900 keystrokes per minute.

155
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,863
Can I do it for you and call it even?

156
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:46,693
I can't believe I'm reading your rough draft. I'm so thrilled.

157
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,163
Don't say things like that.

158
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:50,893
It creeps me out because it reminds me of "Misery".

159
00:17:50,893 --> 00:17:53,533
Oh, right. There's this line in "Misery".

160
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:56,793
"The only people who can read my manuscripts are my editor,"

161
00:17:56,793 --> 00:18:00,493
"my legal representative, and the one who saved my life."

162
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:03,623
My gosh. Come to think of it, I did sort of save your life...

163
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:05,063
I'm the one who saved your life.

164
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,823
You passed out after breaking my golf club...

165
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:10,723
which Tiger Woods gave me as a gift.

166
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:14,763
Then I called my doctor who's expensive and saved your life.

167
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:17,893
That is true, but I also saved your...

168
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:21,463
Can you not breathe if you keep your mouth shut for a minute?

169
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,093
Is it like a branchia?

170
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:27,663
Do you want me to shut my mouth? I hope it's a misunderstanding.

171
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:29,993
You understood me perfectly.

172
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:31,893
Okay.

173
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:03,193
My goodness.

174
00:20:57,463 --> 00:21:00,423
Go faster, will you? Speed up.

175
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:02,823
You said yourself that you're a very fast learner.

176
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:04,563
Will we ever finish it if you type like that?

177
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,923
Then you should've paid more attention to your handwriting.

178
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:11,293
That's obviously what's slowing me down.

179
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:14,663
It's due in 30 minutes.

180
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:17,293
It won't make it on the newspaper if the rotary press starts rolling.

181
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:20,323
Did I tell you to get drunk and hurt your hand from a broken beer bottle?

182
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:23,663
I never told you to act so recklessly just before the deadline.

183
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:03,363
Go. The rotary press will start rolling in 10 minutes. Go!

184
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:07,223
- Why should I? - You must be faster than me.

185
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:11,823
Darn it. I'll give you half of my pay.

186
00:22:12,423 --> 00:22:14,193
Hurry up, please!

187
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:15,293
Okay!

188
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:19,823
Go.

189
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:29,293
I told you to write something magnificent.

190
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:33,763
Your novel is so third-rate. What a waste of newspaper space.

191
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:36,723
Hey, Yoo Su Yeon!

192
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,563
By any chance,

193
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:19,663
did you just get a strange feeling too?

194
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:22,563
Wait, you too?

195
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:28,693
It felt as if time and space were collapsing.

196
00:23:29,823 --> 00:23:30,963
Isn't this...

197
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:33,763
an earthquake?

198
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:35,123
What?

199
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:40,993
- It's an earthquake! - Earthquake!

200
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,130
By any chance,

201
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,100
did you just get a strange feeling too?

202
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,000
Wait, you too?

203
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,230
It felt as if time and space were collapsing.

204
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,330
Isn't this...

205
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,270
an earthquake?

206
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,630
What?

207
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,600
- It's an earthquake! - Earthquake!

208
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,830
I didn't know Seoul could be hit by such a strong earthquake.

209
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,570
There was no forecast or warning about this at all.

210
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,830
Gosh, go away! Move away from me.

211
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,800
I was here first. Why are you so selfish?

212
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,800
Did you just snap at me?

213
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,170
I guess nothing scares you now that you're faced with death!

214
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,870
I am scared.

215
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,900
Gosh.

216
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,600
It stopped, right?

217
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,470
Yes, I think so.

218
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,430
Don't stare at me like that, please.

219
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,070
It makes me think of "Misery". It's really creepy!

220
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,400
Okay.

221
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,930
My gosh!

222
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,400
Don't do that!

223
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,930
Okay.

224
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,800
It's the moonlight.

225
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,800
You said we've met before, right?

226
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,170
When was it?

227
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,100
Was it a very long time ago?

228
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,330
Well...

229
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,900
Well... It's...

230
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,170
Se Ju!

231
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,470
Se Ju! Where are you?

232
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,400
Why are all the lights off? Where is the switch?

233
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,530
Are you okay?

234
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,030
Listen to me carefully.

235
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,430
If he finds out what happened, it'll be complicated.

236
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,170
So you should sneak out of the room.

237
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,470
- Why should I? - Just listen to me.

238
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,630
You'd better find a way to save yourself.

239
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,600
When I'm back, you shouldn't be here anymore. Do you understand?

240
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,030
Hang on a second. Mr. Han!

241
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,600
What kind of mission is this in the middle of the romance?

242
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,000
Se Ju!

243
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,000
Se Ju! Are you all right?

244
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,330
Your arm!

245
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,630
Did you get bitten?

246
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,700
As you can see, I'm fine. Stop overreacting.

247
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,200
Se Ju, I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier.

248
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,370
I'm just coming back from the business trip in Japan.

249
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,100
Are you all right? Did you get hurt?

250
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,770
You didn't have to hurry. It's dangerous because of the earthquake.

251
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,400
Earthquake? What are you talking about?

252
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,700
My gosh, you're not fine at all.

253
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,800
Is it post-traumatic stress disorder? Should I call the doctor?

254
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,700
My goodness, Se Ju.

255
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,100
Why does she have to interview me?

256
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,870
You said you saw and heard everything.

257
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,330
There's nothing more dangerous than the rumor.

258
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,430
What if she says rubbish to look impressive?

259
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,430
Don't you know those people exaggerate?

260
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,830
So are you saying we should keep people's mouths shut with money...

261
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,830
and publish an interview ourselves...

262
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,700
before other journalists do?

263
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,900
You'd only write me a script to read off.

264
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,930
There's no other way.

265
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,370
What if the rumor runs that your novel encourages the criminals?

266
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,230
Not to mention the sales, your reputation would fall in an instant.

267
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,700
Why is it because of my novel?

268
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,600
It's just a problem of a man who has a low self-esteem.

269
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,530
I know. Everybody knows it's not your fault.

270
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,570
Still, people would blame you.

271
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,200
Why? Because you're a star writer whom people are jealous of.

272
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,230
Everyone would like to talk ill of you.

273
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,770
What?

274
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,500
He's your fan! Why don't you try to convince him?

275
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,270
If you don't want to, I'll do it. Tell me where he is now.

276
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,730
What was that sound? Did you hear that?

277
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,770
I didn't hear anything!

278
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,130
Why do you shout at me?

279
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,270
You surprised me.

280
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,230
Today, I learned being a fan is not an easy job.

281
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,270
The man who broke into the famous writer, Han Se Ju's home...

282
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,400
turned out to be the culprit of the murder at the abandoned factory.

283
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:22,130
According to the police, he was deeply into Han's work and...

284
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,100
imitated the crime from the book.

285
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,470
He murdered his coworkers who have been bullying him.

286
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,870
The police are investigating if there were further offences.

287
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,930
He hasn't yet mentioned the reason why...

288
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,470
- he attacked Writer Han. - Does it have to do with the novel?

289
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,300
Did you make your own weapon?

290
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
- Could you please step aside? - Please answer...

291
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,370
Did you forget something?

292
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,600
I forgot some papers for the lecture.

293
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,100
Please look over here.

294
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,630
- Please say something. - He seems to be...

295
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,330
talented at making problems.

296
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,130
He made an innocent person...

297
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,870
I'm talking about myself.

298
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,930
He made an innocent person look like a crazy person.

299
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,200
He even created a murderer now.

300
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,600
It seems like he's born like that.

301
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,130
Se Ju and his work are not to blame.

302
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,100
He keeps writing same lousy things over and over.

303
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,130
You don't call that a writer.

304
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,370
Are you taking it to the reading room? Give it to me.

305
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,270
(Shocking news! A famous novel encouraged a serial murder.)

306
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,730
You must be feeling bad.

307
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,670
Should I?

308
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,870
I'm saying that because your son is on the news.

309
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,730
Which son? Tae Min is the only son I have.

310
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,530
I'm talking about Se Ju.

311
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,270
We even had his DNA get checked.

312
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,400
What else do you want?

313
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,400
The test result can always be swapped.

314
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,830
If you want, you can always manipulate it.

315
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,100
You...

316
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,370
Let's stop this.

317
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,130
It's been over 10 years since Se Ju left the house.

318
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,270
That's what I'm talking about.

319
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,900
Why would he build his mansion in the neighborhood after all?

320
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,100
It must be because he wants to see you as often as possible.

321
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,600
I didn't know you were a writer.

322
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,870
Maybe you guys have been meeting behind my back.

323
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,130
Who knows?

324
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,670
You're the one who is obsessed with Se Ju, not me.

325
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,430
Tae Min and Se Ra are like that because of you.

326
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,330
What does that mean?

327
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,800
Are you saying our children have some problem?

328
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,030
And are you saying it's my fault?

329
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,130
Take your pills, will you?

330
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,470
Are you saying you didn't do anything wrong?

331
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,900
You should talk to a psychiatrist, not me.

332
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,030
Why don't you just lock me up in a hospital?

333
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,970
I was about to go to the lecture.

334
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,400
Do it, then.

335
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,630
I'm going to work for the same company as Se Ju.

336
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,530
What are you talking about?

337
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,930
Golden Bear Publishing asked me to republish "Fate".

338
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,240
And I said I would.

339
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,830
They'd like to publish my other works as well.

340
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,370
And I'm working on them now.

341
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,800
They asked for an interview together with you.

342
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,100
Mr. Baek.

343
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,600
See you later.

344
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,670
Excuse me.

345
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,030
Yes.

346
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,430
Get rid of the deer right away.

347
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,630
Pardon?

348
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,070
It will be reported if we just release them.

349
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:50,000
Then just let them loose in the mountains or sell them.

350
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,030
Please just keep them out of my sight.

351
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,630
I can't write because of the noise.

352
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,470
You said that you wanted...

353
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,900
to see deer prancing in the garden.

354
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,330
It was not easy to get them.

355
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,300
We even hired a keeper.

356
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,130
Then fire him.

357
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,030
What did he do?

358
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,270
But...

359
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,430
they're actually pretty calm.

360
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,170
Gosh.

361
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,170
Who is it?

362
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,670
I'm so sorry, Mr. Han.

363
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,330
There is an urgent matter I need to tell you.

364
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,930
Be brief.

365
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,800
Reporter Son has just got a scoop.

366
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,900
Reporter Son?

367
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,800
You mean the third-rate reporter who loiters about...

368
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,270
for material?

369
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,470
Yes.

370
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
What's it about?

371
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,800
I am sure that it's a pathetic novel though.

372
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,240
About that, sir.

373
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,270
It's about the criminal intent of the person who attacked you.

374
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,970
Does it mean that the culprit opened his mouth?

375
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,570
No, he's remaining tight-lipped.

376
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,130
An anonymous tipper sent Reporter Son a letter.

377
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,300
An anonymous tipper?

378
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,100
What's it about?

379
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,470
He claims that you stole his life.

380
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,670
- Stole what? - The culprit's life.

381
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,070
Please give me a plain explanation.

382
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,570
Well, that's...

383
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,930
Gosh.

384
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,300
According to the informant, Mr. Jo, the culprit,

385
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,270
sent a letter to Mr. Han every day for three years.

386
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,670
It was claimed that Mr. Han plagiarized its contents.

387
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,600
If the words of the informant are true,

388
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,630
Mr. Han is not socially or culturally responsible...

389
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,930
I'm telling you. Mr. Han never received those letters.

390
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,930
We filter out all the mail first.

391
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,500
We have a team that takes care of it separately.

392
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,530
Please pick up a call.

393
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,830
Hold on a second. Yes?

394
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,830
Are you talking about the same thing too?

395
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,970
That's the address to our advertising team.

396
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,700
Mr. Han's mailing and residential addresses are strictly confidential.

397
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,070
Both of you, read it out loud since I know the address.

398
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,500
Reporters, listen up.

399
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,170
Don't you think you're too hung up on an unreliable source?

400
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,500
- Sir. - What?

401
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Over there, sir.

402
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,170
Reporter Son, that scum.

403
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,970
He's always desperate for a good scoop.

404
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,670
He really did well for himself.

405
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,800
So did the letters actually arrive?

406
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,300
How can I remember everything?

407
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,740
Do you know how many mails you receive every day?

408
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:53,240
If it seems nonsense, then it's shred immediately.

409
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,430
This is tiring.

410
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,600
We were unlucky.

411
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,630
Anyways, the situation has become complicated.

412
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,600
It's a copycat murder.

413
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,270
It would be simple if the scoop is about the lack of literary merit.

414
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,700
But if it is perceived that you've been communicating...

415
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,830
with the culprit, then that would mean...

416
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,300
that you turned a blind eye to the crime.

417
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,330
Reporter Son will gladly fan the flames.

418
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,130
But who's the anonymous informant?

419
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,740
The letters weren't mentioned once by the media.

420
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,430
Even the culprit himself is silent.

421
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,030
But the informant sounds like he was at the scene.

422
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,170
Can it be that he heard every word you shared with the culprit?

423
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,370
That can't be it, right?

424
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,430
I'm off. The deadline is soon.

425
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,300
What did I tell you? I said we should block it.

426
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,070
I said that we should keep that woman's mouth shut.

427
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,600
I definitely think that Han Se Ju read the letters.

428
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,470
Who do you think Gal Ji Seok is?

429
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,830
He does anything for money.

430
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,500
He would've picked it up as long as it made a good story.

431
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,300
How else do you think he's so prolific?

432
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,030
I've heard that the credit for Mr. Han's work...

433
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,800
belongs to a ghost writer.

434
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,970
A ghost writer?

435
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,100
You know? Someone who writes behind someone else's identity.

436
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,570
I've heard that too.

437
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,500
I've heard that 4 to 5 ghost writers...

438
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,100
are hard at work behind the scenes.

439
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,170
What?

440
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,070
That's truly a fanciful story.

441
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,930
Did you say, "ghost writer"?

442
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,870
I appreciate the story material.

443
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,070
By the way, just make copyright claims right now.

444
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,830
Don't bring it up later.

445
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,030
Then I'll consider we are good.

446
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,630
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

447
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,000
Do you think there's anything scarier than words?

448
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,670
I'm not an accomplice here.

449
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,930
I just wanted to help him.

450
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,570
Can we post these up around the hospital?

451
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,030
Did you even make fliers?

452
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,770
I couldn't find it anywhere.

453
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,970
I hope it's not starving.

454
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,470
It would be nice if someone took it and take care of it well.

455
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,470
If it returned to its owner, that would be even better.

456
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,470
- Seol. - Yes?

457
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,870
Now that I think about it, there are two of you.

458
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,530
You're here for Baek Seol, right?

459
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,770
Yes.

460
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,830
Please hold on.

461
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,530
My cat's name is Baek Seol.

462
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,240
My name is Jeon Seol.

463
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,500
Is that so?

464
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,200
That's a pretty name.

465
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,770
Thank you very much.

466
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,670
Now please take a look. She recovered a lot, right?

467
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,470
Let's take a look.

468
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,570
There you are.

469
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,900
Hey, you rascal. You gained weight, didn't you?

470
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,900
Did the hospital food suit your tastes?

471
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,800
Or is it your fur?

472
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,400
Now let's go home. Go inside.

473
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,740
If it vomits again, please come back.

474
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,870
I will. Thank you. I'll get on my way.

475
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,530
Isn't he Writer Baek Tae Min?

476
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,830
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

477
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,300
He's a regular at our hospital.

478
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,630
I didn't know that Baek Tae Min lives around here too.

479
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,730
Can I help you?

480
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,270
There's no phone number.

481
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,130
The hand brake is up too.

482
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,670
I don't think you'll be able to help.

483
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,730
I am from the errand service agency, Do Anything.

484
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,070
Would you like to try?

485
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,500
We are looking for the owner of the illegally parked black vehicle...

486
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,230
in front of the animal hospital.

487
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,000
To ensure the proper care of lovely little animals,

488
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,830
please move the vehicle. Thank you.

489
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,630
I repeat once again.

490
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,670
We are looking for the owner of the illegally parked...

491
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,770
black vehicle in front of the animal hospital.

492
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,700
- Please... - I'm sorry. I'll be down shortly.

493
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,870
Thank you. You saved me.

494
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,130
How much is the service fee?

495
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,600
One autograph will suffice.

496
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,830
Do you know me?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

497
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,130
Of course I do. You are one of the two big idols...

498
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,800
in literature with Han Se Ju.

499
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,070
How can I not know you?

500
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,230
It's flattering to be considered an idol at this age.

501
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,470
What is your name?

502
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,330
- Jeon Seol, isn't it? - Yes.

503
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,870
Your debut novel "Fate" was inspiring.

504
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,530
It's among my top five domestic novels.

505
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,730
I guess you didn't like the work that came after.

506
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,930
Well...

507
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,470
Here you go.

508
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,930
You're not very good at lying, are you?

509
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,500
Pardon me.

510
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,900
Hello. This is, anything is possible errand service, Do Anything.

511
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,200
Mr. Han Se Ju?

512
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,070
I'd like to meet briefly today. Where is good for you?

513
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,700
Your dating preferences are a bit rough.

514
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,370
Who says this is a date?

515
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,170
Then do you want to spar or something?

516
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,970
Didn't I tell you to try being a bit more creative before?

517
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,330
It's not that I'm not creative.

518
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,230
But I'm not exactly sure...

519
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,370
what you are trying to say.

520
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,070
Since the space is wide open,

521
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,030
Nobody can sneak in.

522
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:48,730
There was no time for anyone to install...

523
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,670
a candid camera or to wire the room.

524
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,770
Can there be a better place than this?

525
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:00,600
Then the reason you suddenly changed the location is...

526
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,900
Did you report it?

527
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,700
Report? Report what?

528
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,870
Did you report...

529
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,830
what the culprit and I talked about that night...

530
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,800
to the media?

531
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,430
Are you still suspecting me?

532
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:16,870
Just answer me.

533
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,400
I didn't.

534
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,430
Is that right?

535
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,270
So you didn't do it.

536
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,830
Okay. At least you are not using the dog as an excuse.

537
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,570
You are not believing me right now.

538
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,870
Did you just start talking to me as if I'm your friend?

539
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,730
You talk like that. Why can't I?

540
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,700
Why do you think I did it?

541
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,330
Let's hear the grounds for suspicion.

542
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:49,300
Since you used the precise term "grounds", I will answer it.

543
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,000
The only people who know about what we talked about that night...

544
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,700
are the culprit, me,

545
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,470
and you.

546
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,230
Currently, the culprit is remaining silent about that night.

547
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,730
So how do you think it leaked?

548
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,530
Do you think I chattered about it like a mad man?

549
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,570
So are you suspecting me again?

550
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,030
You provided grounds for reasonable doubt.

551
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,770
What should I do to make you believe me?

552
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,670
Didn't I tell you?

553
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:17,030
I don't believe people. Especially,

554
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,000
not the ones like you, who put on an innocent face...

555
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:21,700
and do wicked things at the back.

556
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,530
If you won't believe me, why are you asking me this?

557
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,970
If you admit your wrong deeds and ask for forgiveness,

558
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,600
I will at least exonerate you.

559
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,930
I will have to live longer to know when you will get it.

560
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,570
Don't worry too much though.

561
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,870
I won't make you take legal responsibility...

562
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,100
for what happened that night.

563
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,330
It was my mistake that I didn't make you shut your mouth.

564
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,770
It was also my mistake that I let my guard down.

565
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:50,970
But...

566
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,030
I can't forgive you twice.

567
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,500
Do you understand?

568
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,170
I clearly warned you.

569
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,100
Hey, Han Se Ju!

570
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,600
"Hey,"

571
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,400
- "Han Se Ju"? - Why are you so high and mighty?

572
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,530
I said I'm your fan, but you accused me of being a stalker.

573
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,430
I saved your life, but you are ungrateful.

574
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,730
Even if I do you a favor, you suspect me and tighten your guard.

575
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,930
I told you. You didn't save my life. You were just being nosy.

576
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,930
Do you think you are going to be successful forever?

577
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,170
I know for a fact that you'll also hit a dead end one day!

578
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,500
There will come a time when you need someone's help!

579
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,300
When that time comes, look around you.

580
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,030
I'm sure nobody will be there for you.

581
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,630
I am sorry.

582
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:37,000
But I won't hit a dead end,

583
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,300
and I will never create a situation where I'll need someone's help.

584
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,700
What are you doing?

585
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,630
I shouldn't have saved you.

586
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,030
If the same thing happens,

587
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,970
then I will leave you to die. I will never help you!

588
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,570
Darn it. It hurts.

589
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,100
He changed.

590
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,800
He wasn't like that 10 years ago. He completely changed.

591
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,770
It's over now.

592
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:31,500
Bye, my beautiful days as a fan.

593
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,830
I was a good fan.

594
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:38,500
Seol will never be able to stop being a fan.

595
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,970
Even if she accepts your love,

596
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,530
her priority will always be Se Ju.

597
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,530
On your lovely date night, she will call off the date...

598
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,700
and run to Se Ju's signing event. That will always happen.

599
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,830
That's the fate of a Han Se Ju fanatic's boyfriend.

600
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,330
I can take that.

601
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:02,200
I can allow one empty room in my lady's heart.

602
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,630
Are you a pushover? And things have changed now.

603
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,370
She's been watching him from a distance all these years.

604
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:17,330
But now, she even went inside Se Ju's bedroom.

605
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,330
- Bedroom? - Yes.

606
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,000
I told you it was a guest bedroom.

607
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,200
Will you keep spreading a false truth?

608
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:27,170
What is up with the backpack? Are you going somewhere?

609
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,370
I am going to get some air.

610
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,970
My heart just broke.

611
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,370
- What? Your heart broke. - What? Your heart broke.

612
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,030
I realized that my idol...

613
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:44,530
is just an idol.

614
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,930
I decided to end my 10-year-long fan life.

615
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,200
I'm going to become a normal person again.

616
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,530
Excellent!

617
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:59,800
I was going to ask you to take my script to Mr. Han...

618
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:02,370
when you two become close.

619
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,500
Why do you stop being his fan?

620
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:08,900
I prepared a love serenade for you. Listen.

621
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,630
He's so simple.

622
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:48,030
Thank you for your cooperation.

623
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,230
We will monitor the conversation.

624
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:55,130
So you don't have to worry about your safety.

625
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:56,130
This way, please.

626
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,430
You came here, Mr. Han.

627
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,230
You must've been very surprised.

628
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,570
My sister must've reported it to the media.

629
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:32,970
Your sister.

630
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,970
I stopped her from doing it, but she must've felt bad for me.

631
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,600
Are you still suspecting me?

632
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,000
I didn't do it.

633
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,530
The world must be in an uproar now...

634
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,470
that they found out about our relationship.

635
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,170
What do you mean by "our relationship"?

636
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,970
What relationship are you talking about?

637
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,530
Why are you pretending not to know?

638
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,730
You gave me an inspiration to commit a murder,

639
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,430
and I gave you an inspiration for your novel.

640
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:04,800
Hey.

641
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,030
I neither gave you an inspiration...

642
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,000
nor received an inspiration.

643
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,530
A more educated word to describe it is "muse".

644
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,600
I read it in your novel.

645
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,800
Every writer wants a muse who can inspire him.

646
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,770
So you are my muse,

647
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,030
and I am your muse.

648
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,470
I will make it clear.

649
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:43,270
I've never read your letter.

650
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,970
And my novel isn't about you.

651
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,130
Don't worry.

652
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,970
I will let you keep that story. That's what you want.

653
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,000
Hey!

654
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,030
I knew it the moment I saw you...

655
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,230
that we are alike.

656
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,970
Who are you really?

657
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,600
I did a little research about you.

658
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,200
I know almost everything about you.

659
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,600
You were abandoned by your kin when you were little, right?

660
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,030
Were you about 10 years old?

661
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,170
Your first guardian who was your relative took your parents'...

662
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,530
death benefit and migrated without telling you.

663
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:29,800
How many relatives did you have to stay with after that?

664
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:33,300
By the say, why did you leave Writer Baek Do Ha's house?

665
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,700
You stayed there for 5 long years since you were 16 years old.

666
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,670
Were you...

667
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,600
abandoned again?

668
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:46,900
Shut your mouth.

669
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,800
You are just like me.

670
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,770
We were both abandoned.

671
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,430
We are always worried about being abandoned again.

672
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,370
We are scared, and we never trust other people.

673
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,700
That's why I thought you would understand me.

674
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,730
No.

675
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,130
You are just a mad murderer and a stalker.

676
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,900
But who made me the murderer? You made me commit a murder.

677
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,000
No.

678
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,230
You murdered simply because you wanted attention.

679
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:25,530
You despaired of your low life.

680
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,900
You must've committed a murder to vent your anger.

681
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,370
Muse?

682
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,070
Inspiration?

683
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,500
That's funny.

684
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,930
I am nothing like you.

685
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:45,700
You're different?

686
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:48,130
Of course. I am.

687
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,000
Stop...

688
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,700
having a delusion that I'd understand you.

689
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:57,270
Are you going to betray me?

690
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,330
You deny me now...

691
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:04,170
after you pretended to understand and click with me?

692
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,700
If you are done talking, I'll get going.

693
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,170
Because of you, my life came to an end.

694
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:16,970
Your novel...

695
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:20,070
and you writing have gotten me killed already.

696
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,200
Grab him.

697
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,600
You should feel the same.

698
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:28,400
Why don't you taste death with my writing.

699
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,300
- Yes, sir. - Ms. Kang.

700
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:03,000
Could you get me Jeon Seol's address?

701
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,100
("Do Anything")

702
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,170
Hello, it's Do Anything.

703
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:30,730
Isn't this Jeon Seol's phone?

704
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,230
Are you looking for Seol?

705
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,200
Who are you?

706
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,400
Me? Wang Bang Wool fairy.

707
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:48,130
So you have the special gift from...

708
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,730
Why do you have that phone?

709
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,000
Seol left and she's on temporary break for now.

710
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,800
She left the phone with me to manage the customers.

711
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,370
What do you mean she left? Where did she go?

712
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:00,570
She might have gone anywhere.

713
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,000
She leaves whenever she feels confused.

714
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,030
Thank you for letting me know.

715
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,600
I can sense that you are in a very unstable state.

716
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,430
Death, madness, delusion, anxiety,

717
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,700
fear, resentment, and obsession.

718
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,770
You have all the bad energy surrounding you.

719
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,770
There might be a rumor too.

720
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,430
Your life is very close with death.

721
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:36,070
You'll have meet someone every time but you can't tell good from bad.

722
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,300
Soon, you will have two special encounters.

723
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:45,700
Try hard. You can only survive that way.

724
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,730
You are just like me.

725
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,930
We were both abandoned.

726
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,170
We are always worried about being abandoned again.

727
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,670
Hello.

728
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:14,800
Mr. Han. From now on, don't watch TV or read any news on the Internet.

729
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,900
Why? Something happened?

730
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,700
Don't take calls from anyone but me. Wait. Just turn your phone off!

731
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,930
Don't go outside for a while.

732
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:25,530
What on earth is happening?

733
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,370
It's breaking news.

734
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,570
The imprisoned murderer who was responsible for shooting...

735
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,730
committed suicide last night.

736
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:37,430
In his prison cell, there were three pages of handwritten will.

737
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,700
It was about his resentment...

738
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,900
- towards Writer Han. - No way.

739
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,070
No way.

740
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:47,830
Oh, he's out.

741
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,070
He's out.

742
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,770
Do you know anything about the culprit's suicide?

743
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:53,930
Do you feel guilty or responsible for it in any kind of way?

744
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:56,230
Did you really use the culprit for your own benefit?

745
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:58,570
- Please let us know. - Please say something.

746
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:01,570
- Tell us. - Please tell us.

747
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,370
You should feel the same.

748
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:08,130
Why don't you taste death with my writing.

749
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,200
- What's the truth? - Please say something.

750
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,930
- What happened? - Please tell us.

751
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,930
(1 month later)

752
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:31,130
Mr. Gal?

753
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,430
Reporter Song, that jerk.

754
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:36,800
Mr. Gal.

755
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,830
Hey, Reporter Song!

756
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:43,470
What brings you here?

757
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:46,130
I came because I got worried.

758
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,100
Words spread that Mr. Han disappeared...

759
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,100
because he's experiencing a slump.

760
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:53,370
What's going on?

761
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:55,970
No, he didn't disappear.

762
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,870
He's just spending time alone for creativity.

763
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,370
He's busy because he's working on his next novel.

764
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:03,670
He's just trying to focus on his work.

765
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:05,830
Even we can't see him that often these days.

766
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,570
Hello? This is Gal Ji Seok.

767
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,000
Yes?

768
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,100
Wait here. Yes.

769
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:13,930
Okay. Wait.

770
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,430
What happened?

771
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,970
What did the doctor say?

772
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,270
He said I have PTSD.

773
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:41,300
It's a burnout syndrome.

774
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:45,470
He said I can get better if I relax...

775
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,030
and take proper rest.

776
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,630
He told me not to worry.

777
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,430
Stand up.

778
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:55,700
Telling someone not to worry when they're worried...

779
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:59,830
is the same thing as telling an alcoholic to stop drinking.

780
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:01,430
What a stupid doctor.

781
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,700
Come on. Stand up.

782
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:08,730
- What are you doing? - Come here.

783
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:12,670
Come here.

784
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,670
Sit down right now.

785
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:25,600
Write. Stop acting so weak and start writing.

786
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,500
"Writing is nothing."

787
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,500
"I just sit in front of a typewriter and cough out some blood."

788
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,170
That's what you said during your interview.

789
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,230
I just said what Hemingway said.

790
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:37,130
"Don't try to make it perfect. Just write."

791
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:39,330
That was by James Joyce.

792
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:42,200
"You'll come up with ideas once you start writing."

793
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,970
Stop it.

794
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:46,800
"If you want water, you need to turn on the faucet."

795
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,700
Stop it!

796
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:56,000
If you're not going to write for me, shut that mouth of yours, you jerk.

797
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:02,630
Are you being serious?

798
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,170
What?

799
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,300
Do you really need someone to write for you?

800
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,330
What are you saying?

801
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:13,730
It's been a month now. You're not sane.

802
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:15,330
We need to come up with something.

803
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:17,330
What are you saying right now?

804
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:20,270
During the past month, you canceled on 2 magazines, 4 interviews,

805
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:23,170
3 lectures, 2 TV shows, and 3 schedules abroad.

806
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,270
Fine. Let's say I understand.

807
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:31,030
You're human, so you could get tired and burn out once in a while.

808
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,330
But we'll lose so much if the 10 million-dollar project goes wrong.

809
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,400
Stop talking about that stupid project!

810
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,730
Are you saying you're going to write for me or what?

811
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,630
Just let me use your name!

812
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,300
And what if I let you?

813
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,430
Let's hire a ghost writer.

814
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:55,977
Let's hire a ghost writer.

815
01:04:59,056 --> 01:05:00,086
What?

816
01:05:06,456 --> 01:05:07,586
You're kidding, right?

817
01:05:10,256 --> 01:05:11,386
Are you crazy?

818
01:05:11,386 --> 01:05:13,356
Only until you overcome the slump.

819
01:05:13,356 --> 01:05:15,216
No one would find it out.

820
01:05:15,216 --> 01:05:18,086
We are going to make a secret agreement with the ghost writer.

821
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:20,786
Get out.

822
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:23,556
Se Ju. You should keep a cool head.

823
01:05:23,556 --> 01:05:24,716
What we need is...

824
01:05:24,716 --> 01:05:26,416
not your work,

825
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:28,386
but your name, which has the brand value.

826
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:30,116
Stop it, you scum.

827
01:05:31,316 --> 01:05:34,116
I'm going to write. I will write.

828
01:05:35,816 --> 01:05:37,316
I'll make sure you get...

829
01:05:37,316 --> 01:05:40,086
the manuscript in your hand before the deadline.

830
01:05:40,886 --> 01:05:42,116
So get out.

831
01:06:12,216 --> 01:06:15,356
Hi, Mr. Yoo. How have you been?

832
01:06:16,316 --> 01:06:18,816
I'm fine as usual.

833
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:23,586
Do you still ghostwrite biographies?

834
01:06:30,716 --> 01:06:34,686
Did you give up on becoming a writer?

835
01:06:51,256 --> 01:06:53,786
(It smells like...)

836
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:44,056
Hey, what's up, man?

837
01:07:44,956 --> 01:07:46,856
Hi, Mr. Yoo. Have a seat.

838
01:07:51,626 --> 01:07:55,556
Mr. Yoo. You must not tell anyone...

839
01:07:56,686 --> 01:07:58,316
about the things I say from now on.

840
01:08:37,186 --> 01:08:38,286
(Carpe Diem)

841
01:08:50,086 --> 01:08:51,256
Hey.

842
01:08:52,556 --> 01:08:53,586
Hi.

843
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:59,156
That girl is quite a good dancer, isn't she?

844
01:09:08,656 --> 01:09:09,716
It's a random dance.

845
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,586
- We should dance as well. - The deadline is coming soon.

846
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:20,086
I promised I'd send the manuscript for the newspaper by tomorrow.

847
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:22,686
Deadlines are supposed to be missed.

848
01:09:22,986 --> 01:09:25,156
"Carpe diem". You should focus on the present.

849
01:09:25,156 --> 01:09:28,516
Love yourself as you are.

850
01:09:28,986 --> 01:09:30,126
Stop it.

851
01:09:30,386 --> 01:09:32,386
Come on.

852
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,416
Hello.

853
01:10:36,956 --> 01:10:38,686
Is your manuscript ready?

854
01:10:38,686 --> 01:10:40,956
I still have some time until the deadline.

855
01:10:40,956 --> 01:10:45,086
Do you think you can make it until the deadline?

856
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:47,256
Do you want me to make it or not?

857
01:10:50,686 --> 01:10:52,486
Mr. Han.

858
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:57,086
About the ghost writer I talked about,

859
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:02,626
I know a person who is perfect for it.

860
01:11:04,186 --> 01:11:06,286
If it's too stressful,

861
01:11:06,786 --> 01:11:09,626
you can still ask him to...

862
01:11:09,626 --> 01:11:12,016
It's almost done. Stop wasting my time. I'll hang up.

863
01:11:53,756 --> 01:11:55,916
We sing

864
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:58,156
- The song of the glory - The song of the glory

865
01:11:58,156 --> 01:12:01,856
- Let's sing together - Let's sing together

866
01:12:01,956 --> 01:12:06,256
- My dream is whispering - My dream is whispering

867
01:12:06,286 --> 01:12:09,556
- The eyes are blazing - The eyes are blazing

868
01:12:10,016 --> 01:12:14,056
- Let's sing - Let's sing

869
01:12:14,056 --> 01:12:17,956
- People on the street - People on the street

870
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:22,126
Let's whistle

871
01:12:22,216 --> 01:12:25,516
- For the youth of tomorrow - For the youth of tomorrow

872
01:12:25,986 --> 01:12:27,356
Is it because of the drink?

873
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:30,356
Maybe it's the tranquillizer.

874
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:32,626
Or maybe not.

875
01:12:33,286 --> 01:12:36,186
Is it a scene of a novel I was thinking of?

876
01:13:51,016 --> 01:13:53,516
Since when have I had such an antique item?

877
01:14:06,986 --> 01:14:08,356
(Carpe Diem)

878
01:14:26,626 --> 01:14:29,056
What's going on? Am I crazy?

879
01:14:29,556 --> 01:14:30,886
Am I getting crazy?

880
01:14:32,316 --> 01:14:34,186
Or am I already crazy?

881
01:14:36,356 --> 01:14:39,216
It'd be a big loss if we cancel this project.

882
01:14:39,886 --> 01:14:40,956
I should die.

883
01:14:41,626 --> 01:14:46,126
A writer who can't write is dead anyway.

884
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:50,416
Well,

885
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:52,486
why do I have to die?

886
01:14:52,516 --> 01:14:54,356
Think about all the things I've been through to get here.

887
01:14:56,256 --> 01:14:57,886
I can't fall like this.

888
01:14:58,216 --> 01:14:59,816
I cannot die like this.

889
01:15:00,086 --> 01:15:02,156
Darn it. Giving something and taking it away is...

890
01:15:02,186 --> 01:15:03,356
the worst thing one can do!

891
01:15:22,886 --> 01:15:25,586
Wait, just a second!

892
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:28,716
I haven't even decided whether I want to die or not!

893
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:19,816
Help... Help...

894
01:18:35,186 --> 01:18:37,386
If you ever end up in the same situation,

895
01:18:37,556 --> 01:18:40,486
I'll just let you die. I won't help you!

896
01:18:46,126 --> 01:18:47,126
Hey.

897
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:24,126
(Chicago Typewriter)

898
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:25,516
Any word from Se Ju?

899
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:26,816
We can't get a hold of him.

900
01:19:26,816 --> 01:19:30,816
Han Se Ju, can you not come back? Or do you not want to return?

901
01:19:30,816 --> 01:19:32,216
Why am I here...

902
01:19:32,626 --> 01:19:33,816
It's Mr. Han's manuscript!

903
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:34,986
He used a typewriter.

904
01:19:34,986 --> 01:19:36,986
We're getting publication rights inquiries from all over the world.

905
01:19:37,016 --> 01:19:38,716
Did I really write this?

906
01:19:38,716 --> 01:19:40,886
It is the story I wanted to write.

907
01:19:40,886 --> 01:19:42,516
You made a big contribution to your homeland.

908
01:19:42,516 --> 01:19:45,086
Isn't it a perfect revival? Do you think someone else wrote it?

909
01:19:45,086 --> 01:19:48,016
I'll turn Baek Tae Min into the second Han Se Ju.

910
01:19:48,556 --> 01:19:50,186
It's like a minefield.

911
01:19:50,816 --> 01:19:53,086
Who is it? I'm asking who it is. Answer me.

912
01:19:53,086 --> 01:19:54,416
I wrote it.

913
01:19:55,456 --> 01:19:57,626
I'm certain that I wrote it.
