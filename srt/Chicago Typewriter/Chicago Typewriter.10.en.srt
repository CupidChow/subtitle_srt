1
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:21,274
Where have they gone? I told you to keep eyes on them!

2
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:23,044
Let's go that way!

3
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:38,523
What was that lameness?

4
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:42,607
If you are going to talk about kissing for the country,

5
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:44,493
do it well. Do it right.

6
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:46,523
It was you, wasn't it?

7
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:49,963
You're the masked man who saved me, aren't you?

8
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:53,193
Answer me. Was it you or not?

9
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:03,793
I wanted to pretend to be your savior.

10
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,423
But your eyes look so desperate that I can't lie to you.

11
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:10,223
Does it mean it wasn't you?

12
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:11,523
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:16,693
Instead, I won't charge you for the kissing lesson.

14
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:18,763
Do you want a recap?

15
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,293
Take this.

16
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:33,093
You said your father left you this.

17
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,023
That pays you for saving my life today. Okay?

18
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:46,193
You are hurt.

19
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:49,763
Be consistent and stay indifferent.

20
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:52,293
Don't get yourself hurt by knowing too much.

21
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:56,793
Don't let what happened today make you harbor ulterior motive.

22
00:01:57,193 --> 00:02:00,393
It happened simply as a revolutionary tactic.

23
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:20,593
(Episode 10)

24
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:26,423
The delivery is completed. A hound smelt and followed us.

25
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,093
How's Sapsari?

26
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:31,023
She returned safely. She got hurt a little, but she's fine.

27
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:44,693
- Aren't you going to watch? - I can't.

28
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,163
You were once called a genius.

29
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:50,263
Until when will you write the third-rate romance novel?

30
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:53,093
What about you? Aren't you going to write again?

31
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:55,363
I'm going to date freely now.

32
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:57,023
Do you have a girl?

33
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:31,393
Remember this.

34
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:33,423
A fighter can't fall in love.

35
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:35,023
As long as you have a gun in your hand,

36
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:37,323
you can never be in a relationship.

37
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:38,723
Why not?

38
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:40,693
It has a direct connection with your life.

39
00:03:57,763 --> 00:03:59,923
I'm going to date freely now.

40
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,493
It's a cinnamon stick.

41
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:15,793
You are such a son of a pharmacist.

42
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,663
Are you trying to give up smoking?

43
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:20,163
The cigarette light might make you a target.

44
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:21,923
I don't want to be shot.

45
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:30,763
- Tell her it was you. - What?

46
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:34,293
Tell her you are the one who saved Su Hyeon's life.

47
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,493
- Why? - She thinks it's me.

48
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:37,793
But it is you.

49
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:40,923
Why don't you tell her everything and make up with her?

50
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:42,723
Until when will you let her treat you like a playboy?

51
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:43,893
I can't.

52
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:47,623
Then she will know that I'm part of the group.

53
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:48,763
When she knows that,

54
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:52,093
it will be a matter of time before she learns...

55
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:53,463
that I am the lead.

56
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:55,563
She will learn it one day.

57
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:56,563
No.

58
00:04:57,793 --> 00:04:58,863
She can't know this.

59
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,863
We don't know when, where, and how she will be caught...

60
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:03,463
and how she will be tortured.

61
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:05,033
Su Hyeon is stronger than you think.

62
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:06,793
She won't let out our secret easily.

63
00:05:06,793 --> 00:05:10,193
Lying with knowledge is different from...

64
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:13,693
not being able to answer because you don't know.

65
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:16,893
She must not know. Don't ever tell her.

66
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:20,263
All right.

67
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:24,563
You guys are here.

68
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:26,993
Tomorrow's our day off.

69
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:29,393
Don't you want to go to Changgyeong Palace?

70
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:31,823
Unfortunately, you two should go without me.

71
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:35,793
I have a date with Mae Hyang from Myeongwolgwan.

72
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:39,163
That playboy.

73
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:41,723
Wait. Wait there.

74
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:44,493
Are you really not coming with us?

75
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,223
Why would I go on a picnic with an ugly fighting dog...

76
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:49,423
when I can go on a date with a beautiful lady?

77
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:50,663
An ugly fighting dog?

78
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,493
Are you referring to me?

79
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:56,993
Do you think I'd call a beautiful kisaeng from Myeongwolgwan that?

80
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:59,223
Can you stop playing around?

81
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:04,493
Who are you to say that?

82
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:09,063
- What? - Who are you to order me around?

83
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:11,963
Are you my wife?

84
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:14,463
I didn't say I was one.

85
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:16,363
Or are you...

86
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:18,263
jealous?

87
00:06:19,323 --> 00:06:21,523
If it's not that,

88
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:24,763
did you harbor an ulterior motive?

89
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:29,893
What is it? Did you like the lesson today?

90
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:32,423
Do you want more of it?

91
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:34,723
Do you want a recap?

92
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:45,563
Are you wearing perfume?

93
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:49,593
I told you not to pretend to be a girl.

94
00:07:21,263 --> 00:07:22,323
Are you going to cry more?

95
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,193
Goodness.

96
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:30,623
You surprised me.

97
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:32,693
What are you doing?

98
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:37,863
If you are going to cry more,

99
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:39,463
go to this place.

100
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:41,693
(Carpe Diem)

101
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:45,693
Go there and find Shin Yul.

102
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:46,923
He will help you.

103
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:52,963
Then...

104
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:56,293
are you that masked man?

105
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:00,763
Did you just realize that?

106
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:06,523
It's true that a beacon does not shine on its own base.

107
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:08,563
You are so sneaky.

108
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,093
See?

109
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:15,123
You are beautiful when you smile.

110
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,063
Get up.

111
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:23,123
Let's go to the night market, get some cold tea,

112
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,423
and look around a little.

113
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:30,923
You're not going to charge me for the ride, right?

114
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,523
Hold tight.

115
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:28,523
(Chicago Typewriter)

116
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:39,593
(Chicago Typewriter, 4th week script)

117
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,223
It's just the first draft.

118
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,293
Is it your imagination or from your memory?

119
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,763
I don't know.

120
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:06,633
I just wrote down what came to my mind.

121
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:10,923
At this rate, your memory will exceed mine.

122
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:13,263
You said Su Hyeon was...

123
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:17,063
our lover and comrade. Right?

124
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:21,223
Who did Su Hyeon love?

125
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,523
Between Hui Young and Shin Yul,

126
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:31,323
who did Su Hyeon...

127
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:33,523
love?

128
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:43,263
The only person who knows that...

129
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:46,293
is Su Hyeon.

130
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:49,763
She was living at a time where...

131
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,793
one had to hide his or her feelings...

132
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:55,293
for a greater cause.

133
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:58,193
Was it?

134
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,663
But now, people seem to hide their feelings because of their pride.

135
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,193
I guess love is difficult wherever you live.

136
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,323
But why did you ask me that all of a sudden?

137
00:11:10,823 --> 00:11:11,993
As I was writing,

138
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,163
I started to feel a bit sorry for...

139
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,223
Hui Young.

140
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:22,123
I figured that...

141
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:26,123
I should never love someone like he did.

142
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:28,763
I don't need to hide my feelings for a greater cause now.

143
00:11:29,263 --> 00:11:30,463
It's for my pride...

144
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:32,963
No.

145
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:35,823
I'm going to go all in for love.

146
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:49,723
Hello?

147
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:51,293
Come outside. Let's work out.

148
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:54,493
What?

149
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:57,093
Why do you want to work out all of a sudden?

150
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:59,463
Then let's go on a date.

151
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:07,463
Hey.

152
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:09,693
Let's ride a bicycle.

153
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:14,993
What made you want to ride a bicycle?

154
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:18,023
I always wanted to ride a bicycle with you.

155
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:19,593
You know how to ride one, right?

156
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:22,563
Yes, I do.

157
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,793
But I'm a bit tired, so you can just ride it by yourself.

158
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:27,793
I'll wait for you here.

159
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:31,023
If you win a bet, I'll buy you the first edition of "Stalker"...

160
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,523
and the original copy of "Unfair Game".

161
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,393
Hey, you can't get a head start.

162
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:45,663
No!

163
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:47,493
No.

164
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:30,123
(How to get rid of an exorcist)

165
00:13:37,093 --> 00:13:38,563
(Your device is low on battery.)

166
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:52,863
I just learned another way to use the latest technology.

167
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:59,063
How do ghosts show themselves to humans?

168
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:11,993
You said this was a date,

169
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,393
but it feels more like a triathlon.

170
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:21,223
You're the one who took it seriously as if it was the Olympics.

171
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:23,423
Your last minute spurt was incredible.

172
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,363
You should know how to let a woman win.

173
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:30,023
I can't do that. We're living in a world that's full of competition.

174
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:32,123
You didn't even discuss this with me beforehand.

175
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:33,693
That makes it an unfair game.

176
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,823
Fine. Let's do it fair and square.

177
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:42,193
Let's play a game that's much more advantageous to you.

178
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,493
Hey,

179
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:59,063
didn't I tell you about my trauma last time when we drank together?

180
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,393
I said I start seeing things whenever I hold a gun.

181
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:03,323
We'll each get four shots. How does that sound?

182
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:06,993
Do you even know how to shoot?

183
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:10,393
I told you. I'm excellent at this theoretically.

184
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:18,693
You're a born shooter.

185
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:20,793
You're practically a sniper.

186
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:25,893
By any chance,

187
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:28,823
do you remember me?

188
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,323
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

189
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,723
We've...

190
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:37,723
met a very long time ago.

191
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:41,923
You mean 10 years ago?

192
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:43,363
No.

193
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,263
Longer than that.

194
00:15:50,923 --> 00:15:53,223
When did we meet?

195
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:54,963
100 years ago?

196
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:57,423
Or was it 1,000 years ago?

197
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,523
Around 80 years ago.

198
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:15,423
You really don't remember me?

199
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:18,393
We...

200
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:20,923
were in Kyungsung together.

201
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:25,693
You were Su Hyeon.

202
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:28,793
I was Hui Young.

203
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:36,663
We were both part of a society called Joseon Youth Alliance.

204
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,693
You were a very talented and confident...

205
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:41,223
sniper.

206
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:44,863
You were a fighter for our country.

207
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:54,163
You're making this up, right?

208
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:58,223
Up until now, I didn't want you to remember your past life.

209
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:01,663
But now, it's different. Whoever you killed in your past life,

210
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:03,823
that was only...

211
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:06,923
something you had to do for your country.

212
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,663
So you should never be afraid of that.

213
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,463
It's something you should be proud of.

214
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:18,893
Sapsari.

215
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,923
You need to carry out your mission.

216
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:22,993
"Sapsari"?

217
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:24,493
It was your code name.

218
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:26,893
Go on and shoot.

219
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,123
It's an order.

220
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,123
Clear.

221
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:07,123
I feel like I'm Gyun Woo.

222
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:11,793
That was so close.

223
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:13,693
You won me by a point.

224
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:17,163
Thanks.

225
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,863
No one's ever consoled me like you did.

226
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:22,763
What? What are you talking about?

227
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:27,523
You consoled me by telling me to not be afraid of my past.

228
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:31,393
You put my heart at ease by using your novel.

229
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:33,923
You gave me the best consolation as a novel writer.

230
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:36,093
You can...

231
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:38,893
think however you please.

232
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,963
But remember this.

233
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:46,793
Us meeting each other was not a coincidence.

234
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,393
I'm sure there's a reason behind it.

235
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:53,123
Okay. You're really cheering me up.

236
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:54,693
Right.

237
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,593
My novel's getting published tomorrow.

238
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:00,493
Make sure you read it.

239
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:02,923
Of course. I promise I'll read it.

240
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:04,993
It's a story about you.

241
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,363
It's also a story about me.

242
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,463
Are you being serious?

243
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:14,123
Once you read the novel,

244
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:17,693
you might start to remember things more.

245
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,293
Whatever those memories may be,

246
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,263
you must tell me everything you remember.

247
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:26,293
I'm telling you not to suffer alone.

248
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,293
Okay?

249
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:32,993
Okay. I'll tell you every little thing I remember.

250
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:34,093
Are you satisfied?

251
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:35,463
Yes.

252
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:37,333
Good girl.

253
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,223
What are you doing?

254
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:42,393
You're touching me so often today.

255
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:44,093
I've always wanted to do this.

256
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:46,663
My gosh, stop it.

257
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:49,123
Like I promised,

258
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:51,863
I'll get you the first edition of "Stalker"...

259
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:53,333
and the original copy of "Unfair Game".

260
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:04,723
You're one successful mania. You know that?

261
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,163
Is it that fun?

262
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:16,023
What are you reading so interestingly?

263
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,023
It's a novel that recently got published.

264
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:20,523
My friends all told me that it's fun.

265
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,493
Really? What's the title?

266
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:24,333
"Chicago Typewriter".

267
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:26,993
It's apparently the nickname of a gun that was used by people...

268
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,393
who fought for our country.

269
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:33,593
Ma'am.

270
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:49,493
(I'm dying to read the next episode!)

271
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:50,923
Take a good look.

272
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,193
Only I can accomplish something like that.

273
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:56,023
You're seriously so amazing, Mr. Han.

274
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:58,223
There's no need to be that surprised.

275
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,493
All of my novels get such responses.

276
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:05,333
Many people are hoping that Yul and Su Hyeon become a couple.

277
00:21:06,123 --> 00:21:09,263
I guess a man's true love captures ladies' hearts...

278
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:11,263
regardless of which era we're living in.

279
00:21:12,723 --> 00:21:16,963
There are always some people who are crazy about auxiliary characters.

280
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:18,963
Don't take it seriously.

281
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:23,293
By "auxiliary characters",

282
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,223
- are you referring to me? - Do you really have to ask?

283
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:27,523
You're putting me on the spot.

284
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,763
You write so much about Hui Young and Su Hyeon.

285
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:36,363
I'll be in charge of the love story between Yul and Su Hyeon.

286
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:37,993
Who says you can do that?

287
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:41,293
Doing that won't make Su Hyeon like you.

288
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:43,163
How do you know that?

289
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:45,763
We should ask Su Hyeon directly...

290
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:53,793
What's wrong? Are you zoning out?

291
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,093
That's right.

292
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:03,993
The stories of the three of us have to come together...

293
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:07,823
for this novel to become complete.

294
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:16,663
("Chicago Typewriter")

295
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:29,363
What is this? It's exactly the same as the memories...

296
00:22:30,063 --> 00:22:31,393
that I recalled in the past.

297
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:33,793
(Hui Young grabs Su Hyeon to kiss.)

298
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:40,663
It's a success.

299
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:42,423
Boss will be glad.

300
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:49,193
I know what happened that day.

301
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:53,623
I also know what kind of sentiments Su Hyeon was feeling at that moment.

302
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:56,163
You really don't remember me?

303
00:22:57,523 --> 00:23:00,363
We were in Kyungsung together.

304
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:03,593
You were Su Hyeon,

305
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:06,263
and I was Hui Young.

306
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:10,823
No way. Did that really happen?

307
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,793
Were we really together at that time? Mr. Han and me?

308
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:18,663
- What are you doing? - My gosh.

309
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:22,663
Mr. Han. I didn't know you were coming.

310
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:27,923
Here are the things I promised to give you.

311
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:32,463
Oh, my. The original edition of "Unfair Game"...

312
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:33,623
and the first edition of "Stalker".

313
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,163
- Are you really giving me these? - Yes.

314
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:42,763
Have you read it?

315
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,223
Did it bring any new memories?

316
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:53,693
Are you here because you were worried about it?

317
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:56,063
Because I might have remembered bad memories?

318
00:23:57,023 --> 00:23:58,063
Tell me.

319
00:23:58,493 --> 00:24:01,223
Did any new memories surface?

320
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:04,123
It's...

321
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:13,163
Well, it's...

322
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:16,863
It's kind of awkward for me to talk about it...

323
00:24:17,293 --> 00:24:18,923
It's okay. Just tell me.

324
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:21,863
You said you'd tell me everything.

325
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:28,763
Well, it's actually...

326
00:24:29,823 --> 00:24:32,023
I'll leave if you're going to keep avoiding eye contact like that.

327
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:46,123
Judging from how red your face has turned,

328
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:49,663
I can sort of guess what you've remembered.

329
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:55,593
The medicine should be arriving in any minute. Is it not here yet?

330
00:25:02,863 --> 00:25:03,863
My goodness.

331
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:11,223
Anyway, it's not an unpleasant memory, right?

332
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:16,923
You don't even know what it is. Why are you so confident?

333
00:25:18,963 --> 00:25:20,793
If you're going to keep avoiding eye contact with me like that,

334
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:24,163
I'll do something for the betterment of our country.

335
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,763
What are you going to do?

336
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:39,323
I must be right. You've remembered that scene.

337
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:46,163
Let's have dinner together today.

338
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:52,163
What shall we eat?

339
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,523
Japanese? Italian?

340
00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:14,493
- I hope you enjoy the food. - Thank you.

341
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:19,563
I'm so glad that the novel is getting wild response.

342
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:22,823
That's what I'm saying. I thought the company might go bust.

343
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:25,963
Just remember that you guys can earn a living thanks to Se Ju.

344
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:27,563
- Okay. - By the way,

345
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:31,223
why is Ms. Hong out to get Mr. Han?

346
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:33,163
Is the rumor true?

347
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:35,493
What rumor?

348
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:38,993
There was a rumor about how he and Mr. Baek Tae Min could be brothers.

349
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:43,363
If Mr. Han is actually Mr. Baek Do Ha's love child...

350
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:46,293
There was an article saying it's not true.

351
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,223
Are you going to keep spewing nonsense? We're eating.

352
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:53,023
It's the only reason that can explain why she hates him so much.

353
00:26:58,963 --> 00:27:00,323
Hello, Mr. Baek.

354
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:05,463
Yes. Right now?

355
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:06,893
(Hot bestsellers)

356
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:19,093
By the way, why did you want to see me?

357
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:22,063
Well, it's about...

358
00:27:23,523 --> 00:27:27,863
I heard you're planning on printing more copies of Tae Min's "Fate".

359
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:32,223
Oh, yes. There's a huge demand for re-reading "Fate" these days.

360
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:34,823
I must say, it's because of the successful...

361
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:37,323
marketing and PR strategy our firm employed...

362
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:38,963
I'd like to ask you...

363
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:41,793
to stop printing those additional copies.

364
00:27:42,223 --> 00:27:44,323
Pardon me? Gosh, why...

365
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:47,663
What do you mean, Mr. Baek? I mean, the book is selling well.

366
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,763
I think Tae Min is too dependent on that novel.

367
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:54,693
It's making it hard for him to write anything new.

368
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:00,063
Gosh, Mr. Baek.

369
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:03,623
Don't you think you're being too harsh on your son?

370
00:28:03,993 --> 00:28:06,323
He needs to be backed by a stable royalty income...

371
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:08,463
to be able to focus on writing a new novel.

372
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:11,623
Writers must not rely on their old works...

373
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,363
and neglect producing new work.

374
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:16,723
And I heard that he signed a contract...

375
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:19,663
with your firm to write a new novel.

376
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:23,763
Wouldn't it be better for him to focus on that?

377
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:27,693
Well, I get why you're saying this,

378
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:31,293
but we had high hopes for his "Fate".

379
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:34,663
I don't know what to say.

380
00:28:38,023 --> 00:28:39,693
Please do it for me.

381
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:43,393
Of course. I'll speak with Tae Min about it.

382
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,623
But I can't give you the answer right now.

383
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:54,123
Mr. Baek.

384
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:59,793
There's something I'd like to ask you. It may sound impolite,

385
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,693
but I need to ask you just in case.

386
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,963
Please don't get any wrong ideas.

387
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:07,493
Go ahead.

388
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:11,163
Did something happen while you were...

389
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:13,223
mentoring Se Ju?

390
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:19,093
Your wife is going around my back to influence the media and investors.

391
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:21,423
I want to know why she's so out to get him.

392
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:26,123
I let it slide because I didn't want to disgrace your name in any way,

393
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:30,463
but I'll have to do something about it if it happens again.

394
00:29:33,163 --> 00:29:35,593
What is it that you actually want to say?

395
00:29:36,293 --> 00:29:40,263
I'm asking why you're investing in Se Ju's project.

396
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:46,493
I did it because the consultant said it's a promising project.

397
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:49,663
I thought it'd be more lucrative than collecting paintings.

398
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:52,623
I don't know why you're getting so worked up about it.

399
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:56,823
You see, I know you very well.

400
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,123
You're doing it to suffocate him because he's stopped writing.

401
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:05,723
Why are you bothering me if you already know the reason?

402
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:07,523
If you keep this up,

403
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:11,593
I'll only want to stomp all over him more. Don't you know that?

404
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:16,193
How... How far are you going to take this?

405
00:30:19,363 --> 00:30:22,393
Until Se Ju completely gets destroyed.

406
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:26,493
And until I see your devastated face while you watch him suffer.

407
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:31,293
Please. Please stop now.

408
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:35,763
Tae Min and I are the ones who need to get down on our knees, not Se Ju.

409
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:38,023
What are you talking about?

410
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:40,923
Do you know what Tae Min and I have done...

411
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,323
to Se Ju 10 years ago?

412
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:44,623
Do you have any idea...

413
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:47,963
who made Tae Min a professor as a writer?

414
00:30:49,293 --> 00:30:50,763
Who made him a professor?

415
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:53,993
What does that mean?

416
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:55,823
Are you saying...

417
00:30:56,523 --> 00:31:00,863
Tae Min stole what Se Ju wrote or what?

418
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:06,623
No way.

419
00:31:07,923 --> 00:31:08,963
Is that true?

420
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:13,123
Then...

421
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,523
you should do something about it.

422
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:20,063
Shouldn't you?

423
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:24,893
- Thank you. - Thank you.

424
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:29,423
- Thank you. - Bye.

425
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:31,063
- Thank you. - Bye.

426
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:33,523
Thank you.

427
00:31:35,323 --> 00:31:36,323
Sir.

428
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:42,323
- Do you have a question? - No.

429
00:31:42,523 --> 00:31:44,393
I want to get your autograph.

430
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:46,223
I see.

431
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:49,323
This is the first edition.

432
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:50,923
I heard it's hard to find one.

433
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,223
How do you feel about...

434
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:57,963
autographing on the book you didn't write?

435
00:32:01,893 --> 00:32:04,693
What do you mean?

436
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,063
My brother told me...

437
00:32:07,263 --> 00:32:08,793
that "Fate" is not written by Baek Tae Min,

438
00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:10,123
but by Han Se Ju.

439
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:21,093
My brother knows everything about Han Se Ju.

440
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:25,593
Who...

441
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:27,863
are you?

442
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:30,293
Well.

443
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:35,193
Who do you think I am?

444
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:00,485
What are you doing now?

445
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:04,455
I'm practicing possessing humans, but it's not easy.

446
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:08,885
I wonder why there aren't books about how to possess people.

447
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:12,825
Why don't you write one yourself?

448
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:14,625
"Introduction to Possession".

449
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:19,525
Where are you going?

450
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,925
I'm just going over there.

451
00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:32,355
Why did you lie to me?

452
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:34,485
My goodness!

453
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:36,885
Are you going to meet Seol?

454
00:33:37,355 --> 00:33:38,655
You know where I'm going. Why do you ask?

455
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,695
"Contract article 5, clause 6."

456
00:33:41,695 --> 00:33:43,985
"Han Se Ju shares everything..."

457
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:46,425
"about his dating process with Yoo Jin Oh."

458
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:47,695
Did you forget about that?

459
00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:51,285
But do we really have to be always together like a married couple?

460
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:53,125
You even cut off most of my parts from the novel.

461
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,325
How could you do this to me?

462
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:57,525
I should quickly find a way to show myself.

463
00:33:57,625 --> 00:34:00,485
This is so unfair. I don't want to be a ghost anymore.

464
00:34:04,285 --> 00:34:05,555
In 1, 2, 3.

465
00:34:05,655 --> 00:34:06,925
- "Carpe Diem". - "Carpe Diem".

466
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:10,825
Do you believe me now?

467
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:13,585
No, no.

468
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,695
The name of the cafe is already in the novel.

469
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,125
Maybe I was influenced by it.

470
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,325
Then...

471
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:24,655
What's the song I sang on the stage that day?

472
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:26,055
In 1, 2, 3.

473
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:27,755
- "The Wind Blows". - "The Wind Blows".

474
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:32,555
Why don't just believe me?

475
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:37,025
You and I were together in Kyungsung.

476
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:38,785
You're right.

477
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:41,325
How is this possible?

478
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:44,195
There's something even more unbelievable.

479
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:47,585
This is nothing.

480
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:52,125
Then since when...

481
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:55,855
did you begin to remember your past life?

482
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:01,355
Since I saw the typewriter in the cafe...

483
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:05,955
at the signing event in Chicago...

484
00:35:06,255 --> 00:35:08,085
and since you...

485
00:35:08,885 --> 00:35:12,285
delivered the typewriter to my house.

486
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,155
Typewriter?

487
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:18,925
You know, the typewriter in my workroom.

488
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:22,855
It's what I used to use in my past life.

489
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,985
Really?

490
00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:26,255
Yes.

491
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:29,055
This is unbelievable.

492
00:35:31,525 --> 00:35:32,855
There's something even more unbelievable.

493
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:35,955
The pocket watch you have...

494
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:38,755
also used to be mine in my past life.

495
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:43,425
That's what my dad left for me.

496
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:45,755
It's also what my dad left for me.

497
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:47,755
I'm talking about my dad in the past life.

498
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:50,355
This is amazing.

499
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:53,955
How did it end up coming to my family?

500
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:56,625
I told you.

501
00:35:57,785 --> 00:36:01,285
We are meant to meet each other.

502
00:36:05,385 --> 00:36:06,585
Chef, calm down.

503
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:09,425
Listen to his horrible pick up line.

504
00:36:09,525 --> 00:36:12,225
Can you believe there are still some people who hit on girls...

505
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,695
talking about past lives?

506
00:36:14,325 --> 00:36:16,955
Is there anything else you remember?

507
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,125
There is.

508
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:27,755
There was one more person with us, right?

509
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:34,085
A tall and handsome man who was next to you.

510
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:39,285
His name was...

511
00:36:39,955 --> 00:36:41,625
Shin Yul, isn't it?

512
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,695
Do you know Shin Yul?

513
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:52,325
I learned his name through your novel.

514
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:55,825
Actually, he is...

515
00:36:57,725 --> 00:37:02,155
the first face I could remember clearly from the past life.

516
00:37:06,055 --> 00:37:08,985
I couldn't remember your face clearly until recently.

517
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:13,925
She remembered me first.

518
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:17,585
He taught me how to shoot.

519
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:20,225
He was really sweet.

520
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:26,555
Do you think...

521
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:30,625
he's living somewhere like us?

522
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:41,855
Tomatoes and pepper are added to enrich the flavor of the mussel.

523
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:45,585
Here's your impepata di cozze.

524
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:47,025
We didn't order this.

525
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:49,885
- Is it on the house? - No way.

526
00:37:50,195 --> 00:37:52,985
Bang Jin ordered it. She said she's on the way.

527
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:53,985
Okay.

528
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:56,325
This is not good.

529
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:03,355
What's up?

530
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:05,695
How did you know you got a phone call...

531
00:38:05,695 --> 00:38:07,195
when your phone didn't even ring?

532
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,455
What's the problem?

533
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:14,355
This girl, Bang Jin can see me.

534
00:38:14,455 --> 00:38:15,855
I need to go somewhere.

535
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:17,525
What's the big deal?

536
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:19,325
Then go away.

537
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:21,525
As you know, I'm dependent on the typewriter.

538
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,985
If I'm away from it for a long time, I lack energy and,

539
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:25,925
I become way weaker.

540
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:26,925
What?

541
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:31,825
Then just go home.

542
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:33,625
Just go.

543
00:38:34,385 --> 00:38:36,125
I really wanted to ask her...

544
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:38,385
how much she remembers about me.

545
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:40,255
Go.

546
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:43,625
Stop making it complicated. Get lost.

547
00:38:47,385 --> 00:38:49,425
Did you say that to me?

548
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:50,985
- No. - Dae Han.

549
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:52,885
Don't be like that to your customer.

550
00:38:54,385 --> 00:38:57,285
Seol, I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner,

551
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:00,785
but the light bulb in the women's bathroom burned out.

552
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:02,195
Could you please change it?

553
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:05,025
Fine.

554
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:08,225
I'll do it.

555
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:13,725
I said it's women's bathroom. Women.

556
00:39:27,085 --> 00:39:28,155
Mr. Yoo.

557
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:39,325
Have you been well, Bang Jin?

558
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:42,285
Goodness. How do you know my name?

559
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:48,055
I heard it from Seol.

560
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:49,985
It was nice meeting you.

561
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:51,355
Wait.

562
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:54,525
You are very strong.

563
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,525
I'm sorry.

564
00:39:55,755 --> 00:40:00,455
I know it's rude, but you keep disappearing like a ghost.

565
00:40:01,585 --> 00:40:04,485
What is it that you want from me?

566
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,525
Cell phone number.

567
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:09,025
I recently came from the US, and I don't have a number yet.

568
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:11,285
Then how about your address or another form of contact?

569
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:14,825
I'm staying at my friend's for now.

570
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:16,285
How about your name then?

571
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,725
I want to know your full name.

572
00:40:19,225 --> 00:40:21,525
You could tell me your name, right?

573
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:22,955
Right?

574
00:40:23,695 --> 00:40:25,325
It hurts. All right.

575
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,125
I will tell you when you let go of my arm.

576
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,425
My arm hurts.

577
00:40:29,785 --> 00:40:30,825
You mean it, right?

578
00:40:38,055 --> 00:40:39,655
My name is...

579
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:41,885
Yoo Jin Oh.

580
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:43,455
Yoo Jin Oh.

581
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:48,485
Yoo Jin Oh.

582
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:52,885
Your name is so amazing too.

583
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:56,425
What happened?

584
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:59,355
I just found out his name, and he disappeared.

585
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:02,225
When will we become close?

586
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:04,985
Jin Oh.

587
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:07,455
Mr. Yoo Jin Oh?

588
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:10,225
Mr. Yoo!

589
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:24,655
My eyes hurt.

590
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:26,955
Your eyes are piercing.

591
00:41:27,055 --> 00:41:28,855
If you're done with the staring contest,

592
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,225
tell me what you want to say.

593
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,955
- My senorita... - Senorita?

594
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:39,525
That's the nickname I gave to Seol.

595
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:41,925
Only I get to call her that.

596
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:45,925
You are very cheesy.

597
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:47,925
Go on.

598
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,085
Why do I feel like you are ordering me around?

599
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,125
Anyway,

600
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:57,855
if you meet my senorita only to kill time...

601
00:41:57,855 --> 00:41:59,855
I don't have time to kill.

602
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:01,655
Hence, I don't need someone to kill time with.

603
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:04,625
Move onto the next question.

604
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:09,225
How much do you know about my senorita?

605
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:10,655
Do you know a lot about her?

606
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:11,655
Of course, I do.

607
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:14,925
Do you know how many years I've known her?

608
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:16,885
How long have you known her?

609
00:42:16,885 --> 00:42:18,255
22 years.

610
00:42:18,355 --> 00:42:20,455
22 long years.

611
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,485
I've known her for 80 years.

612
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:28,195
Are you joking me?

613
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:29,955
Are you immortal or something?

614
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:30,955
Dae Han,

615
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:33,355
I changed all the bulbs in the bathroom.

616
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:34,455
I see.

617
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:36,055
It looked as if someone intentionally broke them.

618
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:37,625
It wasn't you, right?

619
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:43,255
Of course, it wasn't. Why would I do such thing?

620
00:42:44,055 --> 00:42:45,755
You are funny, senorita.

621
00:42:46,755 --> 00:42:47,825
Sapsari.

622
00:42:49,585 --> 00:42:50,825
- Sapsari? - Sapsari?

623
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:52,855
It's my nickname for her.

624
00:42:53,585 --> 00:42:54,885
Only I get to call her that.

625
00:42:58,755 --> 00:43:00,555
Let's go, Sapsari.

626
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:03,925
Did you two fight?

627
00:43:03,955 --> 00:43:05,955
Are you in grade school?

628
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:08,385
Sapsari.

629
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:10,385
That's a nice one.

630
00:43:29,755 --> 00:43:31,685
Go in. I'll leave now.

631
00:43:33,355 --> 00:43:34,525
Okay, Brother.

632
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:38,225
I knew you were going to be senseless.

633
00:43:52,155 --> 00:43:53,185
If you...

634
00:43:53,785 --> 00:43:54,955
remember something,

635
00:43:55,655 --> 00:43:58,355
tell me. Don't struggle alone.

636
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:07,855
I'm leaving.

637
00:44:28,425 --> 00:44:31,985
Hooray to the successful fan!

638
00:44:34,525 --> 00:44:37,555
You said you'd come, why didn't you? Your dish was prepared.

639
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:39,025
Aren't you hungry?

640
00:44:39,255 --> 00:44:41,525
I'm not hungry because I had mush.

641
00:44:42,585 --> 00:44:46,055
Looking for the man who disappeared like a ghost,

642
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:48,855
I became mush myself.

643
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:51,725
And...

644
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,725
you were being all lovey-dovey in front of someone like me.

645
00:44:54,325 --> 00:44:57,225
You guys were so sweet. Do you like him that much?

646
00:44:58,155 --> 00:45:00,055
Yes. I like him.

647
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,025
Goodness.

648
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:06,625
How can you be so selfish?

649
00:45:07,155 --> 00:45:09,525
I have a lot of sins.

650
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:11,255
I've got no excuses.

651
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:13,955
And yet you came here. Why did you come?

652
00:45:14,355 --> 00:45:16,055
What did you come here for?

653
00:45:17,655 --> 00:45:21,085
I had to see Seol once.

654
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:23,155
I had something to tell her.

655
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:25,785
Why? Are you terminally ill?

656
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:29,085
You selfish woman.

657
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:31,685
You've been gone for 20 years.

658
00:45:32,325 --> 00:45:34,555
You abandoned your child and disappeared without a trace.

659
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:36,425
Why did you appear all of a sudden?

660
00:45:37,755 --> 00:45:40,385
Never mind. Don't give me the reason. Don't.

661
00:45:40,585 --> 00:45:41,855
Get out of my house right now.

662
00:45:42,355 --> 00:45:43,655
Hurry before Seol comes.

663
00:45:46,155 --> 00:45:47,325
We're home.

664
00:45:54,355 --> 00:45:55,355
Who is she?

665
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:14,585
Mom?

666
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:22,985
Seol.

667
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:30,055
Mom.

668
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,285
Is that you?

669
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,185
I want to...

670
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,055
apologize.

671
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:02,825
I won't ask you to forgive me.

672
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:07,155
How...

673
00:47:09,255 --> 00:47:10,685
have you been?

674
00:47:14,955 --> 00:47:18,785
How could I have wished for happiness after abandoning my child?

675
00:47:20,855 --> 00:47:22,585
I just lived somehow.

676
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:24,525
Then you should've just...

677
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:26,955
continued living like that.

678
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:29,425
Why did you come find me?

679
00:47:30,525 --> 00:47:31,955
- Seol. - Why?

680
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:34,555
Did you run out of money?

681
00:47:36,555 --> 00:47:37,825
You abandoned your child...

682
00:47:38,885 --> 00:47:42,685
and left to be with a man to be happy.

683
00:47:43,855 --> 00:47:46,925
This is too shabby. It's all too disappointing for me.

684
00:47:53,555 --> 00:47:55,085
On the day Dad died,

685
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,225
I thought you'd come to his funeral.

686
00:48:00,785 --> 00:48:02,525
Even if you were divorced,

687
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,155
and even if you abandoned your child.

688
00:48:06,355 --> 00:48:08,125
I thought you'd come and ask me to live with you...

689
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:10,485
when you see me being all alone.

690
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:12,825
I thought I'd reject...

691
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:15,825
just once, only once...

692
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:17,725
and then follow you.

693
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:21,085
I waited for you with that thought.

694
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:24,025
I am sorry.

695
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:29,355
I am so sorry, darling.

696
00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:34,755
I shouldn't have abandoned you like that.

697
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:41,785
Please leave now.

698
00:48:42,455 --> 00:48:44,085
I don't want to see you anymore.

699
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,355
My wound just got healed, and you just threw salt at it.

700
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:49,225
Do you...

701
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:52,355
still see your past life?

702
00:48:54,955 --> 00:48:56,325
You told me that when you were little.

703
00:48:57,025 --> 00:48:58,655
You said you killed someone with a gun.

704
00:48:58,955 --> 00:49:00,855
You said it made you hurt and sad.

705
00:49:02,285 --> 00:49:03,455
Did you...

706
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,025
remember...

707
00:49:05,685 --> 00:49:08,125
anything else?

708
00:49:09,885 --> 00:49:11,485
Did you come here to ask me that?

709
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,355
Why? Will you come back to me...

710
00:49:14,355 --> 00:49:16,725
if I say I am totally normal now?

711
00:49:17,785 --> 00:49:18,855
No.

712
00:49:24,885 --> 00:49:25,985
I've come...

713
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,785
to tell you the real reason for leaving you.

714
00:49:31,485 --> 00:49:34,555
What other reason was there other than the man?

715
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:40,785
I also...

716
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:44,485
have memories of my past life.

717
00:49:53,228 --> 00:49:57,028
So you knew about my past life...

718
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,228
that I remember?

719
00:50:02,258 --> 00:50:04,028
You'll find it hard to believe, but that's right.

720
00:50:05,528 --> 00:50:07,028
And you and I were...

721
00:50:07,898 --> 00:50:10,798
in the same space at the same time?

722
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:19,858
But how can that be the reason you left me?

723
00:50:21,658 --> 00:50:22,698
I was scared...

724
00:50:24,298 --> 00:50:28,098
that our ill-fated relationship from our past lives might be repeated...

725
00:50:29,328 --> 00:50:33,098
and that you might remember things that you shouldn't remember.

726
00:50:33,298 --> 00:50:34,798
I was terrified.

727
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:39,128
What are the things that I shouldn't remember?

728
00:50:41,198 --> 00:50:43,098
Memories of what?

729
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:51,928
I came to see you because there's something I have to tell you.

730
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:05,458
Stay away from that man.

731
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,028
Don't meet him.

732
00:51:09,428 --> 00:51:12,198
You guys must not cross paths.

733
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:15,258
What are you talking about?

734
00:51:16,328 --> 00:51:18,998
Don't be so cryptic and vague.

735
00:51:19,498 --> 00:51:21,798
- Tell me everything you know. - I can't.

736
00:51:22,728 --> 00:51:26,328
It might unleash the memories I tried so hard to lock up.

737
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:28,358
- Mom. - Just remember this, Seol.

738
00:51:29,158 --> 00:51:32,798
You must not let any of the ill-fated relationships repeat.

739
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:34,358
Don't even think about your past life.

740
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:37,798
Forget everything and just live your life now. That's all you have to do.

741
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:39,498
You must.

742
00:51:48,328 --> 00:51:51,498
I wanted Seol to be the first person to see me when I reveal myself.

743
00:51:51,828 --> 00:51:54,958
How did I get caught by Bang Jin like that?

744
00:51:55,798 --> 00:51:57,598
That was so stressful.

745
00:51:58,028 --> 00:51:59,098
Aren't you going to work?

746
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:04,458
My gosh, I see that you've perked up.

747
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:07,498
I am fully recharged.

748
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:12,698
By the way, do ghosts lose their abilities when they're tired?

749
00:52:13,028 --> 00:52:15,798
I'm different from normal ghosts. Because I dwell in the typewriter,

750
00:52:15,858 --> 00:52:18,958
my abilities become limited when I'm far away from the typewriter.

751
00:52:19,058 --> 00:52:20,058
What?

752
00:52:21,028 --> 00:52:23,158
Then you're not any better than us humans.

753
00:52:23,758 --> 00:52:26,198
Ghosts don't have it better than humans to begin with.

754
00:52:26,858 --> 00:52:29,428
I can't reveal myself in front of the person I like,

755
00:52:29,428 --> 00:52:31,458
and I can't even look at her in the eye and talk to her.

756
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,428
I can't grow old with her either.

757
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:37,158
People who live only because they can't die...

758
00:52:37,898 --> 00:52:39,798
might actually envy ghosts.

759
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:42,628
If you're that jealous, how about we swap?

760
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:44,028
Do you want to die?

761
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:45,858
I'm already dead.

762
00:52:48,728 --> 00:52:52,698
Anyway, I have hope now that Seol has remembered me.

763
00:52:53,828 --> 00:52:56,328
I should find a way to reveal myself to her as soon as possible.

764
00:52:56,858 --> 00:52:58,658
Then shall we begin?

765
00:53:04,058 --> 00:53:08,028
Unpleasant things happen whenever I hear that sound.

766
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,898
Ominous premonitions are never wrong.

767
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:21,458
Hey, Se Ju.

768
00:53:21,928 --> 00:53:23,058
How have you been?

769
00:53:25,398 --> 00:53:27,628
Do you even compete with alcohol now?

770
00:53:27,858 --> 00:53:28,928
You punk.

771
00:53:32,058 --> 00:53:33,258
It's good to see you.

772
00:53:34,498 --> 00:53:35,958
How many years has it been?

773
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:39,828
Behave yourself if you're going to get drunk. Don't be ridiculous.

774
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:44,558
This isn't your place. I'll call a driver for you, so just go home.

775
00:53:53,928 --> 00:53:56,428
Se Ju, can you please...

776
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,358
help me out this once?

777
00:54:04,558 --> 00:54:05,758
What are you doing right now?

778
00:54:06,298 --> 00:54:08,628
Do you want to feel mortified later? Get up.

779
00:54:08,898 --> 00:54:10,958
Unless you want to regret yourself to death tomorrow morning.

780
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:12,198
The first draft of "Fate".

781
00:54:16,098 --> 00:54:17,628
Can you give it to me?

782
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,698
Is that why you're here?

783
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:25,658
My mighty and just father...

784
00:54:27,158 --> 00:54:28,458
wants me to disclose everything...

785
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:32,958
and start afresh from the bottom.

786
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:36,058
But you know.

787
00:54:36,498 --> 00:54:37,958
I can't do that.

788
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:40,498
I can't rise up like this again with my abilities alone.

789
00:54:40,558 --> 00:54:43,058
- Tae Min. - I'd rather die.

790
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:46,928
If people look at me with eyes full of contempt...

791
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:52,528
I can't tolerate it.

792
00:54:54,558 --> 00:54:55,628
I won't be able to take it.

793
00:55:07,428 --> 00:55:08,928
All right. I'll give it to you.

794
00:55:09,398 --> 00:55:11,258
You can have it, so just get up already...

795
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:52,058
Don't tell me that you're feeling compassion towards him.

796
00:55:53,498 --> 00:55:56,098
He and I used to be roommates.

797
00:55:56,698 --> 00:55:58,158
I can do this much for him.

798
00:55:58,498 --> 00:56:00,328
Don't trust that guy.

799
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,598
He was two-faced even in the old days.

800
00:56:03,998 --> 00:56:05,028
The old days?

801
00:56:06,398 --> 00:56:08,328
- Does that mean... - That's right.

802
00:56:09,128 --> 00:56:10,928
He was in Kyungsung too.

803
00:56:12,028 --> 00:56:13,398
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

804
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:15,458
I wanted to observe him first.

805
00:56:16,058 --> 00:56:19,358
Villains aren't always reincarnated as villains.

806
00:56:19,698 --> 00:56:22,898
Then did you sign the contract with me...

807
00:56:23,598 --> 00:56:26,358
in order to pull him away from Seol?

808
00:56:27,328 --> 00:56:28,628
That is one of the reasons.

809
00:56:29,258 --> 00:56:32,898
I wanted to track down two people in order to find out how I died,

810
00:56:34,998 --> 00:56:37,298
and he's one of them.

811
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:39,228
Who's the other one?

812
00:56:41,028 --> 00:56:44,758
The madam at Carpe Diem, Sophia.

813
00:57:20,898 --> 00:57:23,358
Had I known my heart would be tattered into pieces like this,

814
00:57:24,328 --> 00:57:26,228
I would've just stayed by your side.

815
00:57:29,398 --> 00:57:30,458
I'm sorry.

816
00:57:33,098 --> 00:57:34,398
I'm sorry, Seol.

817
00:57:54,758 --> 00:57:55,958
Just a second.

818
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:02,458
You better turn around.

819
00:58:03,728 --> 00:58:04,798
Otherwise, I'll never see you again.

820
00:58:06,398 --> 00:58:08,928
I'll never look for you. I really mean it.

821
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:22,428
I'm sorry,

822
00:58:24,098 --> 00:58:25,828
but I don't believe in what you said.

823
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:28,528
I won't be like you.

824
00:58:30,598 --> 00:58:33,828
I won't leave those I love just because of my past life.

825
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:37,798
I'm not scared at all. I'm not afraid at all.

826
00:58:40,158 --> 00:58:41,228
Because...

827
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:45,228
I'm not alone. I'm going to overcome it together.

828
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,428
- Seol. - What I can't forgive...

829
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:55,758
is that you didn't even think of overcoming it together with me.

830
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:56,958
Even now,

831
00:58:57,358 --> 00:58:58,828
you're running away.

832
00:59:04,828 --> 00:59:05,828
The fate...

833
00:59:07,598 --> 00:59:10,628
The ill fate might be repeated.

834
00:59:10,898 --> 00:59:11,998
No, it won't.

835
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:14,358
Fate can be changed.

836
00:59:14,558 --> 00:59:15,798
And I'm not like you.

837
00:59:16,258 --> 00:59:18,998
I would never live like you.

838
00:59:36,228 --> 00:59:39,628
What have two people done to us?

839
00:59:39,628 --> 00:59:41,728
I can't remember in detail,

840
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:43,528
but I clearly remember...

841
00:59:43,528 --> 00:59:47,028
the name and the face of the two, although my memory was erased.

842
00:59:48,158 --> 00:59:50,398
I'm sure they're related to...

843
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:52,558
my death.

844
01:00:13,658 --> 01:00:15,358
Hey, Sapsari.

845
01:00:16,528 --> 01:00:17,798
You called me at the right moment.

846
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,658
I wanted to take some rest.

847
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:23,058
You told me I should tell you when I have problems.

848
01:00:24,158 --> 01:00:26,058
Now is the moment.

849
01:00:26,598 --> 01:00:27,898
Can I see you for a moment?

850
01:00:28,098 --> 01:00:29,158
Where are you now?

851
01:00:45,728 --> 01:00:47,328
All right. I'll be there soon.

852
01:00:47,828 --> 01:00:51,658
I might arrive later than you, so wait inside.

854
01:01:53,598 --> 01:01:55,498
("Fate", First draft)

855
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:08,128
You're still living like a rat.

856
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,458
Heo Young Min.

857
01:02:27,798 --> 01:02:28,798
Who are you?

858
01:02:32,928 --> 01:02:34,758
He can see me?

859
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:46,798
Don't meet him.

860
01:02:47,128 --> 01:02:49,858
You guys must not cross paths.

861
01:02:52,428 --> 01:02:54,028
Us meeting each other...

862
01:02:54,028 --> 01:02:55,758
was not a coincidence.

863
01:02:55,758 --> 01:02:57,958
There must be a reason.

864
01:02:58,658 --> 01:03:00,998
The fate... The ill fate might be...

865
01:03:01,558 --> 01:03:03,228
repeated.

866
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:07,258
Shoot. It's an order.

867
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:15,858
Typewriter?

868
01:03:16,328 --> 01:03:18,998
You know, the typewriter in my workroom.

869
01:03:19,498 --> 01:03:21,428
It's what I used to use in my past life.

870
01:03:22,428 --> 01:03:24,498
The pocket watch you have...

871
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:27,228
also used to be mine in my past life.

872
01:04:05,198 --> 01:04:06,198
Seol.

873
01:04:09,728 --> 01:04:10,758
What's wrong?

874
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:12,558
What happened?

875
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:14,898
Are you sick?

876
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:19,128
Just remember this, Seol.

877
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:23,458
You must not let any of the ill-fated relationships repeat.

(Chicago Typewriter)

879
01:05:08,828 --> 01:05:11,528
How will the novel end?

880
01:05:11,528 --> 01:05:13,098
Do you not want it to be finished?

881
01:05:13,098 --> 01:05:15,398
I just think I'll be sad...

882
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:16,698
if its ending is tragic.

883
01:05:16,698 --> 01:05:19,528
You're really handsome.

884
01:05:19,528 --> 01:05:21,798
You're flattering me.

885
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:23,058
Can I give you a hug?

886
01:05:23,058 --> 01:05:25,358
Right now? Here?

887
01:05:27,658 --> 01:05:29,858
I will bring you bad luck.

888
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:31,858
Don't you think that's stupid?

889
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:32,858
It seems like...

890
01:05:33,628 --> 01:05:36,158
I killed you.
