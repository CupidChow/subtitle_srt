00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,719
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,380
Are you really not going to release it?

3
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,410
Why won't you do it? What do you write this for then?

4
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,650
Why do you care?

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,050
We are the protagonists. I have a share in this.

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,180
Who gave you the share? Do you think a novel is a gold mine?

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,180
Stop it. Please!

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,550
Aren't you tired of it yet?

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,780
You fight whenever you see each other.

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,350
Were you mortal enemies in your past life?

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,810
Please check Su Hyeon's wound later.

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,580
What do you mean? What wound?

13
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,180
The bullet wound.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,380
It didn't go through her. It only passed by her.

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,880
I don't want to be treated.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,310
She didn't get treated yet?

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,480
She said she treated it herself, but I think the wound is infected.

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,950
Can't you hear me?

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,450
I won't get treated by Hui Young.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,780
- Why won't you? 
- He's got no license. He's fake.

21
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,450
Fake?

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,610
He may not have diploma, but he's from the medical department...

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,750
of Keijo Imperial University.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,750
He quit at the last moment to become a writer.

25
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,080
You seem to be amused by that fact.

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,180
Thanks to that, we get a lot of help from you.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,350
You can secretly treat a gunshot wound.

28
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,280
Your family has been running a pharmacy for generations,

29
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,050
so you know almost every drug out there.

30
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,710
Even your distant relatives are doctors,

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,280
so you can get medical supplies easily.

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,080
You are very useful in many ways.

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,050
Where are you going?

34
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,380
I need to attend my grandfather's memorial service.

35
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,450
By now, the elders in the family must be gathered around...

36
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,410
and thinking about ways to get connected to the government general.

37
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,980
I have to go and flatter them to get money out of them.

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,550
Treat her. All right?

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,250
- Why would I? 
- Why would I?

40
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,910
Or both of you should leave my place.

41
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,110
Is this your house?

42
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,250
Will it be okay to leave them by themselves?

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,350
Why?

44
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,650
Are you worried that the two boys will fall in love with each other?

45
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,550
No way.

46
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,610
I'll be thankful if they don't kill each other.

47
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,480
Take your clothes off.

48
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,910
No. I'm not taking my clothes off.

49
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,950
I can treat you only if you take your clothes off.

50
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,280
Am I a gisaeng? Why do you keep asking me to take my clothes off?

51
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,650
Why are you pretending to be a girl?

52
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,810
Who even thinks of you as a girl?

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,050
Do you want me to strip you off?

54
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,850
Darn it.

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
Come here while I'm still nice.

56
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,410
I said I don't want to. What's wrong with you?

57
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,350
You might die if the gunshot wound gets infected.

58
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,480
So you want me to be treated by a quack?

59
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,280
Don't annoy me.

60
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,110
I might give 10 stitches when you only need 2.

61
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,580
Is it normal to think about incising it even before you see it?

62
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,180
That's why...

63
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,710
we need to see first.

64
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,180
- It needs to be incised. 
- You look thrilled.

65
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,250
Bite it. It's going to hurt.

66
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,080
- Am I a dog or something? 
- Just bite it.

67
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,210
If you want to keep your front teeth intact, that is.

68
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,950
I'll begin.

69
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,180
It will be pretty painful, so you can scream if you'd like.

70
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,810
You didn't even moan. I'm impressed.

71
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,480
So many people of Joseon are suffering and crying.

72
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Of course I won't cry over this little wound.

73
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,880
No wonder you can afford to frequent gisaeng parlors and not work.

74
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,810
I heard you come from a family of pharmacists and doctors.

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,910
I guess your family is rich.

76
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,850
It doesn't even matter.

77
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,950
They've cut ties with me anyway.

78
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,380
Your family cut ties with you? Why?

79
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,010
I told them I wanted to become a writer,

80
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,910
and quit school.

81
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,350
But I've become neither a successful writer nor a doctor.

82
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,850
I can't continue the legacy of the family business.

83
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,350
I mean, their one and only son turned out like this.

84
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,880
What parent would be happy with it?

85
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,050
Our comrades can get help from you though.

86
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,650
Didn't you call me a quack?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

87
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,480
Guns aren't the only thing that can save the world.

88
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,180
What's gotten into you?

89
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,350
You're talking nicely to me for a change.

90
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,150
I'll give you analgesic.

91
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,310
Once it kicks in, you'll get very drowsy...

92
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,880
It was sensational.

93
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,210
I got a feeling as soon as I started reading the novel.

94
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,550
I thought, "He'll become a phenomenal writer."

95
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,210
So please keep writing.

96
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,110
I'll hold a gun. You need to pick up your pen.

97
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,410
And use your knife here and there like this for your comrades.

98
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,650
If everyone does their best at the jobs,

99
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,980
don't you think our country will be liberated?

100
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,850
That novel...

101
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,750
I really hope you complete it.

102
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,910
It doesn't matter when.

103
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,910
Her name was Ryu Su Hyeon.

104
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,710
She was our comrade...

105
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,950
and lover.

106
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,550
Her wish was for you to complete the novel.

107
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,780
So please.

108
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,710
I beg you.

109
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,680
Please continue writing it.

110
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,710
Don't you want to know how we met...

111
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,450
and how you and I became friends?

112
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,810
Why Su Hyeon had to disguise herself as a man,

113
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,280
why she had to hold a gun,

114
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,880
how we lived that time,

115
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,180
and what our final moments were like.

116
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,710
Aren't you curious?

117
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,280
Why?

118
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,650
Why should I be curious?

119
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,980
Let's say that what you're telling me is true.

120
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,150
One lifetime is exhausting enough.

121
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,380
Why do I have to let my past life burden me?

122
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,410
So what if I know?

123
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,480
Will it help my current life?

124
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Past life is just a past.

125
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,980
This is the life we're living now.

126
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,110
Can you just...

127
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,280
think of it as friendship?

128
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,050
As doing a favor for an old friend of yours...

129
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,480
I guess you don't know.

130
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,480
Betrayal hides on the other side of friendship.

131
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,720
Once you do a favor for someone, he or she will keep depending on you.

132
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,910
That's the reality.

133
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,480
You have...

134
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,250
changed a lot.

135
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,350
Times have changed.

136
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,610
We're living in a world where we have to be cold-hearted to survive.

137
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,350
I think it was a mistake coming to you.

138
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,080
That's why I've told you numerous times.

139
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,050
I'm sorry...

140
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,380
for bothering you.

141
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,910
Then...

142
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,720
I'll get going.

143
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,880
Since we met like this, I should ask your name at least...

144
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,750
(Chicago Typewriter)

145
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,880
Thanks for everything.

146
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,910
He ripped your purse?

147
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,350
That's right.

148
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,950
He ripped it like this for no reason.

149
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,880
And he beat up Gyun Woo too?

150
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,380
He didn't really beat him up.

151
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,880
He did this.

152
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,280
Goodness. I'm so disappointed in him.

153
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,610
- Seol, I need to go to washroom... 
- That's not everything.

154
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,720
I made lunch for him because I was worried, but he told me to get lost.

155
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,010
He also told me to shut my mouth and know my place...

156
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,410
- He's certainly a sociopath. 
- What?

157
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,720
I absolutely despise those who treat women, the elderly, and animals...

158
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,680
badly and talk rudely to everyone. Han Se Ju is a classic example.

159
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,380
Are we good now? Then I'll go use the washroom...

160
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,480
Hey.

161
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,720
He's not a sociopath.

162
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,680
He was very rude to you.

163
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,650
He just comes across as blunt, that's all.

164
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,780
Shall I say it's sort of a self-defense tactic?

165
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,050
He just doesn't know how to deal with people.

166
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,910
If you observe him, you'll know he has no ill intention...

167
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,450
Hey, what are you doing now?

168
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,150
How do you expect me to react to that?

169
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,480
- What did I do? 
- Are you becoming like him?

170
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,250
Why are you having mood swings?

171
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,610
Well, I was just trying to state the fact...

172
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,150
Forget it. Just make up your mind today.

173
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,450
Are you a fan or an anti-fan?

174
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,750
I'll respond accordingly and go to the washroom.

175
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,150
Hold on a minute. I need some time to think.

176
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,110
Think, my foot. My bladder is about to explode!

177
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,210
Mr. Yoo.

178
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,550
We meet again.

179
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,280
How did you know that I'd be here?

180
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,280
I guess you're here to see Seol.

181
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,080
There's something I need to tell you.

182
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,610
You want to talk?

183
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,680
With me? What is it about?

184
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,950
Thanks for being my friend.

185
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,380
- Actually, I'm not a human... 
- Wait!

186
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,480
Just a moment, please. I have a bit of an emergency right now.

187
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,710
I'll be back shortly. Don't go anywhere and stay right here.

188
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,250
Hold on, okay?

189
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,650
I don't know why I'm being like this either.

190
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,310
Why am I so understanding when it comes to Han Se Ju?

191
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,880
Was I indebted to him in my past life or something?

192
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,080
Stop drinking.

193
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,410
It'll hurt your stomach.

194
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,550
I'm here to say a final goodbye.

195
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,780
I can't go if you're like this.

196
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,550
Good girl.

197
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,880
That man, Han Se Ju...

198
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,750
Why is he so selfish and untrusting toward everybody?

199
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,910
I know, right?

200
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,480
He wasn't like that before. Aren't I right?

201
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,410
If...

202
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,180
I found you first,

203
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,580
would you have believed me?

204
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,180
If...

205
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,150
you saw me first...

206
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,210
Had it been the case,

207
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,950
would you have welcomed me like you used to?

208
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,080
Why did she drink? Was it because she was sad? Or happy?

209
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,980
Can't you tell it from how she looks?

210
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,110
She never drinks more than three glasses.

211
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,150
Why did she drink so much today?

212
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,580
What do you have your brain for?

213
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,080
Think about it. Who do you think caused her to drink?

214
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,810
Is it because of me?

215
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,450
She felt sorry for hurting me?

216
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,380
She shouldn't feel sorry about it. I'm fine.

217
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,210
What are you saying?

218
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,910
Hey, you should run. I need to bring her to the veterinarian.

219
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,550
I'm trying my best.

220
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,810
Mother.

221
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,950
Father.

222
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
Mother.

223
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,180
Father.

224
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,450
Mother.

225
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,110
Father.

226
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,250
Don't you want to know how we lived that time,

227
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,580
what our final moments were like,

228
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,280
how we met,

229
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,920
and how you and I became friends.

230
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,050
Aren't you curious?

231
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,110
I put my hand on your forehead.

232
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,150
You worked so hard.

233
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,250
You worked so hard to live, survive,

234
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,420
and make it here.

235
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,150
I sincerely wish...

236
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,980
your happiest moment hasn't come yet.

237
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,450
I sent the camp schedule to all the participants via email.

238
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,250
I finished ordering the souvenirs as well.

239
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,350
Okay. Did you send the schedule to the writers as well?

240
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,350
Yes, but...

241
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,420
Mr. Han is still saying he wouldn't come.

242
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,550
What a troublesome man.

243
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,810
What should we do? To be honest, it's all up to him...

244
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,080
whether the camp could be successful or unsuccessful.

245
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,150
What are you asking? We should drag him here.

246
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,150
Maybe he's really going to...

247
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,850
- quit writing. 
- What are you saying?

248
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,210
Writers usually go through a slump every three years.

249
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,950
I'll do something about it. So don't say anything about...

250
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,310
whether he participates or not.

251
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,450
Do you understand?

252
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,880
- Yes, sir. 
- Yes, sir.

253
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,750
Ms. Kang. What is Mr. Han doing? He doesn't answer his phone.

254
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,780
Well...

255
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,280
He's...

256
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,750
He's writing, isn't he? He must be.

257
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,750
He had enough of break.

258
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,650
He must be eager to write...

259
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,610
He's shoveling now.

260
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,950
Shoveling?

261
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,250
What do you mean by "shoveling"?

262
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,350
He said he'd like to make a blueberry farm in Suwon.

263
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,480
A blueberry? Is he already farsighted?

264
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,810
Not only that.

265
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,950
Once, he tried cooking.

266
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,810
He also tried building things with toy blocks and toy robots.

267
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,550
- Once... 
- He's just killing time, to sum up.

268
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,920
What about writing?

269
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,750
He's not writing.

270
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,710
- Not at all? 
- Not at all.

271
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,650
Why is that?

272
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,010
Se Ju.

273
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,420
Hi. You're here.

274
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,750
What are you doing now?

275
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,480
"Carpe Diem".

276
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,650
What Diem?

277
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,150
It means to enjoy the moment.

278
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,250
Live the very moment you are living right now.

279
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,780
I've been spending my time only writing in a room,

280
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,710
so I couldn't enjoy my life.

281
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,650
Now I'm properly enjoying it.

282
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,110
What's wrong with you?

283
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,050
(Mr. Kim's double life)

284
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,210
Why aren't you writing? You're a writer. You should write.

285
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,650
Hey, look.

286
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,010
Look at all the beautiful books.

287
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,750
Look at the writers who are immortal through books.

288
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,050
How could you run away from such a beautiful world?

289
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,210
- I told you I'm in a slump. 
- You've overcome it.

290
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,450
You already wrote the serial novel.

291
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,380
I told you already.

292
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,480
- My ghostwriter wrote the... 
- And the ghostwriter...

293
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,310
is a real ghost, right?

294
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,080
I don't care even if you don't believe me.

295
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,080
Se Ju.

296
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,550
Think about how hard it was to make it here.

297
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,750
Do you remember...

298
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,450
the day we met each other for the first time?

299
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,750
(8 years ago)

300
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,180
It was a sunny day in April.

301
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,080
It was a cloudy day in April.

302
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,580
Don't gloss over it.

303
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,550
Gosh, I've been looking for you.

304
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,710
Move the backlight away. I told you it was cloudy that day.

305
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,850
No, it was sunny.

306
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,610
You're Han Se Ju, right?

307
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,910
You were wearing a worn out sweatsuit.

308
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,610
Your hair was parted at the rate of 2 to 8.

309
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,350
You look way better in real.

310
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,480
I bet your books will be popular just for its writer being handsome.

311
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,950
Who are you?

312
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,950
Me?

313
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,650
I'm a dark horse in the publishing world...

314
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,950
who is going to make an ordinary amateur writer...

315
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,750
Han Se Ju into a bestselling author.

316
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,810
Hey, young man. I'm not finished talking yet.

317
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,450
Hey. Hey.

318
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,810
Han Se Ju is an imitator of Baek Tae Min.

319
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,450
Han Se Ju's "Destiny" is nothing more than...

320
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,180
an imitation of Baek Tae Min's "Fate".

321
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,480
Do you want to be eliminated in the literary world in Korea?

322
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,910
Don't you want to get back at them who are saying you're an imitator?

323
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,880
Is there any way to do that?

324
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,450
You don't look that successful though.

325
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,480
I'm going to found a publishing company soon.

326
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,050
I can give you the chance to write the first book to be published.

327
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,380
But you might need to change the genre to more popular one.

328
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,480
- Why... 
- Why did I pick you?

329
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,150
As soon as I read your writing, I got the feeling.

330
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,180
Talent, character, and appearance.

331
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,110
You got all these three things. You're definitely going to...

332
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,710
be a star writer. So I...

333
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,650
I mean we...

334
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,610
We are going to be incredibly rich.

335
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,850
What do you think?

336
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,250
Do you want to join me or not?

337
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,580
I'd like to join you.

338
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,810
Really?

339
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,280
Why?

340
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,910
You're cheesy and snob. And above all,

341
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,880
I like that you are outrightly crazy about money.

342
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,210
Don't ever change.

343
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,180
That was us.

344
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,550
I never change. Why do you change?

345
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,410
How can your belief change so easily?

346
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,110
At the time, I had a clear goal.

347
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,880
It may have been impure, but I had a purpose.

348
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,310
- But how about now? 
- I have nothing.

349
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,010
I'm confused about everything.

350
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,980
Se Ju.

351
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,610
What's confusing you? Tell me. I'll clarify it for you.

352
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,710
I said everything is confusing.

353
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,380
I don't know what I'm writing,

354
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,150
and I don't know why I need to write it.

355
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,050
You can come up with reasons.

356
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,710
Just stop a stranger and ask.

357
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,710
See how many people know why they live. Everyone...

358
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,750
- Everyone lives like that. 
- More than anything,

359
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,950
I am no longer happy when I write.

360
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,550
What's wrong with you? You're acting like an amateur.

361
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,480
I'm too tired from writing something that's worth money.

362
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,950
I don't want to write anything...

363
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,480
that doesn't make money even if it's writing a diary.

364
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,750
- And... 
- Why would you say "and"?

365
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,180
It should be "but".

366
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,810
And...

367
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,710
(I miss you more at night than in the afternoon.)

368
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,610
I'm confused about the past and the present life.

369
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,150
Did I really write that? Or didn't I?

370
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,280
Is my heart stirred...

371
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,950
because of Su Hyeon from the past life?

372
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,610
Or is it because of...

373
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,450
- He did really well. 
- He did?

374
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,580
Good job.

375
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,750
It's his first time to get vaccinated, so...

376
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,680
Please watch him well.

377
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,080
For a day, you shouldn't...

378
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,310
Doctor?

379
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:42,080
For a day, you shouldn't make him exercise or take him outside.

380
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,580
I'll see you in two weeks.

381
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,450
So he got kicked out from the hospital too.

382
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,480
He wasn't kicked out. She has a point.

383
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,480
If people hear that we take in abandoned dogs,

384
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,150
more people will abandon their dogs in front of the clinic.

385
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,850
Right. Why don't you ask Mr. Baek to take him?

386
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,980
But it's too late. We're not that close.

387
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,180
What do we do with him then?

388
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,850
Welcome.

389
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,350
The dog in front of the shop is yours, isn't he?

390
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,550
No.

391
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,080
He's my friend's. They're leaving soon.

392
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,180
I'm sorry. I'll take him right now.

393
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,810
I'm sorry, Seol. I'll be done soon.

394
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,480
Take a stroll around this area. Okay?

395
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,250
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,680
About what?

397
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,880
You got yelled at because of me.

398
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,710
Don't worry about it.

399
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,750
I'm sorry.

400
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,680
About what again?

401
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,280
I am already living off you, and I even brought a dog with me.

402
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,010
I'm really sorry to you,

403
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,550
but Gyun Woo reminds me of my old self.

404
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,550
So I can't neglect him.

405
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,180
When my dad passed away and I became alone,

406
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,050
I had nowhere to go and your mom took me in.

407
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,650
If you and your mom didn't take me in,

408
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,080
I would've wandered around like Gyun Woo too.

409
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,250
Why are you crying? You're embarrassing me.

410
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,580
Why are you so sorry all the time?

411
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,280
When the kids didn't play with me because my mom's a shaman,

412
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,780
you were the only one that played with me.

413
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,550
You fought for me and always sided with me.

414
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,780
I felt so reassured because of you.

415
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,710
I am the one with the sad story.

416
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,910
Why are you the one crying?

417
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,780
Why are you crying and chasing away your luck?

418
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,680
What are you doing?

419
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,310
Whose tail is that?

420
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Did you say he's not a Sapsali?

421
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,880
- No. He's an English Sheepdog. 
- He's an English Sheepdog.

422
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,750
He's obviously a Sapsali.

423
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,250
- He's not a Sapsali. 
- He's not a Sapsali.

424
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,210
If he's not a Sapsali,

425
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,810
I don't need him.

426
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,210
- He's a Sapsali. 
- He's a Sapsali.

427
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,310
How dare you lie to me? Idiots.

428
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:39,780
It's just a rumor that a Sapsali chases ghosts away.

429
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,880
Look at him. He's so gentle. He can't chase ghosts away.

430
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,580
He won't affect your business at all. Don't worry.

431
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,810
For now,

432
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,010
tie him over there.

433
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,350
Really? Can I really do that?

434
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,250
If my business fails, it's all your fault, girl.

435
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,780
Why am I the one getting blamed? Am I chasing the ghosts away?

436
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,850
Welcome. Are you here to get your fortune told?

437
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,480
Goodness.

438
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,080
I'm keeping him so that the ghosts won't get to you.

439
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,480
How is it my fault?

440
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,880
I heard dogs these days don't eat scraps.

441
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,480
Seol, you will pay for his food.

442
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,350
Of course. Thank you.

443
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,810
- Tell me. Why is it my fault? 
- Things worked out well, right?

444
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,480
You have to be a good boy, so she can love you.

445
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,710
Okay?

446
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,750
This is driving me crazy.

447
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,250
Why is that dog so loud?

448
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,380
He's going to bark all night.

449
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
Goodness.

450
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,250
It's because he's not used to this house.

451
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,780
After today...

452
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,680
Jeon Seol.

453
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,010
What's wrong?

454
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,780
I'm not going to abandon you.

455
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,350
I'm going to find you good parents.

456
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,250
Why did you cry so much?

457
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,480
Did you cry because you were reminded of the past?

458
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,410
Don't do that. Okay? It's better to forget sad memories fast.

459
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,380
Look at me. I'm living just fine.

460
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,110
Anyway, where should I send you?

461
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,350
(To Han Se Ju)

462
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,080
(Literature Camp)

463
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,380
Han Se Ju is Baek Tae Min's imitator.

464
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,910
Do you want to be eliminated in the literary world in Korea?

465
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,080
Hello, Mr. Baek.

466
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,210
I'm actually calling to ask a favor.

467
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,580
The other day, you said you'd look after Gyun Woo.

468
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,780
Is that offer still valid?

469
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,580
Really?

470
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,280
Would you adopt him?

471
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,380
Gosh, thank you. Thank you so much.

472
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,950
- Then I'll go to your studio... 
- It's okay.

473
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,050
I was just about to step out for a cup of coffee anyway.

474
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,580
We might miss each other, so...

475
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,980
I'll bring you coffee to thank you.

476
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,680
Will you?

477
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,580
What should I get? What do you usually drink?

478
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,680
Let's have a quick talk.

479
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,480
Two regular-sized Americano, please.

480
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,080
It's okay. I already got my coffee.

481
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,320
An extra shot in one of them, please.

482
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,650
I already got my coffee with an extra shot.

483
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,950
They're to go, so I'd like a tray too.

484
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,450
I'll let you know when they're ready.

485
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,580
Thank you.

486
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,080
Hey, am I invisible to you?

487
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,880
Why would you be invisible? You're perfectly visible.

488
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,280
Why are you talking so casually to me though?

489
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,980
I'd be polite to you if you were still the writer I admire,

490
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,950
but I no longer have any reason to be like that.

491
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,080
It's about time we nail it down.

492
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,880
If you talk politely to me, I'll do the same.

493
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,750
If you talk casually, I'll talk to you the same way.

494
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,480
Anyway, let's talk first.

495
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,680
I guess I didn't make it simple enough for you.

496
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,450
Will you keep talking casually to me or be polite with me?

497
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,080
- Look. 
- What?

498
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,910
Shall I be short with you too?

499
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:10,180
I would like to talk to you about something.

500
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,320
About the last time, I...

501
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,380
I apologize.

502
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,780
But if you know everything that happened,

503
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,080
you'd agree that it wasn't entirely my fault.

504
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,580
I fully understand why you got the wrong idea,

505
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,750
but I... I mean,

506
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,380
I don't abuse animals.

507
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,480
Ripping your purse wasn't my doing.

508
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,880
There was also a reason I had to yell at you like that...

509
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,580
Then who did it?

510
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,010
You won't believe me even if I tell you.

511
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,820
I'll believe you. Please tell me.

512
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,780
Do you believe in supernatural beings?

513
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,650
Like ghosts, for example.

514
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,380
You'll find it hard to believe,

515
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,950
but a third party intervened...

516
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,880
between you and me.

517
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,880
- That person is... 
- Hey, Han Se Ju.

518
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,580
What is the matter with you?

519
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,110
I've been waiting for a sincere apology.

520
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,850
You came to the clinic and left,

521
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,880
so I thought you weren't ready yet.

522
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,110
"I should give him more time." That's what I told myself.

523
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,480
Please calm down first.

524
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,550
Is it that hard for you to admit your fault?

525
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,480
Is it that difficult for you to apologize?

526
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,580
Supernatural beings?

527
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,080
Be creative, will you? Is that all you can come up with for an excuse?

528
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,980
Hear me out first, okay?

529
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,320
Try to use your reasoning if you have a thing called brain.

530
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,880
At that time, I was here.

531
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,010
And you were over there.

532
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,880
From where I was,

533
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,110
I couldn't even reach your purse, let alone rip it.

534
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,580
What can be concluded from it?

535
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,680
It proves that there was a third party.

536
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,820
Goodness. I can't even stand the sight of you.

537
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,320
You can't stand what?

538
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,280
- If you're done... 
- Are you going to leave?

539
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
No.

540
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,480
You should get out.

541
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:47,711
- If you're done... 
- Are you going to leave?

542
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:48,801
No.

543
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:50,871
You should get out.

544
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:55,171
I have to reorder because my coffee has gotten cold thanks to you!

545
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:06,711
Yoo Jin Oh?

546
00:39:09,211 --> 00:39:11,571
Yoo Jin Oh. You're in there, aren't you?

547
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:15,441
Come out for a minute, okay?

548
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:17,711
Don't ignore me like that.

549
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:20,571
Do you know what you've done to me?

550
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:24,941
My life has become a total mess because of you.

551
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,341
I feel so lost and confused.

552
00:39:27,441 --> 00:39:29,941
I'm also under a mortifying misapprehension.

553
00:39:31,711 --> 00:39:33,101
Come on out.

554
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,471
Please. Come out, okay?

555
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:39,641
Come on out first.

556
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:45,271
Come out, and we'll think about how you can reveal yourself confidently.

557
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:46,741
I'll help you.

558
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:49,271
Gosh, I'm sad that I'm witnessing this sight by myself.

559
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:56,871
I know. I must look a little weird to you.

560
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:00,101
But he's not a normal dog.

561
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:02,671
He may look like an ordinary dog to you,

562
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:05,471
- but there's something inside... 
- Gosh, that's enough!

563
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:09,571
This is why celebrities are scared of their fans turning on them.

564
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,671
Everything about you bothers me now.

565
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:14,171
Gyun Woo, let's go.

566
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:17,471
Hang on. Let me talk to him!

567
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:23,471
All right. I won't ask you to believe me.

568
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:28,171
But I really need this dog.

569
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:30,271
Too bad.

570
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:32,471
You should've been this desperate a little sooner.

571
00:40:32,901 --> 00:40:35,341
I'm on my way to meet his new owner who's adopting him.

572
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:36,571
Wait.

573
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,771
I'll look after him.

574
00:40:44,571 --> 00:40:46,541
Didn't you say you're allergic to dog hair?

575
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:48,841
I didn't know that.

576
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:51,211
Mr. Baek.

577
00:40:51,571 --> 00:40:53,801
I was on my way there. You didn't have to come out.

578
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:56,211
I was just wondering what's taking you so long.

579
00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:59,571
By the way, were you always allergic to dog hair?

580
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:01,441
I don't think I've heard about it.

581
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:10,101
Some of my fans send me dogs as gifts from time to time.

582
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:13,871
I had to find an excuse because I thought they'd be a lot of work.

583
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,211
That gives me more reasons not to give him to you.

584
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,741
What other lies will you tell when you don't want to look after him?

585
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:21,801
I won't abandon him. I'll take care of him until the end.

586
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:22,841
I'm sorry,

587
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:25,571
- but Mr. Baek told me first... 
- I'll offer him the perfect home.

588
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:27,971
Comfortable facilities and a huge garden.

589
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:31,171
Staff who can look after him whenever I'm not around.

590
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:34,371
Also, top-notch food will be given to him at every mealtime.

591
00:41:37,711 --> 00:41:39,471
You can take him.

592
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:41,211
You stay out of this.

593
00:41:41,671 --> 00:41:44,441
Let Se Ju take him. I can't look after him like that.

594
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:45,741
But...

595
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:51,271
Take good care of him.

596
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:54,571
Why are you acting like you're the generous one?

597
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:56,371
Are you his mom or something?

598
00:41:58,471 --> 00:41:59,941
Let's go. Come on.

599
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:04,211
- Gyun Woo! 
- Just let him go.

600
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:07,901
He said all those things himself. I'm sure he'll keep his word.

601
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:09,571
I mean, he has a thing called pride.

602
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:14,341
About our meeting today... A lecture got scheduled unexpectedly.

603
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:17,271
Would it be okay to move it to 6pm?

604
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:20,271
Well, sure. I'll be there on time.

605
00:42:28,271 --> 00:42:30,771
Mr. Han, why did you bring a dog?

606
00:42:31,901 --> 00:42:33,711
I want to look after him from now on.

607
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:37,071
- Then leave him in the garden. 
- I'll take him out later.

608
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:41,341
I have to have a deep conversation with him at the moment.

609
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:54,071
All of you haven't forgotten, right?

610
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,371
Article 1, Section 1 of your contract, duty of confidentiality.

611
00:43:02,741 --> 00:43:03,741
All right.

612
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:10,441
This is like a sacred ground which no one can enter without permission.

613
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:13,871
No one can bother us...

614
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:17,671
and you can show yourself without any worries.

615
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:21,471
Come out.

616
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:27,501
It's all right. Come out.

617
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:32,271
Hey.

618
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:34,601
Tell me the truth.

619
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:38,171
You're just a dog, aren't you?

620
00:43:53,771 --> 00:43:57,541
He had a conversation with the dog this morning.

621
00:43:57,541 --> 00:44:00,141
Now, he's building a dog house.

622
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:04,141
Yoo Jin Oh, you scum!

623
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:08,341
Because of that jerk, I had to care for the dog.

624
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:11,871
- Once you show up, I'll... 
- Stop it.

625
00:44:12,571 --> 00:44:16,401
This is why celebrities are scared of their fans turning on them.

626
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:19,441
Everything about you bothers me now.

627
00:44:22,771 --> 00:44:24,071
Mr. Baek.

628
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:26,271
I was on my way there. You didn't have to come out.

629
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:28,901
Would it be okay to move it to 6pm?

630
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:31,771
Well, sure. I'll be there on time.

631
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:36,171
Gosh!

632
00:44:52,871 --> 00:44:55,371
He's now looking at the sky.

633
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:59,171
He looks a little sad.

634
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:03,371
You said we've met before, right?

635
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:05,701
When is it?

636
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:09,071
I got a feeling as soon as I started reading the novel.

637
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,971
"He'll become a phenomenal writer."

638
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:14,271
I already knew it then...

639
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:17,441
that he's going to be a great writer.

640
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:19,341
So keep writing.

641
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,271
Since then, I have always been your fan.

642
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:24,341
I'll hold a gun. You need to pick up your pen.

643
00:45:24,341 --> 00:45:26,371
I hope the hard time you go through now...

644
00:45:26,441 --> 00:45:28,901
is not a suffering but a training.

645
00:45:29,241 --> 00:45:33,241
They say your talent would be taken away if you don't make it through.

646
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:34,471
That novel...

647
00:45:35,371 --> 00:45:37,371
I really hope you complete it.

648
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:39,971
It doesn't matter when.

649
00:45:44,471 --> 00:45:45,501
I...

650
00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:50,241
I don't want your talent to be taken away.

651
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:54,671
Su Hyeon wanted the novel to be completed.

652
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:56,871
Please.

653
00:45:57,571 --> 00:45:59,071
Please keep writing.

654
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:31,571
Is the manuscript boring?

655
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:32,801
Pardon?

656
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:35,641
I haven't finished reading it.

657
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:38,071
It must be boring because you're thinking about something else.

658
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:39,541
Drink it.

659
00:46:40,641 --> 00:46:41,971
I'm sorry.

660
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,641
I'm a bit worried about Gyun Woo.

661
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:46,441
Maybe I shouldn't have sent him there.

662
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:48,971
Maybe I shouldn't have handed him over just like that.

663
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:51,671
I'm not blaming you though.

664
00:46:52,341 --> 00:46:54,271
He would have taken him anyway.

665
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,771
Pardon?

666
00:47:00,771 --> 00:47:01,901
I'm talking about Se Ju.

667
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:04,771
Even if we stopped him,

668
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:07,341
he would have taken him anyway.

669
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:09,071
How come?

670
00:47:10,371 --> 00:47:13,071
He's kind of competitive.

671
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:17,771
Whenever I was interested in something,

672
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:19,971
he always wanted to have it.

673
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,641
Right. You once lived with Mr. Han.

674
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:29,001
How did you know that?

675
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:33,971
I'm Mr. Han's fan since long ago. So I know quite a lot about him.

676
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:37,371
There was even an article that you might be brothers.

677
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:42,171
I also have a question.

678
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:43,601
For me?

679
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:45,271
What is it?

680
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:48,971
What kind of relationship do you and Mr. Han have?

681
00:47:53,005 --> 00:47:56,135
What kind of relationship do you and Mr. Han have?

682
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:02,805
According to the article, you're his ghostwriter or his lover.

683
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,575
At the press conference, he said,

684
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:09,605
you saved his life and you're a big fan of him.

685
00:48:10,775 --> 00:48:12,535
Of course it's the latter.

686
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:16,705
So you're not his lover at least.

687
00:48:17,475 --> 00:48:18,575
It's okay then.

688
00:48:19,305 --> 00:48:20,735
What's okay?

689
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:22,705
This has been bothering me.

690
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:29,835
The underlined part in the manuscript is related to veterinary.

691
00:48:30,205 --> 00:48:32,105
I wish you concentrate on that part.

692
00:48:33,575 --> 00:48:34,575
Okay.

693
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:51,135
I think I just loved your talent,

694
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:54,405
not the man Han Se Ju is.

695
00:48:54,505 --> 00:48:55,805
That novel...

696
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:58,505
I really hope you complete it.

697
00:48:59,735 --> 00:49:01,705
It doesn't matter when.

698
00:49:03,305 --> 00:49:06,705
I thought stopping writing would make me happy.

699
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,375
But it doesn't seem like it.

700
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:37,205
Hey, Yoo Jin Oh.

701
00:49:40,735 --> 00:49:42,035
Are you there?

702
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:46,105
If you're there, come out.

703
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:54,105
You coward.

704
00:49:55,735 --> 00:49:58,105
You keep hiding yourself in there.

705
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:01,735
Because of you, my life is now in chaos.

706
00:50:04,675 --> 00:50:08,405
You threw a stone into a calm lake.

707
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:12,105
You must reckon for what you did, you jerk!

708
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:21,275
Fine. I get it.

709
00:50:21,305 --> 00:50:22,905
Let's write!

710
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:25,405
I'm going to write! So come out!

711
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,605
Do you mean it?

712
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:05,275
You just said you'd keep writing.

713
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:07,305
Do you mean it?

714
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:10,005
I never go back on my word.

715
00:51:11,475 --> 00:51:13,905
Let's write together.

716
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:28,635
Are you finally interested in your past life?

717
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:30,835
No.

718
00:51:31,775 --> 00:51:33,735
I still haven't changed my mind.

719
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,405
I don't care about my past life.

720
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:40,675
And you're not my friend.

721
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:42,935
Then why...

722
00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:45,805
did you say you'd write the novel?

723
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:50,575
This is the only way to go back to how it was before.

724
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:55,475
I need to finish this up...

725
00:51:57,605 --> 00:52:00,105
to put an end to this chaos,

726
00:52:02,005 --> 00:52:05,735
so that I can make a fresh start as a writer.

727
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:10,605
I guess I will find out...

728
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:13,905
when we write together.

729
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:19,705
I'll find out why I'm so confused.

730
00:52:21,835 --> 00:52:23,205
And because of whom...

731
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,935
my heart gets...

732
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:29,905
stirred.

733
00:52:36,475 --> 00:52:37,835
Thanks to you,

734
00:52:39,475 --> 00:52:43,335
I might be able to get over this long slump.

735
00:52:48,935 --> 00:52:51,005
One you get yourself involved in this,

736
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:54,605
you can never turn it back.

737
00:52:56,035 --> 00:52:59,975
Regardless of how the novel ends and what truth you find out,

738
00:53:00,605 --> 00:53:02,375
you still have to stick with me until the end.

739
00:53:03,435 --> 00:53:05,835
Do you still want to sign with me?

740
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,735
I said I would.

741
00:53:09,975 --> 00:53:11,305
Great.

742
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:16,175
I'll help you get over your slump.

743
00:53:16,475 --> 00:53:17,535
But...

744
00:53:19,105 --> 00:53:21,535
there's a condition.

745
00:53:23,135 --> 00:53:24,235
A condition?

746
00:53:40,105 --> 00:53:41,305
Gosh, you startled me.

747
00:53:42,535 --> 00:53:44,705
Did I startle you? I'm sorry.

748
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:46,175
It's all right.

749
00:53:46,535 --> 00:53:48,905
I get startled easily these days.

750
00:53:54,905 --> 00:53:58,905
The parts with blue mark are related to veterinary medicine.

751
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:01,905
They are already too accurate that it's embarrassing for me.

752
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:03,435
Good work.

753
00:54:04,205 --> 00:54:06,075
I will get going now then.

754
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:07,505
Just a moment.

755
00:54:14,105 --> 00:54:15,505
What's this?

756
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:18,335
The publishing company is holding a literary camp this weekend.

757
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:22,175
Would you go with me and get some air if you're not busy?

758
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,605
I applied for this camp too.

759
00:54:24,935 --> 00:54:27,605
It was too competitive that I couldn't win the ticket.

760
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:31,335
You applied for Se Ju's camp, didn't you?

761
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:34,805
Well, that's right.

762
00:54:35,835 --> 00:54:37,575
Anyway, think about it and call me.

763
00:54:38,305 --> 00:54:40,175
Okay. I'll think about it.

764
00:54:40,175 --> 00:54:42,705
- I'll get going now. 
- Let me go with you.

765
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,235
- I'll give you a ride. 
- No, it's okay.

766
00:54:45,235 --> 00:54:46,805
It won't take long by bus.

767
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,435
You should continue with what you've been doing. I'll just go.

768
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,805
Take care then.

769
00:54:57,505 --> 00:54:58,705
Goodness.

770
00:54:59,575 --> 00:55:00,805
She's so defensive.

771
00:55:03,235 --> 00:55:04,375
Goodness.

772
00:55:07,005 --> 00:55:08,505
It's upsetting a little.

773
00:55:15,175 --> 00:55:18,135
This is strange. I had an umbrella.

774
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:24,275
- I'm glad I followed you. 
- Mr. Baek.

775
00:55:24,705 --> 00:55:27,475
It's raining. Let me give you a ride.

776
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:30,805
Here it is.

777
00:55:31,175 --> 00:55:32,535
I'll get going then.

778
00:55:38,275 --> 00:55:41,805
I'm sorry. I didn't see the motorbike.

779
00:55:42,135 --> 00:55:44,135
I told you I'll give you a ride.

780
00:55:44,805 --> 00:55:47,205
Please let go.

781
00:56:04,705 --> 00:56:08,275
There's a condition.

782
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:10,905
A condition?

783
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,435
What is that condition?

784
00:56:18,005 --> 00:56:21,035
For helping you get over your slump,

785
00:56:21,635 --> 00:56:25,375
you should remove all the guys roaming around Seol.

786
00:56:25,435 --> 00:56:26,705
All of them.

787
00:56:28,835 --> 00:56:30,935
- What? 
- Stop my girl...

788
00:56:30,935 --> 00:56:32,805
from dating another man.

789
00:56:35,735 --> 00:56:36,905
Are you mad?

790
00:56:39,405 --> 00:56:43,635
Do you think I'll do such a childish and a crude thing?

791
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:04,805
What are you doing right now?

792
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:09,735
I told you. I don't want to lose anything to you anymore.

793
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:16,205
Hello?

794
00:57:16,935 --> 00:57:18,235
Guys.

795
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:22,275
Guys.

796
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:25,735
Let's go.

797
00:58:27,205 --> 00:58:30,205
(Chicago Typewriter)

798
00:58:30,205 --> 00:58:31,975
- I want a written contract. 
- Go away.

799
00:58:32,005 --> 00:58:33,975
Can't you just do it?

800
00:58:33,975 --> 00:58:36,175
Why are you so obsessed with Seol?

801
00:58:36,175 --> 00:58:39,005
Are you jealous right now? Do you like me?

802
00:58:39,175 --> 00:58:41,275
Do you believe in a magical being?

803
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:43,535
What is this nonsense?

804
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:45,205
You've never dated anyone, have you?

805
00:58:45,205 --> 00:58:47,605
Do you want to go to the suburb with me?

806
00:58:47,605 --> 00:58:49,235
I know a quiet and an atmospheric cafe.

807
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,475
Should I go and bite him?

808
00:58:50,805 --> 00:58:53,035
- I can see my past life. 
- Do you know?

809
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:55,005
Do you know who Ryu Su Hyeon is?
