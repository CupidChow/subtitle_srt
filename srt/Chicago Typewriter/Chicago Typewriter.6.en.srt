1
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,440
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:23,723
Are you okay? Are you very surprised?

3
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:31,763
You... Who are you?

4
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:36,094
Those pictures and videos... What happened?

5
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:38,964
Who are you?

6
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:41,794
I already told you.

7
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:44,595
I'm your ghost writer, Yoo Jin Oh.

8
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:48,065
- The thing is... - The thing is?

9
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:53,065
I am really a ghost.

10
00:00:57,926 --> 00:00:59,396
A ghost?

11
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:07,966
I'm the ghost who's been locked up there...

12
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:09,566
for 80 years.

13
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:16,326
She's a thing of beauty, isn't she?

14
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:18,786
That's from your country, actually. Korea.

15
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:22,816
Yes. That was handcrafted way back in the 1930s in Kyungsung.

16
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,216
Buddy.

17
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,086
How did you get in here?

18
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:38,056
Actually, I was once in the dark world,

19
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,156
so it's easy to break into another person's...

20
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:41,556
Who sent you here?

21
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:45,156
I sent myself here.

22
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:48,156
I sent myself to you.

23
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:52,486
When, where, and how did you come to know that woman?

24
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,616
- This is it. - The day I came here from the US,

25
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:55,716
Let me see.

26
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,486
I fell in love with her at first sight at the airport.

27
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:02,216
Stay right there.

28
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:05,956
He's cute.

29
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:14,756
Get off.

30
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:19,916
Follow me.

31
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,186
Yes. No.

32
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:31,686
What are you doing? Come in.

33
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:37,256
- Have a seat. - What is he trying to do?

34
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:40,786
"Chicago Typewriter", which is running serially right now,

35
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,986
was written by this man.

36
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:46,586
This man is my ghost writer.

37
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,256
Mr. Han, are you okay?

38
00:02:57,186 --> 00:03:00,786
Mr. Han. Mr. Han! Mr. Han...

39
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,186
(Chicago Typewriter)

40
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:05,786
Mr. Han.

41
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,586
Mr. Han.

42
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:10,386
Mr. Han.

43
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:15,586
You woke up?

44
00:03:21,886 --> 00:03:23,256
Mr. Han, let's...

45
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:25,956
Our Father,

46
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:28,286
hallowed be your name.

47
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,186
Our Father, hallowed be your name...

48
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:36,456
Escaping from the reality isn't a wise thing to do. We should talk...

49
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,886
Mr. Han, can we please talk about it?

50
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:03,056
Get out!

51
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,386
Get lost!

52
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:14,086
I have no idea why I suddenly became visible to you.

53
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:18,116
I know for certain that you couldn't see me at first, but...

54
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:21,316
Who are you?

55
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:23,986
You can see me?

56
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:27,986
That day, I thought it was just a coincidence which happened...

57
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:30,386
because the universe decided to work its mysterious magic somehow.

58
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,026
What do you think you're doing right now?

59
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:44,156
Am I caught again?

60
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:46,526
Then you saw me again.

61
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:52,416
That's why I became certain. "Oh, Mr. Han can see me now."

62
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,586
But...

63
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:01,056
why did you become visible to me suddenly, sir?

64
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:02,486
Gosh.

65
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:06,086
Please feel free to talk casually to me. You're a human,

66
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:07,786
and I'm just a ghost.

67
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:10,216
By any chance, will I...

68
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,216
Will I become possessed by spirits because of you?

69
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:18,186
Will I become a channeler because of you?

70
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:25,186
I'm pretty sure that won't happen. There must be a reason,

71
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:28,856
but I don't really know what it is yet.

72
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:35,416
Then are you saying you're only visible to me, sir?

73
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,156
That's right. Only you...

74
00:05:42,056 --> 00:05:43,456
can see me.

75
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:03,986
Actually, there's one more person.

76
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:05,856
Who is it?

77
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:10,386
Looking at Keun Woo longingly, she says this.

78
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:13,256
"If it doesn't happen in this lifetime,"

79
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,686
"let's promise to meet again in our next life."

80
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:16,956
You said it's about reincarnation.

81
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,516
We're already on page 28.

82
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,986
When will the protagonist die? She has to die to be reincarnated.

83
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:23,016
Wait a bit more.

84
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:26,856
"In our next life,"

85
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:29,916
"you should be born as a horse and I want to be your muscles."

86
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:33,016
"Let's never be apart again"?

87
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:37,686
You're obviously not winning this script contest.

88
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:41,116
- Why do you say that? - A man and a woman in love...

89
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:45,016
will be reincarnated as a horse and its muscles? Does it make sense?

90
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:48,786
Well... Anyway, this is the ending.

91
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:53,786
The two of them are reincarnated as a horse with superb muscles.

92
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,186
A hermaphrodite. The two of them will live as one body.

93
00:06:57,186 --> 00:07:01,356
Flaunting the firm muscles, they run through a wide field together.

94
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:06,786
As their cry of joy fills the theater,

95
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:08,216
the closing credits will roll up...

96
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,116
I'm getting goosebumps right now.

97
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:12,186
Anyway, I'm taking my hands off this.

98
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:14,256
You're so mean.

99
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:17,986
You just don't understand my advanced metaphors.

100
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:20,786
Metaphor, my foot.

101
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:27,056
Please help me. I beg of you.

102
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:29,356
I'm very healthy and energetic,

103
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:31,286
so please just let me have excellent writing skills.

104
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:34,486
I don't need potential. I want to become rich.

105
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:37,786
My mom, who's a mediocre shaman, can have other spirits,

106
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:42,116
but please let the spirit who can write well come to me.

107
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:46,586
How many times have I told you that you can actually get possessed?

108
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:48,786
Don't hit me!

109
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:52,986
Listen. Quit wanting to become a scriptwriter for dramas.

110
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:56,386
It can be worse than preparing for the national exam. Do you know that?

111
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:59,316
Becoming a writer is just like becoming a shaman.

112
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:02,786
All the pain ends when you accept your fate as a shaman.

113
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:06,856
The same goes for an aspiring writer. Winning the contest will...

114
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:10,216
Shut it before I stitch your lips together.

115
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:12,786
Try and talk again.

116
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:15,286
- Go ahead and try talking. - Gosh!

117
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,716
No violence. Just talk to me.

118
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:22,386
Oh, hello. Are you here to get a reading done?

119
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:28,486
You witch. How dare you try to trick me?

120
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:30,516
We're almost done here. Please come in.

121
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:34,516
Oh, you have ketchup on your lips.

122
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,686
No, down here.

123
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,486
Take your time and enjoy your session.

124
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:58,356
Gosh, that witch...

125
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:00,356
Goodness.

126
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:02,056
Anyway,

127
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:04,626
her mom is a shaman, so I get it.

128
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:08,586
But with you, I'm sure there's a reason.

129
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:10,516
We should find what it is soon...

130
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,516
You should just figure out how you can attain Buddhahood.

131
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:17,086
And get out of my house now.

132
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:21,016
Mr. Han, please help me.

133
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:22,586
With what?

134
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:24,586
Attaining Buddhahood?

135
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:26,156
No.

136
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:28,586
Finding out how I can become visible to people.

137
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,416
Why should I?

138
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,156
Are you...

139
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:38,916
Are you trying to get into someone's body?

140
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,416
Will I be possessed by you?

141
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,716
Don't worry about that. I can't do that yet with people.

142
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:47,786
Well, I guess I can do it with animals.

143
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,256
Just try to attain Buddhahood, will you?

144
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:53,856
You're a ghost. Why do you even want to become visible?

145
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,516
Do you want to become a celebrity?

146
00:09:57,126 --> 00:10:00,586
I want to confess my feelings to Seol.

147
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:05,786
What did you say?

148
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:10,356
I want to tell her how I feel about her. I told you.

149
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,086
I fell in love with her at first sight.

150
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:29,986
(I now know. You must tolerate what I cannot tolerate...)

151
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:37,886
"I now know."

152
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:41,056
"You must tolerate what you cannot tolerate."

153
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,016
"And exhausted by things that you cannot handle,"

154
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:47,586
"you spend some nights with teary eyes."

155
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,686
People treated it as just another rumor,

156
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:01,916
but I had to relentlessly recover my damaged pride...

157
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:05,116
as a writer every time.

158
00:11:05,256 --> 00:11:07,116
And I can dare to say that I know...

159
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,386
what you dreamed...

160
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,416
and what you've achieved.

161
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,716
Please stop digging out her personal information.

162
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:17,156
Please stop giving her harassing calls.

163
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:21,616
I beg you.

164
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,586
(Urgent press conference)

165
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:35,116
Fire!

166
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:42,786
Finished.

167
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,256
Fantastic.

168
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:48,986
The name of this lunch box is "O Sole Mio".

169
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:51,116
It means, "Oh, my sun."

170
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:53,086
Seol, you're my sun.

171
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:56,256
Do you think getting this will cheer you up?

172
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,586
Of course.

173
00:11:58,516 --> 00:11:59,616
Are you giving this to someone?

174
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,916
I thought it was for you.

175
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,486
I won't spend this much on food for myself.

176
00:12:07,016 --> 00:12:10,116
Then whom is it for?

177
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:14,816
A man who begged people for me.

178
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,516
A man?

179
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,786
He begged people?

180
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,056
Hey, lady.

181
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:25,586
Men don't beg easily...

182
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:28,856
Are you talking about...

183
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:31,316
Han Se Ju?

184
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,156
Thank you for this great lunchbox, Chef Riccardo.

185
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,056
It will make someone very happy.

186
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:41,486
No, wait!

187
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,056
Fire.

188
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,756
She has a lot of men around her.

189
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:52,386
Who has what around her?

190
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,956
Did you not know?

191
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:58,356
There are a lot of men who are fond of Seol.

192
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:01,986
I've never heard of such nonsense.

193
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:03,756
I'm worried.

194
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:07,286
She's so attractive.

195
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,686
I must show myself to her as soon as possible.

196
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:15,486
So...

197
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:18,186
have you ever given it a try?

198
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,016
Pardon?

199
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:24,456
Well, I'm asking if...

200
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:30,956
you've ever shown yourself to her before.

201
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,056
I'm not so brave.

202
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:40,756
I think I'll be devastated if she fails to see me.

203
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:43,356
So...

204
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:47,016
you're saying that she might get to see you...

205
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:49,456
if you find the right opportunity?

206
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:51,956
That's what I'm hoping.

207
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:54,416
But...

208
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:57,156
why are you so interested?

209
00:13:57,156 --> 00:14:00,086
Do you also like her by any chance?

210
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:01,256
Are you crazy?

211
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:05,356
There are two things that I absolutely do not need in my life.

212
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:07,386
The first one is a ghost writer.

213
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:08,786
The second is a woman.

214
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,456
Another one got added on the list today.

215
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,716
A good-for-nothing ghost.

216
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:18,516
Get out of my house...

217
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:20,456
before I call the police...

218
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:24,156
Before I call an exorcist.

219
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:31,416
Is that an exorcist?

220
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:35,016
It's probably a massage therapist.

221
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,516
I'm sorry for coming by at such a late hour.

222
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:49,556
I came to give you something.

223
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,716
Hurry up and let her in.

224
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,116
For whom?

225
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:56,156
I'll be out, so wait...

226
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,786
That's unexpected. I can't believe he opened the door for me.

227
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:13,156
You opened the door for me. Let's be clear on that.

228
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:14,216
I'm going in.

229
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,256
So were you the one who always opened the door for her...

230
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:21,786
every time she came here?

231
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,086
You were always so mean, so I felt bad for her.

232
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:28,186
- Excuse... - Who told you to open the door?

233
00:15:32,356 --> 00:15:34,856
Well, the door was open.

234
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,856
What do you think you're doing?

235
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,686
I told you earlier that I came to give you something.

236
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,886
But why do you keep yelling?

237
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,986
You're the one who opened the door.

238
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,256
Well...

239
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,556
What I mean is...

240
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:02,616
I guess she can't see me.

241
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:12,286
What made you visit a man's house at such a late hour?

242
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:15,056
You're not a man to me.

243
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:18,086
Then what am I?

244
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:19,856
Your gender doesn't matter...

245
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:23,016
Why doesn't it matter? It's an important factor.

246
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:28,016
Never mind. What did you bring me?

247
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,816
My friend cooked this for you.

248
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:38,356
You should invite her in. Give her some tea or something.

249
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:40,186
Get lost, will you?

250
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:45,616
"Get lost"?

251
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,686
No, it's not that.

252
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:51,686
I wasn't talking to you.

253
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,756
My inner thoughts.

254
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,786
I was talking to my chaotic inner thoughts.

255
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:00,556
Come on in.

256
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:07,716
What's this?

257
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:11,886
I thought you might've skipped your meal due to the press conference.

258
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:17,716
Are you here to console me?

259
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:21,616
Yes, and I also came to say thank you.

260
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:24,356
I don't think I did anything...

261
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:26,416
to deserve that.

262
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:29,186
You bowed down for me.

263
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:32,516
Thanks to you, people stopped threatening me.

264
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:34,216
You really have a great impact.

265
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:37,616
Through this, I realized how famous you are.

266
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,716
That was nothing.

267
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,416
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:49,216
For what?

269
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:53,956
I didn't know you had visited me prior to such a big event.

270
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:57,156
Also, thank you.

271
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,286
For what?

272
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,686
You called my name for the first time that day.

273
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,656
You also thanked me and said...

274
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:06,656
you won't forget that I was your first fan.

275
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:08,216
That's enough.

276
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:10,016
You'll make me cringe if you continue.

277
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,826
While we're on that subject, there's something I want to say to you.

278
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:20,286
What are you doing?

279
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:23,616
I've never done this before, so it's quite awkward for me too.

280
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:26,156
So I'm going to read this to you instead. Please listen.

281
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:30,256
She has such a beautiful heart.

282
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:31,856
Shut it, will you?

283
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:43,686
No. That's not what I meant.

284
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,856
If you don't want to listen,

285
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:51,256
you can read it yourself later. Here you go.

286
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:59,616
I'm just really tired right now.

287
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:02,256
So you should...

288
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:04,256
Are you tired?

289
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,286
You're going to make her leave already? Why?

290
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:08,686
Mind your own business!

291
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:12,116
Get lost. Just get out of here!

292
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:14,686
Why do you keep interfering?

293
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:17,656
Why do you care?

294
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:23,056
I'm sorry for caring. I'll be off then.

295
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:25,686
Wait, don't go. Wait!

296
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:36,186
I... I didn't... It wasn't me.

297
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:37,826
It wasn't me.

298
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:40,826
I didn't do it. I didn't...

299
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:50,916
Wait. Listen to me.

300
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,416
I understand that...

301
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,156
you might be going through a lot because of today's press conference.

302
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:09,916
I tried hard to let it go, but I'm human too.

303
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,516
"He's a writer."

304
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:16,016
"He's sensitive and exhausted."

305
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:17,916
"He's not good at dealing with reality."

306
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:21,826
I tried to understand you every time you were being so emotional.

307
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,016
But I'm human too.

308
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:26,256
Well...

309
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:28,356
I never said you weren't.

310
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:29,956
Just because someone loves you...

311
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:32,616
doesn't mean you have the right to step on their pride.

312
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:36,056
Just because someone liked you first doesn't mean...

313
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:38,056
you have the power to rule over them either.

314
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,716
I loved your talent as a writer,

315
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:46,156
but I don't think I love who you are as a person.

316
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,516
I apologize for all I've done.

317
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:51,956
I won't ever care for you again.

318
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,256
Wait...

319
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:01,326
Where are you? Come out.

320
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:04,916
Come out right now!

321
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:10,786
Come out!

322
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:16,886
Come out.

323
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:18,586
Have you decided to hide like a coward?

324
00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:36,386
Come out!

325
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:46,586
Come out.

326
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:51,386
If you don't come out right now, I'm going to crush you!

327
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:59,486
I gave you days off. Why...

328
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:02,286
Mr. Han. We're sorry.

329
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:05,556
Why are you doing this?

330
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:07,556
We had no idea how much you were suffering...

331
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:09,856
because you never showed it.

332
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,156
You must have been extremely stressed...

333
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,616
to have taken such a drastic action in front of the journalists.

334
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,856
Ms. Kang.

335
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:21,216
We won't leave you.

336
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:24,516
If you have any problem, please share with us.

337
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:26,716
Please don't try to handle it all by yourself.

338
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:30,286
We're going to be supporting you.

339
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:34,886
Se Ju!

340
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:36,816
Se Ju!

341
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:40,286
Se Ju, you sweetie.

342
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,786
How did you even think of doing such a performance?

343
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:45,416
The media and the public are completely on our side now.

344
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,986
Positive articles and comments are pouring like a meteor shower.

345
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,756
All right. Let's share the joy and...

346
00:23:54,756 --> 00:23:58,216
have an in-depth discussion together about the hopeful future.

347
00:23:58,556 --> 00:23:59,616
Let's go.

348
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:04,286
What did you just say?

349
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:07,116
I asked you to stop the project.

350
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:14,286
I'll take care of the penalty and the aftermath.

351
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:16,556
Hang on a second.

352
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:19,456
Why on earth? This is the best timing.

353
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,616
I told you. I really meant what I said at the press conference.

354
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:25,316
I will not go back on my word.

355
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:28,756
Ji Seok.

356
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:34,016
I'm going to quit everything.

357
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:41,456
I know you're very stressed. I understand you want to relax.

358
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:44,656
I will give you two weeks so that you can recharge.

359
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:47,016
Are you listening to me?

360
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:50,486
I'm not going to write the novel.

361
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:52,386
To be precise,

362
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,086
I can't.

363
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,856
Why can't you? Why?

364
00:24:58,256 --> 00:25:00,286
I didn't write the novel.

365
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:02,586
If you didn't, who wrote it?

366
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,116
The ghost writer wrote it.

367
00:25:24,686 --> 00:25:26,986
But the ghost writer is...

368
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,386
a real ghost.

369
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:37,216
I see.

370
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:42,786
Hold on. I need to go to the bathroom.

371
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:52,216
Hello, Dr. Yang. This is Gal Ji Seok from Golden Bear.

372
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:53,956
Right. I called you because...

373
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,686
I know you're there.

374
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:04,156
You'd better come out right now.

375
00:26:05,686 --> 00:26:06,956
Come out!

376
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:10,356
All right.

377
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:12,056
Bring it on.

378
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,916
Still not showing up? Still?

379
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:21,316
Come out! Show yourself!

380
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:23,986
I think Se Ju has...

381
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,416
Se Ju has...

382
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:29,516
gone crazy.

383
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:33,016
(Doctor Yang Ho Pil)

384
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:36,686
It could be because you're under the pressure to write the script...

385
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:41,456
while you're still suffering from Burnout Syndrome.

386
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:44,886
It's kind of a defense mechanism.

387
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:53,656
I will have to take a good rest and avoid stress, right?

388
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:56,186
- I should get going then. - Are you...

389
00:26:57,256 --> 00:26:59,316
still afraid you might be abandoned?

390
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,256
People who were once abandoned before...

391
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:07,256
tend to leave relationships before they get abandoned.

392
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:10,386
Maybe you announced you'd quit writing...

393
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:13,316
because you're afraid of being neglected by the readers...

394
00:27:13,656 --> 00:27:15,756
and you want to avoid that.

395
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:20,686
Who said I'm avoiding because I'm afraid?

396
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:22,816
Do you still have nightmares?

397
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:27,086
Se Ju. Se Ju.

398
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,016
(15 years ago)

399
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:30,586
Wake up.

400
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,556
Do you live here alone?

401
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:44,586
What about your relatives?

402
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:56,816
I'm a friend of your late father.

403
00:27:57,616 --> 00:28:01,056
If you don't mind, how about coming with me?

404
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:08,416
Let's be good friends.

405
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:10,556
Okay. Let's be good friends.

406
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:12,636
You want to take a shower first, right?

407
00:28:12,906 --> 00:28:15,036
I'll get you a towel and a toothbrush.

408
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,566
You must've been surprised. I'm Tae Min's mom.

409
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:45,466
Hello. My name is Han Se Ju.

410
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:48,366
I see. You're very handsome.

411
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:53,006
Thank you for your kindness. I really appreciate it.

412
00:28:53,136 --> 00:28:56,036
You're welcome. Make yourself at home.

413
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:59,666
I'm sure we can get along very well...

414
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,036
as long as you keep a few rules.

415
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,866
Rules?

416
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:07,106
Yes, rules.

417
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:15,666
While you're staying here, live silently like a ghost.

418
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:17,606
Do you understand?

419
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:21,136
Make sure no one can hear you breathing even.

420
00:29:21,766 --> 00:29:24,766
You're a disgrace to our family...

421
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:27,606
that no one should find out.

422
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,966
The nightmare in which you were saved by someone on a cliff,

423
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:35,866
but the savior let you fall down in the end.

424
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:45,206
Do you still see the ghost?

425
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,006
No.

426
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:52,766
I don't see it.

427
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:56,606
I should get going.

428
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:13,936
Are you sure you won't regret this?

429
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:19,866
I can't hear you.

430
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:22,036
I can't see you.

431
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:26,166
Could you just keep writing the novel with me?

432
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:31,106
This is a dream.

433
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,566
This is an illusion.

434
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,636
Could you please?

435
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:38,806
I'm a ghost anyway. Nobody knows who I...

436
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,509
That's what drives me crazy!

437
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:56,579
I thought I'd feel better once I reveal the truth.

438
00:30:57,809 --> 00:30:59,709
But no one believes that you exist.

439
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:03,549
They just think I'm crazy.

440
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:06,509
They don't let me quit writing.

441
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:11,549
They don't let me atone even though I want to.

442
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:15,249
You don't need to make atonement for anything.

443
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:19,909
Because of you, I've done something I shouldn't have done as a writer.

444
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,409
And are you saying I don't need to atone?

445
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:24,809
Yes.

446
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:26,909
I didn't write the novel.

447
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:29,309
Are you saying there was a ghost writer...

448
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:32,649
behind the ghost writer?

449
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:36,149
No. That novel...

450
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:39,549
was written by you 80 years ago.

451
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,649
What?

452
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:45,149
We were friends in the past life.

453
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:47,979
And we were writers.

454
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:54,949
You are lying again.

455
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,709
Even though it wasn't completed,

456
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:05,279
that novel was a story of us who lived that time fiercely.

457
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:08,479
I want to complete that novel.

458
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,579
- Get off. - Mr. Han.

459
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:12,709
Didn't you hear me? Get off!

460
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:32,709
The head housekeeper told me to fix it like this.

461
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:34,449
You should go home now.

462
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,579
The head housekeeper told me not to leave you alone.

463
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,109
Leave me alone!

464
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:41,979
I won't think about strange things...

465
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:47,109
and do something dangerous. So please go home.

466
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:53,749
Okay, sir.

467
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,809
("The Words Perhaps I Wanted to Hear the Most")

468
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:28,409
I think I loved your talent.

469
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:31,649
I don't think I liked you as a person.

470
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,879
It's her!

471
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,249
Gosh, you guys are merciless.

472
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:53,509
How can you make me buy lunch on my first day?

473
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:56,349
The world of game has no mercy.

474
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:58,619
Accept the choice of the ladder.

475
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,409
Okay. Fine. I will buy.

476
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:03,349
Doctor.

477
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,309
Mr. Baek. Is something wrong with Baek Seol?

478
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:10,879
I don't know. She's been crying in pain since the morning.

479
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:14,149
And her leg was swollen as if she fell from a high place.

480
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:15,619
Let me see.

481
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:19,349
Let's take some pictures first.

482
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:21,009
- Soo Cheol, - Yes.

483
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:23,119
It might be fracture, so please prepare for the surgery.

484
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,179
Okay, doctor.

485
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,619
Wait. Is it serious?

486
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:29,749
We have to test her to know more.

487
00:34:29,749 --> 00:34:32,049
Don't worry too much. Stay here.

488
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:43,209
Goodness. How did this happen?

489
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:44,909
This is quite serious.

490
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,249
Why don't we make an incision here and use IMP to fix the fracture?

491
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:50,709
Since there are splinters everywhere,

492
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:52,779
we should do the ESF.

493
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,079
Okay.

494
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,649
How's Baek Seol?

495
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:02,619
The right femoral region is fractured.

496
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,979
She did very well in the surgery, and she's resting now.

497
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,679
Thank goodness.

498
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,779
Thank you so much.

499
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:12,249
Thank us later.

500
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:14,509
We should see if the surgery was successful.

501
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:17,009
By the way, did you buy all of these?

502
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:18,309
Yes.

503
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:22,049
It looked like you didn't get to eat lunch because of Baek Seol.

504
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:23,619
You saved your money.

505
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:26,979
Thank you. Come, guys.

506
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,149
Have a seat. You should eat.

507
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:31,649
- It looks delicious. - Please eat.

508
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:33,809
- Thank you. - Thank you.

509
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:35,749
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

510
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:44,459
Do you have time after work?

511
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,799
Come in. Welcome.

512
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,529
Where are we?

513
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:52,929
It's my writing studio.

514
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:56,499
Didn't you ask me to have a cup of coffee at a cafe?

515
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:59,059
This is where we will be working together.

516
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,899
So I thought it would be nice to show it to you.

517
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:02,459
Work together?

518
00:36:03,299 --> 00:36:06,359
You and I? Why?

519
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:10,959
You must've been drunk that day.

520
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:14,129
I asked you to become my assistant. Don't you remember it?

521
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:16,859
Did I accept the offer?

522
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:20,829
It's strange. I think I rejected.

523
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:24,359
Let's have some tea first. Is latte okay?

524
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:37,229
Here you go. I put my heart into making it.

525
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:44,559
It's creamy and nice.

526
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,099
A warm cup of coffee is the best remedy for an awkward atmosphere.

527
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:50,859
By the way,

528
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:54,759
I remember rejecting the offer.

529
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,729
Right. You rejected.

530
00:36:56,729 --> 00:36:58,499
Right? I did, right?

531
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:01,899
I'm trying to ask you one more time.

532
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:05,459
But I really can't make time.

533
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:08,199
I am going to be working at the animal hospital.

534
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:11,169
But you only work on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

535
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,929
You're free on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

536
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:16,929
More than anything, I don't want to be a writer.

537
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:18,999
I said I need an editor.

538
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:21,199
I didn't say I need a ghost writer.

539
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:24,129
You can use your knowledge, and it's an extension of your hobby too.

540
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:26,359
Pay is high too.

541
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:29,329
Because of the scandal, you quit Do Anything too.

542
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,529
More than anything, you love books.

543
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,129
I've got a lot of rare books here.

544
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,729
You've prepared a lot of baits.

545
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,999
Please bite on something.

546
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:50,299
Did you bite it?

547
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:54,259
Should I reel you in?

548
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:00,959
Should I prepare another bait?

549
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:08,329
Congratulations. You've caught a big fish.

550
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,959
I had a good dream last night.

551
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:15,399
Thanks to that, I already prepared a gift.

552
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,599
("Fate")

553
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:20,459
("Fate")

554
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:23,959
It would've been faster if you used this as the bait from the start.

555
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:25,599
It's unfortunate.

556
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:33,399
Dear Jeon Seol.

557
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:37,329
For our good times to come.

558
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,119
("The Words Perhaps I Wanted to Hear the Most")

559
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:56,479
"I put my hand on your forehead."

560
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:59,649
"You lived very earnestly."

561
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:02,579
"Please put your hand on my forehead as well."

562
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:05,279
"The moment one person imprints his fingerprint..."

563
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:08,279
"on another person's forehead and comforts him,"

564
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:11,809
"all the unimportant things get chipped off."

565
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:15,409
"And the silence we never got to enjoy while we were..."

566
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,949
"engulfed in overwhelming desire will embrace us."

567
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:23,649
"You worked hard."

568
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:26,509
"You worked hard to live, to survive,"

569
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:29,209
"and to reach this far."

570
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:33,119
"I pray with my two hands..."

571
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:36,579
"that your most beautiful days are yet to come."

572
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,209
Wait, Seol!

573
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,119
(Ms. Kang)

574
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:16,979
Ms. Kang.

575
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:21,079
I will send you the link of an online shopping mall.

576
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,279
Can you...

577
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:28,049
Never mind. I will do it myself.

578
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,209
Okay.

579
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:09,119
Please help me a lot.

580
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:11,479
Please help me.

581
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:14,649
I honestly don't know if I can be of any help.

582
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:17,409
I've never thought of becoming a writer's assistant.

583
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:19,449
I'm sure you will help me a lot.

584
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:22,549
You remember where my studio is, right?

585
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:24,809
Of course. You should go.

586
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:26,679
I'll go see how Baek Seol is doing.

587
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,079
See you soon.

588
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:32,009
Hey, you!

589
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,619
It's you, isn't it?

590
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:39,579
Where on earth have you been?

591
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:48,179
You look so grubby.

592
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:50,809
I almost couldn't recognize you.

593
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:52,849
You seem to be enjoying it.

594
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:54,579
Eat up.

595
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,679
There's red ginseng in it.

596
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,279
It's good for you, and it'll make your coat shiny and healthy.

597
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:06,179
He looks like an abandoned dog, but he seems to really like you.

598
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:09,809
Animals love me more than people do.

599
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,909
Especially this guy. He's my number one fan.

600
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:15,279
How did you meet him?

601
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:17,179
Volunteering at an animal shelter?

602
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:18,179
No.

603
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:24,309
I met him by chance. So to speak, Mr. Han and I...

604
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,049
could meet because of him like in the tale of Gyun Woo and Jik Nyo...

605
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,449
Shall I call you Gyun Woo?

606
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:33,709
"Gyun" means "dog", and "Woo" means "friend". What do you think?

607
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:36,409
Isn't it good? Don't you think it's a good name? Do you like it?

608
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,279
You're so adorable.

609
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,079
Why do you have to be a Sapsali though?

610
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,579
Had you not been that breed which is known to ward off spirits,

611
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:49,879
I would've been able to ask Ms. Wang to let you live with us.

612
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:54,179
I guess he has nowhere to go.

613
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:58,549
No. I'm trying to find a home for him but haven't been successful.

614
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:03,449
Then can I take him?

615
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:06,449
Really?

616
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,149
Will you really take care of him?

617
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,479
Please take good care of him.

618
00:43:13,479 --> 00:43:14,709
Don't worry.

619
00:43:14,949 --> 00:43:16,409
- Bye. - Bye.

620
00:43:17,209 --> 00:43:18,479
Let's go.

621
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:21,509
You're one busy man...

622
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:26,209
from giving that woman a ride to looking after this dog.

623
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:28,509
I was wondering why you haven't published anything as of late,

624
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:30,609
but it's probably because you have no time to write.

625
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,909
- Are you here to pick a fight? - Of course not.

626
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,009
Had I known that you'd be here,

627
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:37,779
I wouldn't have come.

628
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:41,309
Right. What a strange coincidence.

629
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:43,079
What brings you here?

630
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,149
I was going to ask you that question first.

631
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:49,079
I come to this veterinary clinic for my cat.

632
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:55,749
Your cat looks like a dog.

633
00:43:57,279 --> 00:43:59,809
My cat's veterinarian gave me this dog as a gift.

634
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,909
Veterinarian?

635
00:44:03,879 --> 00:44:05,109
A gift?

636
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:08,249
What are you bothered by?

637
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,449
The former or the latter?

638
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:14,579
It looks like you think of her as more than just that.

639
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:17,849
I can also tell from your eyes that she's quite special to you.

640
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:21,409
Is it because I've known you for a long time?

641
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:25,579
At times, your eyes and face tell me what you're thinking.

642
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:29,679
From the photos I've seen, I think you two have a special relationship.

643
00:44:30,779 --> 00:44:32,979
So you read the articles about me.

644
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:34,679
Why are you interested suddenly?

645
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:37,709
I'm always curious as to what you're up to.

646
00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:39,309
I know it's not me.

647
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:42,209
I bet you're interested in what's mine.

648
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,449
And you don't stop there.

649
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:47,309
"I'll steal what I want."

650
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:57,679
I told you that nothing good will come out of this dragging long.

651
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:00,879
Go. I shouldn't have said any of that.

652
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:04,949
Don't you think it's also your fault for letting me steal whatever it is?

653
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,379
Losing something...

654
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:11,649
means you failed to protect it.

655
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,979
You don't have any rights over what you couldn't protect.

656
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:15,979
It's not any different from abandoning it.

657
00:45:18,379 --> 00:45:20,049
Right.

658
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:22,949
I didn't know that.

659
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:25,449
And that's precisely why...

660
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:28,649
I'll never let anyone steal what's mine from now on.

661
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,509
- Like what? - Whatever it is.

662
00:45:31,879 --> 00:45:33,309
By any chance,

663
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:36,749
does that include Seol?

664
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:41,249
They're quivering.

665
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:43,379
Your eyes.

666
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:51,309
First off,

667
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:54,779
I must take him.

668
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:57,409
He's actually my dog.

669
00:45:58,449 --> 00:46:00,409
A gift? My foot.

670
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:02,249
Let's go.

671
00:46:15,979 --> 00:46:18,279
You don't have any rights over what you couldn't protect.

672
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:20,409
It's not any different from abandoning it.

673
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:25,509
Are you all right, Mr. Han?

674
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:36,079
It's me.

675
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:43,949
It's me, Mr. Han.

676
00:46:57,995 --> 00:46:59,125
No way.

677
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:03,395
Did you just talk?

678
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:06,095
Yes, Mr. Han. I told you.

679
00:47:06,095 --> 00:47:10,365
I can't take control of human bodies yet, but I can do it with animals.

680
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:22,765
Didn't you...

681
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:25,595
just see something pass by?

682
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:28,735
I'm going to slit your stomach if you eat that!

683
00:47:39,695 --> 00:47:41,095
So...

684
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,995
you're the one who made Jeon Seol come into my house...

685
00:47:45,565 --> 00:47:48,235
and eat up my USB memory stick.

686
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:52,995
Then you fell into her arms.

687
00:47:53,865 --> 00:47:55,265
You're hurting my feelings here.

688
00:47:55,635 --> 00:47:58,465
I'm the one who let her know of the perilous situation...

689
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:01,895
and saved your life. Why aren't you saying anything about that?

690
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:05,135
Come out of there.

691
00:48:05,535 --> 00:48:07,565
We can talk after, okay?

692
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:11,265
You're a renowned writer. Don't you think talking to a dog might...

693
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:15,265
make you look more normal than talking to yourself?

694
00:48:15,265 --> 00:48:16,435
You punk!

695
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:18,135
Come out of there now!

696
00:48:19,265 --> 00:48:22,465
All right. It looks like I need to teach you a lesson.

697
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:24,265
What are you doing right now?

698
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:35,935
I can explain what happened.

699
00:48:37,265 --> 00:48:39,095
Shall I call the Animal Protection Society...

700
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:40,965
and make your face be on the front page of newspapers?

701
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:43,795
I know that you'll find it hard to believe,

702
00:48:44,065 --> 00:48:46,965
- but there's a reason... - What is the reason?

703
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,435
It's not like he threatened or bit you.

704
00:48:53,165 --> 00:48:54,295
Hey.

705
00:48:55,535 --> 00:48:57,735
Sometimes, not everything is as it seems.

706
00:48:57,865 --> 00:49:01,165
You didn't even listen to me when I begged you to look after him.

707
00:49:01,165 --> 00:49:03,235
Why are you being like this suddenly?

708
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:07,595
I could finally put my mind at ease as Mr. Baek offered to take him.

709
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,165
Why do you have to get in the way like this?

710
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:14,235
I got in the way?

711
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:16,565
You're not even going to take good care of him.

712
00:49:16,565 --> 00:49:19,765
If he gets on your nerves, you'll be mean to him and abandon him.

713
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:24,695
You love nothing else but yourself.

714
00:49:27,795 --> 00:49:28,895
Who said that?

715
00:49:29,465 --> 00:49:31,195
Who told you that I'm that kind of person?

716
00:49:32,165 --> 00:49:33,995
Your actions.

717
00:49:34,095 --> 00:49:35,635
Your words...

718
00:49:35,635 --> 00:49:37,395
and your fickle-mindedness.

719
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:41,095
Well, Mr. Han.

720
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:43,265
You should just drop it.

721
00:49:43,265 --> 00:49:44,495
Shut your mouth!

722
00:49:48,965 --> 00:49:50,695
What I just said was...

723
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:52,795
Even though I'm disappointed in you as a person,

724
00:49:53,435 --> 00:49:56,335
I thought I'd be able to continue being a fan of your writing.

725
00:49:57,165 --> 00:49:59,195
I really don't think I can do it anymore.

726
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:04,135
I should still thank you for everything.

727
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:08,535
I hope we don't cross paths ever again.

728
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:11,465
Gyun Woo, let's go.

729
00:50:18,235 --> 00:50:21,235
Mr. Han, I'm sorry. Mr. Han.

730
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:39,895
My apologies. I didn't intend to, but...

731
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:47,465
I'm sorry about that. I had dog hair in my mouth.

732
00:50:49,335 --> 00:50:51,795
- Mr. Han, I want to talk to you... - Don't talk to me.

733
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:54,665
I'll sell this mansion soon too.

734
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,835
I'm planning on sending that typewriter back to Chicago as well.

735
00:51:00,635 --> 00:51:02,195
You can attempt to attain Buddhahood...

736
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:05,495
or wander around as an evil spirit. I don't care what you do.

737
00:51:09,795 --> 00:51:11,335
Are you showing off what you can do?

738
00:51:11,795 --> 00:51:13,935
Will you really let him take everything from you?

739
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:16,565
From your work, "Fate", to the woman, Jeon Seol.

740
00:51:16,565 --> 00:51:18,495
Will you let Baek Tae Min steal everything from you?

741
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:20,135
I told you not to meddle in my life.

742
00:51:20,135 --> 00:51:23,995
Don't you want to know why I sent myself to you?

743
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:25,295
Not at all.

744
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:29,235
You probably wanted to be displayed at a famous writer's home.

745
00:51:29,495 --> 00:51:32,435
I bet you were hoping to publish your novel under that writer's name.

746
00:51:32,435 --> 00:51:35,135
It's because I wanted to write a novel with you.

747
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:37,035
Write it by yourself.

748
00:51:38,065 --> 00:51:41,135
- What is the problem? - I can't.

749
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,895
Most importantly, it will be your novel.

750
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:48,595
And I...

751
00:51:50,465 --> 00:51:53,035
I don't remember the final moments of my past life.

752
00:52:00,235 --> 00:52:01,965
Oh, sorry.

753
00:52:03,295 --> 00:52:06,065
Am I supposed to be crying right now?

754
00:52:07,765 --> 00:52:09,135
- Get lost. - Mr. Han.

755
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:10,265
I told you to get out.

756
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:15,335
Fine. Let's end this once and for all today.

757
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:27,895
Is this the Korean typewriter that just came out?

758
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:33,765
Why do you ask? Do you want it?

759
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:36,765
It's not a Japanese typewriter. We can type in Korean with this.

760
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:40,435
I heard that all writers use typewriters in the US and Europe.

761
00:52:41,295 --> 00:52:42,865
Shall we both get one?

762
00:52:43,795 --> 00:52:45,795
Do you even know how much it is?

763
00:52:46,195 --> 00:52:49,565
- How much is it? - It's more expensive than a bull.

764
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:52,565
Only rich people can buy it as a decoration for their home.

765
00:52:55,565 --> 00:52:58,165
Then we obviously can't buy two.

766
00:52:59,295 --> 00:53:01,435
What do you say? Shall I get one for you?

767
00:53:02,935 --> 00:53:06,595
This is all I need, buddy.

768
00:53:06,835 --> 00:53:10,335
They say that pen is stronger than a sword. It doubles as a weapon,

769
00:53:10,865 --> 00:53:13,695
and it's certainly a very useful tool in changing this world.

770
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:17,365
That was pretty impressive, Hui Young.

771
00:53:45,595 --> 00:53:48,695
So is that the Korean typewriter...

772
00:53:48,695 --> 00:53:51,565
you got for Hui Young as a gift?

773
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:52,995
That's correct.

774
00:53:53,695 --> 00:53:56,135
- It must've been expensive. - It was.

775
00:53:56,435 --> 00:54:00,535
It's a custom-made, one-of-a-kind typewriter.

776
00:54:01,235 --> 00:54:04,795
And he's writing a third-rate romance novel with it?

777
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:08,995
That I'm not sure. He just said it's not for the newspaper.

778
00:54:09,535 --> 00:54:12,495
- Then what is it? - I don't know.

779
00:54:12,495 --> 00:54:16,465
He's not writing it for money or to get women. He said...

780
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:18,635
that it's something he's been wanting to write.

781
00:54:21,565 --> 00:54:23,995
No, never. Don't even dream.

782
00:54:24,935 --> 00:54:26,065
You traitor.

783
00:54:38,635 --> 00:54:40,395
Hey, bring it back!

784
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:46,395
You traitor.

785
00:54:47,595 --> 00:54:49,795
I can't believe you're choosing a woman over a friend.

786
00:54:50,895 --> 00:54:52,765
That's how powerful love is.

787
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:26,395
Stop fidgeting.

788
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:28,535
She'll come.

789
00:55:29,695 --> 00:55:31,865
Would you be able to relax if you were me?

790
00:55:32,135 --> 00:55:36,265
Thinking about what kind of mean remarks Su Yeon might make...

791
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,295
Ladies and gentlemen.

792
00:55:57,665 --> 00:56:00,765
Still engulfed in deep darkness, the skies of Joseon...

793
00:56:01,035 --> 00:56:02,565
make us hopeless.

794
00:56:04,465 --> 00:56:07,035
That's a dangerous remark.

795
00:56:07,735 --> 00:56:12,135
But today, I saw a dim ray of light in the darkness that surrounds us.

796
00:56:16,195 --> 00:56:17,935
What's she saying now?

797
00:56:20,635 --> 00:56:23,695
That light will become a torch that drives away the darkness.

798
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:26,535
I've witnessed the birth of a phenomenal writer,

799
00:56:28,195 --> 00:56:31,995
and I'd like to share the joy of discovering the writer with you.

800
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:36,895
Here's to the bright future of the great writer, Seo Hui Young!

801
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:42,095
- Cheers! - Cheers!

802
00:56:54,065 --> 00:56:56,235
- Isn't she so cute? - Yes.

803
00:56:58,735 --> 00:57:00,495
That being said, all the drinks...

804
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:03,295
will be on the house tonight!

805
00:57:06,395 --> 00:57:07,395
Nice!

806
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,735
Let's drink!

807
00:57:17,235 --> 00:57:18,295
You're paying.

808
00:57:23,435 --> 00:57:25,395
Hey, no. Don't!

809
00:58:13,065 --> 00:58:15,665
Will you believe me now?

810
00:58:19,435 --> 00:58:20,465
Yes.

811
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:25,135
Please help me.

812
00:58:26,865 --> 00:58:29,965
Complete that novel.

813
00:58:32,935 --> 00:58:37,095
Only then, I'll be able to find out how I died...

814
00:58:37,865 --> 00:58:40,795
and why I had to be locked up inside that typewriter...

815
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:42,765
instead of being reincarnated.

816
00:58:44,035 --> 00:58:45,365
That is the only way.

817
00:58:45,795 --> 00:58:46,865
So please...

818
00:58:48,965 --> 00:58:50,365
Let me just ask you one thing.

819
00:58:52,235 --> 00:58:53,765
The past life you're talking about.

820
00:58:55,795 --> 00:58:57,195
Was Jeon Seol in it too?

821
00:59:03,195 --> 00:59:04,395
Was she?

822
00:59:17,365 --> 00:59:19,495
Her name was Yoo Su Yeon.

00:59:38,235 --> 00:59:39,895
She was our comrade...

824

826
01:00:13,302 --> 01:00:14,702
Don't you want to know how we met...

827
01:00:14,702 --> 01:00:17,672
and how we became friends?

828
01:00:17,672 --> 01:00:21,242
Past life is just a past life. This is the life we're living now.

829
01:00:21,503 --> 01:00:24,073
- Hey. - Shall I talk casually too?

830
01:00:24,343 --> 01:00:27,943
I have something to tell you. Do you believe in mysterious creatures?

831
01:00:27,943 --> 01:00:29,473
Ghosts, for example.

832
01:00:29,474 --> 01:00:32,044
Han Se Ju, who on earth are you?

833
01:00:32,044 --> 01:00:36,004
Jin Oh? You're there, aren't you? Come on out.

834
01:00:36,004 --> 01:00:39,644
Did you mean it when you said you're going to keep writing?

835
01:00:39,645 --> 01:00:43,575
All right! Fine! I will write!

836
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:45,145
I will write!

837
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:49,375
Very good. I'd like to suggest a deal.
