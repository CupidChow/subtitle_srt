00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:30,751

disgrace Joseon Youth Alliance...

3
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,821
and myself by being captured by you.

4
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,281
I missed you.

5
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:08,151
Su Hyeon.

7
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,251
Mr. Shin.

8
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,821
Mr. Shin, are you inside?

9
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:53,281
Mr. Shin.

10
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:59,351
Mr. Shin,

11
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,481
until when are you going to be like this?

12
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,251
Your father is very worried about you.

13
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,921
Something came for you.

14
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,981
I don't know what it is,

15
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:17,121
but it's from Mr. Seo Hui Young, so I brought it over.

16
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:21,851
I'll just leave it here then.

17
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:30,881
Hey, Yul. Are you still alive?

18
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,381
Are you reading this letter?

19
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,751
As I was organizing my belongings...

20
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,951
before leaving for Manchuria,

21
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,981
I decided to leave my three most precious belongings...

22
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:45,751
with you.

23
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,521
Do you remember the day we first saw this typewriter?

24
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,251
This typewriter has Joseon letters, not Japanese.

25
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:55,821
Shall I get one for you?

26
00:03:57,351 --> 00:04:00,521
This pen is all I need, my friend.

27
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:02,751
They say, "The pen is mightier than the sword."

28
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,321
So I can use it as a weapon.

29
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:07,151
Moreover, it can be used to change the world.

30
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:08,251
To be honest,

31
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:12,851
I didn't really mean it when I said all I needed was a fountain pen.

32
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,951
It was all a bluff.

33
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,681
When I got that typewriter from you as a gift,

34
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:19,321
I was extremely happy.

35
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,181
I received so many things from you.

36
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:27,181
I don't think I can repay you...

37
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,391
for everything you've done for me in this life.

38
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,051
Right now,

39
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:37,021
as I'm heading towards a path that might lead to my death,

40
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:40,581
I'm sorry that this is all I can leave...

41
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,351
for you.

42
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:45,321
But I can't just give it to you for free.

43
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,391
I want to ask you for a favor.

44
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:50,851
But I wonder if you'd be able to handle it.

45

Please complete this unfinished novel on my behalf...

46
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:59,621

47
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,581

Please write our story on my behalf.

50
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,921
Please write that we had lived through these rough times.

51
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,421
Even when we were faced with a dark reality,

52
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,921
we all lived diligently...

53
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,151
and absorbed the pain.

54
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,981
We found hope in despair.

55
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:30,151
We found happiness in danger.

56
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:32,451
We all...

57
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:36,851
loved and fought to our utmost ability.

58
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,551
I'm leaving you the pocket watch to remind you that...

59
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:46,951
you should always love Su Hyeon every single minute of the day.

60

Please protect her by her side...

I regret that I've never told you...

64
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,751
how much I trusted and loved you.

65
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,551
So...

66
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,521
let's promise to stay alive and meet each other again.

67
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,551
No.

71
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:31,551
if I had lived a happy life,

72
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,121
this is what I'll say.

73
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:37,751
I'll say I was happy to have met all of you.

console me for having gone through so much...

76
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:45,451
and pat me on the shoulders...

77
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,581
and tell me that I lived a good life,

78
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:51,321
I'll ask them for a favor.

79
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:56,981
I'll ask them...

80
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:00,751
to allow me...

81
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:04,981
to be with you guys even in my next life.

(Chicago Typewriter)

83
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,621
I hit someone.

84
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:31,351
I killed someone.

85
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,981
Mr. Baek ordered her to kidnap me?

86
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,481
But why did Mr. Han get hurt?

87
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:42,881
I'm not sure,

88
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,981
but they got into a fight.

89
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:47,821
Then Mr. Han fell from the rooftop.

90
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:50,851
I momentarily possessed his body, so I prevented him from falling.

91
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:52,521
But I'm sure his body still got shocked.

92
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:55,021
Please explain what happened to the doctor.

93
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,621
All right.

94
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:57,921
Thank you for letting me know.

95
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,621
What are you mean he fell off a building?

96
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,921
I'll explain everything in detail later.

97
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,921
Please ask the doctor to check for fractures, brain hemorrhage, and...

98
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:13,551
What else is there? Anyway, please ask him...

99
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:15,481
to check for any kind of symptoms that could occur...

100
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:16,721
from falling from a high building.

101

- Se Ju. - Mr. Han.

103
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,721
What happened? Are you dead?

104
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,621
Are you a ghost? Is that what you are?

105
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:27,651
I'm sorry,

106
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,221
but I'm not a ghost.

107
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,481
But I did get some help from one.

108
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:35,081
He possessed my body...

109
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:38,491
the moment I fell from the rooftop.

110
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:43,451

Yes.

(Passport)

114
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,681
How... How did you...

115
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:08,681
You look like you've encountered a ghost.

116
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:10,491
Why?

117
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:13,821
Are you scared to see me well and alive even when you've hit me...

118
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:15,281
with your car?

119
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:20,651
You're the guy who spied on me...

120
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,321
when I was at Se Ju's place, aren't you?

121
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,521
Who are you?

122
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:26,951
What on earth are you?

123
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,851
That's a wrong question.

124
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:32,181
You should ask if Mr. Han, the guy you pushed, is doing okay.

125
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:33,951
That's only the right thing to do.

126
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:39,881
What are you talking about?

127
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:42,281
I didn't push him.

128
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:45,181
He... He missed his footing.

129
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:47,521
It was just an accident.

130
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:50,281
Even so, you still should've checked if he was alive or not.

131
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:52,721
But you did nothing.

132
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,281
All you did was run away.

133
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:57,321
That's...

134
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:00,581
That's because I was too shocked.

135
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:02,751
I was scared that I'd get blamed for what happened.

136
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:06,151
I'm telling the truth. I wasn't trying to run away on purpose.

137
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:07,681
Was it also a mistake to...

138
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,321
hit me with your car?

139
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:14,181
In order to get away with your sin,

140
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,681
you tried to get rid of me because I'm the witness.

141
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:22,521
That makes you responsible for killing two people.

142
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:27,321
Do you have evidence?

143
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,721
You haven't changed at all.

144
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:34,551
You're just like how you used to be in the past.

145
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,181
You commit a crime.

146
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:38,681
Then you commit another crime to cover up for that crime.

147
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:40,491
You make an excuse instead of apologizing.

148
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:42,051
You forget instead of regretting.

149
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:44,621
You...

150
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:48,251
still don't know how to repent on your wrongdoings.

151
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:51,581
Aren't you a citizen of Joseon?

152
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,381
Mr. Baek Tae Min.

153
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:14,751
You're under arrest for instigating Ms. Jeon Seol's abduction.

154
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:28,321
Se Ju, you need to get hospitalized.

155
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:33,621
I don't have any fractures, and my brain is fine.

156
00:11:33,621 --> 00:11:36,151
All I have is a small wound on my head.

157
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,521
Why would I want to get admitted and eat there?

158
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,121
I'm not telling you to get hospitalized for food.

159
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,721
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

160
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:41,981
Gosh, Ji Seok.

161
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:45,451
Ever since I got you that expensive watch,

162
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,381
you've been overly protective.

163
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,651
Gosh, what do you take me for?

164
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,681
Seol, are you sure about what happened?

165
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,381
How can he be so fine...

166
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,381
when he fell from the rooftop of a building?

167
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,351
What's wrong, Seol? What happened?

168
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,551
Are you all right?

169
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:02,181
Yes.

170
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,521
I was too glad to see you intact, so my legs gave in.

171
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,921
Goodness.

172
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:08,651
Ji Seok,

173
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:10,921
go process the documents to get her admitted to a hospital.

174
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:13,451
Who's over-protecting whom right now?

175
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:15,851
Hurry up!

176
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,321
Goodness. This is so unnecessary.

177
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:27,451
Thanks to you, I'm getting it too.

178
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:30,951
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,281
I almost killed you again.

180
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:35,721
I told you that's not true.

181
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:39,451
Anyway, this time Jin Oh saved your life...

182
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,351
instead of me.

183
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:43,751
I know.

184
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:48,221
If it weren't for that old man, I would've been dead.

185
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:52,821
But where is this heartless ghost hiding?

186
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:54,621
Did you look for me?

187
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:00,921
Where have you been?

188
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,821
I had a business to finish.

189
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:05,451
Mr. Han, are you all right?

190
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,751
Of course.

191
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:10,051
How about you?

192
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:14,081
You were going on and off the other day. Are you all right?

193
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:16,951
What do you mean he was going on and off?

194
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:20,521
Does he operate on battery or something?

195
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:22,451
You didn't know?

196
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:26,481
24 alkaline batteries go into his back.

197
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:28,251
Really?

198
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,881
What did you just say?

199
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:40,681
You said you're losing spiritual power.

200
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,581
Are you losing your hearing ability too?

201
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:44,051
Or...

202
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:47,151
are you acting like an old man because I've been calling you one?

203
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:49,381
Is it true?

204
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:52,481
Did you really remember your past life as you were falling?

205
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,451
Very clearly.

206
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:59,621
From the actions of Joseon Youth Alliance on the day of the revolt...

207
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,321
to the moment their leader, Seo Hui Young, dies.

208
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:03,881
Everything passed through my mind like a film.

209
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:06,151
So?

210
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:08,081
Do you want to hear about it?

211
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:27,721
Is there a need to clarify whose trap...

212
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,181
killed Seo Hui Young?

213
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,821
What is this?

214
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:46,381
Are you suggesting that you want to sleep with me?

215
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,721
Goodness, aren't you very creative.

216
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:52,951
Should I just leave?

217
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:55,381
Don't be so hot-tempered.

218
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:56,951
It's as if I actually read your mind.

219
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,521
What is it?

220
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:08,881
I have a question.

221
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:10,881
What do you want to know?

222
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:14,881
Who do you think is the person I remember from my past life?

223
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:17,951
I definitely shot him.

224
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,721
And whenever I think about that moment,

225
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:24,251
I feel so sad as if my heart is being torn.

226
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,381
Do you have any idea?

227
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:36,281
Don't try too hard to remember.

228
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,551
Just let it go if you can't remember it.

229
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,621
You only remember your great moments.

230
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,581
Do you want me to tell you something even greater?

231
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,721
If you get even greater than now, my heart won't be able to handle it.

232
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,851
Hui Young...

233
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:01,081
prayed to the skies just before he died.

234
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:04,251
He prayed...

235
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:06,721
and asked to be...

236
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:10,051
with Ryu Su Hyeon and Shin Yul even in the next life.

237
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:13,751
The skies answered his prayer.

238
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,121
The old man is here,

239
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:19,721
and...

240
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,221
you are here...

241
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:24,681
right before my eyes.

242
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,751
That's why...

243
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:33,321
I will do something for our country right now.

244
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:36,381
Why don't you just set up a provisional government?

245
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,451
How can you call yourself a citizen of Joseon?

246
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,021
I wasn't caught.

247
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:11,691
I caught someone.

248
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:15,121
Does that mean the person who killed me...

249
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:18,121
is Heo Young Min?

250
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:21,851
Why was I...

251
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:26,251
By whom was I killed?

252
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,521
Tell me the truth.

253
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,421
It wasn't you, was it?

254
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,821
You are such a good kid.

255
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:41,551
How can you instigate a kidnap?

256
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:43,351
That's not possible.

257
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,021
She's setting you up, isn't she?

258
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:48,151
How can they arrest you based on what the murderer's sister said?

259
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:50,921
This is just unbelievable.

260
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,421
Darling, hang in there for a short while. Your uncle is friends with...

261
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:56,381
the Attorney General.

262
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:57,921
Don't get him involved in this.

263
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:00,691
Do you want to be even more humiliated?

264
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:03,851
They got the recording of him instigating a kidnapping.

265
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:06,551
Whose side are you on right now?

266
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:07,981
Are you their attorney?

267
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:09,921
I'm sure it's been fabricated.

268
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:12,281
Tell them to send it for a voice analysis!

269
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:15,351
Please be quiet.

270
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:16,381
Wait.

271
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,751
It's that girl named Jeon Seol, isn't it?

272
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,851
It's the girl who got into a love scandal with Se Ju, right?

273
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:26,521
So that's it.

274
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:29,851
They must've plotted this together.

275
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,851
I asked you to please be quiet.

276
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:34,621
It's very strange that she was suddenly on the news.

277
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,281
Something smells fishy.

278
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,221
I should catch her right away and torture her.

279
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:41,551
Didn't you hear me? I told you to be quiet!

280
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,251
Didn't I?

281
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:44,521
Hey.

282
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:46,621
Tae Min.

283
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,321
When are you going to stop babbling?

284
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:55,381
Tell me.

285
00:18:56,251 --> 00:19:00,051
I can't breathe because of you. You're killing me.

286
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:01,881
How...

287
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,191
How can you...

288
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:07,551
do this to me?

289
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:09,821
How...

290
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:10,821
Hey.

291
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:14,121
Honey, don't provoke him any further.

292
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:15,981
Go outside and calm down.

293
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:18,621
Hurry up.

294
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:36,751
Tae Min.

295
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:38,751
Why did you do that?

296
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:41,191
How did you get into that?

297
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:43,121
Do you know how big of a problem that is?

298
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,151
Dad.

299
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:48,481
Yes.

300
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,221
I...

301
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:53,421
hit a person.

302
00:19:57,921 --> 00:19:58,981
Tae Min.

303
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,121
But...

304
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:03,351
I think it wasn't a person.

305
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:05,951
I was sure he was dead,

306
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,721
but he's moving freely.

307
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:13,751
Se... Se Ju.

308
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,721
Please let me meet Se Ju.

309
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,551
Se Ju must know about him.

310
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,221
He must know...

311
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,281
that man's real identity.

312
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:30,051
What?

313
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,581
Jo Sang Mi did that?

314
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:32,881
That's right.

315
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:36,251
She intentionally got a part-time job at Riccardo.

316
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:37,921
Her motive was to approach Seol.

317
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,721
Nobody is to be trusted in this world.

318
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,921
That's why I didn't want to hire her. I didn't like her vibe.

319
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:49,421
Seol even helped her get the job when she didn't even know that girl.

320
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:52,451
Poor senorita.

321
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:55,751
Wait.

322
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,881
Show me my face with the camera.

323
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:04,021
(Show me my face with the camera.)

324
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,351
- Is that? - What is it?

325
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:19,281
- Do you know that person? - Quiet.

326
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,521
What's wrong?

327
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,051
What?

328
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:31,381
Send the picture to Seol via text message.

329
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,981
(Send the picture to Seol via text message.)

330
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:36,151
Who is she?

331
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:39,981
Se Ju!

332
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:25,251
Did you sleep well?

333
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,581
Yes.

334
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:31,881
By the way, why did I sleep here?

335
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:36,551
I think you didn't want to leave.

336
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:38,721
By the way,

337
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:42,051
when did you sneak up to the bed?

338
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:45,751
You are the one who stopped me. You wanted to talk all night.

339
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:47,051
Did I?

340
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:49,351
Did I?

341
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:52,881
You told me to sleep on the bed, and you were going to sleep on the sofa.

342
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:55,151
When did you crawl up the bed?

343
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:56,851
Can't you talk nicer?

344
00:22:57,421 --> 00:22:59,851
What do you mean I "crawled up" the bed?

345
00:22:59,851 --> 00:23:01,121
- Excuse me. - Goodness.

346
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:03,721
I fell right there.

347
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:08,221
By the way, do you guys need a couple's counseling?

348
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:12,051
What are you doing?

349
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:19,851
Mr. Han, I have an emergency. I have to go.

350
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:21,751
Okay. Go.

351
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:23,881
She's just embarrassed, isn't she?

352
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:26,851
Goodness. You are the man.

353
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:44,421
Bearing the truth isn't as easy as it sounds.

354
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:46,651
It's just the truth from the past.

355
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:48,751
I will be the one bearing it anyway.

356
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,721
You just have to tell me what you know and what you remember.

357
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:56,051
What exactly...

358
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:58,951
What exactly do you know, Seol?

359
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:03,051
I know that...

360
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,951
you were a secret agent,

361
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,151
that there was a revolution,

362
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,051
and that Heo Young Min caught me there.

363
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:19,121
Of course, it's not all from my memories.

364
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:22,651
It includes what Mr. Han remembers.

365
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:26,521
Can't you stop there?

366
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,451
Why would you dig up the past?

367
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:31,981
Mom.

368
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:35,751
Your daughter is not Ryu Su Hyeon. Your daughter is me, Jeon Seol.

369
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:41,151
Su Hyeon would not have forgiven her mom for being a secret agent.

370
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:43,151
But it's different for me.

371
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,351
I couldn't forgive you...

372
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:52,151
because you left your little daughter behind.

373
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:55,751
So please...

374
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:58,051
tell me.

375
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:03,251
Tell me and you should free yourself from...

376
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:05,421
the memories of the past life.

377
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,051
Hey.

378
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,251
Do you have problems that I don't know about?

379
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:31,151
It's not that.

380
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:34,481
You got to remember your last moment.

381
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:38,421
I'm frustrated about why I still can't remember...

382
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:39,981
about my death.

383
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:42,751
Do you...

384
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:45,751
have to know that?

385
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:48,781
Can't you arrive at the blissful state if you don't?

386
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:51,751
You must...

387
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:54,781
know about something, right?

388
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:59,051
What would I know?

389
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:02,651
You and I both were fighters.

390
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:05,721
So your death must be in line with that. Don't you think?

391
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:10,351
You said you remembered me pretending...

392
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:14,351
to have replaced Hui Young and becoming the leader, right?

393
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:18,621
Is that really all you remember?

394
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:21,881
What if it's not?

395
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:23,951
I don't think so.

396
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:27,781
You clearly know something.

397
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:29,851
Am I right?

398
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,251
No matter what I say,

399
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:45,581
will you really be able to handle everything?

400
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:58,151
In order to protect Hui Young and...

401
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,351
to pull out Su Hyeon,

402
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:02,751
Shin Yul walked into the enemy's den.

403
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:06,321
Also, what I'm about to say...

404
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,251
is not from Hui Young's memory. It's...

405
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:13,421
just my inference.

406
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:15,551
All right.

407
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:17,851
Please go on.

408
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:23,721
Shin Yul could stand any pain.

409
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:27,451
But he couldn't stand Heo Young Min,

410
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:31,221
who had Su Hyeon's life in his hand.

411
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,581
Are you suggesting that I exposed you... No.

412
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:38,681
Did I expose Seo Hui Young?

413
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:42,721
- I told you. It's my inference. - It's impossible.

414
00:27:43,151 --> 00:27:45,751
There's no way I would've cornered him into a deadly situation.

415
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:48,551
Why on earth did you make such...

416
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:50,551
On the day we were supposed to leave for Manchuria,

417
00:27:52,251 --> 00:27:54,051
our hideout was attacked.

418
00:27:56,781 --> 00:27:58,421
Madam Sophia.

419
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:01,521
Madam Sophia could've exposed it.

420
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:03,221
No.

421
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:06,951
Neither Madam Sophia nor even Su Hyeon...

422
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:09,951
knew about the location of the hideout.

423
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:13,151
The only other person who knew it...

424
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:18,481
was the lead member of the alliance,

425
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:22,621
Shin Yul.

426
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:31,951
I'll repeat it again. This...

427
00:28:33,221 --> 00:28:35,451
is only my inference.

428
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,951
Then the person who killed me...

429
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:43,721
The person who killed me was...

430
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:47,881
It was me.

431
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,051
The person who killed Shin Yul...

432
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:57,721
was me.

433
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:05,751
Thanks to Mom, I remembered it too.

434
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:25,651
Ryu Su Hyeon, come out. You're free to go.

435
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:00,351
There are clothes and some money in that bag.

436
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:03,881
Mr. Shin said you should forget everything about what happened,

437
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:07,351
go somewhere far, do something you love,

438
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:09,851
and take care of your mind and health.

439
00:30:12,321 --> 00:30:14,481
You are such a spiteful girl.

440
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,621
Can't you at least thank him?

441
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:19,521
Do you know what Mr. Shin went through to get you out?

442
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:22,951
Is it here or the port? Tell me quickly.

443
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,981
(Carpe Diem)

444
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,251
(Seo Hui Young, the leader of Joseon Youth Alliance kills himself.)

445
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:42,251
Do you know what the nickname of this gun is?

446
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,681
I don't know.

447
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:45,251
What is it?

448
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:48,521
The gun shot sounds like the typing sound of a typewriter.

449
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,051
So it got the nickname "Chicago Typewriter".

450
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,721
Please complete this unfinished novel on my behalf...

451
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,451
With the typewriter...

452
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,451
you got for me.

453
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,293
Carpe Diem, which used to be the hideout of Joseon Youth Alliance...

454
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:53,333
now belongs to the police of the Empire of Japan.

455
00:32:54,963 --> 00:32:57,293
Ladies and gentlemen who have come here despite the situation,

456
00:32:57,293 --> 00:32:59,533
thank you very much...

457
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:01,333
for coming all the way here.

458
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:09,933
Furthermore,

459
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:13,363
I'm particularly grateful to...

460
00:33:13,763 --> 00:33:16,303
Mr. Kamamuchi, who gave me a rare opportunity,

461
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:18,563
although I'm a citizen of Joseon.

462
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:21,663
Today is...

463
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:25,763
the best day in my life.

464
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:29,693
Please enjoy yourself.

465
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:34,533
Well then,

466
00:33:36,863 --> 00:33:38,663
let's make a toast.

467
00:33:40,663 --> 00:33:44,663
Cheers to the continued success of the Empire of Japan!

468
00:33:44,663 --> 00:33:46,563
- Cheers. - Cheers.

469
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:52,463
Guns are...

470
00:34:53,563 --> 00:34:56,133
not the type of item that suits women.

471
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,663
Why don't you put it down, Anastasia?

472
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:03,263
You put it down, you scum.

473
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,163
It will be too late to regret after your head is smashed.

474
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:20,363
Fine.

475
00:35:21,303 --> 00:35:23,163
If you stop right now,

476
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:25,763
your life will be spared.

477
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:27,663
If you want, you can...

478
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,693
I'd rather bite my tongue and kill myself than...

479
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,263
beg you for my life.

480
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:41,433
I'm sorry.

481
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:45,033
I was reminded of someone just now.

482
00:35:47,163 --> 00:35:49,303
Was it Seo Hui Young?

483
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:52,163
He was bluffing even at the moment...

484
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,063
he shot himself to death.

485
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:57,163
You're exactly like him.

486
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,133
In the name of Joseon Youth Alliance,

487
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,663
the enemy's hunting dog is removed.

488
00:36:16,163 --> 00:36:18,863
What did you just say?

489
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:22,533
It seems like someone is taking revenge for Joseon Youth Alliance.

490
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,233
Someone ruthlessly shot the high officials...

491
00:36:25,303 --> 00:36:27,063
gathered in Carpe Diem yesterday.

492
00:36:27,163 --> 00:36:28,163
Thanks to that person,

493
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:30,763
Heo Young Min, who interrogated you...

494
00:36:30,963 --> 00:36:32,663
was killed on the spot.

495
00:36:33,463 --> 00:36:35,463
The Japanese Police are now combing...

496
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:37,433
the whole Kyungsung like crazy.

497
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:39,233
But this person is so elusive...

498
00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:41,133
that nobody caught him or her yet.

499
00:37:24,463 --> 00:37:25,763
Come here, Su Hyeon.

500
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:28,163
I'll be waiting for you here.

501
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:33,563
Did you hear that?

502
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:36,803
There's an assassin who takes revenge for Joseon Youth Alliance.

503
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,063
Yes, I heard about it.

504
00:37:38,663 --> 00:37:41,693
I heard this person is as fast as a flash of lightning.

505
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:05,763
Fighters aren't supposed to fall in love, right?

506
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:08,593
Didn't you know there was another code of conduct?

507
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:11,463
The one who betrayed the comrades...

508
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:13,333
will be removed.

509
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:16,163
I was also deceived.

510
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,063
I was...

511
00:38:18,393 --> 00:38:21,063
stupid to believe that they'd release the death row inmates.

512
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:25,363
My son was killed in the end.

513
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:27,533
I wish...

514
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:31,393
we can be better friends in the next life.

515
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:34,463
Please. Su Hyeon.

516
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:36,463
In the name of Joseon Youth Alliance,

517
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:41,063
I remove the secret agent who betrayed the comrades.

518
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:14,963
Hi.

519
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,863
I've been waiting for you.

520
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:27,393
Hui Young left a present for us.

521
00:39:32,063 --> 00:39:33,933
I thought it would be better...

522
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:37,463
that you take the pocket watch.

523
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:40,393
Why did you do that?

524
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,333
Now that you got the pocket watch,

525
00:39:45,063 --> 00:39:46,133
let's finish this up quickly.

526
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,563
Why did you do that? Why?

527
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:53,233
Because...

528
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,033
I couldn't see you being killed...

529
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,163
in front of my eyes.

530
00:40:04,163 --> 00:40:05,433
What am I?

531
00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:08,393
What am I for you to have done that?

532
00:40:09,393 --> 00:40:11,333
You should have let me die!

533
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:13,163
You shouldn't have exposed him...

534
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:14,803
no matter what happened to me!

535
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:16,133
Ryu Su Hyeon!

536
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:23,763
Carry out your duty.

537
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:27,493
The alliance's codes of conduct...

538
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:32,393
are equal to Boss' orders.

539
00:40:37,463 --> 00:40:41,163
In the name of Joseon Youth Alliance...

540
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:49,433
That's not the right posture.

541
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:57,733
Don't be afraid of the recoil.

542
00:40:57,763 --> 00:41:00,863
It might make you step backward or your arm fall,

543
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,363
which leads to poor security and control.

544
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:12,563
Don't forget.

545
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:15,763
Don't be afraid of the recoil and don't step back.

546
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:18,363
You must keep your eyes on your target.

547
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:24,263
If a sniper is hesitant or reluctant in front of his or her target,

548
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:27,463
the sniper will be dead.

549
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:35,363
Go ahead.

550
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,663
Should I do it myself?

551
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,663
Good.

552
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:56,363
Those eyes are back.

553
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:09,833
Do you have...

554
00:42:10,593 --> 00:42:11,993
any last words?

555
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:16,593
Please kill me with your own hands.

556
00:42:19,393 --> 00:42:21,563
That will make me feel better.

557
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:27,493
In the name of Joseon Youth Alliance,

558
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:30,493
I remove...

559
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:34,063
the betrayer.

560
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,193
Hey, Hui Young.

561
00:42:56,363 --> 00:42:57,933
I'm sorry.

562
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:01,233
I made Su Hyeon cry.

563
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:06,293
I'm sorry I couldn't keep the promise...

564
00:43:07,263 --> 00:43:08,763
in this life.

565
00:43:10,063 --> 00:43:13,093
I'm also sorry I couldn't finish the novel.

566
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:15,363
If...

567
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,363
there's a next life,

568
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,593
I will...

569
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:22,963
keep my word then.

570
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:27,393
I will come to you...

571
00:43:28,463 --> 00:43:29,833
to make...

572
00:43:30,963 --> 00:43:32,393
you two happy.

573
00:45:05,763 --> 00:45:07,293
You're really back.

574
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:10,593
I told you I would come.

575
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:13,493
I...

576
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,763
killed Shin Yul.

577
00:45:21,163 --> 00:45:23,163
He was like my brother,

578
00:45:24,663 --> 00:45:26,063
my father,

579
00:45:27,563 --> 00:45:28,693
my friend,

580
00:45:30,163 --> 00:45:31,593
and my comrade.

581
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:35,163
But I killed him.

582
00:45:37,963 --> 00:45:41,033
I was so ungrateful for his kindness and generosity.

583
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:43,563
And I...

584
00:45:44,663 --> 00:45:45,663
I...

585
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:48,433
I killed both of you.

586
00:46:00,693 --> 00:46:02,433
Why do you think like that?

587
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:05,133
You know it's not true.

588
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:07,563
Are you leaving?

589
00:46:08,963 --> 00:46:11,933
When I cry, you just wipe my tear away and leave.

590
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:14,433
Are you leaving?

591
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:18,133
I should.

592
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:21,433
You...

593
00:46:21,963 --> 00:46:23,793
should live your life well.

594
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:30,063
Let me come with you.

595
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:34,163
No, you can't.

596
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:37,863
You should stay alive...

597
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,493
and see our liberated nation.

598
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:48,263
I want to,

599
00:46:51,463 --> 00:46:53,133
but I might be too tired.

600
00:46:54,963 --> 00:46:56,063
I feel...

601
00:46:56,593 --> 00:46:57,763
sleepy.

602
00:47:57,163 --> 00:47:58,193
What is that?

603
00:47:58,363 --> 00:47:59,363
I don't know.

604
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:00,793
It looks pretty old.

605
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:03,963
It feels exotic.

606
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:05,963
Should I give it to my daughter?

607
00:48:05,963 --> 00:48:06,963
Go ahead.

608
00:48:15,463 --> 00:48:16,963
Seo Hui Young!

609
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:20,133
Does that mean...

610
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:23,393
I betrayed you...

611
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,293
and let you be killed?

612
00:48:26,763 --> 00:48:28,433
Hey, come to your senses.

613
00:48:29,163 --> 00:48:31,063
I'm not Hui Young. I'm Se Ju.

614
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:33,463
Did I...

615
00:48:34,063 --> 00:48:35,363
make you...

616
00:48:35,593 --> 00:48:37,163
kill me?

617
00:48:38,163 --> 00:48:39,193
I'm sorry.

618
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:43,293
I was the one...

619
00:48:45,563 --> 00:48:48,063
who killed you two after all.

620
00:49:00,963 --> 00:49:02,333
- Mr. Yoo! - Jin Oh!

621
00:49:02,963 --> 00:49:04,033
Jin Oh!

622
00:49:05,963 --> 00:49:07,033
Jin Oh!

623
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:14,793
I'm sorry for calling you here when it's raining.

624
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:17,933
I didn't know whom to call when a ghost gets sick.

625
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:19,333
I couldn't call a doctor.

626
00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:20,563
Gosh.

627
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:22,663
Where is he?

628
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:24,563
So...

629
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:28,133
are you saying he's lying down here?

630
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:29,433
Yes.

631
00:49:30,163 --> 00:49:32,933
What do you think? How does he look?

632
00:49:35,963 --> 00:49:37,763
Tell me the symptoms he has.

633
00:49:38,263 --> 00:49:40,463
Suddenly he got cracks all over his body and passed out...

634
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:42,593
after some lights leaked from his body.

635
00:49:43,133 --> 00:49:45,863
Did something happen to cause that?

636
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:46,933
What?

637
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:48,863
Well...

638
00:49:49,663 --> 00:49:52,193
He did get shocked.

639
00:49:54,793 --> 00:49:56,793
It's not long until he perishes.

640
00:49:58,063 --> 00:49:59,563
Perish?

641
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:02,263
What does that mean exactly?

642
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,393
It literally means...

643
00:50:04,193 --> 00:50:05,963
his soul will completely perish.

644
00:50:06,863 --> 00:50:08,163
It will become nothing.

645
00:50:09,163 --> 00:50:12,463
It's not like reincarnation. He won't have the next life.

646
00:50:13,563 --> 00:50:15,363
Why did this suddenly happen?

647
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:20,793
I kept telling him he should save his energy.

648
00:50:21,193 --> 00:50:23,033
He used too much of energy.

649
00:50:23,863 --> 00:50:25,763
On top of that, he got shocked.

650
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:27,333
That worsened the cracks.

651
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:30,963
Is there any way to keep him from perishing?

652
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:35,163
We could try to put his energy back together,

653
00:50:35,563 --> 00:50:38,763
but it'll be hard to be like how he was before once he has cracks.

654
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:41,663
Then...

655
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:45,963
Why don't you just grant him his wishes before he leaves?

656
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:24,893
Mr. Han. Would you like to grab some beer?

657
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:30,233
Seol is sending Bang Wool off.

658
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:31,793
Why didn't you tell me?

659
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:38,963
You didn't tell me that I was a betrayer either.

660
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,863
How can you be smiling?

661
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:52,693
It's not that bad actually.

662
00:51:56,763 --> 00:52:00,463
I finally learned why I was sealed in the typewriter.

663
00:52:00,593 --> 00:52:01,633
I mean,

664
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:06,133
why I sealed myself, to be precise.

665
00:52:07,763 --> 00:52:09,363
I finally realized it.

666
00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:11,393
Why is that?

667
00:52:11,993 --> 00:52:13,233
Tell me.

668
00:52:17,063 --> 00:52:21,063
I did it to apologize to you two.

669
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:24,933
And...

670
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,963
to keep the promise I made with Hui Young.

671
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:31,663
What promise?

672
00:52:32,363 --> 00:52:34,193
The promise to give you a chance to date Seol.

673
00:52:35,063 --> 00:52:36,363
Do you remember that?

674
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:45,093
It seems like I kept my word successfully...

675
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:50,063
with the help of Gyun Woo and our deal.

676
00:52:56,463 --> 00:52:58,233
Sadly,

677
00:52:59,563 --> 00:53:00,933
I will give you the chance...

678
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:04,163
to date Seol for this life.

679
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:07,193
- In the next life... - You want me to give up?

680
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:08,193
No.

681
00:53:09,363 --> 00:53:13,593
In the next life, I'd like to date another girl.

682
00:53:14,463 --> 00:53:15,993
My gosh.

683
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:23,233
Hui Young...

684
00:53:24,263 --> 00:53:26,493
had trust in Yul until the very last moment.

685
00:53:28,463 --> 00:53:30,733
He knew Yul told on them,

686
00:53:31,493 --> 00:53:35,263
but he never blamed him. He had every confidence in him.

687
00:53:37,393 --> 00:53:38,593
Hui Young...

688
00:53:40,363 --> 00:53:41,933
already forgave you.

689
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:45,963
And Se Ju...

690
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:50,463
has no reason to forgive Jin Oh.

691
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:54,233
You're not Shin Yul.

692
00:53:57,263 --> 00:53:58,633
You're Yoo Jin Oh.

693
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,863
So stop blaming yourself,

694
00:54:03,363 --> 00:54:06,093
and let's think about how you can avoid perishing.

695
00:54:10,963 --> 00:54:12,993
Can I ask you for a favor?

696
00:54:13,593 --> 00:54:14,593
What is it?

697
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:18,233
I'd like to use your workroom for a while.

698
00:54:19,263 --> 00:54:22,233
I promised Hui Young that I'd finish the novel.

699
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,563
I want to keep that promise.

700
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:51,193
Thank you.

701
00:54:53,363 --> 00:54:56,693
I could finish the novel thanks to you.

702
00:54:58,063 --> 00:55:00,263
Are you going to write it?

703
00:55:02,363 --> 00:55:04,193
I promised Hui Young.

704
00:55:07,063 --> 00:55:10,263
I'm sorry I made it tough for you.

705
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:13,793
Su Hyeon.

706
00:55:19,563 --> 00:55:21,093
It's not your fault.

707
00:55:21,893 --> 00:55:26,363
You just did what you were supposed to do.

708
00:55:26,563 --> 00:55:27,633
So...

709
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:30,593
please don't feel guilty anymore.

710
00:55:32,293 --> 00:55:35,793
Move on and live in the present.

711
00:55:37,363 --> 00:55:38,463
Then...

712
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:42,363
I want you to do the same, Yul.

713
00:55:44,493 --> 00:55:48,993
You betrayed us to save me.

714
00:55:54,363 --> 00:55:56,693
Su Hyeon knew it as well.

715
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:02,163
Even at the very moment she pulled the trigger,

716
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:07,293
she was very sorry and grateful to you.

717
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:11,763
Crossing the river of oblivion,

718
00:56:13,063 --> 00:56:16,733
she couldn't stop looking back multiple times.

719
00:56:21,363 --> 00:56:23,293
To me, Yul was...

720
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:27,963
a teacher I respected,

721
00:56:29,363 --> 00:56:31,463
a comrade I could rely on,

722
00:56:32,863 --> 00:56:34,793
and a kind brother.

723
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:40,693
Thanks to him, my life wasn't lonely.

724
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:45,233
I could live an awesome life as a sniper.

725
00:56:49,293 --> 00:56:50,563
He adored me...

726
00:56:52,063 --> 00:56:53,563
and told me I was pretty.

727
00:56:55,193 --> 00:56:56,793
It was more than I deserved.

728
00:56:58,633 --> 00:56:59,993
Thank you.

729
00:58:00,093 --> 00:58:01,293
Hello.

730
00:58:01,963 --> 00:58:02,993
It's me.

731
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:08,463
Hello. I'm listening.

732
00:58:08,893 --> 00:58:11,963
I'm sorry to ask you this,

733
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:15,933
but could you please meet Tae Min?

734
00:58:18,463 --> 00:58:22,633
He keeps saying something strange.

735
00:58:29,763 --> 00:58:30,793
You're here.

736
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,593
I'm glad you look well.

737
00:58:44,463 --> 00:58:45,993
You're okay, right?

738
00:58:47,163 --> 00:58:48,993
Of course you're glad.

739
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:54,133
If something bad happened to me, it would've been worse for you.

740
00:58:55,563 --> 00:58:57,063
So what did you want to talk about?

741
00:59:00,393 --> 00:59:03,393
Who is that guy?

742
00:59:03,993 --> 00:59:05,193
What do you mean?

743
00:59:11,963 --> 00:59:13,563
The guy who was hit by my car.

744
00:59:14,693 --> 00:59:16,463
The guy who was in your workroom.

745
00:59:18,863 --> 00:59:21,163
- What are you talking about? - Who is he?

746
00:59:22,233 --> 00:59:25,233
He's not a human, right?

747
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:28,263
He keeps appearing in my dream...

748
00:59:28,763 --> 00:59:32,293
and tells me to admit it's my fault. I didn't do anything wrong.

749
00:59:35,063 --> 00:59:36,263
Tae Min.

750
00:59:36,733 --> 00:59:38,963
What? Why?

751
00:59:39,563 --> 00:59:42,633
Is it so difficult to admit you did something wrong?

752
00:59:44,363 --> 00:59:46,233
Is it so difficult...

753
00:59:47,693 --> 00:59:49,093
to say you're sorry?

754
00:59:51,063 --> 00:59:55,093
Someone waited for 80 years to make an apology.

755
00:59:56,633 --> 00:59:59,163
Someone even risked his life...

756
01:00:01,363 --> 01:00:03,563
to keep his word.

757
01:00:11,563 --> 01:00:14,133
Life isn't only about the good days.

758
01:00:14,493 --> 01:00:18,063
If you did something wrong, admit it...

759
01:00:19,163 --> 01:00:20,393
and correct it.

760
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:22,133
It might be painful from time to time,

761
01:00:22,963 --> 01:00:25,693
but you should fight it.

762
01:00:27,193 --> 01:00:28,393
That's life.

763
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:34,563
I wish you atone for what you did for the rest of your life...

764
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,033
so that you can make a fresh start.

765
01:00:50,963 --> 01:00:53,093
Jin Oh, I'm home.

766
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:58,233
I said, I'm home.

767
01:00:58,763 --> 01:00:59,793
Are you there?

768
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:10,093
Where are you?

769
01:01:11,163 --> 01:01:12,293
Welcome home.

770
01:01:15,993 --> 01:01:17,263
Would you like to drink with me?

771
01:01:17,963 --> 01:01:19,663
I just finished writing.

772
01:01:26,633 --> 01:01:28,963
I guess this is why they write.

773
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:35,393
You finally kept the promise you made with Hui Young.

774
01:01:35,463 --> 01:01:36,463
Yes.

775
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:39,263
It...

776
01:01:40,493 --> 01:01:42,293
took exactly 83 years.

777
01:01:46,163 --> 01:01:49,563
Then it's time to keep the promise you made with me.

778
01:01:50,063 --> 01:01:51,793
Pardon? A promise?

779
01:01:52,193 --> 01:01:53,993
What promise?

780
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,063
(Co-writing Contract)

781
01:02:03,393 --> 01:02:05,763
It will take at least 100 years...

782
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,563
to keep everything.

783
01:02:07,563 --> 01:02:09,393
I'll be generous with you.

784
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:11,433
You can carry on just one clause.

785
01:02:12,133 --> 01:02:13,963
That's really generous of you.

786
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:16,663
Among the countless number of clauses,

787
01:02:17,263 --> 01:02:18,433
which one do you want me to carry on?

788
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:22,263
Co-writing Contract Article 1, Clause 1.

789
01:02:23,093 --> 01:02:26,763
Until the novel is finished, Han Se Ju and Yoo Jin Oh...

790
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,063
live...

791
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:31,463
together.

792
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:37,193
You might have finished writing Hui Young and Yul's novel,

793
01:02:37,563 --> 01:02:38,863
but our novel,

794
01:02:41,393 --> 01:02:44,463
Se Ju and Jin Oh's novel...

795
01:02:45,463 --> 01:02:47,033
is yet to be finished.

796
01:02:49,863 --> 01:02:53,063
So if you just disappear without giving me any notice,

797
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:56,233
I will kill... No.

798
01:02:57,433 --> 01:02:59,193
I will make you reincarnate.

799
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:05,033
How will you revive me?

800
01:03:05,093 --> 01:03:06,263
Through my novel.

801
01:03:08,633 --> 01:03:09,993
I'm thinking of...

802
01:03:13,163 --> 01:03:16,233
writing that novel.

803
01:03:29,396 --> 01:03:33,136
I love the sound of putting a period at the end of a writing.

804
01:03:35,636 --> 01:03:36,896
Did you finish writing?

805
01:03:38,996 --> 01:03:39,996
Yes.

806
01:03:40,936 --> 01:03:41,936
Hey.

807
01:03:42,396 --> 01:03:44,366
This almost killed me.

808
01:03:45,536 --> 01:03:47,836
May I have a look?

809
01:03:48,496 --> 01:03:51,896
Before you start reading, promise me one thing.

810
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,896
Are you sure it's just one thing?

811
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:00,496
You said you sealed yourself...

812
01:04:00,966 --> 01:04:02,396
in the typewriter...

813
01:04:02,796 --> 01:04:06,436
to keep your word and to ask for forgiveness, right?

814
01:04:07,496 --> 01:04:08,966
Why do you bring that up?

815
01:04:08,966 --> 01:04:09,966
I'm...

816
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:16,036
thinking of keeping you sealed in my novel.

817
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,496
- Pardon? - I heard when you perish,

818
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:22,696
you will become nothing.

819
01:04:23,536 --> 01:04:25,396
I heard you can't even reincarnate.

820
01:04:26,766 --> 01:04:29,466
If I keep you sealed in my novel before you perish,

821
01:04:31,236 --> 01:04:33,136
at least you won't have to go away.

822
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,566
You will at least have a chance to reincarnate.

823
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,166
So promise me.

824
01:04:41,296 --> 01:04:43,536
Wait in my novel...

825
01:04:44,196 --> 01:04:46,636
until the cracks go away...

826
01:04:46,866 --> 01:04:48,666
and meet me again...

827
01:04:50,966 --> 01:04:53,466
to say thank you.

828
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:58,396
Promise me you will come back to me.

829
01:05:19,096 --> 01:05:21,866
It seems like it's time to change the battery.

830
01:05:25,466 --> 01:05:27,496
Follow me. I want to take you somewhere.

831
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,396
Thank you.

832
01:05:38,596 --> 01:05:39,636
For what?

833
01:05:40,796 --> 01:05:44,366
What Hui Young wanted to do the most in the liberated country...

834
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:46,136
was fishing.

835
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:50,866
Thanks to you, one of my wishes came true.

836
01:06:00,036 --> 01:06:02,696
Do you want to make a bet?

837
01:06:04,196 --> 01:06:05,236
What bet?

838
01:06:05,696 --> 01:06:09,536
Let's see if Jin Oh will reincarnate and come find us.

839
01:06:10,296 --> 01:06:12,966
The words of a person who owns the rod that moves first will be true.

840
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:16,696
I'm in.

841
01:06:17,136 --> 01:06:20,566
"I'm in"? Are you guys betting on my fate?

842
01:06:22,636 --> 01:06:24,166
I love making bets.

843
01:06:24,696 --> 01:06:25,766
Let me start first.

844
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:31,396
- He might reincarnate. - I wish he reincarnates.

845
01:06:32,506 --> 01:06:34,166
Come on. That's too mean.

846
01:06:34,436 --> 01:06:36,266
How can you be so unsure about it?

847
01:06:37,136 --> 01:06:40,036
I say I will definitely reincarnate.

848
01:06:48,696 --> 01:06:49,866
I'm also thankful.

849
01:06:51,196 --> 01:06:53,296
I'm saying that to Jin Oh, not Yul.

850
01:06:54,966 --> 01:06:57,236
What are you thankful for?

851
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:02,466
If you didn't come into my life,

852
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:07,166
I might have been not able to write a single sentence until now.

853
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:12,506
If you didn't invite Seol to my house,

854
01:07:13,636 --> 01:07:14,766
I might have been...

855
01:07:15,506 --> 01:07:18,866
living a life where Seol isn't in it.

856
01:07:25,096 --> 01:07:27,966
I think I should change the bait.

857
01:07:28,466 --> 01:07:29,936
It doesn't seem to work.

858
01:07:36,036 --> 01:07:38,136
If you didn't come find me,

859
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:43,166
I might have lived with a wall around myself.

860
01:07:45,366 --> 01:07:48,266
Like a ghost who roams around,

861
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:50,366
although I'm alive.

862
01:07:54,296 --> 01:07:57,166
So don't you dare disappear without...

863
01:08:09,066 --> 01:08:10,236
Jin Oh.

864
01:08:11,636 --> 01:08:13,166
Are you going on and off again?

865
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:17,506
If you're there, give me a signal.

866
01:08:20,366 --> 01:08:21,366
Jin Oh.

867
01:08:23,396 --> 01:08:25,036
I asked you to give me a signal.

868
01:08:30,336 --> 01:08:32,436
I'll kill you if you're messing with me right now.

869
01:08:41,896 --> 01:08:44,596
I told you I would kill you if you disappear without any notice.

870
01:08:47,006 --> 01:08:49,836
Show yourself! Right now!

871
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:30,196
He was my muse.

872
01:09:31,566 --> 01:09:33,006
He was also a ghost.

873
01:09:33,866 --> 01:09:35,566
He was my friend...

874
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:37,766
who came to save me...

875
01:09:38,936 --> 01:09:40,266
from 80 years ago.

876
01:09:43,466 --> 01:09:46,136
It's a small miracle that an old typewriter brought to me.

877
01:09:47,436 --> 01:09:49,136
This special experience...

878
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:52,636
greatly encourages me...

879
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:55,466
to live the present.

880
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:10,666
Lastly,

881
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:12,166
I dedicate this book...

882
01:10:14,696 --> 01:10:17,596
to my friend, Yoo Jin Oh.

883
01:10:18,036 --> 01:10:19,066
Thank you.

884
01:10:42,836 --> 01:10:44,866
You said you have an autograph session. How can you be here?

885
01:10:45,736 --> 01:10:47,366
I've done everything I could do.

886
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:49,196
It wasn't even planned anyway.

887
01:10:51,196 --> 01:10:54,766
Still, your fans might feel quite betrayed.

888
01:10:56,396 --> 01:10:57,596
You don't like being with me alone?

889
01:10:58,196 --> 01:11:00,236
Why do you keep talking about that when I'm next to you?

890
01:11:01,506 --> 01:11:03,236
I feel guilty...

891
01:11:04,396 --> 01:11:06,536
that I'm the only one who's happy.

892
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:14,096
I wonder who is missing me this much.

893
01:11:15,296 --> 01:11:18,666
They say someone is thinking about me when the shoelaces are untied.

894
01:11:21,896 --> 01:11:24,196
There's someone who misses you.

895
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:27,596
There's a person...

896
01:11:28,296 --> 01:11:30,036
who has been waiting for you for almost 100 years.

897
01:11:31,596 --> 01:11:33,936
There's a person who can't leave you...

898
01:11:34,636 --> 01:11:36,436
because of the destiny.

899
01:11:39,236 --> 01:11:40,236
Who is it?

900
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:41,666
Is it a mysterious creature?

901
01:11:48,836 --> 01:11:50,296
What do you think...

902
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:53,036
happened to Jin Oh?

903
01:11:53,506 --> 01:11:56,966
I just wish he's safely sealed in my novel.

904
01:11:59,396 --> 01:12:01,006
Do you think...

905
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:02,766
he's happy there?

906
01:12:05,596 --> 01:12:06,596
How about...

907
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:08,796
we ask that mighty coin of yours?

908
01:12:15,836 --> 01:12:18,796
If it's the picture side, he's safely in there.

909
01:12:20,066 --> 01:12:21,296
If it's the number side,

910
01:12:26,196 --> 01:12:27,236
he failed.

911
01:12:42,596 --> 01:12:44,596
("Chicago Typewriter")

912
01:12:53,196 --> 01:12:54,396
All right.

913
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,196
No.

914
01:12:59,796 --> 01:13:01,166
You will never get to read it.

915
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:05,936
I know it's finished. Why do you not want to show me?

916
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:08,336
I want to know how it ends.

917
01:13:09,006 --> 01:13:10,966
If you're curious, buy the book later.

918
01:13:12,396 --> 01:13:14,196
You're so petty.

919
01:13:19,136 --> 01:13:20,296
I said, no.

920
01:13:20,436 --> 01:13:21,506
I'll never let you read it.

921
01:13:29,836 --> 01:13:30,866
Hey, friend.

922
01:13:31,536 --> 01:13:34,266
What took you so long?

923
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:38,696
Yul.

924
01:13:39,266 --> 01:13:40,966
Where have you been?

925
01:13:42,436 --> 01:13:43,636
I had a dream.

926
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:47,596
It sounds like you took a long nap soundly.

927
01:13:48,666 --> 01:13:50,696
Our country will never be liberated with...

928
01:13:50,696 --> 01:13:52,636
such a lazy independence fighter.

929
01:13:53,966 --> 01:13:55,036
Don't worry.

930
01:13:55,396 --> 01:13:56,766
Our country will be liberated.

931
01:13:57,506 --> 01:13:58,536
I'm sure.

932
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:02,636
It looks like you had a good dream.

933
01:14:04,136 --> 01:14:05,266
What was it about?

934
01:14:08,296 --> 01:14:11,836
It was a dream about you living happily in the liberated country.

935
01:14:26,536 --> 01:14:28,336
It was for a short while,

936
01:14:29,796 --> 01:14:31,836
but I was with you guys in the dream.

937
01:14:33,696 --> 01:14:35,836
And I hope that...

938
01:14:37,536 --> 01:14:40,196
we could be together again somewhere in the future.

939
01:14:42,966 --> 01:14:46,866
(Thank you for watching Chicago Typewriter.)

940

(Chicago Typewriter)

942
01:15:23,696 --> 01:15:26,336
It's rolling. Action.

943
01:15:26,336 --> 01:15:28,936
I'd like to announce... I'm sorry.

944
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:34,896
- It's rolling. - Let's try again. Action.

945
01:15:34,896 --> 01:15:36,666
I'd like to announce...

946
01:15:41,506 --> 01:15:43,636
We will assassinate those who are in the way of...

947
01:15:44,266 --> 01:15:45,396
our country's independence.

948
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:51,766
We will assassinate those who are in the way of...

949

our country's independence.

950
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:57,736
Just pretend to be shooting.

951
01:15:58,136 --> 01:15:59,436
I was so surprised.

952
01:15:59,436 --> 01:16:01,436
I saw fire from the gun.

953
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,336
My goodness.

954
01:16:03,336 --> 01:16:05,536
I didn't expect that at all.

955
01:16:12,336 --> 01:16:13,336
Cut.

956
01:16:14,766 --> 01:16:15,966
That way! Get them!

957
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:22,466
What are you doing? Do you want to die?

958
01:16:24,396 --> 01:16:25,596
Cut. Okay.

959
01:16:25,696 --> 01:16:26,696
Cut.
