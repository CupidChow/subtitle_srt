00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:20,404
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:32,434
Let me see your face.

3
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:38,134
Hey, show me your face.

4
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:42,704
You look familiar though.

5
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,604
Take off your glasses.

6
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:50,164
My apologies.

7
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:52,764
I can't show my face.

8
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:55,264
Are you out of your mind? You punk.

9
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:57,104
What is this?

10
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,604
- I make my living through it. - You rat.

11
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:07,704
Hey. Hey...

12
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:10,264
I also need my hand to earn a living.

13
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:12,534
- You piece of... - I found him!

14
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:15,234
How dare you run away after blowing Boss' two million dollars?

15
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:17,904
- Please don't kill me. - It's your lucky day,

16
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:23,864
- Hey! - Please don't hit me.

17
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:31,104
Hey!

18
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:40,834
I am sorry, but you can't hit my head.

19
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,164
This is the real source of my livelihood.

20
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,704
Who are you, jerk?

21
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:06,334
Ignorance is not a virtue.

22
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,964
If you have time to fight, you should read some books.

23
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:33,964
You're back.

24
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:36,834
Did you get some good materials?

25
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:38,734
Yes, I did, Ms, Kang.

26
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:41,034
Should we prepare a meal for you?

27
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:42,764
I will organize my materials first.

28
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:43,764
Okay, sir.

29
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:53,604
A writer writes not only with his brain,

30
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:57,034
but also with his hands, his feet, and his butt.

31
00:02:58,164 --> 00:03:01,264
Sometimes, he even disguises himself,

32
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,564
to become the character of his writing.

33
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:10,764
What do I do when I get stuck?

34
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:13,004
I don't know.

35
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,164
Perhaps the idea of getting stuck is created by whiners,

36
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:19,004
as an excuse to drink.

37
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,134
It's not from me.

38
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:25,334
I'm simply quoting Steve Martin who is an actor and a writer.

39
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:27,504
I agree with him entirely.

40
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,104
It's five minutes before Mr, Han finishes work.

41
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:03,004
Writing is the test of your strength.

42
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,434
I am trying to stay fit by controlling my diet,

43
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,334
and regularly exercising.

44
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:09,074
But I couldn't give up strawberry shortcake,

45
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:13,204
and cocoa loaded with sugar and milk.

46
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,734
I only eat them after submitting my work.

47
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:30,204
It's like a reward for myself.

48
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:33,904
Cigarettes?

49
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:38,704
Is there such an old-fashioned writer who still smokes cigarettes?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

50
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:41,434
I quit smoking two years ago.

51
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:44,434
Cinnamon stick proves to be an excellent alternative.

52
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:50,604
Sir, I finished sending the script.

53
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:54,364
The copyright lawyer is scheduled to visit around 1:30pm.

54
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:58,574
At 2:30pm, your doctor will visit for your regular health check-up.

55
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,264
After that, you have to finish writing a short story,

56
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:01,304
for a quarterly magazine.

57
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:02,404
Ms, Kang.

58
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:03,964
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:05,404
The garden looks,

60
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:09,004
too dreary.

61
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,004
Should we raise a deer?

62
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:16,964
Yes?

63
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:24,804
Writer Han Se Ju's novel Unfair Game's English version,

64
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:27,404
got listed in the New York Times bestseller section.

65
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:31,304
According to the KGR Management, which manages,

66
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:33,134
Mr, Han's international copyrights,

67
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:36,734
it topped the chart in just five days after the official release.

68
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:38,534
And recently it started to show a preponderance.

69
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:40,604
Supported by the enthusiastic local reception,

70
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:42,864
the writer is planning to travel seven American cities,

71
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:44,704
and five European cities on a book tour.

72
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,434
Thank you.

73
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:59,104
I liked it.

74
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:00,204
You look gorgeous.

75
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:03,334
- Hello. - Hello.

76
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:22,264
I really liked its writing.

77
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,664
I want him to sign my book.

78
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:26,564
Oh, my gosh.

79
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:30,264
Thank you.

80
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:51,764
Do you know what this gun's nickname is?

81
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,904
What? What are you saying?

82
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:40,104
Do you know what this gun's nickname is?

83
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:44,234
I don't know, What is it?

84
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:47,334
Because its gunshot is similar to a typewriter sound,

85
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:48,934
it got the nickname "Chicago Typewriter".

86
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:51,434
That's cool.

87
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:53,404
So?

88
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:57,004
A pen is stronger than a knife.

89
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:59,334
A typewriter is stronger than a gun.

90
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:00,934
So?

91
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:04,204
You should write something good.

92
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:07,734
Don't write to gain fame and women.

93
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:09,634
Write something magnificent.

94
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,764
She's a thing of beauty, huh?

95
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:25,764
That's from your country actually, Korea.

96
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:29,864
That was handcrafted way back in 1930s Kyungsung.

97
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:32,404
Kyungsung.

98
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:37,004
Hey, I am sorry. Do you think I can get an autograph too?

99
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,304
Of course.

100
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:43,964
It was such an hour hosting your book signing in my cafe.

101
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:46,434
My pleasure.

102
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:54,034
Would you sell that typewriter to me?

103
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,204
No, no, no.

104
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,234
I paid quite a lot for that at auction.

105
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:01,434
I am a huge fan, but,

106
00:11:02,934 --> 00:11:05,104
to me, she's priceless.

107
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,704
I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. It was a great pleasure.

108
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,764
- Okay, - Ha Na!

109
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:26,904
Hey, buddy.

110
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:52,064
(Chicago Typewriter)

111
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:16,134
(Please send me to Han Se Ju,)

112
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:18,934
(Please send me to Han Se Ju,)

113
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:21,964
(Please send me to Han Se Ju,)

114
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:22,104
I love the smell of new books,

115
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:25,604
Are you getting even more copies?

116
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:27,534
The one I have is for reading.

117
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,534
This one is for display, and this for keeping.

118
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:33,334
You don't even own an apartment. Are you going to build a castle?

119
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:35,704
Maniacs change the world, you know.

120
00:15:35,704 --> 00:15:38,604
The world is in need of maniacs.

121
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,964
Cut out that nonsense.

122
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:46,434
In addition to being an awesome writer, he's even handsome.

123
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:49,334
His handsome face could even save a country.

124
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:51,904
That's he's accused of writing his books with his abs,

125
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:54,834
and selling them with his face.

126
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:59,604
What kind of jerk said that?

127
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:05,234
Unfairly. I mean, he's unfairly accused of that.

128
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:08,704
I left out the "unfairly" part.

129
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:13,634
I made a terrible mistake. Just hit me. Go ahead.

130
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:16,364
Can't you let go of me?

131
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:26,064
Hello. This is, anything is possible errand service. Do Anything.

132
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,834
You have something to be picked up at Incheon International Airport?

133
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:32,134
I'll be on my way right away.

134
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:36,134
If you ever run into that jerk,

135
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:40,404
tell him or her that I might squeeze all the juices out of him or her.

136
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,564
I hope it's not you.

137
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:52,034
She's definitely not normal.

138
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:55,404
She's so crazy about that writer.

139
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:58,164
Is she the one,

140
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:01,604
who sweeps all editions of every book Han Se Ju writes?

141
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:02,904
You're right.

142
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:05,004
Who is she?

143
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:06,434
Is she an editor?

144
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,064
No.

145
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:13,034
Jeon Seol.

146
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,034
She's a legendary maniac.

147
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:26,564
She's a legendary fan fiction writer too.

148
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:33,004
Back in high school, all the other kids wrote fan fictions for singers.

149
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:38,004
Unlike all the other kids, she wrote ones for a writer.

150
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,834
No other fans of writers had done that.

151
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,934
She's a real pioneer.

152
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:49,304
Even as a kid, she was incredibly persistent.

153
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:51,934
I'm going to marry a writer.

154
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,764
- Why? - Why?

155
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:55,134
I don't know.

156
00:17:55,734 --> 00:18:00,004
I've always thought so as far as I can remember.

157
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:09,964
Just like her dad, she's an amazing climber.

158
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:21,434
She's also a master of various martial arts.

159
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:26,104
In her teens, she even dreamed of becoming an Olympian.

160
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:27,904
which she later gave up on for personal reasons.

161
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,764
Despite the prejudice that athletes have thick heads.

162
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:40,604
she got into a veterinary school after only a year of preparation.

163
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:42,834
That's incredible.

164
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:48,134
Everyone expected her to become a successful vet.

165
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:51,034
- Did she give up again? - Why would she do that?

166
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:52,904
Again, for personal reasons.

167
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:55,334
A sad story, really.

168
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:57,064
What a waste.

169
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:59,374
Her parents must have been so disappointed.

170
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:01,434
If she had parents,

171
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:04,404
the story wouldn't have ended so sadly.

172
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:07,164
- Is she an orphan? - You could say that.

173
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:11,604
Anyway, she's been doing all kinds of part-time jobs she can find.

174
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:14,734
That's how she earned her nickname, the legendary part-timer.

175
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,804
Once she starts something, she seems to become a legend.

176
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:21,964
It's nothing to be jealous of, I'd say she's lost her mind.

177
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:25,134
Now, she's nothing more than a clever girl,

178
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:27,034
who's a crazy about a writer.

179
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,804
He really has no match.

180
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,904
He must have saved a country in his previous life.

181
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:50,534
- Please say something. - Look at the camera.

182
00:19:55,064 --> 00:19:56,374
Is it a celebrity?

183
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:01,264
It's Han Se Ju.

184
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:08,874
- Don't take pictures. - Please say something.

185
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,934
(Where are you? Please hurry to Area G, I'm scared,)

186
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:14,834
Where are you?

187
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:16,634
Please hurry to Area G. I'm scared.

188
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:19,964
Is she a kid? Why would she be scared in an airport?

189
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,204
Does she have a phobia or something?

190
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:27,264
Gosh, what a shame I have to work.

191
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:42,874
Excuse me. Are you Hanna Kim?

192
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,504
Why are you so late?

193
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:46,834
I'm sorry.

194
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:49,834
Actually, I'm 48 seconds early.

195
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:52,664
Cut it out. This is the stuff.

196
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:56,034
Tell him it's a gift from the cafe owner in Chicago.

197
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:59,034
Make sure you deliver it in person.

198
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:00,234
Thank you in advance.

199
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:03,664
Wait. what's the name of the sender?

200
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:08,704
Let's see.

201
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:12,134
To Han Se Ju?

202
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:18,004
No way. That Han Se Ju?

203
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:25,134
Gosh. I should really be going with you and take care of you.

204
00:21:25,504 --> 00:21:30,134
What can I do though? I have things to take care of here.

205
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:33,734
I told you. The Han Se Ju Backing Up Project.

206
00:21:34,304 --> 00:21:36,904
I bet that project is for yourself.

207
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:42,064
Gosh. can you take a break? Being a workaholic is a disease.

208
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,864
Why do you think made me become workaholic?

209
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:48,504
I'm not sure.

210
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:52,434
I have a mountain of writing to do.

211
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:53,964
How can I take a break?

212
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:57,634
It looks like I need to wear a diaper and keep writing nonstop.

213
00:21:58,004 --> 00:21:59,864
Stop giving me work if you have any conscience.

214
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:02,764
You must be hungry.

215
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:05,904
Ms, Kang. You made a reservation at the restaurant, right?

216
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:11,164
Fire!

217
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:18,634
1 steak, 2 pasta, and 1 special for Table 7!

218
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:22,134
Hurry up, Faster, faster!

219
00:22:22,304 --> 00:22:24,964
Does he cook with his mouth or what? Listen up.

220
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:28,364
Let's publish your serial novel through an app and make it a hit.

221
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:30,164
Beautiful.

222
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:32,834
Beautiful.

223
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:35,864
Gosh. Seriously. Why is he so loud?

224
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:39,634
Anyhow, we'll revise the storyline a little bit afterward,

225
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:43,904
and turn into a movie, game, musical, webtoon, and so on.

226
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:48,934
A one-source multi-use business that effectively utilizes your content.

227
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,764
Ms, Kang, I'd like to take today off even if I'm booked for things.

228
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:55,564
I knew you'd say that, so I left your schedule empty.

229
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:57,764
The starting point is your idea.

230
00:22:57,764 --> 00:23:01,004
The staff are still on vacation. Will you be going to a hotel?

231
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:03,264
No, I'd like to go home.

232
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:06,764
The staff don't need to come back early from their vacation for me.

233
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,504
You should have an early day too.

234
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:12,364
The earlier you come up with an idea, the faster we can prepare.

235
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:16,264
There was that stalker incident recently. Will you be okay alone?

236
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:18,264
I'll be fine.

237
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:21,934
Don't just say it. Please make sure to get some rest today.

238
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,364
Make sure to give your mouth a break first.

239
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,634
Am I talking to myself or what? I'm the CEO of Golden Bear Publishing!

240
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,604
Excuse me.

241
00:23:34,504 --> 00:23:37,004
Mr, Han, did you enjoy the food?

242
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:39,364
Yes, it was delicious,

243
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:43,834
- Could I get your autograph? - Well...

244
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:47,304
A friend of mine is an avid fan of Mr, Han.

245
00:23:48,164 --> 00:23:49,964
- Sure, please give it to me. - Gosh, thank you.

246
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:53,034
- What's your friend's name? - Jeon Seol.

247
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:56,064
It means "legend".

248
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:08,234
- It's a very unique name. - It'd be amazing,

249
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:11,534
if I could get another one so that I can hang one at my restaurant.

250
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:21,034
- What's your restaurant called? - Riccardo.

251
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,504
(Rica)

252
00:24:25,504 --> 00:24:29,134
It's "cca". There are two Cs.

253
00:24:30,264 --> 00:24:31,364
Please do it again.

254
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:38,204
How fussy.

255
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:40,634
Good.

256
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:50,664
Thank you. Thank you very much.

257
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,434
That's right.

258
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:57,434
Please open this fortune cookie for fun. It's pretty accurate.

259
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,764
I'll open it later.

260
00:26:41,204 --> 00:26:42,344
Gosh.

261
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:46,404
Is this a castle or what?

262
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:56,844
So I'm actually,

263
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:01,104
in front of the writer Han Se Ju's house right now.

264
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,174
Gosh, my heart is beating so fast.

265
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,804
Fortune cookie.

266
00:27:46,474 --> 00:27:48,474
"Muses are like ghosts."

267
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:52,274
"At times, they show up without being invited."

268
00:27:53,544 --> 00:27:55,204
"Stephen King."

269
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:24,204
Parcel, parcel, parcel. There's a parcel for you.

270
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:25,974
A parcel for you!

271
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,804
Was that weird?

272
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,774
A parcel for you!

273
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,244
A parcel for you,

274
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:36,874
- Who is it? - There's a parcel for you!

275
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:46,244
I'm sorry, but could you please just leave it at the door?

276
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:50,844
My client told me to make sure,

277
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:52,904
that I give it to you in person.

278
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:55,604
I'm working at the moment. Please leave it there.

279
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:58,474
Wait, Mr, Han. Just a second, Mr, Han!

280
00:28:58,574 --> 00:28:59,804
Mr, Han.

281
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:15,344
I must've been the biggest traitor to my country in my past life.

282
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:19,074
I cannot believe I blew the chance that fell in my lap.

283
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:26,044
Who are you?

284
00:30:27,044 --> 00:30:28,204
Do you live in this house?

285
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:31,274
You are adorable.

286
00:30:32,604 --> 00:30:36,404
I'm jealous that you live in this house.

287
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:38,874
I wanted to go in there too.

288
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:43,274
I wanted to look at his writing room too.

289
00:30:59,844 --> 00:31:00,974
Are you telling me to follow you?

290
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,704
I have a parcel delivered for you. Please open the door.

291
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:21,274
You have a parcel.

292
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,104
You have a parcel.

293
00:31:40,704 --> 00:31:42,944
How did you get in here?

294
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,104
What?

295
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:46,374
Well...'

296
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,174
You opened the door.

297
00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:50,644
Did you say I opened the door?

298
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:52,404
Me?

299
00:31:56,404 --> 00:31:57,544
Who are you?

300
00:31:58,474 --> 00:31:59,604
Are you a stalker?

301
00:32:00,174 --> 00:32:03,474
I should've introduced myself first. I am sorry. I am...

302
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:05,544
Wait.

303
00:32:10,944 --> 00:32:12,274
I am a martial artist.

304
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:14,604
I am an expert martial artist who passed 17 levels.

305
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:16,604
Whatever you are trying to take out,

306
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:18,574
you better think carefully.

307
00:32:19,044 --> 00:32:21,104
You will take the responsibility in its entirety,

308
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:23,144
for your hasty decision.

309
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:26,044
I won't go easy even if you are a girl.

310
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:29,774
I carefully thought about it just now.

311
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:34,144
I am someone who gathers all wisdoms to do anything.

312
00:32:34,144 --> 00:32:38,044
You are the chosen one, Big Bell Angel.

313
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:39,704
I am sorry. That was a mistake.

314
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:42,444
That's the business card of my friend's fortune-teller mom.

315
00:32:43,774 --> 00:32:46,904
I am from the errand service agency. Do Anything.

316
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:48,004
(Do Anything)

317
00:32:50,704 --> 00:32:52,874
I will check your identity later.

318
00:32:54,674 --> 00:32:57,404
Now. I will put your parcel inside your house.

319
00:32:57,474 --> 00:32:58,474
Stop.

320
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:04,704
If you will put it in front of the door. I'll check it later.

321
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:07,474
Since I'm here.

322
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:09,444
It's okay.

323
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:11,704
- But I will... - I said no!

324
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:18,404
Goodness, you are hot-tempered.

325
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:22,274
No.

326
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:26,274
I don't take a parcel into the house,

327
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:28,344
before it's checked.

328
00:33:28,944 --> 00:33:30,074
Why is that?

329
00:33:34,904 --> 00:33:38,314
In this world, there are many people who get,

330
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:41,874
blinded by jealousy and end up wasting their lives.

331
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:44,274
Those people include,

332
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:46,774
stalkers or,

333
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:50,474
people who suffer from a persecution complex,

334
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:52,874
and insist that I stole their scripts.

335
00:33:52,874 --> 00:33:55,044
I am not a stalker, but your enthusiastic 

336
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:57,044
- fan - Blackmails are the weakest.

337
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,814
From photographs with my eyes carved out to razor blades,

338
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,104
animal corpse,

339
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:04,744
and handmade explosives.

340
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:06,874
I get all sorts of things delivered.

341
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:08,274
Really?

342
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:11,814
Someone once sneaked into my house and installed a candid camera.

343
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:13,944
Someone tried to steal my script.

344
00:34:13,944 --> 00:34:17,344
Someone even got caught while secretly lying down on my bed.

345
00:34:17,604 --> 00:34:18,674
Therefore.

346
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,144
I don't bring in anything carelessly.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

347
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:25,404
Whether it's a person, a thing,

348
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:27,374
or whatever it is.

349
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:03,044
Didn't something just pass?

350
00:35:03,374 --> 00:35:04,474
Your dog.

351
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:07,074
Dog. My dog?

352
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:12,174
I have a dog fur allergy, so I don't raise a dog.

353
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,674
Get it! Get it right now!

354
00:35:19,104 --> 00:35:21,314
What? Then I have to go inside your house.

355
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:23,544
Go in! Go inside and get it!

356
00:35:23,544 --> 00:35:25,444
Okay, I will go in first.

357
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:28,744
It's not my dog, but I will go get it.

358
00:35:42,244 --> 00:35:43,774
No! Not that one!

359
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:48,274
You're a good boy.

360
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:49,274
Come here.

361
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:01,474
No.

362
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:07,444
No. Not that one.

363
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:11,244
Is that a USB memory stick?

364
00:36:11,374 --> 00:36:13,544
Do you think that's just a USB memory stick?

365
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,474
That's my hard work.

366
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:17,474
It's the materials I collected,

367
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:19,074
while not sleeping and eating,

368
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:24,044
Until my back broke, until callus formed on my butt,

369
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:27,744
until my eyes became ulcerated, I wrote and wrote more,

370
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:29,344
for those materials.

371
00:36:30,544 --> 00:36:32,104
If that dog eats that,

372
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,544
you will die too.

373
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:37,474
But it's not my dog.

374
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:40,174
But anyway it followed you in!

375
00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:42,104
The door just opened.

376
00:36:44,444 --> 00:36:46,274
Don't you dare eat that.

377
00:36:46,844 --> 00:36:48,874
I will pluck all your hair.

378
00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:51,104
Don't provoke him. He's getting agitated.

379
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:54,044
Good boy. Come this way.

380
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:56,474
I will give you a delicious snack.

381
00:36:58,314 --> 00:36:59,474
Are you crazy?

382
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:02,944
He reacted to the word "snack".

383
00:37:05,844 --> 00:37:06,904
No.

384
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:09,574
No, please don't eat that.

385
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,704
That's not food. Please.

386
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:13,444
No.

387
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,244
Good boy.

388
00:37:15,244 --> 00:37:17,314
Don't eat that. Your stomach will get hurt.

389
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:18,944
Don't eat it. Don't eat it.

390
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:20,374
Good boy.

391
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:24,944
You darn dog! Don't you dare eat that!

392
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:27,574
I will cut you open if you eat that!

393
00:37:44,474 --> 00:37:46,204
What are you doing? Go get him!

394
00:37:47,204 --> 00:37:48,204
Why would I?

395
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:50,774
I just entered your house.

396
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:54,204
You said you will gather all wisdoms and do anything!

397
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:00,144
I will pay you double. Quadruple.

398
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,844
Octuple!

399
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:12,674
I will catch him. You go home.

400
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:14,904
You will only provoke him more. You won't be of any help.

401
00:38:14,904 --> 00:38:17,674
Am I crazy? What if you are an idea thief?

402
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:19,314
You have so many doubts.

403
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,604
I used to be a vet.

404
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:24,274
I wouldn't get a dog involved in a scam work.

405
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:27,904
That makes you even more suspicious!

406
00:38:28,204 --> 00:38:29,944
You must've trained the dog.

407
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:31,314
You must've locked him in a cage,

408
00:38:31,314 --> 00:38:33,904
fed him only dumplings, and raised him as a murder dog.

409
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:36,344
"Bite the enemy's neck."

410
00:38:36,344 --> 00:38:38,044
How would I know if you trained him to do that?

411
00:38:38,044 --> 00:38:41,704
You have such a great imagination.

412
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,444
I will do it. Never provoke him.

413
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,274
- That darn... - Stop it.

414
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:11,774
Did you just stop my mouth?

415
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:13,744
You have to handle him carefully.

416
00:39:13,744 --> 00:39:17,004
You have to treat him carefully with love and patience.

417
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,204
Copy me.

418
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:20,174
Good boy.

419
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:21,974
Come here.

420
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:23,904
He's not good at all.

421
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:33,314
Good boy.

422
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:35,874
Come here.

423
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:38,404
Good boy. Come here.

424
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:40,814
Good boy.

425
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:43,904
- Good boy. Come here. - Good boy.

426
00:39:43,904 --> 00:39:45,244
You are good.

427
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:47,844
- Come here. Come here. - Come here.

428
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:09,404
Help!

429
00:41:10,474 --> 00:41:12,374
Seol, it's been a long time.

430
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:13,704
It's an emergency.

431
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,104
- What's wrong? - He swallowed tears of blood.

432
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:18,574
I mean, he swallowed a memory stick. It needs to be taken out right away.

433
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:21,474
Otherwise, a dog and a person will die.

434
00:41:21,474 --> 00:41:24,574
- Come this way. - This way.

435
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:50,174
Luckily, he pooped before even taking any X-rays.

436
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:53,374
Pooped?

437
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:55,574
He let it all out even without an enema.

438
00:41:55,574 --> 00:41:57,604
It was painless.

439
00:41:58,074 --> 00:41:59,074
Let it all out?

440
00:41:59,074 --> 00:42:02,644
The memory stick seems to be working fine.

441
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:05,544
It's such a miracle.

442
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:09,044
It was locked, so I couldn't see what's inside. Don't worry.

443
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:12,704
I cleaned it thoroughly.

444
00:42:18,174 --> 00:42:19,204
Look.

445
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:22,444
I have another request.

446
00:42:49,374 --> 00:42:50,704
Is it done?

447
00:42:50,744 --> 00:42:53,974
As you said, I e-mailed you everything in the memory stick.

448
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:57,804
Right now, I'm formatting the memory stick and the laptop.

449
00:42:57,804 --> 00:43:00,974
The laptop is new. It won't take long.

450
00:43:01,374 --> 00:43:02,574
Have some coffee.

451
00:43:02,574 --> 00:43:05,274
Thank you. I appreciate it.

452
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:35,274
Do you have something to tell me?

453
00:43:39,374 --> 00:43:41,044
Don't you remember me?

454
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:44,604
We've met once before.

455
00:43:57,444 --> 00:43:58,644
Why are you laughing?

456
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,444
That was so predictable.

457
00:44:03,844 --> 00:44:05,444
"Don't you remember me?"

458
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:06,904
"We've met before."

459
00:44:06,904 --> 00:44:08,344
- It's true. - "It's true."

460
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,874
It's so boring.

461
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,774
It's like a refrain of a song.

462
00:44:19,204 --> 00:44:20,444
So?

463
00:44:21,544 --> 00:44:23,404
When did we meet?

464
00:44:24,644 --> 00:44:27,174
- It was... - 100 years ago?

465
00:44:28,844 --> 00:44:30,474
1,000 years ago?

466
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:38,704
When I ask them why they're obsessed with me,

467
00:44:39,104 --> 00:44:41,074
they usually say this.

468
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:44,604
"Don't try to make sense of it."

469
00:44:44,674 --> 00:44:47,474
"All I can say is that it's a destiny."

470
00:44:47,574 --> 00:44:51,244
"It might have something to do with our previous lives."

471
00:44:53,904 --> 00:44:54,974
What do you say?

472
00:44:55,674 --> 00:44:57,674
Is this what you were going to say?

473
00:44:58,074 --> 00:45:00,044
Or do you now know what to say?

474
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:02,804
I'm not obsessed with you.

475
00:45:02,844 --> 00:45:04,644
I'm just your first-ever fan.

476
00:45:04,644 --> 00:45:07,074
In the movie, "Misery", the woman says,

477
00:45:07,844 --> 00:45:10,644
"I'm your number-one fan."

478
00:45:14,074 --> 00:45:15,674
I think the laptop is formatted now.

479
00:45:16,174 --> 00:45:18,604
Please throw this memory stick away on your way.

480
00:45:21,644 --> 00:45:23,604
I can give you my laptop as a gift.

481
00:45:30,204 --> 00:45:33,304
Wait. I mean...

482
00:45:34,474 --> 00:45:36,104
Thank you for your work.

483
00:45:36,374 --> 00:45:38,474
I'll make sure to pay you generously.

484
00:45:38,574 --> 00:45:42,074
Can't I at least finish my coffee?

485
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:45,174
Do you want me to open this for you?

486
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:47,344
No. It's fine.

487
00:45:50,074 --> 00:45:53,404
I already have someone who goes through my packages for me.

488
00:45:54,474 --> 00:45:57,674
I have no other intentions.

489
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:01,544
The sender said it's important that this package is delivered right.

490
00:46:01,544 --> 00:46:04,544
- To fulfil my duty... - Do you know the sender?

491
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:09,104
Oh, I forgot to mention it.

492
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:11,144
I can explain inside.

493
00:46:11,774 --> 00:46:13,104
It's okay.

494
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:18,074
Tell me right here who sent this to me.

495
00:46:19,474 --> 00:46:21,344
- Chicago. - Chicago?

496
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:24,704
It's a gift from a cafe owner in Chicago.

497
00:46:24,704 --> 00:46:27,274
No. No. No.

498
00:46:27,274 --> 00:46:29,874
I am a huge fan, but,

499
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:32,844
to me, she's priceless.

500
00:46:35,904 --> 00:46:38,874
I'll open it myself inside.

501
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:42,704
- Bye. - Well.

502
00:46:42,704 --> 00:46:44,674
Look. Wait.

503
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:47,174
Mr, Han.

504
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:49,974
- Why does she like him so much? - Mr, Han.

505
00:46:50,004 --> 00:46:51,974
She's always been a bookworm

506
00:46:51,974 --> 00:46:55,404
She said books helped her through her hardships.

507
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:57,804
She's had many hardships in her life.

508
00:46:58,104 --> 00:47:01,274
What I don't get is, from Baek Tae Min,

509
00:47:01,274 --> 00:47:03,844
to Kim Young Ha, Chun Myung Gwan, and Kim Yeon Su,

510
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:07,874
there are countless other writers. Why Han Se Ju, of all writers?

511
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:10,874
"Don't try to make sense of it."

512
00:47:12,574 --> 00:47:15,474
"All I can say is that it's a destiny." he said,

513
00:47:19,174 --> 00:47:23,004
"It might have something to do with our previous lives." he said.

514
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,774
Still, he didn't recognize me.

515
00:47:29,574 --> 00:47:33,644
Hey, lady.

516
00:47:35,444 --> 00:47:37,174
Stop speaking Italian.

517
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:39,744
It sounds so cheesy.

518
00:47:39,844 --> 00:47:44,574
Lady, I have something amazing for you.

519
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:47,844
Ta-da.

520
00:47:51,174 --> 00:47:52,604
I see, Han Se Ju's autograph.

521
00:47:54,904 --> 00:47:58,304
"I see, Han Se Ju's autograph?"

522
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:06,904
Open it if you dare.

523
00:48:07,174 --> 00:48:10,804
You're not saying this is Han Se Ju's, are you?

524
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,274
I went to deliver a package to him, and he gave it to me.

525
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:16,344
I helped him with something.

526
00:48:18,344 --> 00:48:20,004
Unbelievable.

527
00:48:30,104 --> 00:48:33,904
I totally feel the energy of a best-seller writer.

528
00:48:34,074 --> 00:48:36,644
Will it help me win the writing competition?

529
00:48:36,644 --> 00:48:37,804
See?

530
00:48:38,204 --> 00:48:41,274
This is so-called "successful maniac".

531
00:48:41,274 --> 00:48:44,274
- Let me see. - I want to see it too.

532
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:48,474
- That was hilarious. - That was so funny.

533
00:48:48,474 --> 00:48:50,274
Wait. Lower your voice.

534
00:48:50,974 --> 00:48:53,374
That was so funny.

535
00:48:55,174 --> 00:48:56,174
Gosh.

536
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,204
Seol.

537
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:04,144
Stand right there.

538
00:49:06,174 --> 00:49:08,544
Fine. I'm late, and I'm drunk.

539
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:12,844
I won't do it again. Just worry about your daughter, Bang Jin.

540
00:49:12,844 --> 00:49:15,204
You don't have to care about even me.

541
00:49:15,974 --> 00:49:17,004
You.

542
00:49:17,944 --> 00:49:19,974
Did you deliver something weird today?

543
00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:21,344
Something weird?

544
00:49:21,944 --> 00:49:23,104
Like what?

545
00:49:23,844 --> 00:49:26,304
Ashes, for example.

546
00:49:27,574 --> 00:49:30,104
No. Why?

547
00:49:30,874 --> 00:49:32,074
What is it then?

548
00:49:33,544 --> 00:49:36,844
There's dark energy around you.

549
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:41,144
No way.

550
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:45,804
Are you seeing weird things again?

551
00:49:46,344 --> 00:49:49,544
Gosh, there you go again.

552
00:49:49,544 --> 00:49:50,744
Do you see them or not?

553
00:49:50,974 --> 00:49:52,704
Don't worry. I don't.

554
00:49:52,704 --> 00:49:54,604
It was a long time ago.

555
00:49:56,274 --> 00:49:57,974
That's a relief.

556
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:01,474
I'll kill myself if I start seeing them again.

557
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:04,374
Because of that, you abandoned me and I gave up on the Olympics.

558
00:50:04,374 --> 00:50:05,644
Will you stop?

559
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:10,104
How many times do I have to tell you your mom ran away with a guy?

560
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:14,404
Oh, my. That really cheers me up.

561
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:16,744
Did you think I'd be like this?

562
00:50:17,274 --> 00:50:20,004
- I mean. - I know.

563
00:50:20,074 --> 00:50:21,804
Just go to bed.

564
00:50:21,804 --> 00:50:25,044
Ms, Wang, your shoes are getting worn out.

565
00:50:25,074 --> 00:50:26,474
I should get going now.

566
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:31,704
How strange.

567
00:50:32,974 --> 00:50:35,404
I feel something strange.

568
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:40,074
What on earth did she deliver?

569
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:05,474
(His face expression hasn't changed. He was like a robot.)

570
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:53,544
Hey.

571
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,274
She could be useful if we teach her a bit. Don't you think?

572
00:51:58,774 --> 00:52:01,074
She's a fast learner.

573
00:52:03,974 --> 00:52:05,104
I'm done.

574
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:08,574
It took 20 seconds. See?

575
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:22,474
Well done.

576
00:52:23,904 --> 00:52:26,274
You shouldn't teach such a thing to a kid.

577
00:52:36,474 --> 00:52:38,604
What? What are you trying to say?

578
00:52:39,004 --> 00:52:40,844
Do you know what this gun's nickname is?

579
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:44,874
I don't know. What is it?

580
00:52:45,004 --> 00:52:47,344
Because its gunshot is similar to a typewriter sound,

581
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:49,704
it got the nickname "Chicago Typewriter",

582
00:52:50,774 --> 00:52:52,074
That's cool.

583
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:54,204
So?

584
00:52:55,744 --> 00:52:57,874
A pen is stronger than a knife.

585
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,004
A typewriter is stronger than a gun.

586
00:53:00,604 --> 00:53:01,674
So?

587
00:53:02,674 --> 00:53:04,404
You should write something good.

588
00:53:04,874 --> 00:53:07,974
Don't write to gain fame and women.

589
00:53:08,074 --> 00:53:10,174
Write something magnificent.

590
00:54:00,974 --> 00:54:03,874
Stop nagging on me. You know, it's early in the morning.

591
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:06,744
What do you by morning? It's already past 3pm.

592
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,174
It's not like you to oversleep.

593
00:54:09,304 --> 00:54:11,674
Are you laid-back now,

594
00:54:11,674 --> 00:54:14,804
since your employers are all on a vacation?

595
00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:18,604
Come on. I get you the golden eggs always on time.

596
00:54:18,844 --> 00:54:20,604
Have I ever missed the deadline?

597
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,244
Why don't you just open my stomach?

598
00:54:24,374 --> 00:54:26,144
Gosh, how polite of you.

599
00:54:26,144 --> 00:54:30,404
I was just joking. Did I sound so serious to you?

600
00:54:31,774 --> 00:54:34,044
I just wanted to tell you,

601
00:54:34,044 --> 00:54:38,344
we might have to tell the investors about the item.

602
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:45,874
1930.

603
00:54:47,474 --> 00:54:48,574
In Kyungsung,

604
00:54:48,574 --> 00:54:50,074
(President Gal Ji Seok)

605
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:51,474
So you have an idea.

606
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:56,644
1930 in Kyungsung? Is it a period piece?

607
00:54:57,204 --> 00:55:01,374
It's a love story of an independence activist and a writer.

608
00:55:04,474 --> 00:55:06,244
Unbelivable!

609
00:55:06,574 --> 00:55:08,874
Incredible! Remarkable!

610
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,604
Yes, man!

611
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:17,174
Korea's Steven King, Han Se Ju writes a love story.

612
00:55:17,174 --> 00:55:19,174
I love it,

613
00:55:19,544 --> 00:55:22,074
It already sells itself.

614
00:55:23,544 --> 00:55:25,974
Are you happy now? I'll hang up now.

615
00:55:32,474 --> 00:55:34,144
Maybe I worked too much.

616
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:12,344
Why don't you just open my...

617
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:14,904
Hi, ms, Kang.

618
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:17,874
Excuse me?

619
00:56:19,674 --> 00:56:20,704
A dog?

620
00:56:21,904 --> 00:56:23,144
What dog?

621
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:24,604
Yes.

622
00:56:26,404 --> 00:56:27,674
Really?

623
00:56:28,674 --> 00:56:31,304
All right. Bye.

624
00:56:31,374 --> 00:56:32,474
Hello.

625
00:56:34,044 --> 00:56:36,474
- This is the document you asked. - Seol.

626
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:39,144
What should we do with the dog?

627
00:56:40,074 --> 00:56:41,174
What about the dog?

628
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:43,774
Is he sick?

629
00:56:44,474 --> 00:56:47,904
I just talked to the secretary of Han Se Ju,

630
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,044
but he said he can't take him.

631
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:52,104
He isn't his dog?

632
00:56:52,104 --> 00:56:53,474
No, he isn't.

633
00:56:54,604 --> 00:56:55,944
How strange.

634
00:56:56,404 --> 00:56:59,204
He was acting as if he was the owner of the house.

635
00:56:59,204 --> 00:57:01,844
He even opened the door for him.

636
00:57:02,574 --> 00:57:07,304
It seems like he's a lost dog. He's full grown, so he won't be adopted.

637
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:11,444
Seol, you can't take him, can you?

638
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:16,204
I'd love to, but I'm living at my friend's place.

639
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:20,944
I guess you aren't so different from him.

640
00:57:22,744 --> 00:57:26,574
I'll go ask the writer tonight after I finish work.

641
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:28,174
That won't help.

642
00:57:28,174 --> 00:57:30,904
He said he's allergic to dogs.

643
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:33,604
It seemed like he had a large garden and many employers.

644
00:57:33,644 --> 00:57:35,874
Maybe someone there can take him.

645
00:57:40,844 --> 00:57:44,274
Maybe we're meant to meet each other.

646
00:58:12,174 --> 00:58:14,944
("Fate")

647
00:58:21,074 --> 00:58:22,274
Mr, Han?

648
00:58:25,904 --> 00:58:27,204
There you are, Han Se Ju.

649
00:58:28,474 --> 00:58:31,674
Are you busy? If you have some time, how about a cup of tea?

650
00:58:33,104 --> 00:58:34,304
Why would I?

651
00:58:36,474 --> 00:58:39,704
- It's Han Se Ju. - He's so handsome!

652
00:58:40,004 --> 00:58:41,104
My gosh.

653
00:58:42,944 --> 00:58:44,344
Why would I mind?

654
00:58:50,874 --> 00:58:54,374
My father finished the novel he's been writing for 10 years recently.

655
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:56,804
It's going to be published as a complete series soon.

656
00:58:58,204 --> 00:59:01,674
He said he'd never do it again. He even got himself a rupture.

657
00:59:02,274 --> 00:59:04,604
My mother is still into painting.

658
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:07,474
Right. You know Se Ra went to France to study, don't you?

659
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,644
Why do you say that to me?

660
00:59:10,944 --> 00:59:11,944
Excuse me?

661
00:59:12,144 --> 00:59:14,874
It shouldn't be because that's all you can brag about yourself,

662
00:59:15,274 --> 00:59:17,744
in front of an orphan.

663
00:59:17,904 --> 00:59:19,074
You.

664
00:59:19,744 --> 00:59:23,104
You used to live with us under one roof.

665
00:59:23,174 --> 00:59:26,104
It's been a long time since I'm out of the roof.

666
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,174
Why do I have to know about how they're doing?

667
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:32,444
It's as horrible as reading a boring novel to the end.

668
00:59:32,704 --> 00:59:37,304
Even if I was forced to buy it. I have all the right to stop reading.

669
00:59:37,304 --> 00:59:38,874
I stopped reading a long time ago.

670
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:41,104
Please don't open it again. It's boring.

671
00:59:43,044 --> 00:59:44,844
Did you feel like you were forced?

672
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:47,774
I once thought it was a present.

673
00:59:50,104 --> 00:59:52,644
All of my family feel sorry about,

674
00:59:52,974 --> 00:59:55,344
that we couldn't be nice to you to the end.

675
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:58,704
- But... - Does it make you feel better,

676
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:01,404
if you talk like that?

677
01:00:04,374 --> 01:00:06,444
Stop being so negative.

678
01:00:06,574 --> 01:00:09,274
I just wanted to personally catch up with,

679
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:12,004
Why would I see you personally if I don't want to see you in public?

680
01:00:12,174 --> 01:00:13,374
Mr, Han.

681
01:00:15,874 --> 01:00:17,044
In public.

682
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:19,874
I'm wearing so-called "business mask".

683
01:00:22,044 --> 01:00:24,204
It has a smile of capitalism.

684
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:27,674
When you're professional, it's doable.

685
01:00:29,144 --> 01:00:31,204
But it doesn't seem to work when seeing in person.

686
01:00:32,744 --> 01:00:34,144
So let's not do this.

687
01:00:35,704 --> 01:00:37,704
My father is very worried about you.

688
01:00:41,544 --> 01:00:44,574
It seems to bother him that you write something dangerous.

689
01:00:51,644 --> 01:00:52,944
Something dangerous?

690
01:00:54,474 --> 01:00:55,874
He's an old man.

691
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:58,804
Because of the kind of books you write,

692
01:00:58,804 --> 01:01:00,074
he thinks you're likely to be offensive yourself.

693
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:01,444
What's dangerous is,

694
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:05,004
already written 10 years ago.

695
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:07,904
It ruined,

696
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:11,904
both yours and my life,

697
01:01:14,944 --> 01:01:17,144
Could there be anything more dangerous than that?

698
01:01:21,174 --> 01:01:23,404
Stop wasting valuable time.

699
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:25,774
Go write.

700
01:01:26,844 --> 01:01:29,474
Write madly like me.

701
01:01:35,674 --> 01:01:36,944
"Write madly,"

702
01:01:39,944 --> 01:01:41,344
"like me."

703
01:02:54,034 --> 01:02:57,034
("Muses are ghosts. Sometimes they come uninvited." by Steven King)

704
01:03:02,034 --> 01:03:03,864
("Muses are ghosts. Sometimes they come uninvited." by Steven King)

705
01:03:05,964 --> 01:03:06,964
Who is there?

706
01:03:07,434 --> 01:03:09,534
You're not supposed to walk into my office without my permission.

707
01:03:32,864 --> 01:03:34,264
Hello, Mr, Han.

708
01:03:36,434 --> 01:03:38,264
How did you come in here?

709
01:03:39,234 --> 01:03:40,234
Well...

710
01:03:40,634 --> 01:03:42,734
After ringing the bell.

711
01:03:42,734 --> 01:03:44,364
I figured the door was open.

712
01:03:44,364 --> 01:03:46,334
I made sure it was closed after I came in.

713
01:03:46,964 --> 01:03:48,734
You'd better lock up.

714
01:03:52,434 --> 01:03:54,134
Well.

715
01:03:54,834 --> 01:03:58,094
I already heard everything from the veterinarian,

716
01:03:58,694 --> 01:04:01,134
but I feel really bad for the dog.

717
01:04:02,394 --> 01:04:05,294
So I wanted to ask you for one last time.

718
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:09,634
I suggest you to be more creative.

719
01:04:10,064 --> 01:04:11,064
Pardon me?

720
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,864
You're using the same trick.

721
01:04:14,394 --> 01:04:16,734
I've never let the door open,

722
01:04:16,734 --> 01:04:19,234
but it's open whenever you're here.

723
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:21,234
- I'm not lying. - You asked me why you would,

724
01:04:21,234 --> 01:04:24,264
bring a dog just to lie to me.

725
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:27,634
But you always blame the dog,

726
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:31,764
Using a dog is indeed quite,

727
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,864
a good way to let one's guard down when commiting a crime.

728
01:04:35,194 --> 01:04:37,134
What do you mean by crime?

729
01:04:37,134 --> 01:04:38,564
Who are you?

730
01:04:40,034 --> 01:04:41,134
Mr, Han.

731
01:04:41,134 --> 01:04:43,764
Is it also you who were at my office?

732
01:04:44,094 --> 01:04:46,264
Were you the peeping person?

733
01:04:46,264 --> 01:04:47,664
I'm not.

734
01:04:47,664 --> 01:04:50,164
Why would I do that? I'm just...

735
01:04:52,534 --> 01:04:54,464
Did a stalker break in?

736
01:04:54,464 --> 01:04:57,094
Don't ask me. You should know.

737
01:04:59,164 --> 01:05:00,164
Are you,

738
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:03,734
suspecting me now?

739
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:08,464
I told you. I'm the first-ever fan of yours.

740
01:05:08,464 --> 01:05:11,734
I know people like you.

741
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:16,194
Saying that you're a huge fan of mine, you like me,

742
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:18,094
and you respect me,

743
01:05:18,534 --> 01:05:22,294
you idealize me and become obsessed with me.

744
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:23,994
Once the illusion is shattered,

745
01:05:24,664 --> 01:05:29,564
you'd turn your back and attack and blackmail me.

746
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:33,694
Get lost. Otherwise I will call the police.

747
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:35,894
I don't need a fan like you.

748
01:05:55,964 --> 01:05:56,964
Let's go.

749
01:05:57,634 --> 01:06:01,834
I don't think he's going to accept you as a family member.

750
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:08,834
I can't force him to take you if he doesn't want to.

751
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:11,934
Let's go.

752
01:06:31,094 --> 01:06:34,034
Your sandwich and coffee are ready.

753
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:36,434
Enjoy.

754
01:06:44,064 --> 01:06:45,334
He's here again.

755
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:46,634
Yes.

756
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:48,464
He comes everyday at the same time.

757
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:51,704
Then he orders the cheapest sandwich and a cup of coffee,

758
01:06:51,704 --> 01:06:53,364
and stay here the whole day.

759
01:06:53,764 --> 01:06:54,994
It's already been a month.

760
01:06:55,464 --> 01:06:59,494
He sometimes eats the leftover sandwiches or cookies others left.

761
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:01,934
Maybe he's a homeless man.

762
01:07:02,334 --> 01:07:04,864
He looks like an ordinary person though.

763
01:07:05,264 --> 01:07:07,794
It seemed like he was writing a novel.

764
01:07:25,934 --> 01:07:27,664
Of course he doesn't remember.

765
01:07:28,034 --> 01:07:29,834
It's been a long time.

766
01:07:38,064 --> 01:07:39,334
Where are you going?

767
01:07:39,864 --> 01:07:41,134
It's dangerous!

768
01:07:43,634 --> 01:07:44,764
Gosh.

769
01:07:49,704 --> 01:07:51,394
You should write something good.

770
01:08:11,394 --> 01:08:14,464
Don't write to gain fame and women.

771
01:08:14,704 --> 01:08:16,564
Write something magnificent.

772
01:08:37,664 --> 01:08:38,894
Who is it?

773
01:08:44,064 --> 01:08:45,704
Are you still there?

774
01:08:46,634 --> 01:08:48,994
I told you I'm going to call the police.

775
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:49,994
Mr, Han.

776
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:52,794
Don't you remember me?

777
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:11,964
Since three years ago.

778
01:09:12,564 --> 01:09:15,364
I've been sending you emails and letters every day.

779
01:09:23,564 --> 01:09:24,794
Please,

780
01:09:25,564 --> 01:09:27,964
put that gun down so that we can talk.

781
01:09:28,494 --> 01:09:30,864
The fact that you never wrote me back really disappointed me.

782
01:09:31,704 --> 01:09:34,964
You sent me a message through your serial novel,

783
01:09:34,964 --> 01:09:36,564
that I should retaliate against the world.

784
01:09:38,064 --> 01:09:39,564
Put your gun down first.

785
01:09:39,564 --> 01:09:42,364
I knew right away that you were trying to speak to me.

786
01:09:43,164 --> 01:09:44,634
I thought. "This is my story."

787
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:48,394
"Mr, Han is sending me a message through his novel."

788
01:09:51,034 --> 01:09:53,334
Hence, I've eliminated everyone like you told me to do.

789
01:09:56,704 --> 01:09:58,834
What? Eliminate?

790
01:09:59,394 --> 01:10:00,394
Whom?

791
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:02,564
Those jerks who had been making my life difficult.

792
01:10:06,294 --> 01:10:07,934
Are you saying,

793
01:10:09,094 --> 01:10:11,894
that you killed people after reading my novel?

794
01:10:12,864 --> 01:10:14,534
That's what you told me to do.

795
01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:19,434
Are you insane?

796
01:10:20,234 --> 01:10:23,034
But why did you end the story like that?

797
01:10:23,704 --> 01:10:25,764
Why do I have to die? I just,

798
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:28,294
wiped out those pieces of trash like you said I should.

799
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:34,164
That novel isn't about you!

800
01:10:34,164 --> 01:10:37,364
Don't lie to my face, I told you that story!

801
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:43,394
All I did was do as you say. Why do I have to die? Why?

802
01:10:48,294 --> 01:10:49,734
You ruined me.

803
01:10:49,794 --> 01:10:52,164
Your novel destroyed my life!

804
01:12:07,064 --> 01:12:08,164
Don't be so ridiculous.

805
01:12:08,664 --> 01:12:11,134
No idiot would let a novel ruin his life.

806
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:14,734
You're the one who ruined your life.

807
01:12:19,564 --> 01:12:22,494
By the way, you said she used to be an Olympic prospect.

808
01:12:22,494 --> 01:12:23,994
In what?

809
01:12:24,394 --> 01:12:26,034
Didn't I tell you?

810
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:28,094
- Shooting. - Shooting?

811
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,534
Why did she quit? Because of an injury?

812
01:12:30,664 --> 01:12:31,934
No.

813
01:12:32,794 --> 01:12:35,964
She sees delusions every time she holds a gun.

814
01:12:36,134 --> 01:12:37,394
What does she see?

815
01:12:38,764 --> 01:12:40,064
Her past life.

816
01:12:41,134 --> 01:12:45,204
She sees herself shooting someone dead in her past life.

817
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:49,364
Before it started happening,

818
01:12:49,564 --> 01:12:52,064
she really was known as a legend.

819
01:12:54,234 --> 01:12:57,364
A legendary sniper.

820
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:58,394
(Chicago Typewriter)

821
01:13:58,664 --> 01:14:00,434
Did you learn how to shoot?

822
01:14:00,434 --> 01:14:01,794
A really long time ago,

823
01:14:01,794 --> 01:14:03,764
I'll tell you about it when we become close.

824
01:14:03,764 --> 01:14:05,704
She reminds me of "Misery". She creeps me out!

825
01:14:05,704 --> 01:14:08,094
The reporter just dropped a bomb.

826
01:14:08,094 --> 01:14:09,864
I told you we must make sure she doesn't talk!

827
01:14:09,864 --> 01:14:11,564
Do you think you're so perfect?

828
01:14:11,564 --> 01:14:13,494
I know for a fact that you'll also hit a dead end one day!

829
01:14:13,494 --> 01:14:14,894
I told you I'd write it!

830
01:14:14,894 --> 01:14:17,434
That ghost writer I told you about.

831
01:14:21,334 --> 01:14:23,864
What is this? Am I crazy?

832
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:26,034
Am I going insane?

833
01:14:27,704 --> 01:14:29,264
I can't die like this.
