00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:46,000
This used to be our playground.

190
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This used to be our playground.

191
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:06,000
This used to be our playground.

192
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:16,000
This used to be our playground.

193
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:26,000
This used to be our playground.

194
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:36,000
This used to be our playground.

195
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This used to be our playground.

196
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,000
This used to be our playground.

197
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,000
This used to be our playground.

198
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:14,000
This used to be our playground.

199
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:24,000
This used to be our playground.

200
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This used to be our playground.

201
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:44,000
This used to be our playground.

202
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:54,000
This used to be our playground.

203
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:04,000
This used to be our playground.

204
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:14,000
This used to be our playground.

205
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This used to be our playground.

206
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:34,000
This used to be our playground.

207
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:44,000
This used to be our playground.

208
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This used to be our playground.

209
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:04,000
This used to be our playground.

210
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,000
This used to be our playground.

211
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:22,000
This used to be our playground.

212
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This used to be our playground.

213
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This used to be our playground.

214
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:52,000
This used to be our playground.

215
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:02,000
This used to be our playground.

216
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:12,000
This used to be our playground.

217
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:22,000
This used to be our playground.

218
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:32,000
This used to be our playground.

219
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:40,000
This used to be our playground.

220
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:50,000
This used to be our playground.

221
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
This used to be our playground.

222
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
This used to be our playground.

223
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This used to be our playground.

224
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Chen Nian, you did the right thing.

225
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You have to believe in your own right.

226
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
There will always be shadows on the road.

227
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But the stage always sees the light.

228
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I am responsible for this.

229
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You will have a new director.

230
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Chen Nian.

231
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You are disappointed with me?

232
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm also very disappointed. I don't know who to choose.

233
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We've done a lot of work, but we don't have enough evidence.

234
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But you know what it is. Right?

235
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You don't know who to choose.

236
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We've done a lot of work, but we don't have enough evidence.

237
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But you know what it is. Right?

238
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
When I was 18, I didn't really like to sleep.

239
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
At that time, our middle-school class director told me

240
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,120
or medical school.

241
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,480
Because these two jobs

242
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,600
are often done by the night.

243
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,280
Later, I was a police officer

244
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,320
at the school graduation.

245
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,680
I slowly

246
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,160
became a very fond of sleeping.

247
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,760
Do you know why?

248
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,560
Because there are some things

249
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,160
that I don't want to see.

250
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,760
We are not such a family.

251
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,200
I always taught him

252
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,400
as his father.

253
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,600
Nothing can be done

254
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,760
just like a child.

255
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,120
What kind of person

256
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,880
is worth teaching and how to teach?

257
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,080
It's all about learning.

258
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,400
Other children can't think about it.

259
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,560
They can't not think about it.

260
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,320
It's different from others.

261
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,360
I'm afraid a lot of things

262
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,640
are not that simple.

263
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,840
For example,

264
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,360
what is the status of the other family?

265
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,800
Why is their psychological quality

266
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,000
so bad?

267
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,120
What responsibility should you have

268
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,160
in school?

269
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:10,960
And

270
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,920
you have to tell them

271
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,040
everything about the truth.

272
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,320
If you really want to be a good person,

273
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,520
who will face you?

274
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,720
Have you ever seen my eyes?

275
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Before they were caught and killed.

276
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,680
This child is still single.

277
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,600
You said he was not ashamed.

278
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,720
Who is ashamed?

279
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,680
No expression.

280
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,840
Nothing.

281
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,320
But because he is afraid in his heart,

282
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
he didn't have time to open his eyes.

283
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,840
You don't need to be afraid now.

284
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,440
Get ready to go to the exam.

285
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,600
Yes.

286
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,120
After the exam,

287
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,120
you become a great person.

288
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,480
My mom said

289
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,240
being a great person is a little bit better.

290
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,840
The memory will become dull.

291
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
So you don't have to go to the heart.

292
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,280
You will forget everything.

293
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,840
But

294
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
you never understood

295
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,160
how to become a great person.

296
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,000
Zhen Tian,

297
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,680
listen to me.

298
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,840
You look like you are jumping.

299
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,880
Don't think about anything on the ground.

300
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,840
Jump into the river.

301
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,000
There are sand and stones in the river.

302
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,280
There will be a wave.

303
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,960
We all look like that.

304
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,720
Don't worry.

305
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,880
Have you eaten?

306
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,680
Yes.

307
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,040
I am a little bit troublesome.

308
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
I have a few people who are busy with facial masks.

309
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,440
I am always here to look for them.

310
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:09,920
Come back.

311
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,440
Then come back.

312
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,480
Don't you want to do it?

313
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,600
I can't come back.

314
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,640
I have money.

315
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,560
And someone is chasing me.

316
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,240
You are alone at home.

317
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,360
It's safe.

318
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,040
You are a child at home.

319
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,560
How are they going to help you?

320
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,840
Hello.

321
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,560
Have you had enough money?

322
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,840
Have you paid enough for yourself?

323
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,440
Yes.

324
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,320
Why are you still wearing it?

325
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,040
I am not.

326
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,680
Yes.

327
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,680
Don't look for me in the first place.

328
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,120
I don't want to see you.

329
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,480
Little pot.

330
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,840
What are you doing?

331
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,120
When I get to Beijing,

332
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,080
I will be ready.

333
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,000
When?

334
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,200
When I need a mask.

335
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,240
I will open a small store.

336
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,720
I take care of people every day to pay.

337
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,560
We will come back together.

338
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,680
I will pay for my classmates.

339
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,200
Okay.

340
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,160
Good boy.

341
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,080
I will only give you.

342
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,480
I tell you.

343
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,680
You are the best.

344
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,200
I will be the best.

345
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,760
We are all four-hole heads.

346
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,040
We are all four-hole heads.

347
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,760
Do you understand?

348
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,680
The mouse is in the night.

349
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,000
Don't turn off the light.

350
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,280
Do you understand?

351
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,360
I heard it well.

352
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,480
I will get it.

353
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,800
Come on.

354
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,400
Good boy.

355
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,920
Sleep early.

356
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:38,960
Bye.

357
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,000
Good boy.

358
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,120
Bye.

359
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,480
But students' mental health is very important to us.

360
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,800
The school will also strengthen their mental health.

361
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,080
If you have any questions,

362
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,080
you can ask the teacher.

363
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,680
We must stick to it.

364
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,400
We must be persistent.

365
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,160
Only if we are persistent,

366
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,920
we can get better results.

367
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,760
We are all not afraid of being afraid of being afraid.

368
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,480
Right?

369
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,680
Yes.

370
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,240
Class.

371
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,640
Class.

372
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,520
Class.

373
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,520
You are going to die soon.

374
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,880
You are going to die soon.

375
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,480
Are you happy?

376
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,760
Yes.

377
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,840
Run.

378
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,200
Class, you are going to die.

379
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,160
Have fun.

380
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,120
Have fun.

381
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,640
One, two, three.

382
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,760
Yes.

383
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,640
Yes.

384
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,120
How dare you!

385
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,000
Why don't you look like I wasn't?

386
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,520
Damn it!

387
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,120
Let go of me!

388
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,240
Stop!

389
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,760
Stop!

390
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,760
What's wrong with you, Chen Jian?

391
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,760
Where did Chen Jian go?

392
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
I'm going to kill you!

393
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,760
Are you going to run away?

394
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,760
Stop!

395
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
Stop!

396
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,760
Stop!

397
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,760
Get away!

398
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,760
Did you see anyone?

399
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,760
Go to her house!

400
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,760
I don't want to believe that she won't go back!

401
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

402
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,760
I'm sorry.

403
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,760
I'm sorry.

404
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
Do you think I can protect you?

405
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,760
I don't have any money to pay you.

406
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
But I have to go to Beijing.

407
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,760
I'm sorry.

408
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,760
Are you hot?

409
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,760
What?

410
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,760
What did you say?

411
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,760
Are you hot?

412
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,760
No.

413
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,760
Do you want to go to Beijing?

414
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
I'm sorry.

415
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,760
I'm sorry.

416
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,760
I'm sorry.

417
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,760
I'm sorry.

418
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,760
I'm sorry.

419
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,760
Do you want to go?

420
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
What did you say?

421
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,760
Do you want to go to the beach?

422
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,760
No.

423
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,760
No.

424
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,760
You've been looking down on me, haven't you?

425
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Give me a seat.

426
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,760
Give me a seat.

427
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,760
Bring the doorbell.

428
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,760
Give me the seat.

429
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,760
Bring the doorbell.

430
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,760
Sister Zai, I owe Xiaobai a favor.

431
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,760
I didn't say I owe him anything.

432
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,760
Maybe he's a criminal.

433
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,760
I'm sorry.

434
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,760
I didn't say he's a criminal.

435
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,760
Maybe he's a criminal.

436
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,760
You have to write it tomorrow.

437
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,760
I'm sorry.

438
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,760
I'm sorry.

439
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,760
I'm sorry.

440
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,760
Hey.

441
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
I'm sorry.

442
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Don't touch me.

443
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,760
Where's the money?

444
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,760
What are you looking at?

445
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,760
You don't have money.

446
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,760
You still have the face to pay.

447
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,760
I'll pay the last contribution.

448
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,760
Now, please give up your power

449
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,760
and make the right choice.

450
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,760
I swear.

451
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,760
I swear upon my father.

452
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,760
I don't pay the left hands after my father.

453
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,760
I don't get the money.

454
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,760
You don't have the money.

455
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,760
Get lost.

456
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,760
I'm taking my someone's smile.

457
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,760
Be bold.

458
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,760
Follow follow follow.

459
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,760
What is it?

460
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,760
6 seconds.

461
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,760
30,000.

462
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,760
50,000.

463
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,760
We have 50,000.

464
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,760
I'm sorry.

465
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,760
Don't do it.

466
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,760
I'm sorry.

467
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,760
I'm sorry.

468
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,760
Don't do it!

469
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,760
Don't do it!

470
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,760
Don't do it!

471
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
What are you doing?

472
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,760
Playing.

473
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,760
Playing?

474
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,760
I don't know.

475
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,760
The subject is very accurate.

476
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,760
What is the subject?

477
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,760
Don't tell me.

478
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,760
I don't want to know.

479
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,760
Why don't you go to school?

480
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,760
I didn't say no.

481
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,760
It's useful.

482
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,760
It's useful to you.

483
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,760
It's useful to me.

484
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,760
If you don't study well,

485
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,760
you'll have to fight in my shop.

486
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,760
Your parents don't care about us.

487
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,760
They like to fight.

488
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,760
What are you waiting for?

489
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,760
Fight.

490
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,760
You're too sensitive.

491
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,760
You don't understand.

492
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,760
Who is protecting you?

493
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Can he protect me?

494
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,760
I don't know.

495
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,760
Why did he turn to me?

496
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,760
Why did we listen to him?

497
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,760
I'll accompany you to go home.

498
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,760
I'll go with you.

499
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:51,760
I'm sorry.

500
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,760
Does it hurt?

501
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,760
It's fine.

502
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,760
How long has it been?

503
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,760
13 years.

504
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,760
My dad ran away.

505
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,760
My mom couldn't live with me.

506
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,760
She didn't have any sense.

507
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,760
I came back to meet a man.

508
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,760
One morning, I just got up.

509
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,760
He came back from the house.

510
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,760
I was happy.

511
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,760
I could not eat meat.

512
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,760
But I had a taste.

513
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,760
He started to hit me.

514
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,760
I was so sad.

515
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,760
I didn't want that man.

516
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,760
Because of me.

517
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,760
But then he hit me.

518
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,760
I'll go to see him.

519
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,760
He's gone.

520
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,760
He's gone.

521
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,760
Chen Tian.

522
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,760
You're the first person who asks me if I'm hurt.

523
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,760
I'm sorry.

524
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,760
Here you are.

525
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,760
Thank you.

526
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,760
Have you been followed recently?

527
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,760
I'll tell you.

528
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,760
I saw a little girl with a man.

529
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,760
It's not the same.

530
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,760
How much does a college student earn?

531
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,760
Not much.

532
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,760
It's over 10,000 yuan.

533
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,760
How do we earn money?

534
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,760
First, we don't want to earn money.

535
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,760
Second, we don't want to earn money.

536
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,760
How can we earn money?

537
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,760
But you look so pretty.

538
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,760
Think about it.

539
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,760
I'm not the kind of person you think I am.

540
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,760
What do you think?

541
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,760
I've been ignoring Wei Xiaodi.

542
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,760
She wanted to be my friend.

543
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,760
I actually like her.

544
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,760
I've never thought that I would be protected by you.

545
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,760
What did you say?

546
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,760
I said I was going to be your friend.

547
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,760
I'm not going to be your friend.

548
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,760
I'm not going to be your friend.

549
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,760
I'm sorry.

550
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,760
I'm sorry.

551
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,760
Wei.

552
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,760
Do you miss me?

553
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,760
Let's go out together.

554
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
How do we go out?

555
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,760
There's no way.

556
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,760
We can meet the most glorious people on the street.

557
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,760
Close your eyes.

558
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,760
Come here.

559
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,760
I'm going to beat you.

560
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,760
Be quiet.

561
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,760
Don't run.

562
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,760
What are you doing?

563
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,760
What are you doing?

564
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,760
What are you doing?

565
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,760
Get out of the way.

566
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,760
I said you.

567
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,760
What are you doing?

568
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,760
Go.

569
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,760
What are you doing?

570
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,760
You and you.

571
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,760
Get up.

572
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,760
You guys get up.

573
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,760
Wait for me.

574
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,760
Get up.

575
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,760
You three should get up.

576
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,760
Get up.

577
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,760
Get up.

578
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,760
Get up.

579
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,760
One of you should get up.

580
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,760
Where are you going?

581
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,760
Get up.

582
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,760
I'm coming.

583
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:29,760
Take the cell phone.

584
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,760
There's someone who is a suspect.

585
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,760
Please cooperate with us to investigate.

586
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,380
They shouldn't.

587
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,400
Four dogs become NEED testers?

588
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,380
It's only just the nine of us.

589
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:06,580
Three nests!

590
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:11,540
Some can bear nothing.

591
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,040
What is it?

592
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,040
The number you dialed is powered off.

593
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,040
Sorry.

594
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,040
Want to live? Just shut up.

595
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,040
Want to live? Just shut up!

596
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:51,540
Wait a minute. Next.

597
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,540
Want to live? Just shut up!

598
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,540
Go!

599
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,040
Go!

600
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,040
Go!

601
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,040
I can do it again?

602
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,040
Put your masks on.

603
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,040
Stand still.

604
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,040
The number you dialed is powered off.

605
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,040
Sorry.

606
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,040
The number you dialed is powered off.

607
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,040
Sorry.

608
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,040
What is it?

609
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Don't hang up.

610
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,040
What is it?

611
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,040
What is it?

612
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,040
What is it?

613
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,040
Where is it?

614
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,040
What is it?

615
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,040
What is it?

616
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,040
What is it?

617
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,040
What is it?

618
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,040
What is it?

619
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,040
Don't hang up.

620
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,040
Sorry.

621
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,040
Sorry.

622
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,040
Where is it?

623
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,040
What is it?

624
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,540
The number you dialed is powered off.

625
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,540
Sorry.

626
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,540

627
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,540
Don't hang up.

628
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,540
Sorry.

629
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:22,540
Sorry.

630
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,540
Sorry.

631
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,540
Sorry.

632
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:26,540
Sorry.

633
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,540
Sorry.

634
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,540
Sorry.

635
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:29,540
Sorry.

636
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,540
Sorry.

637
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,540
Sorry.

638
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:36,040
Yournie is alive, isn't she?

639
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:40,420
That was

640
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,040
a large number of Hitomi,

641
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,040
and it was our lucky pinnacle

642
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,240
to have even one of us

643
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,040
give the album to the number

644
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,240
you dialed.

645
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,040
Yournie Deutscher,

646
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,040
and also my lucky pinnacle

647
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,020
recognized as much as

648
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,040
the number you dialed.

649
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,980
Come on!

650
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,500
Come!

651
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:09,300
What are you doing?

652
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,820
I'm a police officer!

653
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,100
The police unite

654
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:29,140
Can you carb this drink?

655
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,180
There's less to be forgive

656
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,280
Nothing was in there.

657
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,500
I offered nothing,

658
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,440
but what's more precious is love.

659
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,360
You're still my 저�liner.

660
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,140
Now what?

661
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,840
You can help me,

662
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,540
but if I can't be your little ruffian...

663
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,060
from that time on...

664
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:25,900
and everything when you gave me the weapon,

665
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,620
I'd rather be a red by your hand.

666
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,940
You should bring something from your home.

667
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:37,540
I'm going to make a little bit of a hole in the middle of the tree.

668
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:42,540
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the tree.

669
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:47,540
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the tree.

670
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:52,540
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the tree.

671
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:57,540
I'm going to make a hole in the middle of the tree.

672
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:01,540
marker

673
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:05,540
marker

674
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:15,540
I'm going to draw the waterano

675
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,540
I'm going to draw the waterano

676
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:26,540
I'm going to draw the waterano

677
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:32,540
I'm going to use a brush to draw the shape of the head.

678
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:37,540
I'm going to draw the head of the head.

679
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:42,540
I'm going to draw the head of the head.

680
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:47,540
I'm going to draw the head of the head.

681
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:52,540
I'm going to draw the head of the head.

682
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:57,540
I'm going to draw the head of the head.

683
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:21,540
I'm going to draw the head of the head.

684
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:28,540
careless

685
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,980
student

686
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,980
You should know the traffic route to the exam.

687
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,480
You should calculate the time.

688
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,980
You should arrive at the station in 15 minutes.

689
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:55,980
Do you hear me?

690
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:56,980
Yes.

691
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,980
Now, you are dismissed.

692
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,480
Song Junlin.

693
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,980

694
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:06,480
Yang Kaiyuan.

695
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,480
Be careful of the exam.

696
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,980
Chen Nian.

697
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:20,980

01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,980
Ying Tianyu.

700
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:40,980
Mom, do you believe me?

701
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:41,980
Yes.

702
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,980
Why don't you believe me?

703
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,980
I can do it myself.

704
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,980
Then, I will wait for your good news.

705
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,980
Don't be afraid.

706
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:06,980
Don't be afraid.

707
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,980
Don't be afraid.

708
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,980
Thank you.

709
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,980
The exam is a long-term project.

710
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:38,980
The country has 923 million people to participate.

711
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,980
The number of people is higher than the previous year.

712
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,980
The rain is pouring.

713
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,980
The road is not long.

714
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,980
The students are going to the exam early.

715
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:48,980
They will be back safely.

716
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:50,980
The data from the Ministry of Rural Affairs shows

717
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:53,980
that the weather is going to continue this time.

718
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,980
The Faregate exam is starting now.

719
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,980
Assassination eats food and demotivates poorly.

720
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,980
You now have 4 students.

721
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,800

and that you are zdefinite.

723

When you come back to the game, you must calm down a little bit.

724
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,740
After a while, you must check the content of the game.

725
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,380
Okay.

726
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,900
The citizen is in the final.

727
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,260
The gun is not at the right time.

728
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,700
The sky is about to fall.

729
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:24,460
The light is coming.

730
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,380
The next person will show his own face.

731
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:27,500
Let's hold on.

732
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,500
You are the last light.

733
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,380
Get ready.

734
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,740

The test bags and the card bags are sealed.

744
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:48,000

It is also the main activity of our class

752
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:03,640

on the other side too

756
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:16,160
If most of the pores are stopped

757
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:25,480
In this car has 100 knowledges for the crime of whatever free- nuevas cable.

758
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:40,440
Five-hour-long hyperflexion,

759
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,440
What's the big deal?

760
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,440
The car was stolen.

761
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,440
Steal?

762
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,440
Who stole it?

763
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,440
The killer is still here.

764
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,440
Don't you have a car?

765
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:58,440
Unless you know the person who stole the car.

766
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,440
Why should I steal the old car?

767
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,440
I have to leave work tomorrow morning.

768
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,440
Don't look at me.

769
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,440
I'm going to sleep.

770
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,440
Hello.

771
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,440
We are brothers.

772
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,440
Brothers listen to me.

773
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,440
I asked you to do a pre-trial examination.

774
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,440
You can do it in the front seat.

775
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,440
Will the assistant director get married?

776
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,440
You're fine.

777
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,440
They asked you what you can do.

778
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,440
He's really dead.

779
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,440
Why are you laughing?

780
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,440
I'm not laughing.

781
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,440
I haven't found me in the future.

782
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,440
That day?

783
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,440
It's not my business.

784
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,440
They have lost control of me.

785
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,440
If I don't follow them,

786
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,440
they will kill me.

787
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,440
Chen Jian is a fool.

788
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,440
Why do you say it's Chen Jian?

789
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,440
Because you've been bullying him.

790
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,440
Who is bullying him?

791
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,440
I'm scared to death.

792
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,440
Don't cry.

793
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,440
You're pregnant, right?

794
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,440
Don't cry.

795
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,440
Don't cry.

796
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,440
I'm not crying.

797
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,440
Are you okay?

798
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,440
Why are you crying?

799
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,440
Don't cry.

800
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,440
Don't cry.

801
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,440
Don't cry.

802
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,440
Don't cry.

803
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,440
Don't cry.

804
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,440
I've seen your video.

805
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,440
Why didn't you report it?

806
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,440
I thought you wanted to take the exam.

807
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,440
Didn't you report it before?

808
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,440
I can talk about it after the exam.

809
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,440
I have two more exams to go.

810
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,440
No.

811
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,440
I have to take you to the hospital.

812
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,440
Chen Jian.

813
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,440
You're a suspect.

814
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,440
Chen Jian.

815
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,440
You're a suspect.

816
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,440
Our policy is to make the public clear.

817
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,440
Do you understand?

818
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,440
Talk.

819
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,440
I understand.

820
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,440
I'm sorry.

821
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,440
I'm sorry.

822
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,440
I'm sorry.

823
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,440
I'm sorry.

824
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,440
I'm sorry.

825
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,440
I'm sorry.

826
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,440
I understand.

827
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,440
Do you know your mom

828
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,440
will be back

829
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:33,440
after that?

830
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,440
No.

831
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,440
Then you don't have any impression of her?

832
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,440
Why didn't you report it after the video?

833
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,440
I told you.

834
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,440
I want to take the exam.

835
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,440
Really?

836
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,440
You can't report it

837
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,440
after you've been taken.

838
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,440
You can't report it.

839
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,440
You're being bullied by them.

840
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,440
Can you turn around like this?

841
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,440
When was the last time you met her?

842
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,440
After that incident,

843
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,440
I didn't see her again.

844
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,440
But what should I do?

845
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,440
If we didn't ask you,

846
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,440
you don't need to talk.

847
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,440
Do you understand?

848
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,440
I understand.

849
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,440
It's the 31st of May.

850
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,440
Where are you?

851
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,440
I'm at home.

852
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,440
I'm at home every day.

853
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,440
Where's the witness?

854
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,440
It's okay.

855
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,440
We can go to the neighbor's office.

856
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,440
Hello.

857
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,440
It's over.

858
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,440
How is she?

859
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,440
She's not at the factory now.

860
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:07,440
But we don't have any other evidence

861
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,440
except for the motive.

862
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:11,440
Or we can let her go.

863
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,440
She'll be in the college tomorrow.

864
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,440
Lei, wait.

865
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,440
I think her reaction is not right.

866
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,440
What do you mean?

867
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,440
She's making a big fuss.

868
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,440
I think you're in a serious

869
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,440
situation with emotion.

870
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:23,440
Your judgment is very serious.

871
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,440
How can Fang Yongkang explain this?

872
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,440
Chen Nian is so timid.

873
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,440
How can he move his body

874
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,440
and bury it?

875
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,440
What's the attitude?

876
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,440
It's possible to have a common sense.

877
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,440
What's wrong with you today?

878
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,440
You're so unprofessional.

879
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,440
Enough.

880
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,440
Can you two be more intimate?

881
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,440
There's a girl in the police station.

882
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,440
She said she saw the most annoying face

883
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,440
in the park.

884
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,440
She's probably close to her age.

885
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,440
Wang Li,

886
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,440
this girl's emotions are a bit...

887
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,440
Let Chen Nian go back first.

888
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,440
I'll keep an eye on her.

889
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,440
I'm sorry.

890
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,440
What are you thinking about?

891
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:23,440
Conversation 5.

892
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,440
Have you decided to go on vacation?

893
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,440
Yeah.

894
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:31,440
I'm going to spend two weeks in South Africa.

895
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,440
The exam is over.

896
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,440
The exam is over.

897
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,440
Please stop the exam.

898
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,440
Please put the answer card

899
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,440
on the paper.

900
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,440
The whole question is answered.

901
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,440
Please take the paper

902
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,440
and the exam paper.

903
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,440
Please.

904
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:45,440
The police is following me.

905
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,440
Can't you let them find out we're together?

906
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,440
Han Qiu Min.

907
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,440
It's time.

908
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:03,440
Hurry up, Han Qiu Min.

909
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,440
I followed you and harassed you.

910
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,440
I want to keep my future,

911
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,440
but I killed her.

912
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,440
No, I didn't.

913
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,440
I'm right.

914
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,440
I'm right.

915
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,440
They're catching me.

916
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,440
I'll kill you.

917
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:25,440
Chen Nian.

918
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,440
Look at me.

919
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,440
See it clearly.

920
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,440
I'm not a person.

921
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,440
I have no brain,

922
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:37,440
I have no money,

923
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,440
and I have no future.

924
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,440
But I like someone.

925
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,440
I want to give her the best ending.

926
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,440
I won't leave you.

927
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,440
I'm not mature.

928
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,440
I won't be afraid of the sun.

929
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,440
When you graduate from college,

930
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,440
I'll be out.

931
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,440
Anyway, I won't leave.

932
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,440
I won't lose

933
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:17,440
if I'm the only one.

934
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,440
You go first.

935
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,440
You're still in the dark.

936
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,440
Chen Nian.

937
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,440
After you grow up,

938
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:41,440
you'll be older, right?

939
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:45,440
No.

940
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,440
Don't run.

941
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:03,440
You're still in my way.

942
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,440
I'm not a person.

943
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,440
I'm not a person.

944
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,440
Chen Nian.

945
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,440
Take him away.

946
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,440
I'm not a person.

947
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,440
I'm not a person.

948
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,440
I'm not a person.

949
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,440
I'm not a person.

950
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,440
I'm not a person.

951
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,440
I'm not a person.

952
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,440
I'm not a person.

953
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,440
I'm not a person.

954
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:30,440
I'm not a person.

955
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,440
I'm not a person.

956
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,440
I'm not a person.

957
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,440
I'm not a person.

958
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,440
I'm not a person.

959
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,440
I'm not a person.

960
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,440
I'm not a person.

961
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,440
I'm not a person.

962
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,440
I'm not a person.

963
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,440
Lots of shit rounds.

964
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:55,440
Help!

965
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,500
It was you who bomb made

966
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,440
by the power of以前 and Coll both hands.

967
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:11,440
Do you want to check it out?

968
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,440
I came to the police station last time,

969
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,440
and got caught by you.

970
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,440
I just let it go.

971
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,440
I didn't mean to find you a member.

972
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,440
I don't understand.

973
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,440
You're quite energetic.

974
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,440
There should be a girl who likes you.

975
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,440
Why did you do this?

976
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,440
Guess what, Brother Beihong.

977
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,440
Guess right, I said.

978
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,440
Shut up!

979
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,440
I don't have time to talk to you.

980
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,440
I don't ask anything.

981
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,440
Just say whatever you want.

982
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,440
Tell me everything about the criminal.

983
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,440
I told him just now.

984
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,440
He's gone.

985
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,440
Let me tell you.

986
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,440
What we're talking about is the evidence.

987
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:52,440
Then go find the evidence.

988
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,440
Anyway, I've already told you.

989
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,440
If Li Li Fang sees you like this,

990
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,440
what will she do?

991
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,440
If you open me to refugees,

992
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,440
who will we thank?

993
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,440
There's no place for us.

994
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,440
At the bottom line,

995
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,440
we didn't have to go for the mistrust.

996
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:26,440
I want to give you a chance to get rid of the past.

997
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:33,440
We've sent someone to find your mother.

998
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,440
Do you believe in her?

999
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,440
You don't want to know how she's doing now?

1000
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,440
Are you willing to say that you love her?

1001
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,440
Do you still want to be honest with me?

1002
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,440
How's your son?

1003
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,440
He's a good son.

1004
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,440
Have you seen his daughter?

1005
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:15,440
He's been killed for her.

1006
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:21,440
I've already told you that we've seen her.

1007
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,440
You're the one who's been in her.

1008
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:29,440
Liu Beishan, why did you kill Wei Lan?

1009
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,440
I'm fine.

1010
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:58,440
I'm fine.

1011
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,440
You're trying to make me feel better.

1012
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:06,440
If you hurt me, I'll just push you away.

1013
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,440
I'll hang up no matter what.

1014
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,440
I'm sorry.

1015
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,440
I'm sorry.

1016
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,440
I've already confessed my fault.

1017
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,440
I've deleted the video.

1018
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,440
I can't let them hear it.

1019
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,440
I'm sorry.

1020
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,440
I'm sorry.

1021
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,440
I'm sorry.

1022
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,440
I'm sorry.

1023
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,440
I'm sorry.

1024
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,440
I'm sorry.

1025
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,440
I'm sorry.

1026
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,440
I'm sorry.

1027
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,440
I'm sorry.

1028
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,440
I'm sorry.

1029
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:50,440
I'm sorry.

1030
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,440
I can't let them hear it.

1031
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,440
Look.

1032
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,440
What do you want?

1033
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,440
Please don't give up.

1034
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,440
How much money do you want?

1035
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,440
I can give you as much as you want.

1036
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,440
Tell me.

1037
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,440
Tell me.

1038
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,440
I'm sorry.

1039
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,440
I can't let you take pictures of me.

1040
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,440
Who are you?

1041
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,440
You hit me.

1042
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,440
Don't touch my things.

1043
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:30,440
I'm really not a good person.

1044
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:32,440
My dad has already done this.

1045
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,440
He didn't tell me anything.

1046
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,440
I don't want to hear it.

1047
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,440
You don't have to forgive me.

1048
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,440
You just have to pay for it.

1049
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,440
I'm sorry.

1050
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,440
I'm sorry.

1051
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,440
I'm sorry.

1052
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,440
Please forgive me.

1053
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,440
I promise you everything.

1054
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,440
I'm sorry.

1055
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:55,440
I'm really not a good person.

1056
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,440
I don't want to see you again.

1057
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,440
I understand.

1058
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,440
Wait.

1059
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,440
Don't you want to see me again?

1060
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:30,440
Let's not be together.

1061
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,440
You want to take pictures of me.

1062
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:34,440
I want to take pictures of Beida.

1063
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:36,440
What about you?

1064
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,440
You can forget it if you don't want to.

1065
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:45,440
But if we have a normal result, it's a good result.

1066
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,440
It's a pity.

1067
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,440
We can be friends.

1068
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:52,440
Luo Ting is a little silly.

1069
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,440
Xu Miao You is a double-sided card.

1070
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:56,440
You are really good.

1071
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,440
My mom is right.

1072
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,440
Who doesn't have a good person to be friends with?

1073
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:02,440
This life is too easy.

1074
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,440
I've made a video for you.

1075
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,440
You can leave it like this.

1076
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:08,440
Just pretend nothing has happened.

1077
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:10,440
The most important thing is to live under the current situation.

1078
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,440
Are you sure you don't want money?

1079
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,440
I'm more at ease if you take money.

1080
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,440
You can also help your mom pay the debt.

1081
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,440
So you don't have to hide from the people you can't see.

1082
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,440
Say it.

1083
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,440
You've never met Liu Beishan before.

1084
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:06,440
But some of your classmates saw him following you.

1085
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:08,440
Did you have a bad feeling?

1086
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,440
No.

1087
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:17,440
He just wanted to protect him.

1088
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,440
He is a brother to everyone.

1089
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:31,440
Xiaoli.

1090
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,440
Help me find the surveillance footage of Chen Nian on the way to school.

1091
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,440
Put it on the way to the meeting room.

1092
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,440
Put it on the way.

1093
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:54,440
What do you want?

1094
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,440
To study, to take exams, to go to school.

1095
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,440
To find the smartest person to be with.

1096
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:02,440
To find the answer.

1097
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,440
If possible,

1098
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,440
protect Senior Sister.

1099
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,440
Can you do it?

1100
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:12,440
I want to try.

1101
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:26,440
That's enough.

1102
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,440
You protect Senior Sister.

1103
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,440
I protect you.

1104
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,440
I protect you.

1105
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,440
You can talk to them first.

1106
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,440
You can talk to them.

1107
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,440
You can talk to them.

1108
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:59,440
You can see clearly the camera is open.

1109
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,440
It's good.

1110
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:05,440
Renren, which one is the future?

1111
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:11,440
I can't see.

1112
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,440
Why is the one in the middle so fast?

1113
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,440
Because I'm evil.

1114
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,440
You're all evil.

1115
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,440
Actually, you know that's the future.

1116
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,440
I don't know.

1117
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,440
Why do you have to show me this?

1118
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,440
Is it because you've seen the body?

1119
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,440
So you know what kind of clothes he wears when he dies?

1120
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,440
I'm just telling you.

1121
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,440
I'm not a bad person.

1122
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,440
I'm just in the next room.

1123
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:40,440
We're talking to him at the same time.

1124
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:44,440
So is being bullied my fault?

1125
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,440
I pity your behavior.

1126
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,440
But if you can trust the adults more,

1127
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:52,440
we'll definitely help you.

1128
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,440
Who can help me?

1129
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,440
If my video is good,

1130
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,440
and I'm watching the people,

1131
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:01,440
I'll ask them why you're the only one being picked up.

1132
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,440
They'll be fine.

1133
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,440
You think you can only help yourself.

1134
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:09,440
So you're looking for the future and trying to revenge him?

1135
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:16,440
In your eyes, revenge is normal.

1136
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:19,440
It's hard for us to bear it.

1137
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,440
We only want to be highly respected.

1138
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,440
Is this wrong?

1139
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:28,440
If this is the case,

1140
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:31,440
don't worry about your baby.

1141
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:38,440
Let me get the mask.

1142
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,440
You're Chen Jian's friend.

1143
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,440
I'm his friend too.

1144
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,440
I want to help him too.

1145
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,440
But why?

1146
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,440
You're too weak.

1147
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:04,440
You think you're a good planer.

1148
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,440
You're a fool.

1149
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:08,440
Do you think you're a fool?

1150
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,440
Even if you die,

1151
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,440
you can't take the risk of Chen Jian's life.

1152
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,440
I'll tell you what.

1153
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,440
Now, only we two...

1154
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:20,440
tell me the situation.

1155
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,440
I'll think about how to explain it.

1156
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,440
But Mr. Zong...

1157
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,440
Do you think you can cover the family?

1158
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,440
What do we do with jars?

1159
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,440
I said,

1160
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,440
I'll listen to you.

1161
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,440
But are you afraid?

1162
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,440
He works in a confederation

1163
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,440
to follow those same agents who say

1164
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,440
they're his enemies?

1165
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,840
Mr. Zong already

1166
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,840
You know Chen Jian.

1167
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:55,840
He was attacked by 70.

1168
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,840
You killed him.

1169
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:00,840
But you are still a little bit brainless.

1170
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,840
Today is Chen Jian's initiative to get in.

1171
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,840
Do you want to know what he said?

1172
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:23,840
Here.

1173
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:30,840
Thank you.

1174
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,840
It's okay if you don't confess.

1175
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:42,840
Is Chen Jian a good person?

1176
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:44,840
Chen Jian.

1177
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,840
Do you know how much this world has?

1178
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:48,840
You can hold it, but he can't bear it.

1179
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,840
He's the one who's going to get you.

1180
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:51,840
Do you know the criminal?

1181
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,840
Do you know how to live in prison?

1182
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,840
Everyone will unite to make him.

1183
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:00,840
No matter how much you want to be a person,

1184
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:01,840
whether you want to be a person,

1185
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:02,840
or sacrifice yourself,

1186
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:03,840
you should ask yourself first.

1187
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:05,840
Can someone else bear it?

1188
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:08,840
Unless this is what you want.

1189
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,840
You go to heaven.

1190
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,840
Let others go to hell.

1191
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:18,840
You said

1192
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:20,840
I let others apologize for me.

1193
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,840
And then someone else kicked me out of prison.

1194
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:23,840
Who else?

1195
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,840
You said no matter how much I want to be a person,

1196
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,840
no one else can stand it.

1197
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,840
Who else?

1198
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:32,840
Now everyone is going to get it.

1199
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,840
The test is going to help.

1200
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,840
Who can really help me?

1201
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:40,840
Why do you say I'm helping him?

1202
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,840
I don't care what I'm doing.

1203
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:45,840
I'll say it again.

1204
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:47,840
Don't act anymore.

1205
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:49,840
I didn't let anyone apologize.

1206
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:51,840
I'm not stupid.

1207
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,840
It has nothing to do with me.

1208
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,840
I don't know anyone other than

1209
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:57,840
the person who I've ever met.

1210
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,840
I've never met anyone like Liu Beishan.

1211
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,840
Do you want to be a criminal again?

1212
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:17,840
Do you want to be a criminal again?

1213
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:21,840
I just want a job,

1214
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,840
One job is around the end of life.

1215
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,840
I don't want that much money.

1216
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:43,840
OK, OK.

1217
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:45,840
Her business.

1218
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:49,840
OK.

1219
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:51,840
You're lying.

1220
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,840
You're lying all the time.

1221
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:55,840
I'll give you the proof.

1222
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,840
I'll never see him again.

1223
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:57,840
Have you ever thought about it?

1224
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:03,840
I don't know him.

1225
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:07,840
Do you want us to know each other now?

1226
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:12,840
Cheng Yan!

1227
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:13,840
Tell me, Cheng Yan!

1228
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:14,840
Cheng Yan!

1229
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:15,840
What are you doing?

1230
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:16,840
What are you doing?

1231
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:17,840
What are you doing?

1232
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:18,840
What are you doing?

1233
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:19,840
What are you doing?

1234
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,840
What are you doing?

1235
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:21,840
Cheng Yan!

1236
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,840
Get closer to Zheng Yan!

1237
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,840
Do you really know what you're doing?

1238
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:26,840
Cheng Yan!

1239
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:27,840
Listen to me!

1240
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:28,840
Cheng Yan!

1241
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:29,840
Get closer to Zheng Yan!

1242
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:30,840
Trust me, okay?

1243
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:31,840
Cheng Yan!

1244
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:54,840
Aるmpance

1245
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:16,840
Didn't you always miss someone else?

1246
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:20,840
Why do we have to prove that he killed the future?

1247
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:25,840
If someone really has been blinded for decades,

1248
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:28,840
then he will be dead in this life.

1249
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:33,840
But no one will be guilty of being a murderer for another person.

1250
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:34,840
You and I won't.

1251
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,840
But they are still young.

1252
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:18,840
The future is a dream.

1253
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:22,840
The future is a dream.

1254
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,840
The future is a dream.

1255
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:28,840
The future is a dream.

1256
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,840
The future is a dream.

1257
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:34,840
The future is a dream.

1258
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,840
The future is a dream.

1259
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,840
The future is a dream.

1260
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:43,840
The future is a dream.

1261
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,840
The future is a dream.

1262
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:57,840
What's wrong?

1263
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1264
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:03,840
I don't mind.

1265
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:06,840
It's not as simple as you think.

1266
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:08,840
You should go first.

1267
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:10,840
I'll be behind you.

1268
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:14,840
What are you doing behind me?

1269
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:16,840
Nothing.

1270
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1271
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1272
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1273
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1274
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1275
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:00,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1276
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1277
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1278
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1279
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,840
I'm not good enough to see anyone else.

1280
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:14,840
I'm not.

1281
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:21,840
I knew it.

1282
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:23,840
500 percent is not...

1283
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:28,840
only 45 percent is not...

1284
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:29,840
but all the work.

1285
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:32,840
I've closed 500 percent.

1286
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:36,840
I've solved all the drawings.

1287
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:38,840
I'm not good enough.

1288
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:41,840
Usually,

1289
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,840
Mom, I love you.

1290
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,840
I love you.

1291
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,840
Let's go for dinner.

1292
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,840
Don't be in a daze. I'll go check.

1293
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:23,840
Hello, Auntie.

1294
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,840
Hello.

1295
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:32,840
I miss you so much.

1296
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:40,840
You're free. How do you feel?

1297
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:44,840
I mean, I feel like I'm becoming a gentleman.

1298
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:46,840
How do you feel?

1299
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:50,840
You don't want to talk to me anymore?

1300
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,840
I understand.

1301
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,840
I thought you were very normal to me.

1302
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:58,840
Because of that, I was also punished by the organization.

1303
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:07,840
Okay, I'm leaving.

1304
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,840
You go to Beijing and I'll come to see you off.

1305
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,840
By the way, I forgot to tell you that

1306
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:30,840
a few days ago, the police in the north of the city were sentenced to death.

1307
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:37,840
Due to the criminal and criminal offences,

1308
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:39,840
and the case against the organization,

1309
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,840
the court soon declared that it was a crime.

1310
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,840
Didn't he still not be sentenced?

1311
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:46,840
He lied to me.

1312
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,840
The city has been sentenced to death.

1313
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:52,840
Even if the person is sentenced to death,

1314
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:54,840
he will still be punished by the law.

1315
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:11,840
What?

1316
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,840
Get out! Get out!

1317
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:16,840
Why?

1318
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,840
Why don't you let us go?

1319
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:20,840
We can't even go to the police station.

1320
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,840
We can't even go to the police station.

1321
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:24,840
Why?

1322
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,840
Why do you have to go?

1323
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:29,840
Get out!

1324
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:41,840
I'm sorry, I lied to you.

1325
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,840
He hasn't come out yet.

1326
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:44,840
Then he must be a few decades old.

1327
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:45,840
If it's you,

1328
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:46,840
the police will come out.

1329
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,840
You can hate me forever.

1330
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,840
But I really do it for your good.

1331
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:10,840
I'm sorry.

1332
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:40,840
Don't cry.

1333
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:41,840
Someone is coming to see you.

1334
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:10,840
I'm sorry.

1335
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:40,840
I'm sorry.

1336
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:12,640
We pay the bonus of exaggerated pay rate.

I'm sorry.

1356
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:15,840
I'm sorry.

1357
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:17,840
I'm sorry.

1358
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,840
I'm sorry.

1359
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,840
I'm sorry.

1360
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,840
I'm sorry.

1361
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,840
I'm sorry.

1362
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,840

I'm sorry.

1371
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,840
I'm sorry.

1372
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,840
I'm sorry.

1373
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,840
I'm sorry.

1374
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,840
I'm sorry.

1375
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,840
I'm sorry.

1376
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,840
I'm sorry.

1377
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,840
I'm sorry.

1378
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,840
I'm sorry.

1379
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,840
I'm sorry.

1380
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,840
I'm sorry.

1381
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:06,840
I'm sorry.

1382
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:08,840
I'm sorry.

1383
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:10,840
I'm sorry.

1384
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:12,840
I'm sorry.

1385
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,840
When you get the merchandise,

1386
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:18,840
people will hear it.

1387
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:20,840
Someone will get to see it.

1388
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:23,840
It's not going to be extinguishing,

1389
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,840
it's all good.

1390
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:27,840
I don't know what to face.

1391
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,840
We will bring her back.

1392
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,840
We...

1393
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,660
Okay, okay.

1394
02:03:34,180 --> 02:03:37,460
Deng Ren's gonna find out.

1395
02:03:37,540 --> 02:03:39,460
Yeah.

1396
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:41,560
Wash the drei.

1397
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:43,760
Just clean it up.

1398
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:56,800
Don't pick up, I said don't pick it up.

1399
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,560
I did my littleunknown.

1400
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:02,760
They'd been together, one after the other,

1401
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:06,420
even if they got over those hate comments.

1402
02:04:06,420 --> 02:04:09,000
I decided the film was the sameal

1403
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,080
with a different deeper Vorac.

1404
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:14,160
from the beginning till the end.

1405
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:16,480
We really only knew the upsides.

1406
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,720
Now when you take a look at that,

1407
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:21,760
it looks like there's a new identity.

1408
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:25,280
From the way you looked.

1409
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,280
What?

1410
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:29,280
A letter from 20 years ago.

1411
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:41,280
Are you afraid?

1412
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,280
I'm afraid.

1413
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,280
I still have a little bit of fear.

1414
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,280
Do you?

1415
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:54,280
You have a little bit of fear.

1416
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:58,280
But I'm not afraid now.

1417
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:07,280
If I come back,

1418
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,280
will you do that?

1419
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:20,280
What about you?

1420
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:24,280
I don't have a partner.

1421
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,280
And...

1422
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:33,280
I don't want to have such a partner.

1423
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:53,280
I'm afraid.

1424
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,280
I'm afraid.

1425
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:53,280
I'm afraid.

1426
02:07:51,280 --> 02:08:12,280
Is there any person who knows the difference between the two of us?

1427
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:16,280
Which one knows?

1428
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:18,280
WOS is the meaning of the past.

1429
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:25,280
其实两者都是曾经的意思,但不同之处,如果用us to be的话,就有一种失去乐园的感叹。

1430
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:30,280
大家都记住了吗?那我们一起再来读一遍吧。

1431
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:33,280
This used to be our playground.

1432
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:37,280
This used to be our playground.

1433
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:39,280
This was our playground.

1434
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,280
This was our playground.

This is our playground.

This used to be our playground.

1438
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:51,280
This used to be our playground.

1439
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:53,280
This was our playground.

1440
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,280
This was our playground.

1441
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:58,280
This is our playground.

1442
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:00,280
This is our playground.

1443
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:05,280
This used to be our playground.

1444
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:08,280
This was our playground.

1445
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:10,280
This is our playground.

1446
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:15,280
This is our playground.

The first day of the trip

1471
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:41,640
In November 2017, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education

1474
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:24,640
I want to fly

1475
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:32,640
When a moment holds your forgiveness

1476
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:47,640
I want to fly

1477
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:05,640
I've been through the world, I've seen myself step by step being pushed away

1478
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:12,640
I'm still sweating

1479
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:18,640
I've been through the world, I've seen myself step by step being pushed away

1480
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:23,640
I'm just trying to find love

1481
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:29,640
I want to fly

1482
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:35,640
I've lost everything

1483
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:41,640
I've lost everything

1484
02:13:43,640 --> 02:13:49,640
I've been lost again

1485
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:55,640
I've been through the world, I've seen myself step by step being pushed away

1486
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:01,640
I'm still trying to find love

1487
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:08,640
I like your hope

1488
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:14,640
You protect this world

1489
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:19,640
I protect you

1490

You protect me

1495
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:20,640
