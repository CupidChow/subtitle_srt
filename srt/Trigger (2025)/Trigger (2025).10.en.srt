1
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,600
You doing all right?

2
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,436
Huh?

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,063
Not bad, I guess.

4
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,734
By the way,

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,403
what happened back then?

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,697
What?

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,576
You said your mom passed away.

8
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,959
Someone broke into our house.

9
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,840
Everyone in my family was killed
except me.

10
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,386
If my brother were still alive…

11
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,060
he'd probably be about your age.

12
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,650
Ever thought about getting revenge?

13
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,490
You could've found him if you wanted.

14
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,326
Why didn't you just find him
and go "bang"?

15
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,620
Shoot him dead?

16
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,163
Forget it.

17
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,795
So you're saying
you're better than me now?

18
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,837
Is that it?

19
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,257
Him being brought to justice by the law
was enough for you?

20
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,509
Because you're a cop?

21
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,890
People don't change that easily.

22
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,936
The bastards who ripped out my eye

23
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,771
would've ripped out someone else's,

24
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,398
even if it hadn't been mine.

25
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,484
If taking revenge ruins my life…

26
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,695
is it worth it?

27
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,343
It was all so sudden.

28
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,012
I still can't believe it.

29
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,882
Jake reached out to us.

30
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,466
Why?

31
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:00,471
It seems some people interested
in Korea's situation want to reach out.

32
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,517
Tell him I'll decide
after I meet them myself.

33
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,853
And he was quite worried.

34
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,688
About me?

35
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,690
Or the business?

36
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,453
REPORTER WANG DAE-HYEON

37
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,496
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW

38
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,497
LEE DO IS AWAKE

39
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,882
Thank you for coming.

40
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,886
Years ago,

41
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,557
Do and I were on a mission
in a conflict zone in the Middle East.

42
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,021
Everyone there was armed,
kids and adults alike,

43
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,690
and weapons were piled high
in the streets.

44
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,152
I wondered, "What if guns
became this available in Korea?"

45
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,907
At the time, I thought something like that
could never happen in Korea.

46
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,828
So? How's the gun retrieval going?

47
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,624
Once the investigation shifted
after the shootings by Yu and Jeon,

48
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,168
they began using real couriers.

49
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,089
They seem to have a strong grasp
of the Korean people and the system.

50
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,174
We estimate about 10,000 guns

51
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,760
have been distributed
in the past few days.

52
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:27,225
It probably hit harder because the footage
of you getting shot aired right before.

53
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,602
Seems like fearmongering
really did the trick.

54
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,690
"If you don't want to end up like that,
pick up a gun."

55
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,109
That's the greatest fear

56
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,653
a gun holds.

57
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,862
That's right.

58
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,117
"Now I have to protect myself
with the gun in my hands."

59
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,369
That's probably what they thought.

60
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,128
Sir, I think you should see this.

61
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,090
A GATHERING OF SUPPORTERS
OF GUN OWNERSHIP LEGALIZATION

62
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,551
This has just begun circulating
on social media.

63
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,928
It already has 300,000 views from shares.

64
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:08,850
Yes, Director.

65
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,145
The president is preparing a statement.
He may declare martial law.

66
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,898
If he does, Korea will become
a country ruled by guns once again.

67
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,859
Attention, everybody.

68
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,945
Check who's available
and deploy them right away.

69
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,656
We need to quickly identify
who's organizing this rally.

70
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,034
If it becomes a large rally,
anything could happen.

71
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,118
Understood.

72
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,501
Huh?

73
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,712
What is it?

74
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,590
Look at this.

75
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,383
What is this?

76
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,888
A pro-gun ownership rally?

77
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,307
A GATHERING OF SUPPORTERS
OF GUN OWNERSHIP LEGALIZATION

78
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,769
A gathering at a time like this
can only lead to disaster.

79
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:01,486
In light of unprecedented mass shootings
and untraceable firearm distribution,

80
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,906
some argue that gun ownership
should be allowed in Korea.

81
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,994
Pro-gun protesters have gathered
to express their views to the government.

82
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:10,912
No guns!

83
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,039
Fears of a major clash have risen

84
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,584
as anti-gun protesters hold
a counterrally.

85
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,670
Have any of you ever been shot?

86
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,925
I nearly died
because of some crazy bastard.

87
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,219
We've been living perfectly fine
without guns!

88
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:30,139
With so many guns out there,
who knows what could happen next?

89
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,935
We need to think about our families
and our future!

90
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,978
No guns. Never!

91
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:42,151
-Never!
-Legalize guns!

92
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,829
Hi, Mom.

93
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,914
So-hyeon. Are you still at the hospital?

94
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,249
Yeah.

95
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,668
I'm on night shifts all week.

96
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,585
I see.

97
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,212
And you're doing okay?

98
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,839
Why wouldn't I be?

99
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,134
I heard a lot of people
have been shot lately.

100
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,219
Your hospital must be chaotic as well.

101
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,930
Mom, I gotta get back to work.
Talk to you later.

102
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,390
Sure. Take care.

103
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,127
Officer Jang.

104
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,963
I think I need to go to that rally.

105
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,384
I'll make sure

106
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,804
the captain gets the farewell he deserves.

107
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,641
Thank you.

108
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:14,035
You! Didn't I say I wouldn't take it
if you talked back again?

109
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,953
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,209
You really think you're in a position
to question your shifts?

111
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,461
Just take the shifts you're given.

112
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,962
You're right. I'm sorry.

113
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,178
Look.

114
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,764
One word to the head nurse from us

115
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,309
and your career's done and dusted.

116
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,062
Think twice before you act up.

117
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,984
If she acts up again, let me know.

118
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,361
She's so annoying.

119
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,488
Today's snack is dakbal!

120
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,114
Same place as last time?

121
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,283
Of course. You don't even have to ask.

122
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,827
Ma'am, you're the best.

123
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,867
Legalizing gun ownership…

124
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,952
NO GUNS!

125
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,580
…could make bulletproof vests as necessary

126
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,125
as masks were during the pandemic.

127
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,460
We want guns!

128
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,714
Legalize it!

129
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,091
Is that really the world
we want to live in?

130
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,260
No guns!

131
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,346
Pro-gun legalization protesters
have exceeded 10,000,

132
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,558
surpassing police estimates,
with numbers still rising.

133
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,893
As police prepare for all contingencies,

134
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,771
they're also working
to identify those behind the protest.

135
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,025
…fully mobilized police
over a potential large-scale clash…

136
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,362
Police suspect Blue Brown
organized protesters via social media.

137
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,532
They are searching
for the group's base of operations

138
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,868
but have reportedly found no major leads.

139
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,628
NO CALLER ID

140
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,315
Did you enjoy your tour of hell?

141
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,654
Why me, of all people?

142
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,284
At first,

143
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,328
just curiosity?

144
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,997
I really had

145
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,500
high expectations

146
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,711
for that gosiwon guy.

147
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,587
It's not mandatory per se,

148
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,590
but rules are made
for everyone to follow, so--

149
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,635
Hey, why the hell do you care?

150
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,011
I'm fine.

151
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,263
People are looking.

152
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,896
But then a police officer
showed up out of nowhere

153
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,691
and stopped him.

154
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,945
So I did some digging into that officer…

155
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,988
CONFIDENTIAL
TOP SECRET

156
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,658
…and it turns out he shot
countless people dead in the past.

157
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,078
Now he says he'll never pick one up again.

158
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,496
Funny, isn't it?

159
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,126
Is that face of yours real?

160
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,587
Or is it all fake?

161
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,090
That's when
something interesting struck me.

162
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,845
"If you picked up a gun again,

163
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,306
how would it change you?"

164
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,976
Why did it have to be me?

165
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,936
We have a few things in common.

166
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,731
A rough childhood,

167
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,609
an obsession with revenge,

168
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,237
and the choice to pick up a gun for it.

169
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,366
Don't justify your actions
like there's some philosophy behind them.

170
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,330
You're nothing more
than a third-rate peddler who profits…

171
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,792
by inciting fear.

172
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,549
What difference does it make to me now

173
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,093
if I sell one more gun?

174
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,554
I'm simply curious

175
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,933
what would happen

176
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,103
if guns became widely available
in this country.

177
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,360
There were far more people

178
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,987
who wanted guns than I expected.

179
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,701
In the end, a gun was the only way

180
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:53,207
they could release
their pent-up resentment and frustration.

181
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,840
I don't need anything right now.

182
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,219
Excuse me.
It's been bothering me for a while.

183
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,099
That was also true for the captain,
who had been like a father to you.

184
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,021
And the same for Kyeong-suk.

185
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,654
In the end, it was a gun…

186
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,573
Thank you.

187
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,741
…that saved them.

188
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,005
In a world
where the strong devour the weak,

189
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,510
it's not your cheap sympathy
that will protect them.

190
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,764
The answer is a gun
that lets them enforce their own justice.

191
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,061
That's why I want to live
in a utopia of equality

192
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,315
where everyone owns a gun.

193
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,608
That's all I want.

194
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,984
No.

195
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,445
There's no such utopia.

196
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,033
That is nothing but a hell…

197
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,870
where people kill and get killed.

198
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,583
What a shame.

199
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,882
I thought you, of all people…

200
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,470
would understand me.

201
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,681
Then,

202
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,892
shall we see

203
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,019
who's right?

204
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,799
What are you doing?

205
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,099
I'll show you the world I want to see.

206
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,810
Just sit back and watch.

207
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,224
-What's with that truck?
-What's going on?

208
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,073
The guns are right in front of you.
What are you waiting for?

209
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,367
Hurry up and take them.

210
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,327
They're guns!

211
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,412
They are guns!

212
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,628
Guns! Hurry!

213
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,938
Guns are being distributed
from the truck in the square.

214
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,523
Civilians are swarming in.

215
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,100
You motherfucker!

216
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,186
Request SOU reinforcements.

217
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,104
Yes, sir.

218
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,757
Breaking news.

219
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,385
A sudden, large-scale distribution
of firearms occurred

220
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,929
at today's pro-gun ownership rally.

221
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:04,726
As citizens scrambled and collided,
the rally quickly descended into chaos.

222
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,271
Police have cordoned off the area

223
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,857
due to concerns
about a possible shooting at the square

224
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,361
and have pledged to confiscate
all guns distributed at the scene.

225
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,614
We will provide further updates
as things develop.

226
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,248
Get it all on camera.
Don't miss a single moment.

227
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,333
Yes, sir.

228
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,298
Move!

229
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,304
Give me that!

230
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,602
What else can we do when shootings happen
almost every other day?

231
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,646
Put the gun down, or I'll shoot.

232
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,024
I just want to protect my family
since the government won't.

233
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,692
Is that wrong?

234
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,320
-No. You can't.
-Why not?

235
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,656
I was minding my own business
and almost got shot!

236
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,741
Fuck it! I don't want to die, so I'm--

237
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,535
Let go! Get your hands off me!

238
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,420
FIREARMS DISTRIBUTED AT RALLY

FIREARMS DISTRIBUTED AT RALLY
SCENE IN PANIC

240
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:20,988
UNEXPECTED FIREARM DISTRIBUTION
SPARKS CHAOS AT RALLY

241
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,567
You see that, Lee Do?

242
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,445
If, as you say,

243
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,990
a world where everyone carries a gun
is truly hell,

244
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,786
then why do so many people want one?

245
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,166
What could possibly

246
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,544
make them pick up a gun?

247
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,273
It was this world

248
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,902
that made the people angry.

249
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,614
All I did

250
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,075
was hand them a gun.

251
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,413
It's up to them

252
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,499
whether they pull the trigger.

253
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,057
Lee Do.

254
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,564
If a gunshot went off right here and now,

255
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,275
what would happen to these people?

256
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,861
Is this what you wanted?

257
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,532
No.

258
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,951
What I want…

259
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,455
is a single gunshot.

260
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,382
A single gunshot

261
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,343
that will make these people

262
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,555
start shooting at each other.

263
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:45,358
Wouldn't pulling a 5-millimeter trigger
in pursuit of revenge

264
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,778
spread fear in the minds of many?

265
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,073
Out of fear
that they might die without a gun,

266
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,993
everyone will rush to get one.

267
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,913
And a society like that

268
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,207
will soon be destroyed.

269
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,932
Don't shoot!

270
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,250
Don't come any closer!

271
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,751
Move!

272
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,802
Mom!

273
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,217
Help me, please!

274
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,934
Mommy.

275
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,693
It's okay.

276
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,864
You're safe.

ESCALATING VIOLENCE AT RALLY

279
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,722
Tragically, there has been
yet another incident.

280
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,309
The mass shooting at Gyeongin Stadium

281
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,689
has reportedly left
over 70 casualties so far.

282
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,608
The death toll is expected to rise

283
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,778
as many remain in critical condition.

284
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,741
During the mass shooting
at Gyeongin Stadium,

285
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,202
a citizen's brave act
of saving an elementary school child

286
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,079
brought a heartwarming moment.

287
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,585
The citizen risked his life to protect
the child in a dangerous situation.

288
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:17,338
Even amid ongoing gunfire,
he kept the child safe until the very end.

-Yes.

00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,350

Hey, man.

306
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,008
Wow.

307
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,552
The view from here is amazing.

308
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,847
I'll be using this room. Yeah.

309
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,433
What?

310
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,436
Why would you censor my article?

311
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,689
Victim protection, my ass.

312
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,778
Touch my article without asking,
and I'm switching to another network.

313
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,622
Holy shit. What the hell?

314
00:31:55,705 --> 00:32:00,835
Do you have any idea what your article did
to my innocent child's life?

315
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,464
I begged and pleaded with you
to take it down.

316
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,673
Hold on a second.

317
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,425
I wrote the article, so--

318
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,958
With severe blood loss
and widespread cancer,

319
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,461
chances of recovery are low.

320
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,582
Okay.
