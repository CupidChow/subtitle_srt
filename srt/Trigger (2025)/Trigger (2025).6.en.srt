00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,341
THIS EPISODE CONTAINS
GRAPHIC DEPICTIONS OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,926
WHICH SOME VIEWERS MAY FIND DISTURBING.

3
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:25,960
Wait here.

4
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,259
Sir, you wanted to see me?

5
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,136
I did. Take a seat over there.

6
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,638
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,228
Jeong-man.

8
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,360
Hey, Jeong-man,
you fucking son of a bitch.

9
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,779
Are you dealing guns?

10
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,739
No.

11
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,199
Are you sure?

12
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,451
What are you going on about
all of a sudden?

13
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,911
What guns?

14
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,373
You're also confused, right?

15
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,541
I was too.

16
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:09,003
Some pig I know suddenly showed up
and asked if I was dealing guns.

17
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,797
I was fucking speechless.

18
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,467
A pig? He must be out of his mind.

19
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,387
I thought the same,
but then he showed me this crap.

20
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,311
Who is this?

21
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,355
How should I know?

22
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,901
Didn't you ask me the other day
if I knew any of your boys?

23
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,239
I don't know a single one of them,
so I figured I'd ask you.

24
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,950
He's not one of my boys.

25
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,495
Be honest,
or you're gonna regret it later.

26
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,833
Why would I ever lie to you, sir?

27
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,673
So he's not one of your boys?

28
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,301
No.

29
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,721
Okay!

30
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,807
I got fucking scared for no reason.

31
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,226
That pig is a real headache.

32
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,937
All right. You can go now.

33
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,127
He's onto us.

34
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,546
Find the guns as quickly as possible.

35
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,965
Sir, what did that bastard say?

36
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,426
He said he's not one of his.

37
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,552
He said that?

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,306
That bastard. What nerve to lie to you.

39
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,952
-Hey!
-Oh man.

40
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,370
Why's the floor so slippery?

41
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,331
-Sorry to disturb your meal.
-What are you looking at, fuckers?

42
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,667
Hey, hidden cam perv.

43
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,836
Your life is about to go to shit.

44
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,006
Just wait and see.

45
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,681
That fucking asshole.

46
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,061
Hey! Stop what you're doing!

47
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,022
What's going on here?

48
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,524
Well, sir,

49
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,359
the floor was so slippery.

50
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,362
You should be more careful.
Look at this mess.

51
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,446
Are you okay?

52
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,533
Do I look okay to you?

53
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,119
What's with that attitude?
I was just worried, so--

54
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,788
Why, that little…

55
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,206
Hey, you!

56
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,376
Look at that punk. Hey.

57
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,961
Hey, Park Gyu-jin!

58
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,673
What do you think you're doing?
Get back here!

59
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,049
Kim Bae, wait for me!

60
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,551
Here comes the failure.

61
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,905
The more lists we find,
the more new addresses show up.

62
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,533
Do.

63
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,118
Look at this.

64
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,538
I think this is the list's numbering.

65
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,124
That means
there are as many guns as numbers.

66
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,085
How many lists have we collected so far?

67
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,587
Just over 20 pages.

68
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,089
Oh man.

69
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,674
That means they've distributed

70
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,135
at least several hundred firearms
across the country.

71
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,362
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO LOOK FOR THAT ADDRESS LIST?

72
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,418
OF COURSE

73
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,010
TAKE CARE
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU FIND IT

74
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,851
OKAY! CALL ME
IF YOU NEED MOON BAEK'S HELP! I'M BORED

75
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,367
That cop has been investigating you
for the past few days, boss.

76
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,787
-Should we get rid of him quietly?
-Leave him alone.

77
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,623
I need to confirm something.

78
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:56,958
Yes, boss.

79
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,752
I think you need to get going now.

80
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,215
All right, then.

81
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,635
Time to go meet some friends.

82
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,656
Everything is ready.

83
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,353
Hey. I heard you cursed out Seong-jun

84
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,522
and threw a chair too.

85
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,607
So what?

86
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,776
Weren't you scared?

87
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,488
He's going to be more cruel to you now.

88
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,574
You put up with him,
so he keeps giving you shit.

89
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,659
You're incredible.

90
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,748
You pack quite a punch too.

91
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,709
About that…

92
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,462
-I'm sorry. I--
-It's fine.

93
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,590
No one understands you better than I do.

94
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,634
Thanks, Gyu-jin.

95
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,345
What I'm saying is,

96
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,388
if you're frustrated or annoyed,

97
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,307
punch them or curse at them.

98
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,768
Don't just sit there. Do something.

99
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,394
Do you think I could do it?

100
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,355
You son of a bitch!

101
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:48,819
You bastard!

102
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,071
You fucking bastard.

103
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,739
This is so fucking interesting.

104
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,324
Hey, get a good shot.

105
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,791
-Out of my fucking way!
-Move, damn it!

106
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,586
Unbelievable.

107
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,964
Get over here!

108
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,091
You motherfucker!

109
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,346
You fucking bastards!

110
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,849
SHOOTING CAFÉ

111
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,977
-Is that okay?
-No way, seriously!

112
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,713
SHOOTING RANGE SAFETY RULES
DO NOT FIRE AT PEOPLE

113
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,803
A gun!

114
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,555
Get away!

115
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,115
Aren't those BBs?

116
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,617
They're BBs.

117
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,201
It looked like a real gun.

118
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,494
Who is that bastard?

119
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,963
Who did that, damn it?

120
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,747
How dare you neighborhood punks
cause all this trouble?

121
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,210
Hey, who the fuck are you? Huh?

122
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,171
Me?

123
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,465
I'm Moon Baek.

124
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,966
That stings!

125
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,747
-Fuck, he did that all by himself.
-Sick!

126
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,682
Excuse me, just a second.

127
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:09,770
Could you

128
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,940
teach me how to shoot a gun?

129
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,277
Hold your breath.

130
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,821
When your body steadies,

131
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,865
pull the trigger gently.

132
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:27,788
Shoot.

133
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,044
Hey.

134
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,714
I suddenly feel confident for no reason.

135
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,413
Here, take it.

136
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,166
Wanna try shooting?

137
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,127
Me?

138
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,004
Yeah.

139
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,008
I'm home.

140
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,969
-Gyu-jin, you're back.
-Yeah, I'm just gonna rest.

141
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,981
Gyu-jin.

142
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,234
Have some fruit.

143
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,154
Just leave it there.

144
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,162
Are you sick or something?

145
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,667
Let me see your face, please.

146
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,586
Mom, I'm grown up now.
No need to coddle me.

147
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,923
That's right. You're all grown up now.

148
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,384
And without my help.

149
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,182
You've given me everything I need.

150
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,185
You're doing your best.

151
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,022
Thanks for understanding.

152
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,651
By the way, Mom…

153
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,570
Yeah?

154
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,447
When do people get the most upset?

155
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,283
Well, for me,

156
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,035
I get the most upset when you're sick…

157
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,497
or going through a hard time.

158
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,792
I guess all parents feel the same way.

159
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,295
Nothing matters more to them
than their children.

160
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,340
Gu Jeong-man started fetching
the guns from the list.

161
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,134
And Mr. Kim's place?

162
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,971
It seems no one has accessed
the storage room yet.

163
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,224
They're so frustrating.

164
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,102
This isn't it.

165
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,103
INCORRECT PATTERN

166
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,230
Not this either.

167
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,025
Goddamn it!

168
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,445
What good is the phone
without the damn password?

169
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,030
Sorry, sir.

170
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,698
Sorry won't cut it, bastards!

171
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,408
Fucking bastards.

172
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,663
NO CALLER ID

173
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,584
Hello?

174
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,839
Who the hell is this?

175
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,258
Why the hell
are you speaking English to me?

176
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,135
What's the matter, sir?

177
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,569
"Red sticker"?
Hey, find the box with a red sticker.

178
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,572
But every box in here
has a red sticker, sir.

179
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,834
Mr. Kim, that bastard.
What the hell is he hiding in here?

180
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,878
What the fuck is this?

181
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,923
Why is this here?

182
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,842
You found them? The guns?

183
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,265
If you're curious, try shooting yourself.

184
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,564
All the recent shootings in the news
involved guns from that room.

185
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,484
You know,

186
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,363
since you took out Mr. Kim,
the guns are just piling up in there,

187
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,281
and Mr. Kim is gone.

188
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,535
This puts me in a weird spot, you know?

189
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,830
Weirdly enough,

190
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,084
someone is really determined
to find those guns.

191
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,130
Gu Jeong-man?

192
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,214
Gu Jeong-man?

193
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,174
How do you know him?

194
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,804
I don't know what Gu Jeong-man is up to,

195
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,432
but you should really think things over.

196
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,393
Like what you should do

197
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,395
with all those guns.

198
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,107
Hello?

199
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,901
Fucking bastard.

200
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,925
Hey, this is a bet.

201
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,516
Yes, we have secured enough.

202
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,353
We'll get right to it.

203
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,989
Excuse me, gentlemen!

204
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,075
Hello.

205
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,703
Can I just ask you
to remember this one thing, please?

206
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,873
Take a photo
after delivering the package, okay?

207
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:07,169
You need to take a picture
and send it to us

208
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,296
so we can process the payment.

209
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,714
-Is that clear?
-Yes!

210
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,427
Here, this way. Come on.

211
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,932
-No rush.
-Remember the photo.

212
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,018
Yes, good. Here, take these.

213
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,481
The packages are ready.

214
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,483
Are they?

215
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,238
It's great how many delivery options
are available in Korea.

216
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,455
Come home early tonight.

217
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,457
I'll get the meat you like.

218
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,972
I thought you were too old for this.

219
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,474
Now you're sweet
since I said I'd buy you meat?

220
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,019
-See you later.
-All right.

221
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,612
Reporting an update.

222
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,657
The student is now on his way
to school with a gun.

223
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,536
How old were you when you were adopted?

224
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,080
Nine years old.

225
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
Did you find your mom and dad?

226
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,501
Yes.

227
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,420
How were they?

228
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,422
I only watched them from afar.

229
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,093
How come?

230
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,555
I thought I'd be miserable
if they didn't remember me.

231
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,351
I see.

232
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,939
Then…

233
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,484
we should make them remember.

234
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,829
Line 3, 30% of delivery photos received.

235
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,456
Line 2, 30% of photos received.

236
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,833
Line 7, 50% of delivery photos received.

237
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,501
Line 4, 70% of photos received.

238
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,213
All couriers from Gyeongdong
on lines 5 and 7 confirmed.

239
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,797
First photo received.

240
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,507
30% of photos received from Dongin.

241
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,426
60% of photos received from Gyeongseo.

242
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,011
80% received from Gyeongseo.

243
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,097
The gun packages are going out as planned.

244
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,350
We will keep you posted
on further updates.

245
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,434
Okay.

246
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,114
Come on. At least try to look happy
to see me again.

247
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,243
Is Kyeong-suk okay?

248
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,412
Yeah. Thanks to you.

249
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,456
The address list?

250
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,710
Here.

251
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,756
I don't usually trust people,

252
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,592
but I think I can trust you, Officer Lee.

253
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,765
But there's something bothering me.

254
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:08,976
Over here.

255
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,688
There's a high school student on the list.

256
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,984
Shouldn't you check?

257
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,614
Keep watch until Yeong-dong gets here.

258
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,824
Yeah, okay.

259
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,874
Did Yeong-dong die in a ditch
on his way to get bread?

260
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,584
Hey.

261
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,920
Let me bum a smoke.

262
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,047
-Damn it.
-This bastard never has any smokes.

263
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,842
Man, just buy your own, you cheapskate.

264
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,345
What's wrong?

265
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,264
Are you still pissed?

266
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,682
Fuck-gyu, that fucker.

267
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,060
The teacher's watching too closely.
I can't do a thing.

268
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,689
Lie low for now.
One wrong move, and you're fucked.

269
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,483
It's fucking embarrassing, you asshole.

270
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,736
Seriously, who locked the doors?

271
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,154
Goodbye, sir.

272
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,115
-Sir! I need the restroom.
-How are you going to go?

273
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,784
-Try pulling it.
-I said I need the restroom!

274
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,536
What's the problem?

275
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,871
Sir, he did it!

276
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,955
What's this?

277
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,416
-Locked from outside?
-What?

278
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,418
-Did you do this, sir?
-You little punks.

279
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,087
-Who did this?
-Break it down!

280
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,797
Think this is funny?

281
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,932
Hey, Park Gyu-jin.

282
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,894
Class president. What's up?

283
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,855
The homeroom teacher wants to see you.
Go to the faculty room.

284
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,739
How should I fuck that bastard over?

285
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,199
Hey.

286
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,951
How about that?

287
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,912
Shit, that's nasty.

288
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,914
-What is that?
-Damn, that's gross.

289
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,831
Hey.

290
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,958
Go grab Fuck-gyu's bag.

291
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,669
Yes, sir!

292
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:08,970
Hey, Do.

293
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,515
Why is it so hard to reach you?
Where are you?

294
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,808
I'm looking for the guns.

295
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,518
Head to Jeongil High now.

296
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,896
One of their students is on the list.
He has a gun.

297
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,148
Go there now!

298
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,030
Turn around. We're going to Jeongil High.

299
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,120
Hello, this is Officer Lee Do
from Domyeong Station.

300
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,706
We met at a training seminar
on violence prevention.

301
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,874
Yes, hello.

302
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,043
How can I help you?

303
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,170
I'm calling because there's a chance

304
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,673
a Jeongil High student
is involved in my case.

305
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,884
One of our students? What's his name?

306
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,177
I don't know his name,

307
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,887
but I have his number.

308
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,890
Go ahead and give me the number.

309
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,726
It's 010-337-8155.

310
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,644
Did you call me?

311
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,187
Wait a minute.

312
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,147
I understand.

313
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,649
I'll check and call you back
as soon as I can.

314
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,444
Gyu-jin.

315
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,948
I wanted to talk to you,
but something urgent came up.

316
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:10,991
Come back later.

317
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,033
Okay, ma'am.

318
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,243
Sorry about that.

319
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,912
How are things over there, kids?

320
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,789
All the doors here are locked.

321
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,001
As soon as I find out who did this…

322
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:21,960
Sir!

323
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,337
The western entrance
and snack bar are locked.

324
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,841
Sir, could you ask the janitor
to bring us a bolt cutter now?

325
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,801
You fucking bitch. Get over here.

326
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,055
You fucking asshole.
Fuck you, motherfucker.

327
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,432
You son of a bitch.

328
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,809
Goddamn it.

329
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,936
-You motherfucker!
-You son of a bitch!

330
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,523
You fucking bastard.

331
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,109
You motherfucker.

332
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,360
You fucking dick.

333
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,572
Hey, where were you?
Why are you so fucking late?

334
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,490
You little shit!

335
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,532
Fuck you!

336
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,242
Fuck this.

337
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,745
STUDENT RECORDS

338
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,376

Hey, Fuck-gyu!

341
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,311
What's up? Looking for this?

342
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,813
Goddamn it, you little shit.

343
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,191
Were you gonna shoot us with this?

344
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,361
Man, I was wondering
why you've been acting so tough lately.

345
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,656
Because of this damn toy?

346
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,449
It looks real. Kind of scary.

347
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,117
Scary? For fuck's sake.

348
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,870
Hey, you scared of this?

349
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,996
No, go ahead and shoot.

350
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,415
You fucking losers scared of this?

351
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,000
-Hey, you scared?
-Huh?

352
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,378
It's just a BB gun.

353
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,380
You stupid fucking idiot.

354
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,508
Don't shoot.

355
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,592
"Don't shoot."

356
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,641
You're not going anywhere,
fucking asshole.

357
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,271
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed to voicemail…

358
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,939
The phone's still off.

359
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,692
Kids turn in their phones before class.

360
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,277
Can you go faster?

361
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,195
Okay.

362
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,864
Hey.

363
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,285
Hey, you scared? Are you?

364
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,708
This little bitch.
Hey, stand up straight right there.

365
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,170
Don't shoot. You shouldn't shoot that gun.

366
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,590
Hey, hold him tight.

367
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,135
Don't shoot.

368
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,387
Stay still.

369
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,139
Don't shoot!

370
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,182
CLASS 2-1 ADDRESS BOOK

371
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,892
"8-1-5-5…"

372
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,060
NO RESULTS FOUND

373
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,858
Run for it!

374
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,030
What was that?

375
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,949
I didn't even pull the trigger.

376
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,626
This bastard loaded it with steel pellets.

377
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,793
Hey, are you crazy?

378
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,087
Were you trying to fucking kill us?

379
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,965
Yeah, I'm fucking crazy.

380
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,300
You motherfucker.

381
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,053
I'll shoot you with this,
you fucking asshole.

382
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,641
I found it.

383
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,226
"Seo Yeong-dong"?

384
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,645
Run!

385
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,276
I told you to stop.

386
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,539
Going somewhere?

387
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,001
Yeong-dong.

388
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,629
I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry.

389
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,673
I was totally in the wrong.

390
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,758
Don't apologize.

391
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,719
It's not like you.

392
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,514
Please, no.

393
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,974
Mom…

394
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,492
Hey, he's got a gun!

395
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,580
That crazy bastard.

396
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,082
Get inside!

397
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,126
-Hey!
-What is it?

398
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,002
Out of my way!

399
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,422
Get out of my way!

400
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,551
Come on, move!

401
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,927
Hey, don't push so hard!

402
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,262
Get out, damn it.

403
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,555
Get out, for fuck's sake!

404
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,682
-Move!
-What's the holdup?

405
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,106
Hey.

406
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,984
There you are, Gyu-jin.

407
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,579
It's okay.

408
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,582
Nobody can get out.

409
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,925
The doors…

410
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,428
You locked them all?

411
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,972
Yeah.

412
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,141
Take this.

413
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,811
Now, let's go…

414
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,319
kill

415
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,279
all of them.

416
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,633
Move out of the way, motherfuckers!

417
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,551
I said move, fucking asshole!

418
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,595
-Open the door!
-Fucking hell!

419
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,305
-What the fuck?
-Let us out!

420
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,228
Help us!

421
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,408
Move! I said move!

422
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,170
-Over here!
-Help us!

423
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,841
-Please open the door!
-Please help us!

424
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,925
Over here!

425
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:58,273
A FUTURE SOCIETY BUILT ON GOOD CHARACTER

426
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,446
Please open the door!

427
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,115
This one's locked too.

428
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,408
Kids, step back!

429
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,285
Hey, step back!

430
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,008
Moon Baek, out of the way!

431
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,262
Everybody out! Slowly.

432
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,722
-Go!
-Hurry, get out!

433
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,890
-Go!
-Hurry!

434
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,850
Careful!

435
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,060
Huh? Damn it.

436
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,618
Run! Quickly!

437
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,212
-This way. Quickly!
-Get in here!

438
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,048
-In here. Hurry!
-Come on!

439
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,467
Hurry. Close the door quickly!

440
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,177
-Everybody in?
-Block the door!

441
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,553
-Bring the desks!
-Hurry!

442
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,721
Block the door!

443
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,514
Don't close the door! Please!

444
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,442
Fucking get in here already!

445
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,736
Come on, hurry!

446
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,779
Bring more!

447
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,115
Bring more, damn it!

448
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,077
Hurry! Push!

449
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,039
Push!

450
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,256
Come on, hurry!

451
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,343
Hurry!

452
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,448
Fucking hell. Seriously.

453
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,500
Kang Seong-jun!

454
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,255
I know you're here. Come out now.

455
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,847
Kang Seong-jun!
Oh Sang-tae! Hwang Yu-seok!

456
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,891
I told you to come out. I saw you in here!

457
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,898
Crazy son of a bitch.

458
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,653
If you come out,
I'll let everyone else live.

459
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,951
So hurry up and come out.

460
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,122
Shut up, you fuckers.

461
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,083
Wait! Seo Yeong-dong!

462
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,005
It's me, the head teacher.

463
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,799
Can we talk for a moment?

464
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,927
-Now? After everything?
-What?

465
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,388
Sir.

466
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,768
I came to see you several times.

467
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,229
I said I was having a hard time.

468
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,982
That I couldn't take it.

469
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,276
I begged you for help.

470
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,778
Right, Yeong-dong.

471
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,780
I hear you.

472
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,284
I'll handle everything for you,
so why don't you put it down?

473
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,038
You don't seem like the Yeong-dong I know.

474
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,457
Then what am I supposed to be like?

475
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,922
The loser who gets his money stolen
and gets beaten

476
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,049
every day?

477
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,383
No, Yeong-dong.

478
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,595
That's not what I meant. Calm down.

479
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,846
Fuck you!

480
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,933
You ruined my life,
so just shut the fuck up!

481
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,019
Yeong-dong!

482
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,896
Hwang Yu-seok is over here!

483
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:07,980
Shut the fuck up!

484
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,900
He said he'd let everyone live
if you came out, so just go!

485
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,026
Shut the fuck up!

486
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,154
Come out already!

487
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,200
Hwang Yu-seok! Come out here now!

488
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,439
Fucking hell.

489
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,412
Hurry, get out.

490
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,081
-Look after the kids.
-Okay.

491
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,916
Go. Are you okay?

492
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,713
Kang Seong-jun, come out!

493
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,699
Kang Seong-jun.

494
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,809
Is everyone okay?

495
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,811
This is the police.

496
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,231
Kids, are you okay?

497
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,774
Anyone hurt?

498
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,150
-No.
-No.

499
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,027
Everyone seems okay.

500
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,655
-That's a relief.
-Indeed.
