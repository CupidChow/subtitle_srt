1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,584
Hey, careful!

2
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,170
Pull it up!

3
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,533
Seriously.

4
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,951
Are they for real?

5
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,661
Man.

6
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,956
Who does he think he is,
ordering me to come here?

7
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,209
Does he know who I am?

8
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,837
Sir, people tend to be overly suspicious
when making the first deal.

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,048
We should be suspicious of them too.

10
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,509
-Let's be suspicious too.
-Yes, sir.

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,885
Carry more knives.

12
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,640
Sir!

13
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,974
You carry more knives too.

14
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,059
-Knives?
-Yeah.

15
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,228
They want to see you.

16
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,063
How did their faces look?

17
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,940
I couldn't see them.

18
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,983
You couldn't?

19
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,235
No, I couldn't.

20
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,279
Are they fucking ghosts or what?

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,656
Damn it.

22
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,034
-Hey, hide those knives well.
-Yes, sir.

23
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,787
-How many have you got? Two?
-Just one.

24
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,666
-This way, sir.
-Okay.

25
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,713
Fucking hell.

26
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,549
I really can't see anything.

27
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,135
Sir, there's a bag over there.

28
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,678
Shit.

29
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,888
Goddamn it.

30
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,348
What's this?

31
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,018
These are US dollars. What's this for?

32
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,315
Wow.

33
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,777
Hey, I heard

34
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,738
you're looking for distribution channels
other than ours.

35
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,448
Why bother doing the work twice?

36
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,658
It's a hassle.

37
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,327
Just leave it all to us.

38
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,872
We'll sort out everything, hassle-free.

39
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,916
You two, pick this up.

40
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,085
Actually…

41
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,006
What exactly are you looking
to put out there?

42
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,340
Huh?

43
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,566
PROBATION OFFICER
SON OF A BITCH

44
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,235
They're fucking relentless. I swear.

45
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,446
What is it now?

46
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,324
This is the supervising officer.
Where are you?

47
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,034
I'm calling to confirm your location.

48
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,662
Cut it out already, you son of a bitch.
Do you wanna fucking die?

49
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,831
Goodness, there's no need for profanity.

50
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,834
I just need to confirm
that you're heading home.

51
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,878
You have 20 minutes until curfew.

52
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,214
Yeah, I am going now!

53
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,341
I am on my way home!

54
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,343
I'm done talking to you, fucker!

55
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,850
Man, this fucking bastard.
He's a fucking nobody.

56
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,937
Does this motherfucker have
a death wish or something?

57
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,747
-That hurts.
-Tell me. Who are you?

58
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,165
I said it hurts! Damn it!

59
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,378
Did you give this person a ride?

60
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,005
This guy? He got out a while back.

61
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,048
Detective Seo!

62
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,468
Jeon Won-seong's ankle monitor and phone.

63
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,409
A police officer should say, "Police!"
before coming in.

64
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,662
And what kind of police officer
carries a hammer?

65
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,330
Don't you have a Taser?

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,668
How do you know Jeon Won-seong?

67
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,005
Jeon Won-seong? I don't know who that is.

68
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,842
You came to check a package
at a stranger's house?

69
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,052
I really don't know him.

70
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,806
A courier delivered a package to me
a few days ago.

71
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,768
The box was full of bullets.
All kinds of them.

72
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,655
Just bullets?

73
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,615
What about a gun?

74
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,242
What gun?

75
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,994
Mine only had bullets in it.

76
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,079
So you came here to find the gun?

77
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,334
Why is a police officer
waving around a hammer and…

78
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,002
Tell me the truth. Now.

79
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,671
That's what I'm doing now.

80
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,716
The package I received had some bullets

81
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,010
and an address list.

82
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,219
An address list?

83
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:49,807
Yeah, a well-organized address list
with names, addresses, and phone numbers.

84
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:55,229
I got curious and came here,
but once I arrived,

85
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,814
I felt a bit scared.

86
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,441
So I was just hanging around

87
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,402
when the guy who lives here
suddenly rushed out.

88
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,240
Was it this guy?

89
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,950
Yeah, that's him.

90
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,329
He must've been in a hurry.
He didn't even close the door.

91
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,290
So I came in and saw the box,

92
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,709
only to find it empty.

93
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,717
And then

94
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,928
you came in.

95
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,817
Hey, it's me.

96
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,694
Did you find Jeon Won-seong?

97
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,490
I think the bastard left his phone
in the taxi on purpose to trick us.

98
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,579
And the gun?

99
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,748
You didn't find one?

100
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,458
No, there was no gun.

101
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,378
We'll try to find him as soon as possible.

102
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,046
-Stay safe and update me.
-Okay.

103
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,180
Hello, this is Officer Lee Do
from Domyeong Police Station.

104
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,601
Could you check the security footage
in the alley at 45-2 Jeongil-ro?

105
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,604
We've got a report
that Jeon Won-seong left his house.

106
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,189
Please verify this.

107
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,150
"Please verify this."

108
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,280
Yes, we'll check it promptly
and get back to you.

109
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,739
Okay, thank you.

110
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,637
Jeon Won-seong?

111
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,185
He must have a gun, right?

112
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,449
I will

113
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,159
help you.

114
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,785
Don't move.

115
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,662
One.

116
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,790
Stay still.

117
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,751
Two.

118
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,128
Three!

119
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,554
Officer Lee.

120
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,932
We have Jeon's footage.

121
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,600
It looks like he's on the move.

122
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,684
He's on the move?

123
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,979
Please continue tracking him.

124
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,211
You bastard!

125
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,145
I caught him.

126
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,739
Wait, but who's this?
He's not the guy who lives there.

127
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,747
SECURITY CAMERA CONTROL ROOM

128
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,796
Did you find him?

129
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,714
Yes.

130
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,798
Where is he now?

131
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:56,012
He was spotted 3 km away, in front
of Ssangryong Restaurant, 25 minutes ago.

132
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,763
Can you get over there right away?

133
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,183
Actually, I don't have a way to get there.

134
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,407
Hello, Officer Jang.

135
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,160
I caught a man breaking into
Jeon's home and left him

136
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,662
by the camera at 45-5-gil,
Seopyeong-gu. Get there now.

137
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,248
-I'll head over there now.
-Okay.

138
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,961
Where to now?

139
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,172
-Hello, ma'am.
-Yes?

140
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,299
I'm on the move.
Update me on his movements.

141
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,927
We'll backtrack his movements
from 28 minutes ago

142
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,512
and keep you updated.

143
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,977
All team members,
track Jeon's movements and locate him.

144
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,772
-Man, I'm nervous.
-Understood.

145
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,023
Ten.

146
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,942
Nine. Eight.

147
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,196
Seven. What?

148
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,741
Oh, those? I told you earlier.

149
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,701
The box was full of bullets.

150
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,744
That's the box.

151
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,455
We're all set on our end.

152
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,540
Officer Lee, are you ready?

153
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,875
Yes, I'm ready!

154
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,587
Yes, go ahead.

155
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,466
From now on,
I'll relay Jeon's exact route.

156
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,762
Watch out!

157
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,891
In 200 meters, turn right
in front of Ssangryong Restaurant.

158
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,643
Here we go!

159
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,228
SSANGRYONG RESTAURANT

160
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,411
Jeon was spotted entering Gongwon-ro.

161
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,829
Put it on the main screen.

162
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,333
He turned right onto Gongwon-ro 409-gil,
which is your four o'clock position.

163
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,127
Thirty meters ahead.

164
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,130
-In ten meters, turn right.
-Turning right!

165
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,593
Keep going straight.

166
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,192
His location was confirmed 21 minutes ago.

167
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,111
Now go right at the laundromat.

168
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,030
BOSTON LAUNDROMAT

169
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,578
Jeon Won-seong entered
a blind spot 16 minutes ago.

170
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,748
This road leads to Hojung Intersection.

171
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,418
Search the roads near the intersection.
You should find him quickly.

172
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,711
We'll take a look.

173
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,965
Found him!

174
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,426
He moved to an underpass.

175
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,929
An underpass?

176
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,433
There's no vehicle access.
Finding an alternate route. One moment.

177
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,101
We have no time. Please hurry.

178
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,311
Let's get going!

179
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,856
Turn right!

180
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,821
Please describe his appearance.

181
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,907
Clothing color, features, anything helps.

182
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,283
A coat and an orange hoodie!

183
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,036
Yes, he's wearing a field jacket
and an orange hoodie.

184
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,370
And cargo pants.

185
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,413
Yes, that's correct.

186
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,999
Oh, and he had
what looked like a fishing bag.

187
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,878
Is he carrying a fishing bag?

188
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,838
Yes, something similar.

189
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,715
There's probably a gun inside.

190
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,634
Excuse me? A gun?

191
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,554
Jeon Won-seong exited the underpass
and turned right 17 minutes ago.

192
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,723
Damn!

193
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,142
Can we handle this?

194
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,769
"We"?

195
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,687
Yeah, "we."

196
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,897
We're a team now.

197
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,690
Stop joking around and focus.

198
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,253
For fuck's sake.
What the hell are these blank rounds for?

199
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,963
Are they kidding me?

200
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,298
He's going into Hyeondae Market.

201
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,925
Go straight,

202
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,761
then turn right into Hyeondae Market
at the fruit shop.

203
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,054
Turn right over there.

204
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,479
In front of the convenience store
14 minutes ago.

205
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,398
In front of the pharmacy 13 minutes ago.

206
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,774
Hold on.

207
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,152
There's no CCTV in this area.

208
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,238
I'll check the nearby cameras
and update you.

209
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,614
It's a three-way fork.

210
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,284
Please check around
Dongil-ro 34-gil, 46-gil, and 41-gil.

211
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,201
Understood.

212
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,414
I found Jeon.

213
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,665
Do you see the pharmacy?

214
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,000
-Pharmacy?
-Yes.

215
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,752
He turned right
in front of the pharmacy 12 minutes ago.

216
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,141
Turning right!

217
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,979
Turned left at 92 Bakseok-ro
ten minutes ago.

218
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,068
Turned right at 87 Bakseok-ro
eight minutes ago.

219
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,824
Turned right at 76 Geumseong-ro
six minutes ago.

220
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,409
Bakseok-ro? Geumseong-ro? So complex.

221
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,869
There, Geumseong-ro.

222
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,752
He turned right at 96 Geumseong-ro
five minutes ago.

223
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,962
Huh? No, he turned left.

224
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,797
Stop. That was 96 Geumseong-ro.

225
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,968
Reverse.

226
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,770
After entering Geumseong-ro,
go straight for 500 meters.

227
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,687
GEUMSEONG-RO

228
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,069
Turn right now.

229
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,989
Go straight for 800 meters.

230
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,961
So, where do you think
Jeon Won-seong is going with that gun?

231
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,255
And you? What were you going to do
once you found the gun?

232
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,258
Stop suspecting me.
I'm even driving for you.

233
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,010
After Jeon Won-seong, you're next.

234
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,846
"After Jeon Won-seong, you're next."

235
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,015
MRS. OH

236
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,684
Someone's calling.

237
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,438
Hold on, I have another call.

238
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,356
Okay, sure.

239
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,108
Hello, Mrs. Oh.

240
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,277
I have an urgent matter.
Can I call you back?

241
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,029
Oh, right.

242
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,116
Of course. I'm sorry to interrupt.

243
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,701
Okay, I'll call you back.

244
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,705
I'm back.

245
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,416
Turn left at the three-way fork ahead
and drive up.

246
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,630
In 200 meters,
you'll come to a downhill road.

247
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,636
Jeon walked down to the main street.

248
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,264
-The main street?
-Okay, let's go!

249
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,019
Don't worry.
I'll take you right to Jeon Won-seong.

250
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,736
-You okay?
-Just go. Hurry.

251
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,951
Confirmed four minutes ago.
Three minutes ago.

252
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,453
Two minutes ago.

253
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,746
Just keep going down.

254
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,622
One minute ago.

255
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,124
He's headed to the square.

256
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,755
Ten seconds ago! Turn on live visuals!

257
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,473
It's way too crowded.

258
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,435
Track him on all security footage
within 100 meters of the square exit.

259
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,687
I'll search from the square entrance.

260
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,688
Got it.

261
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,359
There's no sign of Jeon
30 meters west of the square.

262
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,360
Sorry about that.

263
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,404
Have you found anything else?

264
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,822
We're checking now.

265
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,909
Jeon wasn't captured
on the camera at the square's exit.

266
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,287
He wasn't captured
on the camera 50 meters north either.

267
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,123
He's not on the camera
to the south either.

268
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,041
Wait.

269
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,001
This is strange.

270
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,295
He couldn't have vanished
from the live visuals.

271
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,297
Even if we lost him,

272
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,759
he'd have to approach the camera
to get to the square.

273
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,969
We should have a better visual of him.

274
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,853
If you keep ignoring my rights
and suffocating me like this,

275
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,605
I won't take it anymore.

276
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,322
Is he heading toward the police station
by any chance?

277
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,532
The police station?

278
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:38,826
Found him.

279
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,952
Where is he?

280
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,829
The last place he was seen.

281
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,082
You're right.
He's heading to the police station.

282
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,794
Are we going?

283
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:58,512
GYEONGIN SEOBU POLICE STATION

284
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,140
There are more people with guns.

285
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,602
Hey, Officer Lee.

286
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,939
Jeon Won-seong seems to be on his way
to the station with a gun.

287
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,357
What?

288
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,192
I'm also heading to the station.

289
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,987
Tighten security at the entrance.
Meet in the parking lot.

290
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,407
Okay. I'll head down to the parking lot.

291
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,289
WOMEN AND JUVENILE AFFAIRS DIVISION

292
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,583
Looks like he's here for revenge.

293
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,336
-Revenge?
-I'm the one who arrested him.

294
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,465
How many in the station can use a gun?

295
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,135
Everyone's out in the field.
There are only a few desk officers here.

296
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,804
Man, Jeon Won-seong is driving me crazy.

297
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,306
I know, right?

298
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,600
Is he trying to ruin our lives, or what?

299
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,019
No word from the detective team yet?

300
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,230
Hey, they would've called
if they caught him.

301
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,316
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

302
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,654
Captain, handcuffs, please.

303
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,614
-What for?
-I'll fill you in later.

304
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,913
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!

305
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,915
Well,

306
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,335
I have something to ask you.

307
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,923
-Hey, that hurts.
-Stay here and keep quiet.

308
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,676
What was that?

309
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,555
Hey, uncuff me! Take me with you!

310
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,015
Take me with you!

311
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,937
What's going on?

312
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,402
"This is the supervising officer."

313
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,405
"Where are you?"

314
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,323
Say it again.

315
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,160
This is the supervising officer.
Where are you?

316
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,289
What was that noise?

317
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,165
That sweet voice.

318
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,002
It was you, huh?

319
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,567
How does it feel, you son of a bitch?

320
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,987
Do you finally understand
how suffocated I felt?

321
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,904
Do you?

322
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,364
Please.

323
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,158
Please spare me.

324
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:10,329
After squeezing the life out of me,
you should've seen this coming.

325
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,622
I was just doing my job, okay?

326
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,207
You know that too.

327
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,542
Over there.

328
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,211
That's my job, right?

329
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,425
So why did you work so hard
just to cause this disaster?

330
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,927
-Why?
-I…

331
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,806
I have a five-year-old daughter

332
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,683
and a son.

333
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,518
So, please.

334
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,937
Please have mercy just this once.

335
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,024
You got kids?

336
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,401
What's that got to do with me?

337
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,493
Hey!

338
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,496
What a surprise.

339
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,500
Everyone I'm after
is right here in front of me.

340
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,418
Take it easy and put the gun down.

341
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,837
Hey, Jeon Won-seong. That's enough.

342
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,173
If you keep this up,
things will only escalate!

343
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,591
Put the gun down.

344
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,134
Hey, you fucking morons.

345
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,097
Things have already escalated.

346
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,057
Am I wrong?

347
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,730
Are you okay?

348
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,524
Lights off first.

349
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,150
-Are you okay, sir?
-Yeah. You?

350
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,068
Yeah.

351
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,166
Hey, Do. What do we do?

352
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,627
A single gun might not be enough.

353
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,589
Captain, do you know
where the guns from the gosiwon are?

354
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,091
In the evidence room.

355
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,718
I thought those guns weren't even usable.

356
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,053
There aren't any bullets.

357
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,390
I've got them.

358
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,476
-What's the passcode?
-It's 0920.

359
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,686
Goddamn it!

360
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,111
I'll distract him
while you get these officers to safety.

361
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,784
You're just a bunch of fucking nobodies
pretending to be big shots.

362
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,551
Hey.

363
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,430
You think hiding from me will save you?

364
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,184
Do you?

365
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,448
For fuck's sake!

366
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,476
Damn it!

367
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,894
Fuck!

368
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,439
You fucking bastard!

369
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,610
That motherfucker.

370
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,490
Goddamn it!

371
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,001
Come out.

372
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,347
Run!

373
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,863
Captain!

374
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,543
He's bleeding heavily.
We have to stop it first.

375
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,795
What's going on?

376
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,880
Hey, here!

377
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,008
Uncuff me now, yeah?

378
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,510
I even chauffeured you around.

379
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,845
Uncuff me already.

380
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,722
Come on. Damn it!

381
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,307
I said uncuff me!

382
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,650
-Hand me some gauze.
-Here.

383
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,614
-And the bandages.
-Here.

384
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,743
I'll keep him distracted.

385
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,912
Shoot him as soon as you can.

386
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,583
Okay. Understood.

387
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,631
EVIDENCE ROOM

388
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,822
I have a really bad feeling about this.

389
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,417
Excuse me, is something going on?

390
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,016
GYEONGIN SEOBU POLICE
INSPECTOR SEO

391
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,769
Hello?

392
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,854
Captain, are you all right?

393
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,856
We're almost there.

394
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,359
Don't come straight in when you get here.

395
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,695
Move with the support team.

396
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,198
Do you understand?
Don't come in alone, no matter what.

397
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,076
What are you talking about?

398
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,013
Hey, wait for me.

399
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,121
Come in! All units are isolated.

400
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,330
Retreat, everyone!

401
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,002
We can't identify friend or foe
because of the storm.

402
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,464
Cease operation.
Everyone, retreat immediately.

403
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,299
-Just a moment.
-Over here. Help me.

404
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,719
Lee Do! We must retreat first.
That's an order. Retreat!

405
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,221
We can't. There are still survivors
on the battlefield.

406
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,516
If you stay there, you'll all die.
Retreat now!

407
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:53,041
You know what?
I was so scared of you fuckers.

408
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,003
I mean, you were acting so freaking tough.

409
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,056
Especially your subordinate.

410
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,809
That huge dumbass.

411
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,769
That fucking asshole.

412
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,689
He turned off the security camera
to beat my ass.

413
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,072
But the moment he saw me holding this gun,

414
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,866
he started shaking like a leaf
and ran away.

415
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,911
In your face, you pathetic ass.

416
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,038
What?

417
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,751
Can't run away with a bullet in you, huh?

418
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,795
Yeah, you're right.

419
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,756
Just like you said…

420
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,011
I have no strength to fight back anymore.

421
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,930
So?

422
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,765
But…

423
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:59,232
if you really thought I'd beg
a piece of shit like you for my life…

424
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,111
Well, sorry to disappoint.

425
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,660
Wow.

426
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,954
Acting tough until the very end, huh?

427
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,166
Hey, I've got

428
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,711
a question for you.

429
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,422
How many…

430
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,098
kids do you have?

431
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,310
You motherfucker.

432
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,784
You fucking--

433
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,287
What the hell?

434
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,711
Come out now, you sons of bitches!

435
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,882
Stop hiding like little rats!
Come out, you motherfuckers!

436
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,693
Who the fuck just shot me?

437
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,403
Come out, you bastard!

438
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,822
Damn it.

439
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,039
I said come out, you fucker!

440
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,294
Come out!

441
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,813
Shit!

442
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,207
You fucking son of a bitch.

443
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,794
You motherfucker,
how dare you toy with me!

444
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,674
Fine, let's fucking go, you fucker!

445
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,810
You're that pig from earlier, right?

446
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,854
You scared?

447
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,731
I said come out, goddamn it!

448
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,404
Fucking hell.
Why is everyone always out to get me?

449
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,764
Jeon Won-seong, drop the gun.

450
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,730
Fuck off, you bitch!

451
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,985
This is your last warning. Drop the gun.

452
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,572
All right. Fine.

453
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,241
Here it is.

454
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,826
Here's the gun.

455
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,828
Sir, are you okay?

456
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,623
Yes, Captain Joo is okay.

457
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,644
I don't want to hold a gun anymore.

458
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,356
If I have a gun in my hand…

459
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,363
…I feel like I have no choice…

460
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,744
but to take one life
to save another again.

461
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,207
Please drop the gun. Please.

462
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:20,227
