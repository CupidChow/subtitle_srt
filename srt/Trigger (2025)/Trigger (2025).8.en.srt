1
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,432
We will now execute
a joint operation to arrest Kim

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,058
and seize all firearms.

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,062
While the SOU and I round up
Gu Jeong-man and Kim at the club,

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:25,734
Officer Lee will raid the tool market
and seize all of Gu Jeong-man's guns.

5
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,404
Can't we just send the SOU team
into the tool market

6
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,489
to overwhelm them with numbers?

7
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,242
There are too many risk factors.

8
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,786
There's an apartment block,
a busy commercial district,

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,581
and even a subway station
near the tool market.

10
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,001
With public anxiety over guns at its peak,

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,544
a large-scale shootout

12
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,338
would cause widespread panic
and confusion.

13
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,259
I'm sure you already know this,

14
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,679
but the operation must be executed
swiftly and discreetly.

15
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,640
But can we really trust
Gong Seok-ho to cooperate?

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,435
Maybe he's up to something.

17
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,811
We're prepared.

18
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,856
Once I capture Gong Seok-ho
and Gu Jeong-man at the club,

19
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,776
Officer Lee will promptly move
into the tool market.

20
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,944
First, I'll seize Gu's firearms.

21
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,864
Then I'll search the place
for evidence on Kim.

22
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,284
Okay, then. Bring Kim here by tomorrow.

23
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:41,101
GYEONGIN SEOBU POLICE STATION

24
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,399
-I'm done.
-Come on, hurry up.

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,818
-Did you load everything?
-Yeah.

26
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,404
Follow them.

27
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,375
All units, stand by in position
until Gu Jeong-man arrives.

28
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,022
Hey, Do.

29
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,150
We're all set.

30
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,860
Gu Jeong-man hasn't arrived yet.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,862
I'll call you when he does.

32
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,530
YAKAM TOURIST HOTEL

33
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,409
Damn it.
What's taking those bastards so long?

34
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,880
Your fingers are fine, right?

35
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,090
Of course.

36
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,010
I even used hand cream to keep them soft.

37
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,805
Put that on and go have
that long-overdue talk with Gong.

38
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,765
And send him my regards.

39
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,684
Sure, I'll pass it on.

40
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,227
For sure.

41
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,305
What the fuck was that?

42
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,264
Hey.

43
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,434
How do you like my tool?

44
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,728
Dope, isn't it?

45
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,777
Wait.

46
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,696
Hold on, Jeong-man! Just hear me out!

47
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,281
No!

48
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,567
Gu Jeong-man's vehicle is approaching.

49
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,695
He's here.

50
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,533
Everyone, check your guns
and bulletproof vests. Stay alert.

51
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,249
You good?

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,881
If I make it out alive,

53
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,968
I'll treat you to a feast.

54
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,553
And if you don't?

55
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,762
If I don't?

56
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,392
Ask Jeong-man to treat you. I'm off.

57
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,063
Later.

58
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,915
Hey, come in.

59
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,760
Good to see you.

60
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,553
Gong, you fucking bitch.

61
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,974
You asked for my fingers, didn't you?
Here they are. Bye!

62
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,771
Fucking hell.

63
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,689
You backstabbed me,

64
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,858
and Jeong-man backstabbed you.

65
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,902
Isn't this hilarious? Right?

66
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,865
Shots fired in the building.

67
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,743
SOU team, move in first.

68
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,788
Sweep the building in teams of two,
starting from the first floor.

69
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,883
You fucking son of a bitch!

70
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,178
Fucking hell, you scared me!
Why are you yelling at me?

71
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,513
Sir.

72
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,057
Got those fingers you wanted?

73
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,351
Where are you?

74
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,144
That's not important right now.

75
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,356
Did you meet Mr. Kim?

76
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,735
I have no idea
about this cash cow or whatever,

77
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,865
but consider this payback
for the money you stole from our work.

78
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,283
What?

79
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,743
Oh, and I'm sorry.

80
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,454
You know those cigars? The Cubans.

81
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,042
To be honest,
they don't fucking suit you at all.

82
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,002
Gu Jeong-man.

83
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,172
How dare you stab me in the back.

84
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,639
You told me to trust you,
then called the cops on me.

85
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,600
Damn you, motherfucker!

86
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,415
Let's go.

87
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,878
Fuck--

88
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,553
Stop shooting, for fuck's sake.

89
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,309
Let's die here together, motherfucker.

90
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,463
What? This is not Gu Jeong-man.

91
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,632
It's Kim.

92
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,345
What are you saying?
Then where's Gu Jeong-man?

93
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,473
He's probably heading your way,
don't you think?

94
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,183
Okay. I'll check.

95
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,715
Wait for my signal.

96
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,759
Stand by for the signal.

97
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,110
Jeong-man, how'd it go?

98
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,152
Gather around.

99
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,618
Holy shit! Jeong-man, what's all this?

100
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,747
Boys, this is your severance pay.
Split it evenly among yourselves.

101
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,167
Let's live it up like everyone else
and suit up!

102
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,005
This is awesome!

103
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,051
Hey, there's one more!

104
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,595
Come on, grab your share too.

105
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,512
-You punk.
-Okay.

106
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,141
-It's not safe. Leave now!
-Okay.

107
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,747
Hey, Jeong-man.

108
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,583
The cops totally stormed in.

109
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,251
Okay.

110
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,670
Get over here fast.

111
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,411
Hey, got a light?

112
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,997
-A light? Nah.
-I'll grab one from the car.

113
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,266
-Seung-gyeong. Go check.
-Shit, are the cops here?

114
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,229
Suspect engaged. Moving in.
Everyone else, join when the SOU arrives.

115
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,857
Hey, grab these!

116
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,818
-Hey, the bag!
-Bring it!

117
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,820
-In here.
-Put it in.

118
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,321
Open the bag and throw it in!

119
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,977
Fuck.

120
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,290
Go!

121
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,529
Shots fired at a tool market.

122
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,531
Eliminate all suspects on sight.

123
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,660
Step on it!

124
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,330
-Hurry!
-All right!

125
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,225
Chang-ju.

126
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,726
You all right?

127
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,062
Chang-ju!

128
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,855
Chang-ju!

129
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:44,990
Jun-ho.

130
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,325
Hey, Jun-ho!

131
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,368
We need to go.

132
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,702
Get up!

133
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,129
Come on, Jun-ho.

134
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,006
Get up.

135
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,537
Gu Jeong-man's location confirmed.
Proceeding with arrest.

136
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,352
All firearms used in recent shootings

137
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,439
have been traced
to the gang arrested today.

138
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,984
The police stated
they would make every effort

139
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,069
to find the remaining unrecovered guns.

140
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,365
The police who dismantled
the illegal firearms network…

141
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,578
Come on. Is this seriously how it ends?

142
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,060
Would you like to

143
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,104
see for yourself?

144
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,795
This is

145
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,755
your daughter, right?

146
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,467
That's…

147
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,560
That's not my daughter.

148
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,271
Pardon?

149
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,606
I said that's not my daughter.

150
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,276
I know this is hard,

151
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,738
but please take a closer look.

152
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,678
That's not my daughter.

153
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,955
MY DAUGHTER

154
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,876
Please.

155
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,963
Pick up just once. Please.

156
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,551
My daughter packed another bland lunch,
even though no one asked her to.

157
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,928
It's healthy food.

158
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,429
Make sure to eat it all.

159
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,722
All right.

160
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,475
She's insisting on moving out now.

161
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,936
She says work-life balance
is important or something.

162
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,356
Why does she have to get a loan
just to get a jeonse and move out?

163
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,900
-For crying out loud.
-Who do we have here?

164
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,903
Goodness, it's my daughter.
My dear Se-yeong.

165
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,530
I told you to check properly.

166
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,824
I checked and called,
but I can't reach them.

167
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,742
That's why I came to you for help.

168
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,828
-You think the police are PIs?
-Whatever.

169
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,499
Se-yeong,

170
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,460
please pick up my call once.

171
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,159
Yeah, okay. All right.

172
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,452
-Good evening, Inspector.
-What brings you here?

173
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,913
-I just need to check something.
-I see.

174
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,804
Things are crazy
because of guns these days.

175
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,016
-You take care, too, okay?
-I will. Thank you.

176
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,228
You take care as well.

177
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,688
-I'll be in touch.
-Sure.

178
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,523
-Be careful.
-Thanks!

179
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,789
How can I help you?

180
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,547
My goodness, Sergeant Lee.

181
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,716
Long time no see.

182
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,886
-You're still alive, then?
-How have you been?

183
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,892
Hey, by the way,
don't you think you're too harsh?

184
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,855
After all our time on the battlefield,
you only show up when you need something.

185
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,398
It hurts me, you know.

186
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,029
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

187
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,243
If you feel that bad,
at least treat me to a meal first.

188
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,578
Forget it.
I know you're not the type to do that.

189
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,496
Let's see.

190
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,541
Wow, what's this?

191
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,379
It was found
in the gun recovered from the scene.

192
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,882
Wow, this is a state-of-the-art GPS!

193
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,386
Man, this is dope.
It even has wiretapping features.

194
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,099
So is it wiretapping us now?

195
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,101
No.

196
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,438
This chip alone
supports only GPS tracking.

197
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,692
Wait, were there any other devices?

198
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,364
Other devices… I don't think so.

199
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,449
So, with this device,

200
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,911
you can only track locations.

201
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,914
You need an external device
to enable wiretapping.

202
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,460
"An external device"?

203
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,546
Well, think it over.

204
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,049
There must have been
something more to each gun.

205
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,608
In recent years,
a massive influx of illegal firearms

206
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,903
has been observed in areas
affected by civil and interstate wars.

207
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,324
A CIA investigation
traced the series of incidents

208
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,954
back to the International Rifle Union,
also known as IRU.

209
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,874
Operating primarily in the black market,

210
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:18,170
it is a vast organization
that illegally supplies weapons

211
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,257
to countries or groups
that cannot acquire them legally.

212
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,678
Additionally, they are known
to wield immense influence,

213
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,766
extensively lobbying US politicians
and multinational corporations

214
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,351
and making them nearly untouchable.

215
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,270
This is Blue Brown.

216
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,314
He has been identified

217
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,777
as the key figure overseeing and managing
all aspects of firearm distribution

218
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,737
currently occurring in South Korea.

219
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,697
How many firearms are in the country now?

220
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,992
The current estimate
is around 30,000 firearms.

221
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,912
What? Did you just say 30,000?

222
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,247
It was revealed
that no courier services were used

223
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,333
in the Yu and Jeon incidents.

224
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:01,421
We're working to trace where and how
these firearms were stored and moved,

225
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,507
but it's proving difficult.

226
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,886
If they smuggle them in
and don't use couriers,

227
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,391
how do they distribute so many firearms
across the country?

228
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,455
So this is where you were hiding.

229
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:39,960
Hey!

230
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,796
How dare you leave the station
without permission!

231
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,007
I'm sorry.

232
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,218
My shift is over,

233
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,514
and I haven't been home all week.

234
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,850
I just wanted to grab some clean socks.

235
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,979
Just wash them and put them back on.

236
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,481
Are you a complete idiot?

237
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,401
I just got chewed out because of you.

238
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,864
Go wipe down all the IV poles
and dressing trolleys now.

239
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,076
I swear, everything you do
just pisses me off.

240
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,830
If your brain's not working,
at least use your body!

241
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,875
Come on, Nurse Yu-jin!
Let's just go, okay?

242
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,543
Fucking bitch.

243
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,004
Just seeing her pisses me off.

244
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,547
I can't stand her.

245
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:08,965
Hey.

246
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,806
What would happen
if everyone in Korea had a gun?

247
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,683
Sorry?

248
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,852
Aren't you curious?

249
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,105
I'm not sure what you mean…

250
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,821
In the end,
what angers and humiliates people the most

251
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,907
is other people.

252
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,743
Selfish, disrespectful people.

253
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,163
But strangely, when you have a gun,

254
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,791
they act differently.

255
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,252
Are you saying

256
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:50,215
you would like to change the world
with guns?

257
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,343
Realistically, that's impossible…

258
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,685
Do you know the true power of a gun?

259
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,188
All I'm doing

260
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,984
is pulling this five-millimeter trigger,

261
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,989
yet the sound of the gun
would quickly spread over 500 meters,

262
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,200
striking fear into people's hearts.

263
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,121
And in one way or another,

264
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,124
it provokes a reaction from them.

265
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,918
But what if it wasn't one person

266
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,130
but a hundred pulling the trigger?

267
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,177
Or a thousand people?

268
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,806
Or ten thousand?

269
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,978
In the blink of an eye.

270
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,733
And eventually, that fear

271
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,611
will lead to a new order.

272
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,794
To influence Koreans
who are easily swayed by emotions,

273
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,339
those with a tragic backstory

274
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,759
must be the first to pull the trigger.

275
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,928
So everyone can empathize
with their anger.

276
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,725
So you have only one job.

277
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,354
Get some good footage

278
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,731
so people can witness

279
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,858
the power of a gun.

280
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,739
Who exactly are you people?

281
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,330
Who we are, you and I, isn't important.

282
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,585
What's important is what I do from now on.

283
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:58,218
That will completely change
the world as we know it.

284
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,606
If my guess is right,

285
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,819
every gun should have a chip like this.

286
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,571
That's how they can monitor
those who have them.

287
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,909
In that case,

288
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,287
what could that external device be?

289
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,839
-Hey, Do.
-Hey, it's me.

290
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:40,135
Was the address list the only common link
between the shooters?

291
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,514
Nothing else
except their cell phones being hacked.

292
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,432
Cell phones…

293
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,569
Sir, this is Officer Lee Do.
He was my superior in the military.

294
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,780
Officer Lee.

295
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,700
Once the IRU selects a target area,

296
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,370
they leave bullets behind
to mark the start of their operation.

297
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,957
It's a signal for them to distribute guns
and devastate the region.

298
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,875
Do.

299
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,794
Before the gosiwon shooting,

300
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,380
bullets were left
at a nearby rooftop house.

301
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,716
You remember that case, don't you?

302
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,301
Detective Seo!

303
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,598
He had this on his body?

304
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,558
Obviously, these must not be registered.

305
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,685
What was the deceased's job?

306
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,562
The deceased had a criminal record.

307
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,732
Apparently,
he sold children left in a baby box

308
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,401
to foreign brokers 20 to 30 years ago.

309
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,157
Who are you?

310
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,867
Long time no see.

311
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:48,912
What?

312
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,830
Hey.

313
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,916
I asked who you were!

314
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,632
You haven't changed a bit.

315
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,844
Let's make some money.

316
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,722
Let's see. Blood type AB…

317
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,224
Hey!

318
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,184
Yeah, you.

319
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,560
Come out here.

320
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,562
Come on.

321
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,031
So the bullets you found
in the rooftop house were his signal

322
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,785
that he would devastate
the country that abandoned him.

323
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,377
He's determined to convey his intentions
by any means.

324
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,422
There must be a reason
he approached you, Officer Lee.

325
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,176
I'm not sure about that…

326
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,058
but this was found
in a gun from Gu's gang.

327
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,938
GPS devices like this were hidden
in all distributed guns.

328
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,150
So they used these chips
to track who they gave the guns to?

329
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,235
That's my guess.

330
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,529
It's a state-of-the-art GPS
that can monitor

331
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,907
and wiretap when used
with an activated external device.

332
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,452
I was thinking
we could trace these devices back.

333
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,620
Trace them back?

334
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,582
As you may know,
a common signal might show up

335
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,418
if we check the chips
in the confiscated guns.

336
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,130
The source of that signal
could be the organization's base.

337
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,757
That's a possibility.

338
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,093
Huh? What's going on?

339
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,553
-Huh?
-What is that?

340
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,180
-What's all this?
-Check the screen!

341
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,724
-It's Blue Brown!
-What?

342
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,767
Server team, check!

343
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,394
-Control's not working.
-Yes, sir.

344
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,354
-Trace the hacking route.
-Yes, sir.

345
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,898
Check the server.

346
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,899
Yes, will do.

347
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,985
-It's not working.
-Too many phone users to narrow down.

348
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,739
Determining the location now.

349
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,954
Sir, it looks like someone in here
has a gun.

350
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,916
Now put your hands on your head
and stand up immediately.

351
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,500
Get up now!

352
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,045
Move to the back of the room.

353
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,797
-Don't touch anything.
-Hands on your head.

354
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,926
Now move toward the wall.

355
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,093
Well?

356
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,472
Aren't you happy to see me again?

357
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,476
Well, I was sure

358
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,312
you'd find those chips quickly.

359
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,607
But

360
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,527
that's not what's important right now.

361
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,782
One gun confirmed.

362
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,285
That gun…

363
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,998
Do you think it's the only one?

364
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,461
There are many people in Korea
who want guns.

365
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,297
Here, there, everywhere.

366
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,634
And at 27 Baekju-ro…

367
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,720
27 Baekju-ro.

368
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,975
There's someone about to pull the trigger.

369
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,268
This is 27 Baekju-ro.

370
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,353
I'm just curious

371
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,106
to see what you decide to do.

372
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,362
Decide quickly.

373
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,366
There isn't much time left.

374
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,666
Captain.

375
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:28,506
Another victim of a jeonse scam
took their own life this morning.

376
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,176
This is already the ninth reported case.

377
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,430
Despite the victims' pleas of desperation,

378
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:40,059
the authorities are being criticized
for only introducing unrealistic measures.

379
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,897
Victims are demanding harsher penalties
for scammers from the government.

380
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:45,982
to protect victims…

381
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:09,881
Captain.

382
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:44,832
Do.

383
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,543
Do!

384
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,472
-Track the location of this GPS chip.
-Yes, sir.

385
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,858
This is where the GPS got picked up.

386
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,111
-Update me on Blue Brown's location.
-Yes, sir.

387
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,278
Okay, let's go!

388
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,045
CAPTAIN JO

389
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,820
Hey! Let's get wasted!

390
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,532
CANCEL

391
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,923
Got Blue Brown's location?

392
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,719
Blue Brown is in the MS Building
underground parking lot.

393
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,459
-We're not interested.
-Who called a trot singer?

394
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,201
Damn it.

395
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,955
Hey, Do. Se-yeong fell victim

396
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,916
to a jeonse scam, and she…

397
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,587
Do any of you know…

398
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,091
what pain feels like?

399
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,008
-Pain?
-So random.

400
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,927
-Lost your mind?
-Is that the title?

401
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,595
-What the fuck?
-"Pain"?

402
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,516
Why the hell would you enter our room
and say this bullshit?

403
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,600
Hey, piss off.

404
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,687
Seriously, what's this fucking lunatic
talking about?

405
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,022
Get him out of here already.

406
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,317
Son Hyeon-seong, 34 years old.

407
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,279
Seven convictions,
including fraud and illegal gambling.

408
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,741
Cheon Il-su, 35 years old.

409
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,286
Nine convictions,
including fraud and assault.

410
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,624
What the fuck?

411
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,337
You're killing my damn buzz.

412
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,048
Who are you, old man?

413
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,640
Because of people like you,

414
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,436
who feel no guilt leeching off
hardworking, ordinary people…

415
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,236
my precious daughter…

416
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,490
and another innocent person

417
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,701
took their own lives today.

418
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,912
What the hell does your daughter's death

419
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,415
have to do with us?

420
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,212
I came here
after identifying my daughter's body.

421
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,551
Don't you dare insult my daughter's death.

422
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,889
What are you waiting for?
Get this old man's mug out of here.

423
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,475
So what? Huh?

424
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,643
What do you want? Did we kill her?

425
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,520
No, we didn't kill her. Fuck.

426
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,731
So why the hell
are you crashing our party?

427
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,025
What the fuck do you want us to do?

428
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,860
What do you want from us?

429
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,113
Apologize at my daughter's funeral.

430
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,949
Apologize? Apologize, my ass.

431
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,702
Did your daughter ask you to do this?

432
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,289
Unless you wanna join your daughter
in the morgue,

433
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,793
just shut the fuck up
and piss off, motherfucker.

434
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,795
I said piss off.

435
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,381
Piss off already.

436
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,465
Piss off now.

437
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,051
-Now.
-Who's the old guy?

438
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,886
-Don't fucking mind it.
-Piss off.

439
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,304
-It's pissing me off.
-Hey!

440
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,222
Hey!

441
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,729
Where the fuck are you going?

442
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,110
What the fuck? That bastard is crazy!

443
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,320
Someone died…

444
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,780
Hey, don't shoot! Fuck!

445
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,199
…yet you people don't feel any guilt.

446
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,578
There is no hope left for you.

447
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,164
You, outside! Call the police!

448
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:19,073
