00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,299
THIS EPISODE CONTAINS
GRAPHIC DEPICTIONS OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,884
WHICH SOME VIEWERS MAY FIND DISTURBING.

3
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:21,980
Is it this person?

4
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,566
Could you check
the other addresses as well?

5
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,859
Sure, read them to me.

6
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,903
13-1 Seojung-ro.

7
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,739
319-2 Changdong-ro.

8
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,949
417-1 Sanggok-ro.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,201
27 Daewon 3-ro.

10
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,286
21 Mijeong-ro.

11
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,039
Wait.

12
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,167
This person was at all the addresses
you read out.

13
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:51,843
Yes, Officer Lee. I just checked.
This guy was at every address you gave me.

14
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,179
Okay, got it. Thanks.

15
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,248
Come on, at least try to look happy
to see me again.

16
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,698
Is everyone okay?

17
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,659
Kids, are you okay?

18
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,370
-Anyone hurt?
-No.

19
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,039
Everyone seems okay.

20
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,459
That's a relief.
Please head outside with the kids.

21
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,377
Okay.

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,865
Hey, wait.

23
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,742
Gyu-jin, I'm sorry.

24
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,748
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,919
I'm sorry, Gyu-jin.

26
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,841
Wait.

27
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,229
I can't possibly know…

28
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,817
all that you've been through.

29
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,864
But what you're about to do…

30
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,870
will only end up hurting you.

31
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,207
Don't act like you understand.

32
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,212
It's too late.

33
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,464
It's not too late.

34
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,845
If you open up to me

35
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,765
about your struggles…

36
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,729
I might be able to help.

37
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,532
I just want to hear your story.

38
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,329
I mean it.

39
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:14,963
But to do that,

40
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,383
you need to put the gun down

41
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,094
so we can talk.

42
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,058
You will, won't you?

43
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,136
That asshole…

44
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,018
He's a total piece of shit.

45
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,937
Good job.

46
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,399
You did well to hold back, Gyu-jin.

47
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,702
Great job. You did well.

48
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,205
You did well.

49
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,725
-My son is in there!
-Is he even human?

50
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,643
We'll explain everything later.

51
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,982
Seong-jun!

52
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,486
-What happened?
-Seong-jun!

53
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,445
Wake up, Seong-jun!

54
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,530
-It's Mom. Look at me.
-It's Dad.

55
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,866
What on earth happened?

56
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,494
-Let go of me!
-Get off me!

57
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,038
Seong-jun, wake up!
Don't you recognize us?

58
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,581
Don't touch me!

59
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,125
Seong-jun, it's Dad.

60
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,129
Ma'am, please don't push. It's not safe.

61
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,013
Gyu-jin!

62
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:29,931
Excuse me.

63
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:34,143
No, I'm his mom. I said I'm his mom!

64
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,186
Gyu-jin!

65
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,813
Let go of me!

66
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,689
-You can't go any further.
-I'm his mom!

67
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,317
Gyu-jin, what are you doing there?

68
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,654
You didn't do anything wrong. Tell them.

69
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,532
Tell them now, Gyu-jin.

70
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,701
No, Gyu-jin! My goodness!

71
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,121
Gyu-jin, why are you
getting in the police car?

72
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,042
Gyu-jin! No!

73
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,253
Gyu-jin!

74
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,426
Detective Seo.

75
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,136
Yeah, go ahead.

76
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,849
Arrest operation ready and all personnel
in position. Shall we get him?

77
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,892
Hold your positions and stand by.

78
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,540
Don't worry.

79
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,542
I'll take you right to Jeon Won-seong.

80
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,002
Don't move.

81
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,674
I caught him.

82
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,802
All it had was a piece of paper
and a bunch of bullets.

83
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,138
Where's that address list now?

84
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,141
I threw it out.

85
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,686
The people who received those guns.

86
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,357
To them, a gun could actually represent
both justice and power.

87
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,985
There's a high school student on the list.

88
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,696
Shouldn't you check?

89
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,615
Kids turn in their phones before class.

90
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,496
GYEONGIN SEOBU POLICE STATION
DETECTIVE SEO

91
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,332
ONCE THE SITUATION IS OVER,
ARREST MOON BAEK

92
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,377
Do, they're all ready.
Should we get him now?

93
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,007
We're all moving in to get him.

94
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,091
Copy that.

95
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,302
Team two, move!

96
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,188
What the hell?

97
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,231
Where did he go?

98
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,192
Where did that bastard go?

99
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,529
-None of you saw him?
-No, sir.

100
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,615
-Block the main gate and side exits.
-Yes, sir.

101
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,575
-Hey, secure all exits.
-Yes, sir.

102
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,952
You three. Come here!

103
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,122
Officer Lee.

104
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,210
I just received background information
on Moon Baek from Dongwol Industries,

105
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,629
but he's not the guy we met.

106
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,472
DONGJIN APARTMENT

107
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,765
LEE DO

108
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,853
South Korea can no longer be called
a gun-free country.

109
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,023
As horrific shootings continue,
citizens are becoming increasingly…

110
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,399
Tragic news.

111
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,653
A mass shooting has occurred
at a high school

112
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,280
after recent events at a gosiwon
and a police station…

113
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,950
A Gyeonggi convenience store was robbed
at gunpoint early this morning.

114
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,162
It took place around 2:00 a.m.
at a convenience store…

115
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,499
As debates continue
over the source of guns in circulation

116
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,833
and the forces behind them…

117
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,712
After a series of gun incidents,
citizens demand that the government…

118
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,005
Where are these guns from?

119
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,716
-And the gun source?
-Is a criminal organization linked?

120
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,593
-What are your plans to…
-Commissioner.

121
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,470
How many more shootings do you foresee?

122
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,388
More guns, right?

123
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,224
The people are shaking in fear.

124
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,518
Are there more guns out there or not?

125
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,562
Or do you not know that either?

126
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,940
Please avoid speculation and conjecture.

127
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,693
Trust the police and be patient.

128
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,157
Here he comes.

129
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,118
-Sir!
-Hello.

130
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,373
The police called me today.

131
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,501
We're not exactly the law-abiding type,

132
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,255
but if you want to make a living
in South Korea,

133
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,299
there's one thing
you should never mess with.

134
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,552
And that's guns.

135
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,178
Didn't it turn out for the best?

136
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,764
I mean, this is a global age now.

137
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,768
How long are you going to stick
to just sashimi knives?

138
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,605
Assault, fraud, drugs, and even murder
can all be settled in court,

139
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,233
but not guns.

140
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,819
The military gets involved.

141
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,945
Exactly.

142
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,032
The moment we get guns,
we'll be put down like dogs.

143
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,999
Fuck, if this goes south,
I might take the fall for everything.

144
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,169
What do we do
about the guns in the storage room?

145
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:49,977
Hey.

146
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,190
Give "Police in Name Only" a call.

147
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,357
Yes, sir.

148
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,568
Are you kidding me?

149
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,904
How could you lose just one guy?

150
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,405
Have you all gone blind?

151
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,201
Do whatever it takes to find that bastard
and bring him to me.

152
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,995
Retrieve every gun sent
to the addresses on the list.

153
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,707
One more shooting,
and we're all handing in our badges.

154
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,584
You got it?

155
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:15,836
Yes, sir.

156
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,344
Lee Do.

157
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,929
You're back on duty today.

158
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,807
I'll take full responsibility,
so join the team.

159
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,187
GONG SEOK-HO

160
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,531
Fucking hell.

161
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,282
Quite keen, isn't he?

162
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,628
Here.

163
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,340
This is a real gun.

164
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,884
Stay back, or I'll shoot.

165
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,844
For real.

166
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,849
Shit, don't fucking shoot me!

167
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,606
Where did you get this gun?

168
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,819
Man…

169
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,699
Mr. Kim, a meth dealer,
offered me a club for cheap, so I took it.

170
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,451
I found these
in the basement storage room.

171
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,121
And where is this Mr. Kim now?

172
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,708
No clue. How would I know?

173
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,917
When I found these,

174
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,170
I thought he was screwing me over,
so I was going to take him down.

175
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,256
But I have no fucking clue where he is.

176
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:44,967
Wait.

177
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,760
Do you expect me to believe that?

178
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,429
Okay, just wait. Here.

179
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,597
Hey, check this out.

180
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,390
Here, look.

181
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,187
For fuck's sake.

182
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,398
There's a guy named Gu Jeong-man.

183
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,318
He works under me,
handling the grunt work.

184
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,655
Officer Lee, it turns out
the guy you're looking for works for him.

185
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,950
Man, I have no idea how he knew,

186
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,204
but he was lingering outside
the club's storage room with the guns.

187
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,415
What does that mean?

188
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,043
Those bastards are looking for guns.

189
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,711
You get what I'm saying?

190
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,094
Why are you showing me all your cards?

191
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,848
Because there were guns
at one of my businesses!

192
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,436
You expect me to just sit back
when I'm about to get shot?

193
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,148
I'll cooperate with you on everything,

194
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:45,778
so leave me out
of this fucked-up mess, Officer Lee.

195
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,656
I have nothing to do with these guns.

196
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,659
I'm just an innocent citizen.

197
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,535
Okay?

198
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,416
Come on. You took them all
when you came last time.

199
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,377
We did? Were they the police?

200
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,048
I handed everything over after seeing
the police ID. Why are you back?

201
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,050
-Hey.
-Yes?

202
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,803
Was anyone else
meant to come here besides us?

203
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,347
No, we're in charge of this area.

204
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,391
Whatever. You guys figure it out.

205
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,811
We've never been here.

206
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,646
-I gave it to you.
-But…

207
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,730
But I already did!

208
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,983
Damn it, this is driving me crazy.

209
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,194
You guys already took it.
Why are you asking again?

210
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,239
This is serious. So if you're lying,
you'll be in big trouble.

211
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,156
Give us the gun.

212
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,866
God, you people are unbelievable.

213
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,867
That's enough. Go.

214
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,786
Sir, you never gave it to us.

215
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,538
Wait a minute, sir!

216
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,961
How many guns did you get?

217
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,339
We've collected guns
from half the listed addresses.

218
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,257
Only half?

219
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,885
What are you going to do
if a madman starts shooting tomorrow?

220
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,137
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,098
I'll put all my men
on finding them as quickly as possible.

222
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,351
What about those bastards
posing as cops to get the guns?

223
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,978
We're also doing our best--

224
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,607
The Joint Investigation HQ
will handle the case from here.

225
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,861
Transfer the case files
and stay out of it.

226
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,903
Sir.

227
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,495
JOINT INVESTIGATION HQ

228
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,918
The Ministry of Health and Welfare
designated regional hub hospitals

229
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,088
and issued a manual
on treating shooting victims.

230
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,049
With this, the medical community…

231
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,094
I get indigestion from flour-based foods,
yet she brought bread again.

232
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,220
Thanks.

233
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,973
God, how oblivious and thickheaded
can she be?

234
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,228
If you're from a no-name college,
at least be good at something.

235
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,188
Right?

236
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,230
I know, right?

237
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,233
When will she finally get it right?

238
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,527
Does she want to show off
her no-name school?

239
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,199
Ma'am, I'll order some mango bingsu later.
It's your favorite.

240
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,283
You're the best.

241
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,790
By the way,
I'm starting personal training next week.

242
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,125
Could you take me off night shifts?

243
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,169
You barely had night shifts last month.

244
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,213
Come on, ma'am. Please?

245
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,214
Goodness me.

246
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,425
All right. I'll adjust the schedule.

247
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,095
We have someone for the night shift.

248
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,848
Thank you so much, ma'am!

249
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,684
I'll order that bingsu right away.

250
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,814
I hear people
are frantically trying to buy

251
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,942
replica firearms and gun parts
from overseas online retailers.

252
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:34,363
We need to start an open discussion
on legalizing gun ownership.

253
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,115
What are you talking about?

254
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,450
An open discussion
on legalizing gun ownership

255
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,120
in South Korea,
one of the world's safest countries?

256
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,205
The problem is
it's being driven underground.

257
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,916
We must legalize,
institutionalize, and systemize it so--

258
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,293
It's not a problem
we can settle right now.

259
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,380
As we face this unprecedented wave
of mass shootings,

260
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,425
I urge any viewers
in possession of a firearm

261
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,388
to report it to the nearest police station
as soon as possible.

262
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,980
It seems Gong Seok-ho is cooperating
with the police investigation.

263
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,610
The delivered guns are starting to move.

264
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,946
We confirmed
the guns were used in Banhyeon-dong.

265
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,407
What's Gu Jeong-man doing now?

266
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,327
Looks like he's only recovered
half of the distributed guns so far.

267
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,288
Only half?

268
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,377
Man, shouldn't someone
be making a bang by now?

269
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,922
We released those guns for people to use,

270
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,718
whether to fight over them
or go up against the police.

271
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,138
Come on. Do something, damn it.

272
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,522
You like that?

273
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,983
-This isn't a toy.
-This looks sleek.

274
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,570
-I said this isn't a toy, dipshit.
-Go to the first floor and…

275
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,283
-Didn't you serve in the army?
-He didn't even serve!

276
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,202
This is top-notch!

277
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,162
You fucking moron.

278
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,958
Wait, this isn't it?

279
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,002
Man, seriously.

280
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,796
Don't make me repeat myself again.

281
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,424
Do you have trust issues?

282
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,262
I'm telling you,
we're the best launderers in town.

283
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,430
You want goods?

284
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,683
Don't you know goods equal cash?

285
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,187
We launder it all, whether the money
is questionable, shady, or illegal.

286
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,606
Stop worrying and send it over, okay?

287
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,946
Good God.

288
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,033
Sir, that's a cigar, isn't it?

289
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,576
It was a gift.

290
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,080
Cigars apparently symbolize
gentility and style.

291
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,333
They're from Cuba. What do you think?

292
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,088
-Does it suit me?
-Yes, you look so cool.

293
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,759
Here. Take a drag, yeah?

294
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,768
You lame ass.

295
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,479
You're not supposed to inhale cigar smoke.
Give it back.

296
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,563
Here it is.

297
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,819
Jeong-man,
you need to clean up and look sharp.

298
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,654
Speaking of which,

299
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,783
I have a big job coming up,
so I need you to hustle one more time.

300
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,787
A big job? What kind of…

301
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,295
I plan to take over Mr. Kim's businesses.

302
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,212
Sorry?

303
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,465
You mean…

304
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,385
Yes, Mr. Kim, the one you and I both know.

305
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,720
We need to clean this up.

306
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,932
Hey, Mr. Kim's selling something new
he brought from overseas,

307
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,351
and it's apparently a huge cash cow.

308
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,979
Mr. Kim's businesses?
This job seems too big.

309
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,480
I got the order from above,

310
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,899
so you and I
just need to take care of Mr. Kim.

311
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,737
That's your expertise,
isn't it, Jeong-man?

312
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,780
Sir.

313
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,366
Once this job is over,

314
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,747
could you please give me and my boys
a business to run?

315
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,751
Come on.

316
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,795
You're about to upset me again.

317
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,883
If this goes well,
you're not just getting one business.

318
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,677
You in or not?

319
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,638
I'm in. I can do it.

320
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,931
That's more like it!

321
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,516
My Jeong-man!

322
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:37,481
You're the only one I can trust.
Give them to me.

323
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,123
Come on, man. Why are you hesitating?

324
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,001
We've got guns. Let's wipe them all out.

325
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,545
Did you know?

326
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,424
A lion waits for the perfect moment,
even when hunting a rabbit.

327
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,346
Not out of weakness
but to avoid making a mistake.

328
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,058
When the time is right,

329
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,769
we need to finish it all in one go.

330
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,773
How many times do I have to tell you this?

331
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,234
Gu Jeong-man is the one
who knows where Mr. Kim is.

332
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,821
-Are you sure?
-Sure? Fucking hell, what…

333
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,745
If you don't believe me,
go ask Gu Jeong-man yourself.

334
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,707
Kim had all of these?

335
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,334
Yes.

336
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:44,339
Kim has been distributing
all the guns used in the shootings so far?

337
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,925
-By disguising them as packages?
-Yes, that's correct.

338
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,387
Where the hell is this bastard Kim?

339
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,722
We're currently unable to locate him.

340
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,726
If we use Gu Jeong-man and Gong
to find Kim,

341
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,481
we can uncover the real masterminds
behind the distribution of these guns.

342
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,359
All right. Come up with a plan

343
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,279
and update the Joint Investigation HQ
on the progress.

344
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,030
Yes, sir.

345
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,657
Please approve this.

346
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,288
Hey.

347
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,790
I told you to stay out of this case.

348
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,000
Sir.

349
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,669
These guns are spreading as we speak.

350
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,380
The sound of gunfire is echoing
throughout Seoul.

351
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,340
We've had three incidents just today.

352
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,885
We must find those guns immediately.

353
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,845
Our job is to stop them.

354
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,770
BACKGROUND CHECK

355
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,356
Officer Lee identified him
as the gun distributor.

356
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,736
Sir, you should focus all your attention
on locating this man.

357
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,864
In the meantime,
we'll find as many guns as possible

358
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,948
and get a lead

359
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,659
on this bastard.

360
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,458
Announcement from HQ.

361
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,544
We have a lead on suspects
impersonating police to obtain firearms,

362
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,630
so all officers are now
on emergency alert.

363
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,841
Collect all firearms
at the listed addresses without delay.

364
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,092
I repeat.

365
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,262
We have a lead
on suspects impersonating police…

366
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,014
MY DAUGHTER

367
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,729
The person you are calling
is currently unavailable.

368
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,981
Please try again later.

369
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,402
REAL ESTATE
BUY AND SELL, RENT, BROKERAGE

370
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,662
Dad, can you

371
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,455
help me out?

372
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,999
Huh? Why?

373
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,545
Can you get an advance on your pension?

374
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,382
Have you lost it, you little brat?

375
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,260
-Trying to butter me up?
-Can't you just help me?

376
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,305
-Sir.
-Then file a report with the police!

377
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,015
-Sir.
-What do you want?

378
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,559
Please help me.

379
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,687
Without that money, I'm dead.
Please have mercy.

380
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,897
I'm begging you. Please.

381
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,815
Let go, damn it.

382
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,067
Dad spent his life working for it.

383
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,735
-It's his pension.
-Just sue me.

384
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,279
God, seriously.

385
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,199
Please have mercy. Sir.

386
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,118
It's Gong! He's here!

387
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,828
Shit, why is he here?

388
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,371
-Get rid of them!
-Hide them!

389
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,289
Fucking hell!

390
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,249
Hey, hurry!

391
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,334
We're fucked.

392
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,711
Come on, quickly!

393
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,755
Hurry!

394
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,432
Give it here.

395
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,482
My dear Jeong-man.

396
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,442
Hello, sir.

397
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,445
What's with this vibe?

398
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,452
What were you all doing
to be this out of breath?

399
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,453
Sorry?

400
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,539
Oh, right. We were just cleaning.

401
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,587
What do you expect
from a rundown building like this?

402
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,672
Don't sweat it.

403
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,301
First time seeing me, boys?

404
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,553
Hello, sir.

405
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,055
Yeah, likewise.

406
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,556
Have a seat, sir.

407
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,812
I saw a famous bakery on the way.

408
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,855
I see.

409
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,778
Right.

410
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,697
Thank you.

411
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,533
You once asked
if I knew your boys' names, didn't you?

412
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,076
Sorry?

413
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,496
I've felt awful about that ever since.

414
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,291
I figured there'd be about 20.
That should be enough, right?

415
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,503
Yes, this is enough.

416
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,922
Hey, take these and share them.

417
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,258
Jeong-man.

418
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,845
Why don't we talk?

419
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,474
Give us a minute, guys.

420
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,519
Thank you for the bread.

421
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,979
Sure. You're welcome!

422
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,042
Jeong-man.

423
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,794
Yes, sir.

424
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,839
I've been missing Mr. Kim lately.

425
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,884
I wonder how he is.

426
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,928
He should still be buried deep, right?

427
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:30,393
Why are you suddenly asking about him?
You know better than anyone.

428
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,021
That's right.

429
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,441
I do.

430
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,456
Ta-da!

431
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,125
This is Mr. Kim's phone.

432
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:59,172
Those idiots brought me his phone
without asking for the passcode.

433
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:03,927
This phone has all the clients' contacts,
but I can't get my hands on the cash.

434
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,136
But, you know,

435
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,097
I don't know it either.

436
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,265
I know.

437
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,145
But you, Jeong-man, can unlock this phone.

438
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,356
Me?

439
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,574
Cut off Mr. Kim's fingers
and bring them to me. All ten.

440
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,954
You know where his body is.

441
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,458
The sooner, the better.

442
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,547
Before all his fingers rot away.

443
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,387
Hey, I came to test the waters with him.

444
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,431
It seems certain
that Gu Jeong-man is hiding Mr. Kim.

445
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,101
I told him to come to the club tomorrow,
so get ready.

446
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,063
Make sure to leave me out of this mess,
"Police in Name Only."

447
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,109
Man, this bastard…

448
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,994
Hey, Jeong-man.

449
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,581
What did that bastard Gong say?

450
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,044
Why the stare? Just spit it out.

451
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,428
Do you trust me, Mr. Kim?

452
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,055
Why ask that now? You're scaring me.

453
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,349
I trust you. What'd that bastard say?

454
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,811
He wants me to take him your fingers.

455
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,521
All ten.

456
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:12,972
Let's go.

457
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,975
Let's go.

458
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,125
Yes, sir.

459
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,879
Gu Jeong-man came to retrieve
Mr. Kim's fingers.

460
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,511
Okay, got it.
Make sure to keep a close eye on him.

461
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,179
Yes, understood.

462
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,394
If you're buried here,
no one will ever find your body.

463
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,148
They're looking for Mr. Kim's fingers.

464
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,417
What are those bastards doing?

465
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,836
I have no idea.

466
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,382
But, sir, why are you so worried
about Gu Jeong-man?

467
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,805
If he bothers you that much,
I can take care of him quietly.

468
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,224
You?

469
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,355
You don't know
what Gu Jeong-man's strength is, do you?

470
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,524
That bastard has strengths?

471
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:51,154
Gu Jeong-man
really fucking cares about his boys.

472
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,452
Give it back.

473
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,580
Forget it. Just stick to your cigarettes.

474
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,331
-Show me the photo.
-Sure.

475
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,048
Of course.

476
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,718
No one can clean up
quite like you, Jeong-man.

477
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,596
Do you have a cast iron stomach?

478
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,848
Here, this is for your trouble.

479
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,768
Thank you. I have to do
whatever brings in money.

480
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,686
I have all those boys to look after.

481
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,522
That's why his group keeps growing,
not shrinking,

482
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,816
even after doing this crap
for over a decade.

483
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,320
Still, they're just scrawny busters,
aren't they?

484
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,116
That's the problem.

485
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,912
You know anything
about those scrawny punks?

486
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,248
People are on the streets
with guns right now.

487
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,628
Could you fend off someone
you don't recognize or know by name

488
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,214
if he came at you with a gun?

489
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,092
That's why

490
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,471
the best option is to use the cop
to take out Gu Jeong-man.

491
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,517
But if he tells the police
what he did for you--

492
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,726
When did I say

493
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,479
I was going to hand him over alive?

494
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,483
Just watch

495
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,444
my plan unfold.

496
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,287
-Did you load everything?
-Yeah.

497
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,124
Let's go!

498
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,719
Yes. Gu Jeong-man has been busy digging
since morning, and now he's moving again.

499
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,202
Yes, sir.

500
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,957
Those bastards just entered the bathhouse.

501
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,667
The bathhouse?

502
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:15,173
That's their routine,
taking a bath after they dig.

503
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,632
Watch them closely.

504
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,218
When Gu Jeong-man leaves,
go to his office.

505
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,470
I'll go once I wrap up here.

506
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,893
Why, you motherfuckers.

507
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:30,021
Hey, get the hell out of here!

508
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,032
You bunch of fucking morons.

509
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,994
Hey, Mr. Gong is waiting
for Mr. Kim's fingers.

510
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,287
Go see him now.

511
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,123
Jeong-man.

512
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,501
Turn on the hot water before you leave.

513
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:04,222
Hey, move your head, damn it.
Let me take a look at his tool.

514
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,769
Man, his tool is tiny as shit.
What a fucking loser.

515
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,533
YAKAM TOURIST HOTEL

516
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,286
Damn it.
What's taking those bastards so long?

517
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,249
I gotta say, this doesn't look like
an ordinary public bathhouse.

518
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,002
Man, are these bastards trying
to mess with us?

519
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,880
Detective, that's Gu Jeong-man.

520
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,055
Detective Seo.

521
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,766
Gu Jeong-man is heading to the club now.

522
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,864
GU JEONG-MAN
I'M ON MY WAY WITH MR. KIM'S FINGERS

523
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,953
He's here.

524
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,789
Everyone, check your guns
and bulletproof vests.

525
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,750
There could be a shooting,
so be on high alert.

526
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,134
Stay alert.

527
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,153
Hey, come in.

528
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,582
What's with you?

529
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:57,918
Good to see you.

530
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,838
Gong, you fucking bitch.

531
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,050
You asked for my fingers, didn't you?

532
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,597
So,

533
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,808
are you gonna cut my fingers off?

534
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,352
No.

535
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,813
I don't use knives anymore.

536
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,607
Then what?

537
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,735
Take him all of your fingers yourself.

538
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,738
I'll give you a gun.

539
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,664
Gu Jeong-man, that motherfucker…

540
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,088
What the fuck was that?

541
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,799
Hey.

542
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,637
How do you like my tool?

543
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,764
Dope, isn't it?

544
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:58,469
