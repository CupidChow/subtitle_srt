1
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,070
You said you'd never pick up a gun again.

2
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,115
So why join the police?

3
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,244
I believe there are ways

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,165
to protect people without using a gun.

5
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,878
I see.

6
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,172
Welcome.

7
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,215
Captain, shall we head inside?

8
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,842
Come on in.

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,763
This is Officer Seo Jae-hui,

10
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,766
Lieutenant Ahn Ji-wan,
and Inspector Oh Dae-han.

11
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,022
I said piss off!

12
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,942
You're killing my damn buzz,
for fuck's sake.

13
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,071
What the hell does your daughter's death

14
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,282
have to do with us?

15
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,285
I came here
after identifying my daughter's body.

16
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,789
Don't you dare insult my daughter's death.

17
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,040
Cut the bullshit.

18
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,417
Get this old man's mug out of here.

19
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,877
So what? Huh?

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,670
What do you want from us?

21
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,548
What do you want? Did we kill her?

22
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,468
So why the hell
are you crashing our party?

23
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,719
Did I fucking kill her?

24
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,013
What do you want from us?

25
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,266
Apologize at my daughter's funeral.

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,437
Apologize?
Did your daughter ask you to do this?

27
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,024
Unless you wanna join your daughter
in the morgue,

28
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,985
just shut the fuck up
and piss off, motherfucker.

29
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,487
Who's the old guy?

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,404
I said piss off.

31
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,989
Don't fucking mind it.

32
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,908
-Piss off.
-It's pissing me off.

33
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,077
I said piss off, you fucking son of a--

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,589
Where the fuck are you going?

35
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,926
Damn it.

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,138
What the fuck? That bastard is crazy!

37
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,347
Someone died…

38
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,518
yet you people don't feel any guilt.

39
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,522
There is no hope left for you.

40
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,067
Please don't kill me.

41
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,026
Please…

42
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,778
What?

43
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,613
Please spare me.

44
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,365
-Please.
-Sir.

45
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,285
Please spare me this once. I…

46
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,413
Please just spare me this once. Sir.

47
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,290
Just this once!

48
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,667
Please spare me.

49
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,169
Please, I'm begging you.

50
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,296
Why didn't you…

51
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,092
spare my daughter?

52
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,220
You fucking bastard!

53
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,722
Out of my way.

54
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,573
-Excuse me. A gun.
-Hey.

55
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,074
-What?
-A crazy bastard. A gun.

56
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,534
There's a gun.

57
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,077
A gun.

58
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,832
That crazy bastard has a gun.

59
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,015
Fuck this shit!

60
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,562
Help me!

61
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,694
Put the gun down!

62
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,990
I said put it down!

63
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,833
Please spare me.

64
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,918
Put the gun down!

65
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,005
Please show mercy, just this once!

66
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,929
But how did you know
this chaos was coming, Mr. Wang?

67
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,266
None of your business.
Just focus on the shot.

68
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,188
Get that shot over there.

69
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,740
Wait, one moment.

70
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,704
I'm Officer Lee Do from Domyeong.

71
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,039
Let me try talking to him.

72
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,795
Do.

73
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
Captain.

74
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,428
Don't come any closer.

75
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,357
You know better than anyone

76
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,777
that this won't bring Se-yeong back.

77
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,245
So put the gun down.

78
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,333
Yeah, I thought
I knew that better than anyone.

79
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:44,635
I believed that arresting scumbags
like him over and over until the end…

80
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,141
would bring justice to the victims
who were wronged.

81
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,645
You've been doing it so well until now.

82
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,027
No.

83
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,529
I actually didn't know.

84
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,868
I didn't know anything at all.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,044
Now I can finally see reality
for what it is.

86
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,963
What the fuck are you people doing?

87
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,051
Don't just stand there and watch. Help me!

88
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,227
Hold your fire.

89
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,480
This is the limit of the law and of us.

90
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,817
The law can't do anything.

91
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,614
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,534
But I've made up my mind now.

93
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,829
Don't let that feeling fool you.

94
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,498
When I first picked up a gun,

95
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,835
do you remember…

96
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,755
what you told me?

97
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,340
Do.

98
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,055
All of us adults here

99
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,643
will make sure that bad man gets punished.

100
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,437
My mom,

101
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,313
dad,

102
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,775
and little brother
were all brutally killed,

103
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,863
but that man is happily
stuffing his face with bread.

104
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,906
This is wrong!

105
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,367
Yes, this is wrong.

106
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,202
You're right about everything.

107
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,245
But

108
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,457
if you shoot that gun right now…

109
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,920
it's only going to make his life easier.

110
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,050
You know, scumbags like him
should be sent to prison

111
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,928
to be punished for their deeds
for the rest of their lives.

112
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,513
No.

113
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,100
I don't think I'll be satisfied

114
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,228
unless I pull the trigger.

115
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,899
Don't let that feeling fool you.
None of it is real.

116
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,235
The satisfaction will only last
for a moment.

117
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,072
Killing a bad person…

118
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,286
is the right thing to do, isn't it?

119
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,666
Say you kill him.

120
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,461
What about your future?

121
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,923
You'll end up ruining your entire life.

122
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,761
So just trust me this once.

123
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,221
I promise.

124
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,351
I will prove to you that not shooting him
was the right thing to do later.

125
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,852
So, Do…

126
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,233
Come on, Do.
Please put the gun down, okay? Please.

127
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,615
In the end, all we could do
was send him to prison.

128
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,535
Why does that matter?

129
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,332
Thanks to you, Captain,
I've kept my life together.

130
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,545
If something happened to you as well…

131
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,173
how would I go on?

132
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,970
Anyway, are you not taking
the promotion exam again?

133
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,765
I'm happy and comfortable where I am.

134
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,849
Look.

135
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,645
With your age,
skills, experience, and abilities,

136
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,314
not to mention your solid build
and good looks,

137
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,568
you should've been a sergeant long ago,
if not higher.

138
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,697
You fought so hard
just to never pick up a gun again.

139
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,157
Where the hell are these guns coming from?

140
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,624
Don't jump in
and get yourself involved, all right?

141
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,420
I can't bear to see you get hurt.

142
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,463
Physically or mentally.

143
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,216
I'm begging you.

144
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,303
Give me

145
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,722
the gun.

146
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,572
Do.

147
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,535
How did you

148
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,165
bear this pain at such a young age?

149
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,838
It was all thanks to you, Captain.

150
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,677
EXCLUSIVE: SHOTS FIRED AT BAR IN GYEONGIN
POLICE IN STANDOFF WITH SUSPECT

151
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,433
This isn't what I had in mind.

152
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,962
Come here. Shoot from this angle.

153
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,762
Hey, Lee Do!

154
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,359
Lee Do!

155
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,542
Do.

156
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,424
I'm sorry…

157
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,594
Captain!

158
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,373
You did well.

159
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,421
The grown-ups are sorry.

160
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,884
I'm sorry, Do.

161
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,862
Let's head outside.

162
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,779
What?

163
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,490
We can't go out there.
That guy's got a gun.

164
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,617
You damn coward.

165
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,411
Hey, give me the camera!

166
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,063
Do you remember how many people
you've killed by pulling the trigger?

167
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,774
I mean…

168
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,279
I heard you spared no one as a mercenary,
adult or child.

169
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,824
But now,

170
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,869
you kill some

171
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,455
and save others.

172
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,628
Is that your definition of justice?

173
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:27,968
This is what you get
when you… straddle the line.

174
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,517
You disgust me.

175
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,770
Lee Do.

176
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,904
Well…

177
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,492
at least you were entertaining.

178
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,625
Just wait and see.

179
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,754
You'll wake up to a whole new world.

180
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,063
Are you filming now?

181
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,148
Yeah, it's coming out fine.

182
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,987
I am Moon Baek,

183
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,865
the mastermind
behind all the recent shootings.

184
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:39,164
As you can see,
South Korea is no longer safe from guns.

185
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,332
So I have…

186
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,834
What's that?

187
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,460
…prepared a gift.

188
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,004
Starting now…

189
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,046
EXCLUSIVE BREAKING NEWS

190
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,175
…regardless of age, gender,
occupation, or nationality,

191
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,178
if you want a gun, I'll give you one

192
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,975
with no restrictions or conditions.

193
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,064
Let me repeat that.

194
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,943
Regardless of age, gender,
occupation, or nationality,

195
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,030
if you want a gun, I'll give you one…

196
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,911
with no restrictions or conditions.

197
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,330
I'm not forcing anyone.

198
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,376
All I want is to give you the power
to protect yourself.

199
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,628
Why don't you do your job as a manager?

200
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,594
"Gun."

201
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,773
Hold him tighter.

202
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,068
His pulse is dropping.
We need to stop the bleeding first.

203
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,653
-Compression gauze, please.
-Here.

204
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,457
Please move. We're in a hurry!

205
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,710
Bed four.

206
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,713
On three. One, two, three.

207
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,842
-A gunshot victim?
-Yes.

208
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,387
-Check vitals and prep for transfusion.
-Yes, Doctor.

209
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,182
Just wait and see.

210
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,728
You'll wake up to a whole new world.

211
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,965
GYEONGIN EXPRESS

212
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,363
It's here! I finally got the gun.

213
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,032
South Korea is now a place
where guns get delivered.

214
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,743
A shocking incident took place in Korea,

215
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,372
where a police officer was shot
by a gun-trafficking organization.

216
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,625
Let's aim to hit 30 million won
in Super Chats today.

217
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,043
HE REALLY GOT A GUN

218
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,921
I truly hope Officer Lee wakes up

219
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,341
as soon as possible.

220
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,351
Unidentified packages
with firearms and ammunition

221
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,270
are being shipped nationwide.

222
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,772
Authorities are on high alert,

223
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,358
fearing that firearm distribution
via courier services

224
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,402
could lead to an active shooting.

225
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,071
Even martial law
wouldn't be enough right now.

226
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,282
No, it's still too early to judge.

227
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,367
How can you say that
after what's happened?

228
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,703
Our priority is
accurate situation assessment.

229
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,331
Given the defendant's intoxication,

230
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,584
first-time offense, and remorse,

231
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,462
I sentence them
to three years in prison and--

232
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,964
-I object.
-Excuse me?

233
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,302
I will personally carry out
his execution here and now.

234
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,807
This is seriously amazing.

235
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,309
You don't need a real gun.

236
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,519
Look, this looks just like a real gun.

237
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,773
With modifications,
an air gun can be deadlier than a firearm.

238
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:38,737
The random spread of guns has fueled fears
that anyone could be armed,

239
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,450
driving crowds to buy firearms blindly.

240
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,287
A nostalgic M16 costs only 20,000 won.

241
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,081
-Give me one first.
-I'll buy one too.

242
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,710
Give me a sec, all right?

243
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,922
Long-suppressed sociopathic tendencies

244
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,134
are now being triggered by these guns.

245
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,262
The real problem

246
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,222
is that this anxiety

247
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,016
is more contagious than expected.

248
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,395
Didn't I tell you
to submit the report before leaving?

249
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:16,316
Sir, I've worked nights for three weeks,
and it's my daughter's birthday today.

250
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,403
You think you're the only one
with a family and a daughter?

251
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,446
Why don't you just quit your job?

252
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,614
Understood, sir.

253
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,410
I'll bring her a birthday cake,
then head back to the office.

254
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,663
Damn, if only I could kill this bastard.

255
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,881
-Hey, welcome home.
-Daddy!

256
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,799
Yes?

257
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,926
This looks like a real gun.

258
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,392
GYEONGIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

259
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:06,825
Recent shootings
are fueling anxiety among citizens.

260
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,953
Many are avoiding going out
for routine tasks, and…

261
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,249
Yes, Mr. President.

262
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,378
Noted, Mr. President.

263
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,005
I will relay the message.

264
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,263
We're now declaring a national emergency.

265
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,269
There has never been
a time of greater conflict in history.

266
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,271
Do you remember
the early days of COVID-19?

267
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,858
It only took three days
for masks to sell out nationwide.

268
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:44,905
Who would just sit back and watch
as guns spread across the nation?

269
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:49,534
While you two were speaking,
a shocking poll result came in.

270
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:55,540
Over 40% said that gun ownership
should be legalized in Korea.

271
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,919
Including conditional permits,
the majority supports it.

272
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,507
The number of packages collected
is too low.

273
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,926
Four million packages
are distributed daily.

274
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,553
We can't possibly manage it this way.

275
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,557
South Korea, once drug-free,
is now a place

276
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,187
where drugs are accessible
anytime, anywhere.

277
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,898
Would it be any different for guns?

278
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:23,443
The emergence
of firearms of unknown origin

279
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,822
is bringing significant changes
to our society.

280
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,659
What is your opinion
on legalizing gun ownership?

281
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,244
Please sign our petition.

282
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,625
Say no to guns!

283
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,710
"Say no"? Come on, man.

284
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,840
This country had knife attacks in daylight
even before we had guns.

285
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,718
Now those lunatics will bring guns
to schools, hospitals, and day cares.

286
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,055
By that logic, even school teachers
and doctors should be carrying guns.

287
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,099
-You call that a country?
-That's right!

288
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:59,354
People like you, who incite gun violence,
should be locked up immediately.

289
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,565
What if our kids get shot by those guns?

290
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,942
To protect your kids,
we need guns even more.

291
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:04,860
Exactly!

292
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,947
If we all have guns,
they'll be too afraid to pull out theirs.

293
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,407
Don't be ridiculous!

294
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,076
-How is that ridiculous?
-Have you lost your mind?

295
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:20,375
The empty streets
are filling up with protesters.

296
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,337
The widespread public fear of guns
is taking a new turn.

297
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,216
All shipped items were delivered
without any issues.

298
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,803
Get ready

299
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,181
for the next step.

300
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,189
Are you feeling any discomfort?

301
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,732
No, I'm fine.

302
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,743
-I'll see you at your afternoon checkup.
-Okay.

303
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,291
Finish these tonight.

304
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,460
We have the head nurse's evaluation
next week.

305
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,880
We don't want any issues with our team,
so finish everything today.

306
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,842
But this is just too much.

307
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,094
I'm on the night shift again today.

308
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,721
So what?

309
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,474
You're talking back to me now, huh?

310
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,768
And that's hardly anything.

311
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,978
It's only hard
because you're so damn slow.

312
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,523
Okay, I'll do it.

313
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,728
We're at each other's throats
every chance we get,

314
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,772
so why have we been meeting
so often lately?

315
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,316
We might become too close.

316
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,278
Hey, you came here
for the same reason we did,

317
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,155
so how about you shut that mouth of yours?

318
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,576
The world's changing.

319
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,246
How can we sit still? We must change too.

320
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,249
If we don't want to get shot
and killed like Gong.

321
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,418
-Are we at a funeral?
-Who's that?

322
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,878
Why the gloomy vibe?

323
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,881
Didn't you come to buy guns?
If not, I'll just leave.

324
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,759
Is this for fucking real?

325
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,389
Hey, you little shit. How old are you?

326
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,058
You little punk,
how dare you walk in like you own--

327
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,566
Does being older give you
a free pass to everything in this country?

328
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,862
Why does everyone look so shocked?
Never seen someone die before?

329
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,283
If you're all done gawking,
pay attention to me.

330
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,660
Stay focused and get serious.

331
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,038
I'm looking for a new partner,

332
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,415
but too many cooks spoil the broth.

333
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,541
I only want one.

334
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,465
Whoever shoots me with that gun.

335
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,634
First come, first served. Just one.

336
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,266
Stay the fuck where you are.

337
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,105
It's probably easier to use than a knife.

338
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,150
Shoot me.

339
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,611
You think we're fucking stupid?

340
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,489
You think I won't shoot, you motherfucker?

341
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,865
Shoot me already.

342
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,868
You fucking piece of shit.
Fuck you, motherfucker!

343
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,865
Did that scare you?

344
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,621
Be sure to answer my calls.

345
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,498
I will.

346
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,917
And clean this up.

347
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,138
GYEONGIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

348
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,452
Officially, you've taken down 99 targets.

349
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,996
As of today, the count is 100.

350
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,291
You just wanted to shoot them all down,
didn't you?

351
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,629
And at 27 Baekju-ro,

352
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,008
there's someone about to pull the trigger.

353
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,801
Lee Do!

354
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,252
You're awake.

355
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,050
You shouldn't move. You need to rest.

356
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,886
Where's my captain?

357
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:05,970
You shouldn't.

358
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,599
Please calm down.

359
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,352
