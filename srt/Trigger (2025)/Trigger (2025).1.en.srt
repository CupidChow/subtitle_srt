1
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,441
There has been an increase
in reports of youths in distress

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,235
due to excessive anger within peer groups

3
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,904
and the emotional challenges that follow.

4
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:34,367
A public servant took their life
after enduring malicious complaints.

5
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,286
Experts say this phenomenon

6
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:41,124
is due to a mental disorder
called intermittent explosive disorder.

7
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,126
A study also found that our students face

8
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,004
some of the highest academic stress
in the world.

9
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,632
Currently, in South Korea,
random assaults and homicides are rampant,

10
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,635
and incidents like animal cruelty
continue to occur.

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,929
According to
annual global suicide statistics,

12
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:59,392
South Korea has the highest suicide rate
among OECD member countries.

13
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,772
VOLUNTARY ISOLATION

14
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,774
SOCIAL ANXIETY

15
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,443
DOPAMINE ADDICTION

16
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,778
ROAD RAGE, DATING VIOLENCE

17
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,750
-Sobriety check, please.
-Sure.

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,178
Officer Lee,
is everything good at Domyeong Market?

19
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,888
Yes, everything is fine.

20
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,359
My neck.

21
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:55,031
You're driving me nuts.
What rotten luck to start the morning.

22
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,326
Seriously, why would you ram
into a stationary car?

23
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,120
You should watch where you're going!

24
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,748
Look here, young lady.

25
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,667
Do you even know how to drive?

26
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,961
-I'm so sorry.
-Good God.

27
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,212
Good morning.

28
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,507
Please calm down. Are you badly injured?

29
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,176
I totally think I've got whiplash.

30
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,053
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

31
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,763
Let's all calm down.

32
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,391
Why don't you report the accident
to your insurance first

33
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,934
and then move your cars?

34
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,978
As you can see, the traffic is backed up.

35
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,522
Thank you. Bye.

36
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,862
Let me help you with that.

37
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,117
NURSE
PARK SO-HYEON

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,618
You must be exhausted.

39
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,536
Oh, yes.

40
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,540
I was on my way home after a night shift
and dozed off while driving.

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,043
Are you okay to drive?
You should consider calling a driver.

42
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,422
No, I'm wide awake now,
so I should be okay. Thank you.

43
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,966
-I see. Drive safely.
-Have a good day.

44
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,688
RANKED SAFEST COUNTRY
FOR 10 CONSECUTIVE YEARS

45
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,401
Look here. Come on.

46
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,820
-Hey, it's 5,000 won.
-I'm not interested.

47
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,781
Why not? It's 5,000 won.

48
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,451
It's 5,000 won. What do you think?

49
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,369
It's 5,000 won. You want one?

50
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,164
It's only 5,000 won.

51
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,665
Hey, 5,000 won!

52
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,297
Wait, this is a lighter!

53
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,090
A cigarette lighter.

54
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,053
No guns are allowed in Korea.

55
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,847
You're not allowed to own guns
in Korea, right?

56
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,099
Good grief. Don't worry.

57
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,434
You're not buying, right?

58
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,561
Have a good trip.

59
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,397
As you just saw,

60
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,318
this new gas lighter is so real
that it will stun even foreigners.

61
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,487
It's 10,000 won for a nostalgic M16,

62
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,447
and 5,000 won for a Glock.

63
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,700
You know what it never runs out of? Gas!

64
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,410
THIS SEAT IS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN

65
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:11,960
Excuse me.

66
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,255
This seat is for pregnant women.

67
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,006
What?

68
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,177
This seat is for pregnant women,
and this lady is standing.

69
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,012
I think you should give her the seat.

70
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,224
Hey, why the hell do you care?

71
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,353
No, it's just that…

72
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,189
It's not mandatory per se,

73
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,192
but rules are made
for everyone to follow, so--

74
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,611
Man, I'm already tired enough as it is.

75
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,322
I'm fine.

76
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,075
People are looking.

77
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,248
Well, sir…

78
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,375
Please stop. I'm really okay.

79
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,794
Besides, I'm getting off soon.

80
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,547
Thank you.

81
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,805
It's 10,000 won for an M16.
It's as good as free. Check it out.

82
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,596
Please watch where you're going.

83
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,021
ENGLISH ACADEMY

85
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,825
How would Party A feel?
They'd be shocked, right?

86
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,994
So Party A doesn't permit--

87
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:15,041
Hey, I told you not to come in
if you thought you'd be late!

88
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,877
Everyone,
look at how terrible he is with time.

89
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,838
That's why he fails his exam every year.

90
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,805
DILIGENCE
SHORTCUT TO PASSING!

91
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,139
Hurry! Get out!

92
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,536
Well, I feel so much better now.

93
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,257
The test results
are much worse than last time.

94
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,009
As time goes on,

95
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,222
this and this keep fighting.

96
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,599
This wants me to do something,

97
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,726
but this suppresses it.

98
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,395
It's confusing.

99
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,690
You haven't been taking
your meds lately, have you?

100
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,111
The medicine makes me drowsy,
so I find it hard to study.

101
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,657
If I fail again this year,
it'll be my tenth year.

102
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,618
Everyone lives with emotions

103
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,915
like anxiety, compulsion, and depression.

104
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,794
We just have different ways
of controlling and alleviating them.

105
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,964
Does that mean I'm normal?

106
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,300
As long as

107
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,801
your head

108
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,597
is not overpowered by your heart.

109
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,189
Everyone carries a trigger in their heart.

110
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,859
But a person with a healthy mind

111
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,070
would never pull that trigger.

112
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:15,036
The medication will help keep you
from pulling the trigger, Jeong-tae.

113
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,709
Everyone has a trigger.

114
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,714
Wow, so many of them came out.

115
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,343
Why is this damn country
so rife with conflict?

116
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,970
At this scale,

117
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,349
it's almost like
someone is inciting the conflict, right?

118
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,354
You still don't see
how easy you have it, do you?

119
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,483
Hey, what does it matter
whether it's incited or voluntary?

120
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,447
It's all money for us,
so take their pictures with gratitude.

121
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,159
Come on, Reporter Wang.
What are you saying?

122
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,788
We now live in a world
where conflict makes money.

123
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,123
Make it look ten times more crowded.

124
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,043
Workers, rise up
and fight for your rights!

125
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,379
Rise up!

126
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,840
That's our bread and butter, after all.

127
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,596
Hey there!

128
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:21,185
You haven't paid your rent in ten months.
How do you expect me to survive?

129
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,645
Not gonna come out?

130
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,022
Fine, then. I've had enough of this.

131
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,027
Goodness. What's that rotten stench?

132
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,076
Look at all these bills.
What's with all this trash?

133
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,954
I shouldn't have rented this place out.

134
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,122
This is seriously…

135
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,130
Anything on the body?

136
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,966
There's no sign of forced entry.

137
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,426
No sign of a homicide either.

138
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,637
Looking at the marks on his neck,
suicide is the most likely cause.

139
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,848
All right.

140
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,642
Detective Seo!

141
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,768
Yeah?

142
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,271
-I found something here.
-What is it?

143
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,363
What is this?

144
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,951
-What are these kids doing here?
-Hello.

145
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,119
Hello.

146
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,037
-Hi.
-Hello.

147
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
So,

148
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,582
what brings you here?

149
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,459
We found this on the street.

150
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,961
Really?

151
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,758
-Hold on, kids.
-Yes?

152
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,384
-Take one.
-Wow!

153
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,637
-Wow!
-Thank you.

154
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,805
Hey, kids. One each.

155
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,098
-One each.
-Take more.

156
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,600
-Take two or three.
-Thank you.

157
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,935
-Sure. Off you go.
-Thank you.

158
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,062
Hey, Do.

159
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,939
Don't give out so many.
It's all taxpayer money.

160
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,108
You had way more than they did, sir.

161
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,070
If my blood sugar drops at my age,
I'll go straight into shock.

162
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,906
-Would you like one, then?
-Should I?

163
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,909
I really shouldn't.
It's almost time for lunch, right?

164
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,876
-Hey. What's up?
-Hey, Do.

165
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,421
I have a situation here.
Can you come over for a second?

166
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,888
-He had these on his body?
-Yeah.

167
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,850
In all my years as a police officer,
I've never seen anything like this.

168
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,313
I thought you might know something,
so I called you first.

169
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,150
You're pretty much an expert in this area.

170
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,069
What do you think?

171
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,574
Obviously, these must not be registered.

172
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,994
Did you find anything besides the bullets?

173
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:44,912
Nope.

174
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,416
Do you think
they were smuggled out of a military base?

175
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,253
I'm not sure.

176
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:56,340
Out of all bullets, these are only used
by a small portion of the military.

177
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,968
They're not easy to get hold of.

178
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,471
What was the deceased's job?

179
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,182
Unemployed, apparently.

180
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,685
Unemployed?

181
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,769
Yeah.

182
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,945
He has a criminal record
and got out of prison not too long ago.

183
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,824
We checked the house thoroughly,
but there was nothing unusual.

184
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,705
Man, even one missing shell casing
is a huge deal in the military,

185
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,083
but here we are
with a whole bunch of bullets.

186
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,297
What's up?

187
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,883
You see something?

188
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,103
Holy crap. What's all this?

189
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,033
YEONGSEONG GOSIWON

190
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,830
Why do these broke-ass morons
keep ordering stuff all the time?

191
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,089
Are you done with this?

192
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,007
Yeah.

193
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,533
Just stop it already.

194
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,995
Just let me study, for God's sake.

195
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,248
Babe, you're driving me crazy.

196
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,877
You fucking like that shit?

197
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,551
YU JEONG-TAE

198
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,515
Just when I thought I'd seen it all.

199
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,936
Seriously? Dozens of bullets
pouring down from the ceiling?

200
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,522
It would be ridiculous, even in a movie.

201
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,694
But where the hell did that bastard
even get all those bullets?

202
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,073
I'm not sure. Detective Seo
is looking into it, so he'll find out.

203
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,784
Yeah, just sit back and wait.

204
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,872
Don't butt in
just because you know that stuff, okay?

205
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,667
They say, "Ignorance is bliss,
and knowledge is a curse," right?

206
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,839
Anyway, you're not taking
the promotion exam again?

207
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,634
I'm happy and comfortable where I am.

208
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,388
I'm uncomfortable
seeing you like this, you punk.

209
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,098
Look.

210
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,977
Given your age,
skills, experience, and abilities,

211
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,855
you should've been a sergeant long ago,
if not higher.

212
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,816
Others are just dying to get a promotion.

213
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,359
Good grief.

214
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,530
The disobedient subordinate
or the daughter driving me up the wall.

215
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,366
I don't know who to be more upset with.

216
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,535
What's up with Se-yeong?

217
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,871
She's insisting on moving out now.

218
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,832
She says work-life balance
is important or something.

219
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,752
-Isn't it time she moved out?
-What?

220
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,838
Are you taking Se-yeong's side?

221
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,676
She's using up every penny
of her hard-earned money.

222
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,596
I wouldn't be this upset
if she were paying monthly rent.

223
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,683
Why does she have to get a loan
just to get a jeonse and move out?

224
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,268
She's chasing work-life balance

225
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,188
while I'm completely losing
my emotional balance.

226
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,692
This way! Do, this is my daughter's car.

227
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,903
-Just one more round.
-No, we've had enough.

228
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,823
You shouldn't keep
piling up debt like that, you punk.

229
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,241
Seriously.

230
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,869
You're moving out?

231
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,870
Yeah.

232
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,580
I'm so excited.

233
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,541
The commute alone took two hours.

234
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:04,088
It only takes me 30 minutes now,
and it's a new building. Amazing, right?

235
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,340
Do you need anything?

236
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:10,094
Maybe just a TV, sofa, and fridge?

237
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,178
That's about it.

238
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,638
Just go home now.

239
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,847
Cheapskate.

240
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,182
-See you!
-Okay.

241
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,100
Bye.

242
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,367
Come in, Lee Do!

243
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,869
All units are isolated. Retreat, everyone!

244
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,498
We can't. There are still survivors
on the battlefield.

245
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,875
We must retreat first.
That's an order. Retreat!

246
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,294
Sergeant Lee!

247
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,590
Bullets are flying from everywhere.
Help me, Sergeant Lee.

248
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,759
Sergeant Lee!

249
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,013
Why, your grades are excellent.

250
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,640
Goodness, you're quite well-built too.

251
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,851
And a black belt in tae kwon do.

252
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,438
I majored in physical education
and served in the Marine Corps!

253
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,480
Wow.

254
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,983
What a remarkable guy.

255
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,361
Thank you. Certain… I mean, yes, sir!

256
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,114
Yeah, sure. Let's give it our all.

257
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,869
So, who is my training officer?

258
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,163
Well, the one who will be training you…

259
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,540
There he is. Behind you.

260
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,715
Were you an admin soldier by any chance?

261
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,135
-Sorry?
-You know…

262
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:38,390
I thought you might be one
after seeing you type so carefully.

263
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,894
Being a police officer
involves lots of paperwork.

264
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,938
You'll get accustomed to it in no time.

265
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,860
But paperwork is not really my thing.

266
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,487
You know,

267
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,449
I'm gonna round up
every single bad guy I lay my eyes on.

268
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:59,745
And if it seems like a violent crime,
I'll just fire my gun to solve it

269
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,081
and head right
to the Regional Investigation Unit.

270
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,167
Doesn't it look like
I'd be a good fit for that?

271
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,502
Sure.

272
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,128
LISTEN TO MY DEAD SON'S MESSAGE!

273
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,922
APOLOGIZE!
BAN DANGEROUS OUTSOURCING

274
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,650
WORKERS MUST BE SAVED,
NOT CORPORATIONS

275
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,318
Ma'am.

276
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,446
You can't do this here.

277
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,616
I'm not breaking any laws.

278
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,327
Well, we received a complaint about this.

279
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,455
As per the rules and principles,
we must handle all complaints.

280
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,373
Mrs. Oh.

281
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,835
Excuse me,
I'm just doing what I do every day.

282
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,295
Am I not allowed today?

283
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,255
Not at all.

284
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,466
One-person protests are legally protected,
so there's no problem.

285
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,010
There's no problem at all,

286
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,180
but gatherings of two or more
must be reported as a rally.

287
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,558
Look at him over there.

288
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,019
As long as you stay 20 meters away
from him, no one can bother you.

289
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,481
If anyone bothers you,
you know what to do.

290
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,111
SEOBU POLICE STATION
LEE DO

291
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,196
You still have it.

292
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,410
Sir.

293
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,703
Sir!

294
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,539
Sir!

295
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,790
-I just--
-What's wrong?

296
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,250
I just want to talk to you.

297
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,751
Why is that so hard?

298
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,004
Officer Lee.
Isn't this preferential treatment?

299
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,257
-I know you are in the car!
-Please, ma'am.

300
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,341
In what way?

301
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,511
Aren't they reporting her
for obstruction of business every hour?

302
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,140
I feel like we, as the police,
should resolve this complaint.

303
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,018
As I said, it's legally protected.

304
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,353
Let's just talk, please!

305
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,440
Her son took on a dangerous job
that no one else would do

306
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,484
for only a third
of a regular employee's salary

307
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,278
and ended up dying in an accident.

308
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,990
But no one apologized
or took responsibility,

309
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,034
and she was forced to cremate his body.

310
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,121
It's also our job
to properly inform them of their rights

311
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,164
and look after them.

312
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,917
Sir!

313
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,001
Go help her.

314
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,295
She might fall ill.

315
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,088
I just want to talk.

316
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:17,966
Ma'am?

317
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,556
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

318
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,101
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

319
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,482
There's no need to give me anything.

320
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,942
It's nothing.

321
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,862
You need strength to keep fighting.
Standing here all day must be tiring.

322
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,656
At least eat something.

323
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,990
YAKGWA

324
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,914
I'm just sorry and grateful.

325
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,124
It's really nothing much.

326
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,337
This is the entry for vehicles,
so let's move.

327
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,297
-Here, let me carry that.
-Goodness.

328
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,760
YEONGSEONG GOSIWON
FULLY FURNISHED

329
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:31,957
What is it?

330
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,209
Someone ate my food again.

331
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,585
What food?

332
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,797
My mom made some braised anchovies
and sent them to me.

333
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,966
I put it in my spot with my name on it

334
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,927
and hid it behind the kimchi container,
but everything's moved.

335
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,013
Seriously? Who pulled that crap this time?

336
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,726
I've put notes on my food countless times,

337
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,853
asking people not to touch it.
Why don't you--

338
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,273
I got it already!
How many times do you have to say it?

339
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,401
And you know unit 306?

340
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,613
I keep hearing a woman moan from there.
He must be bringing his girlfriend.

341
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,365
No way, Jeong-tae!

342
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,994
Why enjoy that good stuff by yourself?
You should've called me right away.

343
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,996
Outsiders are not allowed here.

344
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,668
Rules are meant to be followed.
Why doesn't anyone here follow them?

345
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,380
Jeong-tae, I'm begging you.

346
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,342
Don't just stay cooped up
in your room studying.

347
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,928
Go outside, get some sun,
and breathe in some fresh air.

348
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,972
Why are you so uptight?

349
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,600
That's how you get fucked up,
become a social misfit,

350
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,226
a lunatic with a victim mentality.

351
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,396
Are you ignoring me now?

352
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,608
It's called advice, not ignoring.

353
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,694
All right, I get it. Now go and study.

354
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,946
Just go. I get it, so leave now.

355
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,910
MANAGER'S OFFICE
PLEASE KNOCK

356
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,164
What are you doing?

357
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,624
Fucking useless morons.

358
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:04,966
What?

359
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,511
I'm from unit 307.

360
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,723
You can't smoke in your room,
with the smoke and all.

361
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,601
That's why I have the door open
to air it out.

362
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,855
If you let the air out like this,
the smoke spreads to other rooms.

363
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:23,151
This is a smoke-free zone.
That's the rule, so we should all--

364
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,611
You fucking son of a bitch.

365
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,490
What did you say? The rule?

366
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,700
Hey, you fucker.

367
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,203
This was you, wasn't it?

368
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,541
Do I look like some loser
who steals your food? Do I?

369
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,502
I just put it as a notice for…

370
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,962
Shut your damn mouth.

371
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,428
See what happens
if you post something like this again.

372
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,679
I'll kill you for real.

373
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,438
If you got that, piss off,
you motherfucker.

374
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,114
Fucking son of a bitch.

375
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,062
You fucking maniac. Keep it down!

376
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,318
You can't, you crazy bastard.

377
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,989
Control yourself, you crazy bastard.

378
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,759
Control yourself.

379
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,887
Control yourself.

380
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,350
Maybe no one's home?

381
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,562
Who is it?

382
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,818
Hello, is this
Ms. Park Kyeong-ja's residence?

383
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,570
"Park Kyeong-ja"?

384
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,906
Oh, Mom went to the grocery store.

385
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,117
You recently installed
a water purifier, right?

386
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,369
This is our first maintenance visit.

387
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,287
Come in.

388
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,165
Excuse me.

389
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,044
It's inside.

390
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,186
Have you experienced any issues
with the purifier?

391
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,564
No.

392
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,357
I love it so much.

393
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,192
Totally my type.

394
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,988
Let me know if you'd like a model
with an ice dispenser.

395
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,826
I'll arrange everything for you
with a special deal.

396
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,751
"Special deal"?

397
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,476
A special deal, huh?

398
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,936
You startled me.

399
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,942
Yes, there are many different freebies.

400
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,737
I see. "Freebies."

401
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,410
Would you like a cold drink?

402
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,205
No, I'm fine.

403
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,289
Right.

404
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,238
You're not married, are you?

405
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,574
Actually, I've been married for a while.

406
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,827
Right.

407
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,705
So you're a married woman.

408
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,833
I guess you aren't married yet.

409
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,670
You should find a good woman
and get married soon.

410
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,407
Probably unlikely, huh?

411
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,324
Sorry?

412
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,494
I'm not sure what you mean.

413
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,038
I'm talking about marriage.

414
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,504
Sorry, that's none of my business.

415
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,590
I'll finish up quickly.

416
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,305
Finish up.

417
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,891
I'm going out for a smoke.

418
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,817
You're leaving?

419
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,924
Is Mr. Jeon home?

420
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,719
What do you want?

421
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,429
This is the police.

422
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:11,059
We need to check your ankle monitor.
The signal's been acting up.

423
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,143
Is this a good time?

424
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,521
No, it's not.

425
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,272
Well, if it's not…

426
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,442
Sir, I'm done changing
your water purifier filter.

427
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,777
Have a good day.

428
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,861
Ms. Ko Ji-yeong.

429
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,113
Come back soon.

430
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,450
I'll switch to the purifier
that dispenses ice.

431
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,757
Could you take a quick look inside?

432
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,883
Sure thing.

433
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,478
God, that scared me.

434
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,651
Are you all right?

435
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,570
Thank you so much for earlier.

436
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,114
Did something happen in there?

437
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,283
I saw his ankle monitor.

438
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,369
And I got so scared, so…

439
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,663
Next time you make a home visit,

440
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:17,000
it might be helpful
to check the sex offender registry.

441
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,383
Officer Lee, I'll check his ankle monitor.

442
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,969
I'm going to take a look around.

443
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,529
Mr. Jeon Won-seong.
Do you have any family?

444
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,989
I live alone. Why?

445
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,450
Gonna set me up with a woman?

446
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,913
I see.

447
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,415
Then who is Park Kyeong-ja?

448
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,044
My mom. Why?

449
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,630
But you just said you live alone.

450
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:08,009
Hey, what are you trying to do here?
Pick a fight? Joke around?

451
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,805
Who could live under their own name
with this on their ankle?

452
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,141
For fuck's sake, seriously.

453
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,643
You scared me.

454
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,397
Well, there's no need to get so upset.

455
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,863
Look at this motherfucker
running his mouth.

456
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,534
Please don't swear.

457
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,164
I just did, you motherfucking pig.
What are you gonna do about it?

458
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,832
Fucking hell.

459
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,542
All right, I get it.

460
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,088
Put your foot out without a fuss.
I'll just check it and leave.

461
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,048
Come on.

462
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,383
Your foot!

463
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,054
Here, my fucking foot.
Do whatever the hell you want.

464
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,146
So your name's Jang Jeong-u?

465
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,696
Are both your parents still alive?

466
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,365
That's enough.

467
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,001
How's the signal right now?

468
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,711
There doesn't seem to be issues.

469
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,715
I checked the seam and the back,
and there were no marks.

470
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,383
Yes.

471
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,719
Too bad, Jeong-u.

472
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,767
Your parents will be crushed.

473
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,901
You motherfucker! Let go of me.

474
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,701
No issues?

475
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,327
Well,

476
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,038
no.

477
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,457
No issues with the monitor.

478
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,835
For fuck's sake!

479
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,172
Why is everyone out to get me?

480
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,716
Let's go.

481
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,553
Hey!

482
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,597
You two, stop right there.

483
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,850
I may have committed a crime,

484
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,020
but I still have human rights!

485
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,107
Why do you police insist
on suffocating me like this?

486
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,442
Why?

487
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,988
If you keep ignoring my rights
and suffocating me like this,

488
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,823
I won't take it anymore.

489
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,624
You're wearing that ankle monitor
because we respect human rights.

490
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,461
Got it?

491
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,930
What a fucking joke.

492
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,640
"Respect"?

493
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,810
He said respect. Respect!

494
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,487
I'm sorry, Officer Lee.

495
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,701
No need to be sorry.
Just remember this one thing in the field.

496
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,663
Treat victims with empathy

497
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,374
and criminals with the law.

498
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:30,461
Yes, sir. I'll take your words to heart.

499
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,964
Officer Jang.

500
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,217
-Yes?
-Don't just take them to heart.

501
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,969
When we get back, type it up

502
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,679
in Malgun Gothic font, size 11.

503
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,472
Right. Yes.

504
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,307
Font size 11.

505
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,480
Yet another shooting took place.

506
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,693
At least 15 victims were killed
in an elementary school shooting…

507
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,613
What kind of developed country
has shootings all the time? Fucking scary.

508
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,531
Hey.

509
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:03,202
That's why our country
is a fucking great place to live, right?

510
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,414
Let's turn to our US correspondent,
Bae Su-hyeon.

511
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,333
A great place, my ass.
Thank God Hell Joseon has no guns.

512
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,503
All three of us
already know how to shoot guns.

513
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,754
We all did our service.

514
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,841
Hey, quit the unrealistic talk
and check this out.

515
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,635
Bitcoin is tanking again. Seriously.

516
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,554
Are you still fucking into Bitcoin?

517
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,806
-You're addicted.
-I hit my overdraft limit.

518
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,988
-You jackass, I…
-Seriously!

519
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,323
Hey, for fuck's sake…

520
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,868
Local authorities are investigating
the exact details of the incident.

521
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,453
NO DRINKING! NO SMOKING! NO SHOUTING!

522
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,123
They are considering additional measures
to improve school and community safety.

523
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,041
The shooting…

524
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,418
What the hell?
What's up with that bastard?

525
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,297
One blank round, four live rounds.
All clear!

526
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,717
Can I really trust you?

527
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,801
Sir.

528
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,761
LOUNGE, ARMORY

529
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:06,474
I was the top marksman in the 313th class
of the Central Police Academy.

530
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,060
All right, then. Fill that out.

531
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,695
What about Officer Lee?
Isn't he taking a gun?

532
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,282
Officer Lee prefers to use his Taser.

533
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,951
Is that so?

534
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,370
Anyway, I doubt
you'll even end up using it.

535
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,372
But still, take good care of it, okay?

536
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,540
-Yes, understood.
-Off you go, then.

537
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,968
It's so nice and peaceful.

538
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,553
Night duty is a walk in the park--

539
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,055
Get over here, you punk.

540
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,974
What was that? "Peaceful"?

541
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,517
That's a banned word for us.

542
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,726
-Take it back.
-Yes, sir.

543
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,852
-Blow it away.
-Whoosh!

544
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,188
What am I going to do with you, punk?

545
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,648
-Hey, Lee Do!
-Sir?

546
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,316
Train him properly!

547
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,194
-Seriously, this punk!
-Officer Jang?

548
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,858
You like that? Fuck!

549
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:39,942
Please cut it out.

550
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,610
Yeah, babe.

551
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,072
I'm going to make you fucking scream.

552
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,241
Please.

553
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,675
For fuck's sake! I'm right next door!

554
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,136
What the hell?
You said no one lived next door.

555
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,639
So what? Fuck, that just makes it
even more exciting.

556
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,557
Excuse me.

557
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,435
Let's be considerate, okay?

558
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,104
Fuck off, you asshole.

559
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,689
You wanna do it too?

560
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,233
If you're horny,
you can just jerk off while we do it.

561
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,612
Listen when I'm talking to you,
you motherfuckers.

562
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,120
This is why life is so hard.

563
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,753
Hello, this is 112.

564
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,671
A gun… Here…

565
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,757
I mean, there's a gun here.

566
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,092
Sorry? A gun?

567
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,512
Hello?

568
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,514
I just heard a gunshot.

569
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,641
-Where are you located?
-Hurry, Mr. Officer.

570
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,101
Hey, did you call the police?

571
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,190
Did you call the police or not?

572
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,067
Just answer me, okay?

573
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,610
Hey!

574
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,905
You ignored me
and called the police, didn't you?

575
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,078
You said you heard gunshots?

576
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,038
Hello?

577
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,707
Can you hear me?

578
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,337
You guys are gonna keep ignoring me, huh?

579
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,385
Did she call to report?

580
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,429
And who might you be, sir?

581
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,848
-No, don't call me sir.
-Okay.

582
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,143
I'm preparing
for the Grade 9 civil service exam.

583
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,811
-Sir?
-Grade 7 was too hard.

584
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,728
Sir?

585
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,856
I was about to call you guys anyway.

586
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:46,026
But these guys keep ignoring
what I'm saying right now.

587
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,361
Where are you located?

588
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,529
Yeongseong Gosiwon.

589
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,447
Myeongseong?

590
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,406
-Yeong.
-"Yeong."

591
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,991
-Yes, that's it. Seong.
-"Seong."

592
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,660
Third floor of Tomorrow Karaoke
near the overpass.

593
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,371
But it's no use coming now.

594
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,877
I already pulled the trigger.

595
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,009
How many fucking times did I tell you
to go to a motel to fuck?

596
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,636
The soundproofing is fucking shit.

597
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,102
Don't kill me.

598
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,021
Please.

599
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,405
You're the asshole. Yeah, you.

600
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,033
A motel room isn't even that expensive.

601
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,245
But you bring your beautiful girlfriend
to this filthy place every time.

602
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,003
Fuck this. I don't care.

603
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,299
You take responsibility.

604
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,552
EMERGENCY CALL

605
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:56,972
How are things?

606
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,850
Everything looks good.

607
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,019
Press if you feel threatened.

608
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,854
-I will. Thank you.
-Have a good night.

609
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:08,192
Suspected shooting at Yeongseong Gosiwon.
All nearby units, deploy immediately!

610
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,945
I repeat.
Suspected shooting at Yeongseong Gosiwon.

611
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,074
Fucking hell. Your video game
is too damn loud…

612
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,659
What are you doing?

613
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,954
Where are you going?

614
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,958
I…

615
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,464
Hey, what was that?

616
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,218
What the fuck? Hey, run!

617
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,222
He's got a gun!

618
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:56,949
Sorry.

619
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,617
Hey, I'm sorry.

620
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,495
You motherfucker. Please don't kill me.

621
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,413
Why not?

622
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,417
-You ignored me when I asked nicely.
-What's taking you so long?

623
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,168
Please come quickly!

624
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,672
Some crazy bastard
is shooting up the place!

625
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,841
Please hurry. Come on!

626
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,140
Jeong-tae.

627
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,183
Why don't you do your job as a manager?

628
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,207
Attention, everyone!

629
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,180
Which one of you bastards
ate my anchovies?

630
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,559
