1
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,134
This is your last warning. Drop the gun.

2
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,512
All right. Fine.

3
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,430
Here it is.

4
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,432
Sir, are you okay?

5
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,227
Yes, Captain Joo is okay.

6
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,979
This is your last warning. Drop the gun.

7
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,151
Hey.

8
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,489
Wow, seriously. I can't believe it.

9
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,991
What made you even think to go in there?

10
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:57,909
Come on, man.

11
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,622
Anything for a scoop, right?
It was nothing.

12
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,791
Man, you've still got it.

13
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,377
-By the way…
-Yeah?

14
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,505
Have you ever really seen a gun like that?

15
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,215
No, I haven't. Why?

16
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,677
My hunches are usually spot on.

17
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,929
The incident at that gosiwon too.

18
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,142
I'm sure there are more of them.

19
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,437
If there are, bring me
a couple more exclusives like this.

20
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,814
And if I do?

21
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,818
If you do, I'll do everything I can
to get you a permanent role.

22
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,487
And an office with a view
to make you feel at home.

23
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,114
An office with a view?

24
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,699
A panoramic view, okay?

25
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,909
Keep your word.

26
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,203
A panoramic view. Okay?

27
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,207
An office with a view…

28
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,809
Breaking news.

29
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,437
On November 21,
a horrific shooting occurred

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,148
when Jeon,
after cutting off his ankle monitor,

31
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:14,444
went to Gyeongin Seobu Police Station
and opened fire indiscriminately.

32
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:19,073
He appears to have struck at night,
exploiting the lack of on-duty officers…

33
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,158
Awesome.

34
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,038
The suspect was shot and killed by police
while being apprehended,

35
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,416
which has sparked yet another controversy.

36
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,087
PURCHASE A GUN

37
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,714
WE'RE GIVING AWAY GUNS! FREE GUN

38
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,184
GYEONGIN SEOBU POLICE STATION

39
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,901
You got the gun from the evidence room.

40
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,155
Then where were all those bullets from?

41
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,367
There were no bullets
on the evidence list.

42
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:08,998
You got the bullets from Mr. Moon Baek,
who accompanied you to the scene, right?

43
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,542
You first met him at the house?

44
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:12,877
Yes.

45
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,545
But why did you go there?

46
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,758
Well, I already told that guy everything.

47
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,469
Where did he go?

48
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,054
Told who?

49
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,265
All right.

50
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,851
I'll just tell you the whole truth
from the start.

51
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,646
Mr. Moon Baek said you took the bullets

52
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,357
he was going to report to the police.

53
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,778
What is your relationship
with Mr. Moon Baek?

54
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,406
We met by chance.

55
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,116
It was an urgent situation…

56
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,035
so he helped.

57
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,463
Tell us what happened
when you took down Jeon Won-seong.

58
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,925
Jeon, who shot the probation officers,

59
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,679
had snapped
and was about to commit further crimes.

60
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,140
I concluded

61
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,977
that a quick response was necessary.

62
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,565
Even so, wasn't it a bit excessive
to shoot him so openly?

63
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,362
We checked your record.

64
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,533
It seems you volunteered to serve
only in high-risk conflict zones

65
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,869
that everyone else avoids.

66
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,582
Officially, you've taken down 99 targets.

67
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,712
As of today, the count is 100.

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,052
Why would you bring that up here?

69
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,306
Why don't you just be frank with us?

70
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,604
You just wanted to shoot them all down,
didn't you?

71
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,274
Let's not cross the line.

72
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,444
I'm asking because I have a good reason
to be suspicious.

73
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,454
Hey, Lee.

74
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,123
What are you doing here? Step out.

75
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,251
Chief, we're still investigating.

76
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,420
Investigating, my ass. You damn bastards.

77
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,423
Further investigation is needed
to confirm he followed procedure

78
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,633
when using the firearm.

79
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,593
Haven't you seen the security footage?

80
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,346
He saved the lives of 30 fellow officers

81
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,598
and was the only one
who rushed in to help.

82
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,600
You wouldn't have been able
to do anything.

83
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,312
Regardless of the reason,
he fired a weapon with illegal rounds.

84
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,607
We will refer this case
to the disciplinary committee.

85
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,525
Okay, fine.

86
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,238
If you're disciplining a cop
for doing his job, start with me.

87
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,864
All right? I'm his superior.

88
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,784
I gave the orders,
and I'm the one in charge.

89
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,369
I'm in charge, damn it!

90
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,996
Don't even think about
making him a scapegoat!

91
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,998
If you're punishing anyone, start with me!

92
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,001
You bastards would be the first to run
if bullets started flying.

93
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,378
How dare you!

94
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,338
Step out!

95
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,841
INTERROGATION ROOM

96
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,514
No need to apologize.

98
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,393
We'll take it from here,
so go get some rest.

99
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:17,979
Chin up, kid.

100
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:35,997
Do!

101
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,040
-Captain.
-It must've been tough.

102
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,131
What happened to the shooter?

103
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,424
Wasn't it excessive?

104
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,759
-No comment.
-Where was the gun from?

105
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,978
You didn't have to come.

106
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,694
From your elementary school
to your college graduation,

107
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,948
shooting contests, military enlistment,
deployment overseas, police exam…

108
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,992
Did I miss any of them?

109
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,704
Yes or no?

110
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,081
No.

111
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:24,378
Then why do you always thank me
in a way that upsets me, kid?

112
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,507
I guess it's good to be consistent.

113
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,092
Say what? Look at this punk yapping.

114
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,932
How is Se-yeong doing?

115
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:40,311
See? You always change the subject
when you're in a tough spot.

116
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,606
Should you really be worrying
about others right now?

117
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,651
Stop worrying about Se-yeong.
Worry about yourself.

118
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,116
Are you all right?

119
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,410
Why wouldn't I be?

120
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,664
I'm not talking about your tough-ass body.

121
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,292
Are you okay
with having picked up a gun again?

122
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,464
Don't jump in
and get yourself involved, all right?

123
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,842
I can't bear to see you get hurt,

124
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,303
physically or mentally.

125
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,139
Can a police officer say that?

126
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,101
I'm almost 60.
Who cares what anyone thinks?

127
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,227
Of course I can.

128
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,854
I never told you,

129
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:29,193
but do you know how worried I was
when I heard you picked up a gun?

130
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,362
You don't even know the half of it.

131
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,969
Officially, you've taken down 99 targets.

132
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,264
As of today, the count is 100.

133
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,809
You just wanted to shoot them all down,
didn't you?

134
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,989
Don't be a chicken, little shit.

135
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,240
Hey, the fat ass is here.

136
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,909
Get a move on, dipshit. For fuck's sake.

137
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,414
Seo Yeong-dong.

138
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,459
Wanna try being a bully?

139
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,544
Hey, Fuck-gyu.

140
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,431
You better bring your mom's ID.

141
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,434
You fucker.

142
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,982
Yes, I got it. Yes.

143
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,026
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE DECISION

144
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,319
But, you know, this is--

145
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,739
Okay, all right. Understood.

146
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,452
Seriously? A three-month suspension?

147
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,496
Isn't that a bit much?

148
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,956
Man, they're going way too far.

149
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,835
Don't they know
how many lives Officer Lee saved?

150
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,130
Do is here.

151
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,104
Officer Jang.

152
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,899
Did you confirm the identity
of the man who fled from Jeon's house?

153
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,443
Officer Lee, well…

154
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,905
Look, Do. You can't work on anything.

155
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,243
Come on, guys.
Don't be so heartless, seriously.

156
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,871
Officer Lee never said
he was going to do anything.

157
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,040
He was just asking a question, wasn't he?

158
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,836
Doesn't everyone have a question
in mind that they'd like answered?

159
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,089
Actually,

160
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,341
I was curious about that.

161
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,594
Officer Jang, brief me on what happened.

162
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,847
Then, let me give you a rundown, sir.

163
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,100
The guy who fled from Jeon's house.
Did you find out who he was?

164
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,309
He wasn't there!

165
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,936
He wasn't? You little punk.

166
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,564
Be honest, or you'll end up suspended too.

167
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,898
He really wasn't there.

168
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,235
What do you mean?
I told you to go check right away.

169
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,112
He told you to go check right away!

170
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,364
-So I went right away.
-But?

171
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,075
But there were some other guys around.

172
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,037
License plate number and route, please.

173
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,500
Hey, you can just tell me
the license plate number and the route.

174
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,418
Yes, sir.

175
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,587
-The vehicle was someone else's.
-And?

176
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,133
And the plate number
was 1-5-N 2-3-something…

177
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,346
15N 2335?

178
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,056
That's right!

179
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,434
-Move over a bit.
-Yes, sir.

180
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,772
Wait a minute.

181
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,985
That looks just like Jo U-tae, doesn't it?

182
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,154
Right? I was thinking the same thing.

183
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,157
Who's Jo U-tae?

184
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,242
He's a dirtbag who's been causing

185
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,704
all sorts of trouble
in this neighborhood for years.

186
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,042
Didn't he just get out of prison recently?

187
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,003
I recently found out
that he was just killing time

188
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,546
doing odd jobs for Gong.

189
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,425
By Gong, do you mean
Gong Seok-ho from the Glory Gang?

190
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,927
Yeah, that's him!

191
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,886
That's right.

192
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:28,015
You once worked with Detective Seo
to take him down, right?

193
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,100
Yeah, it's that Gong Seok-ho.

194
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,188
Let's see.

195
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,150
"Today's horoscope for Gong Seok-ho."

196
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,403
"A forgotten enemy will pay you a visit."

197
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,322
"Be careful at all costs."

198
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:44,865
Damn it.

199
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,993
Damn, that scared me.

200
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,119
POLICE IN NAME ONLY

201
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,121
That horoscope is damn accurate.

202
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,542
That piece of shit.

203
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,753
Hey, Detective Seo, it's me.
Can you tell me where Gong Seok-ho is?

204
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,006
-But, Do, you're--
-I won't do anything. Just checking.

205
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,717
-I'll call you if anything happens.
-All right.

206
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,221
That Moon Baek guy?
I checked, and his record is clean.

207
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,014
-Really?
-Yeah.

208
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,726
All right. Get me Gong Seok-ho's location
as soon as you can.

209
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,644
Thanks.

210
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,356
Here you go, Officer Lee.

211
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,984
Wow, look at this motorbike!

212
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:20,901
Thank you.

213
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,362
-Can I ask you for a favor?
-Sure.

214
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,323
Could you find out
whatever you can about this person?

215
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,286
I'll find out all I can.

216
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,912
-Drive safely.
-Will do.

217
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,548
"Dongwol Industry. Moon Baek."

218
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,936
Who are you?

219
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,646
Tell me!

220
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,025
Is Mr. Gong Seok-ho inside?

221
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,736
Who do you think you are?
He's not here. Just leave.

222
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,405
Some strange officer is here, causing…

223
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,324
Mr. Gong Seok-ho.

224
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,496
For fuck's sake.
It must be today's horoscope.

225
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,290
Who said you could come in?

226
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,292
Hey, get out of the way.

227
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,712
I'm talking about you, shithead.
Wanna die? Move!

228
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,714
Move already, you dumbasses.

229
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,883
Don't make a fuss. Go on, move!

230
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,764
Goddamn it.

231
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,187
If looks could kill, eh?

232
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,648
Officer Lee.

233
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,401
You should be keeping your area safe.
Why are you here?

234
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,073
Mr. Gong Seok-ho.

235
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,326
You dealing guns lately?

236
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,410
Guns?

237
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,957
Really? Guns?

238
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,959
Seriously.

239
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,295
You barge into my office
just to ask a bullshit question?

240
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,506
Answer me.

241
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,551
Are you dealing guns?

242
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,930
Did you fucking get shot in the head
or something?

243
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,766
Take a look.
Do those look like guns to you?

244
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,771
Hey, have any of you been
playing around with a gun lately?

245
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,399
I mean, even a toy gun?

246
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,150
No, sir!

247
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,529
You heard them?

248
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,164
Do you know this man?

249
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,127
No clue.

250
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,841
I heard he works
for one of your businesses.

251
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,927
Do you realize how many guys work for me?

252
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,638
How could I possibly know them all?

253
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,224
You really don't know?

254
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,480
And you've got nothing else
to tell me about guns?

255
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,443
I know nothing,
and I've got nothing to tell you.

256
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,365
Then I'll start gathering
all the evidence about that case.

257
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,493
If I find any evidence

258
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,247
that you're dealing in guns…

259
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,876
you know what's coming, right?

260
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,007
We might take on every job
that comes our way,

261
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,093
but we're not stupid enough
to get ourselves killed.

262
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,396
You better keep your word.

263
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,193
I warned you.

264
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,458
Who is this bastard?

265
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,335
I've never seen him before.

266
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,389
Can you confirm if this person works here?

267
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,642
TECHNICAL SALES MANAGER, MOON BAEK

268
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,561
I'm sorry.
We can't check that for you right away.

269
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,563
As a defense contractor,

270
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,983
we need time to share employee details,
even with documents.

271
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,151
Officer Lee.

272
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,737
I got Moon Baek's address,
as you requested.

273
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,197
He lives in the Dongjin Apartments.

274
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,541
Hello?

275
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,126
Hey, it's me.

276
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,045
-Hey, what's up?
-You got a minute?

277
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,965
A minute? Of course I do.

278
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,049
Can we talk?

279
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,240
No, do it again. Come on, get up.

280
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,332
Holy shit.

281
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,252
They disguised and shipped real guns
as regular packages?

282
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,171
So fucking reckless.

283
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,339
Why not?

284
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,925
It's super safe and not suspicious.

285
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,760
They're actually clever.

286
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,847
Have you ever seen anyone in Korea
steal someone else's package?

287
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,057
People follow it like it's the law, man.

288
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,767
Tell us more about those people.

289
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,354
I don't know much either.

290
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,774
But I have to say,
their charisma was just off the charts.

291
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,735
How many guns were there?

292
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,321
A shitload of them.

293
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,615
Around ten truckloads?

294
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,699
Ten truckloads?

295
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,411
Yeah, but we only brought
about half a truckload.

296
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,746
How did you contact them?

297
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,207
What was it again? Oh yeah, Telegram.

298
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,126
-But they only reach out when they want.
-Give me your phone.

299
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,046
Gong Seok-ho took my phone.

300
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,715
Can't even play games when I'm bored,
that son of a bitch.

301
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,177
Hey, did you check the storage room?

302
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:21,845
It was locked.

303
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,432
Okay. That means Gong Seok-ho
hasn't checked it yet either.

304
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,100
The address list?

305
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,187
We should be cautious until we're sure,

306
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,607
especially since our boys ran into a pig
at that gosiwon.

307
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,524
Hey.

308
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:40,197
The fact that a cop was involved confirms
there are guns at those addresses.

309
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,448
-Got it?
-Fucking hell.

310
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,283
You're all so damn clueless.

311
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,666
GONG SEOK-HO

312
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,875
That fucking bitch.

313
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,795
Gong Seok-ho, that fucker.
Why is he calling you?

314
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,842
Jeong-man.

315
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,971
The person you're calling is unavailable.

316
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,098
Please try again later.

317
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,851
This fucking asshole.

318
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,818
What's going on? Why did Gong call?

319
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,028
Has he caught on?

320
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,154
Come on, Jeong-man.

321
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,907
What are you hesitating for?

322
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,743
Good thing I had one squirreled away.

323
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:30,914
If he finds out there are guns
in that storage room, we're all fucked.

324
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,625
Hey, let's move fast.

325
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,794
Whoever gets there first grabs the guns.

326
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,341
Let's…

327
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,761
take those guns.

328
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,055
-That's right.
-For fuck's sake.

329
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,850
Find them all and bring them here.
Don't leave any behind.

330
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,561
Hurry up and bring them all here!

331
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,896
-Move fast!
-Shit. Let's go.

332
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,940
Come on. Move it, you bastard!

333
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,858
Move now!

334
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,443
Guys! Let's go!

335
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,652
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

336
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,695
Come on, let's go!

337
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,664
Goodness me.
The rice today is cooked to perfection.

338
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,210
Oh my. That looks good.

339
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,258
LISTEN TO MY DEAD SON'S MESSAGE!

340
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,926
APOLOGIZE!
BAN DANGEROUS OUTSOURCING

341
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,266
Sir! I just want to talk to you.

342
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:32,893
I just want to…

343
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,644
You still haven't taken care of her?

344
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:38,148
I just want to talk to you.
What's so hard about that?

345
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,498
Hey, why is the floor so slippery?

346
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,000
-Oh no, are you okay?
-Damn, dude.

347
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,836
This bastard always eats his lunch
with his freaking head.

348
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,837
Looks so damn good.

349
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,209
Hey, Fuck-gyu. You're not gonna answer?

350
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,336
You want us to visit
your mom's restaurant?

351
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,463
You want to lose
the one parent you got left?

352
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,506
He'll be an orphan?

353
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,425
-Is his dad dead?
-You didn't know?

354
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,802
So that's why Fuck-gyu's such a dumbass.

355
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,303
I feel bad for your mom.

356
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,930
-Answer.
-You still don't get it?

357
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:55,308
If I ever see you, you're dead.
You fucking loser.

358
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,687
Damn it.

359
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,451
Excuse me. Do you live in Unit 1311?

360
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,216
Hey, you're here. Want some?

361
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,020
What did you do at Dongwol Industry?

362
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,777
Well, I was always designing
and testing new bullets.

363
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,613
Did you know?

364
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,533
South Korea, a gun-free country,

365
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,410
is actually one
of the largest bullet exporters?

366
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,746
Isn't it ironic?

367
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,754
What were you going to do with the gun?

368
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,008
Well, about that…

369
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,761
I don't really wanna say.

370
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,358
Fine.

371
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,488
I have cancer.
They say I'll die in six months.

372
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,740
Maybe even less.

373
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,743
You don't believe me?

374
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,250
Look.

375
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,669
They cut me open three times.

376
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,090
It's in my blood, spreading everywhere.

377
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,510
First, Seoul.

378
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,680
Then Busan.

379
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,725
From Busan to Gwangju.

380
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,231
This thing called cancer.

381
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,693
Man, it really

382
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,945
hurts like hell.

383
00:26:55,488 --> 00:27:00,368
So I was gonna leave this world
with a bang.

384
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,544
But all you had were bullets.

385
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,005
Where did you get them?

386
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:17,093
While looking into handmade guns online
so I could go out with a bang,

387
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:21,181
I stumbled upon a weird website
claiming to be handing out free guns.

388
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,309
I figured I'd give it a go
and clicked on it.

389
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,811
PRESS HERE IF YOU WANT A GUN

390
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,982
A couple of days later,
I really did get a package.

391
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,778
But the annoying thing was
that there were no guns.

392
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,906
All it had was a piece of paper
and a bunch of bullets.

393
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,036
Try going to that website again.

394
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,791
I'd like to do that as well.

395
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,295
But I can't.

396
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,631
The website is gone.

397
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,132
UNABLE TO CONNECT
PLEASE TRY AGAIN

398
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,137
So I checked the piece of paper
that came in the package.

399
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:05,141
It had the addresses of people
who ordered guns, just like I did.

400
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,688
I randomly went to one of them,
just in case.

401
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,772
To get a gun.

402
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,693
Where's that address list now?

403
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,737
I threw it out.

404
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,448
I threw it out.

405
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,325
You expect me to believe that?

406
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,161
But I've got a really good memory.

407
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,496
It's all in here.

408
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,332
I see.

409
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,295
If your memory is that good,

410
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,048
the addresses in your head…

411
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,053
Write them all here.

412
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,266
Yes, sir.

413
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:04,284
DOMYEONG-RO 1-GIL, DONGAN-GU, GYEONGIN

414
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:09,873
What?

415
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,583
Are you sure about these addresses?

416
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,794
Yeah.

417
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,632
Hey!

418
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,218
Where are you going? Damn it.

419
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,264
MRS. OH

420
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,768
The person you're calling is unavailable.

421
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,939
Oh man.

422
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,234
What is it this time?

423
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,988
-Damn it.
-Sir.

424
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,782
How long must I avoid these people?

425
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,492
Sir, please look here!

426
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,285
Is it so hard to get rid of them?

427
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,204
They're not exactly breaking the law.

428
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,206
I'll sort them out quickly.

429
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,461
-Damn it.
-I'm so sorry, sir.

430
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,964
-Drive properly, for God's sake.
-Sorry, she jumped out.

431
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,717
Sir. Please get out.

432
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,552
I just want to talk.

433
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,054
Who is that?

434
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,306
Have you lost your mind?

435
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,476
You know who you're talking to?
Out of the way!

436
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,605
Is it really that hard to apologize?
I just want to talk to you!

437
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,983
-What should I do?
-What else? Just keep driving.

438
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,569
-Keep driving?
-What, you want me to do it?

439
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,904
Go, you bastard.

440
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,491
I said keep going. Go!

441
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,161
Hey, why'd you stop?

442
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,747
-Ma'am, please…
-Do your damn job! You useless fucker.

443
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:37,961
Go!

444
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,757
What's that crazy bitch pulling out?

445
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,009
-A gun?
-Huh?

446
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,344
Sir…

447
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,137
Look at that crazy bitch.

448
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,361
What's this?

449
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,167
ORDERER ADDRESS LIST
INFORMATION

450
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,085
OH KYEONG-SUK

451
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,513
-I'm sorry, sir!
-Ji-ung.

452
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,016
-Ji-ung! Hey, Ji-ung!
-Sir.

453
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,687
You know Hwang Min-ju, right?

454
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,607
Who is Hwang Min-ju? I have no idea!

455
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,410
You don't know?

456
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,412
Why don't you know?

457
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,080
How?

458
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,167
How could you not know Hwang Min-ju?

459
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,044
You, of all people…

460
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,046
How could you…

461
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,051
For God's sake,
I don't know who Hwang Min-ju is!

462
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,553
He was one of your employees.

463
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,056
He's my son,

464
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,183
the one you overworked

465
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,810
to save money,

466
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,565
leaving his body torn in two.

467
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:28,905
I've been screaming his name
at the top of my lungs this whole time.

468
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,368
What a joke we must've been to you.

469
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,704
How lowly must we have been in your eyes

470
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:41,709
for you not to even know
my dead son's name?

471
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:48,424
Spare me, please.
Just this once, please spare my life.

472
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,971
Please don't kill me. I'm sorry.

473
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:57,892
Please spare my life. I'm sorry.

474
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,188
Don't apologize to me.

475
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,901
Apologize to my son.

476
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,004
Mrs. Oh, why didn't you answer?

477
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,797
Officer Lee.

478
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,385
Finally,

479
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,013
I got my apology today.

480
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,476
No matter how much I screamed,

481
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,062
he never listened.

482
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,231
But he gave in so easily

483
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,735
when I pulled a gun.

484
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,278
Mrs. Oh.

485
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,863
Yes, I know.

486
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,324
What I did was wrong.

487
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,413
Now that I got my apology,

488
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,875
I should pay for what I did too.

489
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,586
Officer Lee.

490
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,089
Let me make

491
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,926
one last meal for my son.

492
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:30,318
Min-ju, eat up.

493
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,362
I made him

494
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,115
apologize to you today.

495
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,202
I don't think…

496
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,958
I can cook for you for a while.

497
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,339
I'm sorry.

498
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,185
Officer Lee?

499
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,616
Who are you?

500
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,409
Hey, lady.

501
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,953
Yes?

502
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,580
You have a gun, don't you?

503
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,430
What is it? You recognize that car?

504
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,599
Keep an eye on that car.

505
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,763
MRS. OH

506
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,133
OFFICER LEE DO

507
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,599
Oh man.

508
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,977
I'm curious. So curious.

509
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,693
LISTEN TO MY DEAD SON'S MESSAGE!

510
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,335
Moon Baek never holds back.

511
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,847
-Shit. What the hell?
-That fucking scared me.

512
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,474
-What's up with him?
-Fucking hell!

513
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,061
I told you not to park here.

514
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,521
And who are you?

515
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,147
Me? I'm Moon Baek.

516
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,565
-Don't.
-You fucking asshole.

517
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,026
So why did you park
on this freaking narrow street

518
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,903
and block others from passing?

519
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,621
Holy fuck.
So we meet again, you son of a bitch.

520
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,044
Face the camera.

521
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,130
I wanna take a picture for your funeral.

522
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,172
Say kimchi.

523
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,718
Okay, we got it. Now get lost.

524
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,430
-Huh?
-What is it?

525
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,514
What is this?

526
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,224
Who is this?

527
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,312
-The hell you looking at?
-We got it. Get lost already!

528
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,523
Yeah, I got it. Now you guys get lost too!

529
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,441
What was that?

530
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,192
-Unless you wanna die here.
-What?

531
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,528
-You fucking asshole.
-What the hell?

532
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,031
That bastard saw our faces. Is that okay?

533
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,824
Of course not. Get out.

534
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,286
Man, this just keeps getting
more interesting.

535
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,248
You! Come here.

536
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,624
Where you going?

537
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,959
Hold up. You fucker.

538
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,171
How are you gonna make us die?
He got scared.

539
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,465
Hey!

540
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,008
That fucker, look at his eyes.

541
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,343
Hey!

542
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,762
You bastard!
I'm gonna rip out all your hair!

543
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,681
-Crazy son of a bitch.
-Hey!

544
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,475
-Hey!
-Get him!

545
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,726
You son of a bitch!

546
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,394
-You bastard.
-Stop!

547
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,230
-You son of a bitch!
-Stop!

548
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,775
Where are you going?

549
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,738
-Where is she?
-You fucker.

550
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,574
You're gonna fucking die soon.
Worry about yourself.

551
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,589
Gong made you do this?

552
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,093
Man, this guy has no fucking clue
what he's dealing with.

553
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,011
This is a real fucking gun.

554
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,889
If I pull the trigger,
I'll blow your head off.

555
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:52,890
Holy fuck.

556
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,104
That fucking crazy bitch.

557
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,273
Huh?

558
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,150
What? What is it?

559
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,611
Huh?

560
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,201
One more car.

561
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,224
Fuck!

562
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,564
Fucking hell!

563
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,280
You can't even tell blanks
from live rounds.

564
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,907
Fucking shit! Kill him!

565
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,954
Fuck!

566
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,672
Seriously!

567
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,448
U-tae is calling.

568
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,365
Hey, U-tae.

569
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,992
Get in here, all of you.

570
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,038
Grab your tools and go inside.

571
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,332
-Get ready to take care of the guy.
-Let's move.

572
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,501
Hey, hurry.

573
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,085
Guys, get in the house now.

574
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,672
Shit, we're totally fucked.
Hey, come out already!

575
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,840
Come on, hurry!

576
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,312
Shit.

577
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,697
Fuck!

578
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,253
Mrs. Oh.

579
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,971
I'll be back soon. Hang in there.

580
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,481
Goddamn it. Fuck.

581
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,656
I told you to get the gun ready.
What's the delay?

582
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,241
Hey, hurry up!

583
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,659
-Come on.
-Seriously.

584
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,416
-Why does he keep coming back?
-He's a total nutjob.

585
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,802
-Hey!
-Incoming!

586
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,933
Man, what a bunch of cowards.

587
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,853
-Get him!
-Fuck!

588
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,119
Fucking hell!

589
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,562
Damn it!

590
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,867
Hey! Fuck you!

591
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,666
You!

592
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,338
-Let go! Hey, my hair!
-Hey!

593
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,591
-Where the fuck is everyone?
-Where are you going?

594
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,816
You fuckers!

595
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,695
Let go! I said let go, you bastard!

596
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:58,696
I said let go!

597
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,001
Goddamn it!

598
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,302
This is why

599
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,762
you should

600
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,013
park your car

601
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,766
properly!

602
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,029
You fucking bastard.

603
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,950
Fuck this shit.

604
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,172
Let go, motherfucker.

605
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,590
Let go. I said let go of me.

606
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,133
You fucker, I said let go.

607
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,634
I'm gonna kill you.

608
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,391
-Shit, what's this?
-What the fuck?

609
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,186
Who the hell are you?

610
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,955
-What's up? Is she hurt?
-Moon Baek, open the door.

611
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,589
Press here.

612
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,840
-I'll drive.
-Okay.

613
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,077
You'll be fine, Mrs. Oh.

614
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,496
Hold on just a little longer.

615
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,414
Everything will be okay.

616
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,750
We're almost there.

617
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,546
He turned right at 96 Geumseong-ro
five minutes ago.

618
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,465
-Huh? No, he turned left.
-Stop. That was 96 Geumseong-ro.

Hello, Mrs. Oh.

I have an urgent matter.
Can I call you back?

624

Of course. I'm sorry to interrupt.

I'm back. Go ahead.

Mrs. Oh.

Careful. Watch her head.

Mrs. Oh, you'll be all right.

We're here. Stay strong.

Mrs. Oh, can you hear me?

631
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,940
