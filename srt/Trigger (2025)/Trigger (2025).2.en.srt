1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,137
Stay still, you bastard!

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,639
You are under arrest for murder.

3
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,558
You have the right to an attorney.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,894
-You have the right to remain silent.
-Let me go, you bastards!

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,940
-Anything you say can and will be…
-Let go of me!

6
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,117
Please save

7
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,038
my mom, dad, and brother.

8
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,296
Hey, get a move on.

9
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,721
Are we all set? Detective Jo,
what about the victim's statement?

10
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,681
Yes, it's all ready.

11
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,350
Why are you still wearing bloody clothes?

12
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,604
Hey, reporters are swarming outside.
Don't let your guard down.

13
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,147
Yes, sir.

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,861
Hey.

15
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,531
I'll take you to the hospital soon.

16
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,909
Sit here for a bit, okay?

17
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,452
All right.

18
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,307
Detective Jo!

19
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,851
Look at the kid! He's got a gun!

20
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,438
No, Lee Do! Don't do it!

21
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,190
Don't do anything.

22
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,317
Lee Do.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,235
-Hey.
-Lee Do!

24
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,403
Look at me, okay?

25
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,738
Shoot me.

26
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,073
Shut up, you bastard!

27
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,243
What's stopping you?

28
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,369
Lee Do!

29
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,538
Shoot me.

30
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,257
Shooting at Yeongseong Gosiwon.

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,176
All nearby units, deploy immediately!

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,804
I repeat. Shooting at Yeongseong Gosiwon.

33
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,222
All nearby units…

34
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,530
-Are you okay?
-Help me.

35
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,877
Officer Kim! Hold on.

36
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,464
-Where's the shooter?
-Inside.

37
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,549
Let's go.

38
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,432
Go in.

39
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,773
At least…

40
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,404
the end of my life turned out okay.

41
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,364
You there!

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,533
Drop the gun. Put your hands up.

43
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:25,955
Hello there.

44
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,082
Don't move!

45
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,835
You see, guns are

46
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,297
actually surprisingly easy to use.

47
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,799
So convenient.

48
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,635
Drop the gun and put your hands up!

49
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,803
I heard a police officer's gun…

50
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,807
always fires a blank as the first round.

51
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,309
What?

52
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,991
Get out!

53
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,534
Get out! Now!

54
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,997
Don't save anyone.

55
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,499
These bastards are all trash.

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,670
An officer has been shot.
All units entering must be armed.

57
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,172
The suspect is currently armed
with a machine gun.

58
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,092
-Hey!
-Are you okay?

59
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,635
-Yes.
-And the people inside?

60
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,887
They're too scared to come out.

61
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,557
Come out, you bastards!

62
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,143
-Wait here.
-What?

63
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,479
-Think you can hide from me?
-Officer Lee!

64
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,907
You shouldn't have ignored me, should you?

65
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,912
This wouldn't have happened
if we all followed the rules.

66
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,208
You're the ones who drove me to this.

67
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,461
Did I ask for too much? Huh?

68
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,135
Just not to touch people's food

69
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,054
and to keep your voices down
in shared areas.

70
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,016
Is that so hard?

71
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,938
Don't get your hopes up.

72
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,482
There's no such thing here.

73
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,156
Your life is stuck in the gutter,
just like mine.

74
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,117
I'll spare you the trouble

75
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,494
by killing you all.

76
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,629
Just wait.
I'll find every last one of you.

77
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,850
Found you!

78
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,103
Please don't kill me!

79
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,608
Listen to me carefully.

80
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,443
The shooter has an M4.

81
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,029
He fired three shots after reloading,
leaving 27.

82
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,658
Make that 24.

83
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,827
I'll distract him
and make him waste his ammo.

84
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,329
You save the people inside.

85
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,206
Officer Lee, what are you going to do?

86
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,459
Don't worry about me.
We must save as many as we can, okay?

87
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:24,967
What the hell?

88
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,328
Damn it.

89
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,458
Goddamn it!

90
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,384
Come out.

91
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
This way.

92
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,527
You motherfuckers!
I told you not to save anyone!

93
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,996
Get in there! Hurry!

94
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,085
Why did you…

95
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,525
Thank you.

96
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,529
-Traffic control needed.
-No photos!

97
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,697
-Support units, move now.
-Copy that.

98
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,910
Chief Yoon! Over here!

99
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,869
Chief Yoon!

100
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,329
Chief Yoon! A quick word?

101
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,004
Anything on camera?

102
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,967
The computer storing the files
was destroyed, so they can't be retrieved.

103
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,802
And the witnesses?

104
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,263
They're in no state to testify yet.
It'll take time.

105
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,265
For God's sake.

106
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,727
-Can you check these labels?
-Yes, one moment.

107
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,486
Can you also check unit 308?

108
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,839
Finish up here.

109
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,466
Yes, sir.

110
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,152
I remember preparing for the police exam
in a gosiwon not long ago.

111
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,529
I was in a room just like this

112
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,574
and was on the verge of losing my mind.

113
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,333
Are gosiwon beds made
of nailed plywood these days?

114
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,419
No, that can't be.
It's a bed, not a coffin.

115
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,259
Officer Lee!

116
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,764
Officer Jang.

117
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,725
Have you ever seen this before?

118
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,770
Chief! We found more guns in here.

119
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,812
What?

120
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,776
They've already been scanned,
so you can check them yourself.

121
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,403
These are all automatic rifles.

122
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,157
Call the military now
and have them send an expert.

123
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,241
Yes, sir.

124
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,370
Hey, call them now and…

125
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,421
Hey!

126
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,256
I told you to bring in an expert.

127
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,303
Well, Officer Lee spent a long time
in the military before joining the police.

128
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,349
Then tell us what you know about these
until the expert arrives.

129
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,812
What's he doing over there?

130
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,940
If you're not sure, just stay out of it.

131
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,024
No, sir.

132
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,277
Allow me to explain.

133
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,424
I'll give you a rundown.

134
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,513
This is the XM177E2, a rifle widely used
by US Special Forces SOG in Vietnam.

135
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,057
This is the AK-47,
a 7.62 mm Kalashnikov rifle,

136
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,519
mainly made in the former Soviet Union.

137
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,812
And this is the MP5,

138
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,941
a German submachine gun
introduced in 1964,

139
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,694
an iconic weapon
of counterterrorism forces globally.

140
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,614
Lastly, this is the MK18 MOD1,

141
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,534
the standard-issue rifle
of US Special Operations,

142
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,121
a modernized M4 widely used
by US Special Forces.

143
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:14,168
So you're saying guns from past wars
and overseas conflicts

144
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,754
have surfaced in Korea?

145
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,840
And in a gosiwon, of all places?

146
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,717
Yes, sir.

147
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,803
There's a bigger issue.

148
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,306
Do you recall
the dozens of bullets found before?

149
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,434
You mean the ones found
in the rooftop room?

150
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,769
Yes.

151
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,479
It's under investigation. Why?

152
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,400
The bullets found there

153
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,153
and the guns on this table…

154
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,490
are all fully compatible.

155
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,581
In my opinion,

156
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,377
these two cases appear to be connected.

157
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,921
Everyone.

158
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,799
Looks like we've found something big.

159
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,678
Make sure everyone keeps quiet,
especially the reporters.

160
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,887
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,806
Clean up everything here too.

162
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,026
Man, I'm starving.

163
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,112
For fuck's sake, when's he coming out?

164
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,446
Is it good?

165
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,699
A brutal mass shooting at a gosiwon…

166
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,701
Holy shit. Take a look at this, Jeong-man.

167
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,327
…has shocked the public.

168
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,498
The police apprehended the suspect, Yu,
a resident of the gosiwon…

169
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,542
Are we in the States or what?

170
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,253
Fucking hell, what's going on in Korea?
I don't like this.

171
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,046
-What is it?
-Stop being so dramatic.

172
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,882
Shit.

173
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,426
-He was shooting people and shit.
-Shit. That's fucked.

174
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,351
-Hey, go in and see what's happening.
-Yes, sir.

175
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,484
Walk straight, you bastard!

176
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,572
Let go, you motherfuckers!
Let me go, you bastards!

177
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,531
Stay still!

178
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,283
Yong-gu, you son of a bitch!

179
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,244
Yong-gu, that fucking bastard.

180
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,495
Hey, Gong!

181
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,539
Seok-ho, you motherfucker!

182
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,750
Seok-ho, you fucking asshole!

183
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,337
Spare me, you son of a bitch! Please!

184
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,755
Let's talk this out.

185
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,965
Let's go in, grab a fucking drink, and--

186
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,091
That's too bad.

187
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,261
I quit drinking as of today.
I want to live a long life.

188
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,305
-Seok-ho.
-I asked nicely before.

189
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,682
If you'd given up the business,
we wouldn't be here.

190
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,101
Let's talk this out! Yeah?

191
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,104
You fucking bastard!

192
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,607
Let go of me, you fuckers!

193
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:42,942
Fuck.

194
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,491
Good work, everyone.

195
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,618
-Go get some rest.
-Yes, sir.

196
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,037
-Yong-gu.
-Yes, sir.

197
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,706
Once I sort out the shares,
I'll hand the business over.

198
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,916
Yes, sir.

199
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,295
-I'm off. Take good care of him.
-Yes, sir.

200
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,339
You fucking asshole!
Fucking son of a bitch!

201
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,841
Gong, you fucking traitor!

202
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,428
You motherfucker!
Let me go, you little shitheads!

203
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,683
You motherfuckers!

204
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,063
Gloves on. Let's get ready.

205
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,190
Jeong-man!

206
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,198
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go.

207
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,119
Let's go.

208
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,662
-Hello.
-Hello.

209
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,831
On three. One, two, three.

210
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,002
-This is gonna be a pain.
-Hey, busters.

211
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,130
Make sure to clean thoroughly.

212
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,674
It's pretty messy today, huh?

213
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,927
For fuck's sake. Then come out earlier.

214
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,014
You take your fucking time
and then tell us to hurry the fuck up.

215
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,056
Don't be so dramatic.

216
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,559
Fucking stupid busters.

217
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,728
Don't look at me like that, motherfucker.

218
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,656
Have you lost your mind?
Who ordered that for him?

219
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,493
Are we at a Chinese restaurant
or something?

220
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,872
-He said he'd cooperate for jjajangmyeon.
-Captain's coming. Clean it up.

221
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,873
Sorry, sir.

222
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,294
Hey.

223
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,755
What's your deal?

224
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,632
Where did you get that gun?

225
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,301
The gun?

226
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,852
I'll talk.

227
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,481
But please bring that guy here.

228
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,945
So we meet again.

229
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,740
Why did you want to see me?

230
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,243
I was totally out of my mind back then,
so I wasn't aware.

231
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,499
But when you grabbed my face
and slammed me into the wall,

232
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,583
I thought…

233
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,170
"This guy is legit."

234
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,674
"He's nothing like these lowlifes
in the gosiwon."

235
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,139
Huh?

236
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,350
What the hell is he talking about?

237
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,813
If you have questions, just ask.
I'll tell you everything.

238
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,527
Hey, raise the volume.

239
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,533
Where's the gun from?

240
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,243
It came by courier.

241
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
Who sent it?

242
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,581
I don't know.

243
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,042
That bastard is talking shit again.

244
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,046
Why would a stranger send you
a package by courier

245
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,423
with a gun in it, of all things?

246
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,093
Well, I don't really know why.

247
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,181
Maybe because I wanted it badly.

248
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,100
Shouldn't he be on meds?

249
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,229
Well, I'm not sure.

250
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,690
Mr. Yu.

251
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,278
This isn't the time for jokes.

252
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,155
You know, Officer,

253
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,700
I speak only the truth.

254
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,751
Have you handled guns before?

255
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,422
Far, near, middle.

256
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,465
In the military.

257
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,016
Were the guns you hid under your bed
also delivered by courier?

258
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,520
That's the funny thing.

259
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,400
I made it clear
that I just needed one decent gun,

260
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,445
so I'm not sure
why they sent me so many scary guns.

261
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,533
Thinking about it pisses me off again.

262
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,664
Mr. Yu.

263
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,627
Do you know how many people died
because of you?

264
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,631
If you have any remorse for what you did,

265
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,884
please answer my questions honestly.

266
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:20,969
"Remorse"?

267
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,059
Do you think those bastards
felt any for what they did to me?

268
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,897
Those bastards had no respect
for laws, rules, and common sense.

269
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,774
Fuck them.

270
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,151
No matter the reason,

271
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,737
you can't justify shooting someone.

272
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,031
You shouldn't be saying that!

273
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,953
Just as the police catch criminals
and lock them up,

274
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,913
all I did was get rid of scumbags.

275
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,374
Thanks to me,
many people won't have to suffer.

276
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,628
By taking out just 20 gosiwon scumbags,
I've made countless people safer.

277
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,964
So why would you say that to me?

278
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,846
What I did is no different
from what you did.

279
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,516
I did the same thing you did.

280
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,646
Do you think they're the same?

281
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,649
Why won't you admit it?

282
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,238
If I prove that I'm truly righteous,

283
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,824
will you admit it?

284
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,665
There are more guns.

285
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,793
What do you mean?

286
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,256
There are more people with guns.

287
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,091
How do you know?

288
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,764
What's he doing?

289
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,019
Because I saw it.

290
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,479
Saw what?

291
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,819
People who want guns.

292
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,405
And who are these people?

293
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,661
That's a question
for civil servants paid by taxes.

294
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,373
That bastard is playing dumb
just to screw with us.

295
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,501
Given his psych history,

296
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,379
he's trying to play
the temporary insanity card.

297
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,964
We should still look into it.

298
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,301
-A bigger incident could happen.
-Look into what?

299
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,053
Hey, how does that make any…

300
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,221
A gun? Delivered by courier?

301
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,726
You don't actually believe
what that bastard said, do you?

302
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,521
If he actually received it by courier,
he would've paid for it.

303
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,691
But he only has 530,000 won
in his account.

304
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,651
Clean transaction record, no credit card.

305
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,652
Think about it.

306
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,116
Who would send such expensive firearms
to a guy like him for free?

307
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,785
That's what we need to figure out.

308
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,162
Who is behind this, and why?

309
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,957
-Why did you kill them?
-What was your motive?

310
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,261
Please say a few words!

311
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,183
Captain Joo. I just have one question.

312
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,310
-I'm busy right now.
-Later.

313
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,190
These are guns, right?
There are more, aren't there?

314
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,528
This is an ongoing investigation,
so I can't comment on it.

315
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,030
Come on, don't be like that!

316
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,658
There were more guns there.
I know what I saw.

317
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,577
Smuggled? Homemade?
What exactly does it look like?

318
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,662
Hey, let's go!

319
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,540
I'll write an article based on this photo.

320
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,542
You're a reporter, for God's sake.

321
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,836
Write articles based on facts,
not fiction.

322
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,504
Go ahead. We'll see what happens.

323
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,634
You're not giving me the facts,
so I feel like I have to make stuff up.

324
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,846
Captain!

325
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,185
Oh dear.

326
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,021
Goodness me.

327
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,774
Today's rice is cooked to perfection.

328
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:08,029
The forecast predicted rain yesterday,

329
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,407
so I was really worried,

330
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,869
but the sunshine was so beautiful.

331
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,830
I wasn't cold at all.

332
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,462
Enjoy your meal until I get back, son.

333
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,882
I'll do my best again today.

334
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,185
LISTEN TO MY DEAD SON'S MESSAGE!

335
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,943
Well, word got out that someone died here,
so no one will rent it.

336
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,155
-I'm so mad, I'm losing my mind!
-I see.

337
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,033
What are you even looking for in there?
For God's sake.

338
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,702
We just need to check something.

339
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,456
So no one came by to visit
or drop off any packages, right?

340
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,249
What packages?

341
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,877
I never saw any of his family or friends.

342
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,550
Thank you.

343
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,727
Officer Lee.

344
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,982
What are you looking at?

345
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,110
The gosiwon over there.

346
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,282
Do you think there are more guns
like the gosiwon shooter said?

347
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,078
I hope it's nothing more
than the ravings of a lunatic.

348
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,790
I hope so too.

349
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,751
Guns have no place

350
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,879
in our daily lives.

351
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,604
Fucking hell, these all suck ass.

352
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:10,694
Hey, not a single one of these
is worth selling.

353
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,737
Would you buy any of these?

354
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,573
Hey.

355
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,492
Do these photos turn you on?

356
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,579
Fuck. You gonna keep taking
shitty photos like this?

357
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,622
-Hey, Yeong-dong's here.
-He's coming.

358
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,417
Fuck-gyu's dying. He can't breathe! Hurry!

359
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,460
-Come on, hurry!
-Run!

360
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,337
-Hurry up!
-He's gonna die, man.

361
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,965
-Hey! Run! Hurry up!
-Run! Hurry!

362
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,883
-Hurry!
-Run!

363
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,802
Run faster! Come on!

364
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,803
What are you doing?

365
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,597
Hey, I'm sorry.

366
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,017
Putting on a pig show?

367
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,185
Here, bread and cigarettes.

368
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,103
Here.

369
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,609
Get up.

370
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,280
Hey, Yeong-dung.

371
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:01,745
I told you to make ten accounts for me,
but you still haven't done it.

372
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,498
Seong-jun, I'm sorry.
I'll go make them right away.

373
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,083
I'll get it done quickly.

374
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,297
I'll make it easy for you once I get this.

375
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,715
Okay, I understand.

376
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,759
I'll do my best to fire myself up!

377
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,804
I'll do my best.

378
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,728
Let's go.

379
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,897
-For fuck's sake. Fucking loser.
-Oh man.

380
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,650
Do your job right,
or we'll visit your mom's restaurant.

381
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,068
You stink of your mom's food.

382
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,986
-Fuck, it stinks.
-Cheer up, okay?

383
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,489
-Freaking loser.
-Let's play games.

384
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,991
Good luck, Fuck-gyu.

385
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,542
I'm sorry, Gyu-jin.

386
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,545
I'll run faster next time.

387
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,510
Just wipe off the blood.

388
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,350
Thanks.

389
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,147
Those sons of bitches.

390
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,315
Don't do anything,

391
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,318
or they'll beat you up again.

392
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,823
This is suffocating.

393
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,749
This is fucking suffocating.

394
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,879
That's him, right?

395
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,382
I guess he's too ashamed to show his face.

396
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,383
You're right.

397
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,927
Why does someone like him
have to live here?

398
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,053
What rotten luck.

399
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,096
Exactly.

400
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,019
Those fucking bitches.

401
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,861
Hey, give me two cartons of Marlboro Red.

402
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,325
Please lower your mask
and show me your ID.

403
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,371
Damn it. Hey, lady.

404
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,583
Do I look like a kid to you?

405
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,502
No, it's not exactly that.

406
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,172
Just give me
the fucking cigarettes already.

407
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,299
Did I do something wrong?

408
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,509
I just came to buy groceries.

409
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,929
Why the fuck are you looking at me
like I'm a cockroach?

410
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,478
I just want to kill them all for real.

411
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,566
For fuck's sake!

412
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:44,407
Why the fuck would you block the way
to someone's house?

413
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,328
If you ordered these damn packages,
take them in right away!

414
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,747
What the fuck is this bastard's name?

415
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:52,916
Park Kyeong-ja.

416
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,833
PARK KYEONG-JA

417
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,710
Is this Ms. Park Kyeong-ja's residence?

418
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,003
My mom will be home soon.

419
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,630
-Come in.
-Thank you.

420
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,050
Do you need help
with your mother's packages?

421
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,427
No, it's fine. Just come in.

422
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,223
What the fuck?

423
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,641
It's a gun.

424
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,812
They actually sent this?

425
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,195
Those bastards are fucking crazy.

426
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,660
I mean, they sent me a K1 and a K2.

427
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,241
This is it. Let's go!

428
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,915
Hey, come down from there.

429
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,293
-Hey, it looks good.
-Great.

430
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,004
Jeong-man!

431
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,798
Jeong-man. Gu Jeong-man!

432
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,717
Jeong-man!

433
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,845
Please spare me, Jeong-man.

434
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,556
Stop calling my name.

435
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,143
It's nothing personal. Just business.

436
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,771
Yes, I know you're good at your job.

437
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,609
You're a smart guy, right?

438
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,652
With your brains, man,

439
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,906
you can do better
than being Gong Seok-ho's buster.

440
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,076
Gong Seok-ho promised
to give you the business

441
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,412
if you took me out, right?

442
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,498
But he's going to give it to Yong-gu.

443
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,959
He won't give it to you.

444
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,545
He's never going to give it to you, man.

445
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,630
Mr. Kim.

446
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,965
That didn't sit right with me.

447
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,217
Hurry up and bury him. Quickly!

448
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,302
-Okay!
-Hurry up.

449
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,055
We gotta go before sunrise. Hurry!

450
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,973
We met ten years ago!

451
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,267
Don't worry.
I'll hold a nice memorial for you.

452
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,979
Let me live,
and I'll give you some valuable info.

453
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,149
-Those who say that never have much.
-Jeong-man!

454
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,488
I'll help you take over
this entire organization, Jeong-man!

455
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,284
Jeong-man, you can get a gun!

456
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,787
You can get a gun, you bastard.

457
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,247
Jeong-man!

458
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,877
Come on, Jeong-man.

459
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,254
Just bury him before sunrise
and be done with it.

460
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,758
We're all fucked if Mr. Gong finds out
Mr. Kim is still alive.

461
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,677
Jeong-man, just trust me.

462
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,553
I'll make sure you get everything.

463
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,431
A gun? Seriously? Are you for real?

464
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,643
Why waste time thinking about it?

465
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,561
Come on, think about it. Okay?

466
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,063
-Say we get a gun.
-You can.

467
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,232
How do you take over with one gun?

468
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,317
There are so many people above Mr. Gong.

469
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,653
No, not just one gun. There's a hundred.

470
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,364
More than a hundred guns.
No, actually, there are tons.

471
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,908
You son of a bitch.
You think we're fucking idiots?

472
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,826
Hey, one sec.

473
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,494
Come on.

474
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,580
-What was your name again?
-I almost answered.

475
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,207
-Yes, sir.
-Where's the update?

476
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,333
Damn it.

477
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,294
I was about to call you.
We just finished cleaning up.

478
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,422
-Sir.
-Yeah?

479
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,300
About the business
you promised after this job…

480
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,301
What promise?

481
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,636
Oh, that?

482
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,180
I'm busy. Talk later when you get back.

483
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,020
Gong didn't answer, did he?

484
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,897
He's not going to give it to you.

485
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,570
Fucking hell.

486
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,658
Jeong-man!

487
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,619
He's beating him like a dog.

488
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,164
What are you doing? Bury him.

489
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,790
-Let's bury him.
-Okay.

490
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,334
Hurry up, we gotta get to work.
It's freezing, damn it.

491
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,503
-Hey, bury him.
-Okay.

492
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,395
Shit. Damn you, motherfucker.

493
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,983
What now?

494
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,903
This is the supervising officer.
Where are you?

495
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:36,866
Fuck off. You monitor me 24 hours a day.
Of course you know.

496
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,620
Exactly. Why are you in a place
you don't usually visit?

497
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,163
Why did you go up that mountain?

498
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:47,376
I came out for some fresh air
because you people are suffocating me.

499
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,587
Hey.

500
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,881
Let me ask you something.

501
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:57,053
Where are you monitoring me from, huh?

502
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,847
Tell me. Where are you hiding?

503
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,433
I cannot disclose that information.

504
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,185
"Cannot disclose that information"?

505
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,312
I'm done talking to you, jackass.

506
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,575

512
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,837
I admire you, Officer Lee.

513
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,720
By the way,
the firearms report I requested…

514
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,637
Here you go.

515
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,224
-Do.
-Yes?

516
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,895
Did you request
the customs clearance list? Here.

517
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,148
Yes. Something's bothering me,
so I just wanted to check.

518
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:36,527
It's good to see you working hard,
but let the detectives handle their work.

519
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,196
We should stay in our own lane.

520
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,032
I know. I'll do as you say.

521
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,658
I trust you.

522
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,951
-Thank you.
-Sure.

CUSTOMS CLEARANCE LIST

524
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,091
Hey, how come you haven't been
answering your phone?

525
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,343
Why are you so late?

526
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,512
It took longer than expected
to wrap things up cleanly.

527
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,265
You should've called me earlier, then.
You bastard.

528
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,059
Here's the picture of Mr. Kim.

529
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,314
Oh man, this is a really great shot!

530
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:18,361
Who would've thought
you had another talent, Jeong-man?

531
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,446
Here.

532
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,408
Get a move on.

533
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,623
Fucking hell.

534
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,420
-Hey, Jeong-man.
-Yes?

535
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,798
-This place is nice, isn't it?
-Yes, sir.

536
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,300
So,

537
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,970
do my boys and I

538
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,181
get to run this place from now on?

539
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,933
What the hell are you talking about?

540
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,477
Yong-gu will manage this place.

541
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,897
-I'm sorry?
-Are you kidding me?

542
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,441
Come on, just trust me.
This information is legit.

543
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,359
No way.

544
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,741
Fuck.

545
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,246
Why?

546
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,667
Well, you promised me last time

547
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,794
that you'd let us run
one of these businesses.

548
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,006
Come on, Jeong-man.

549
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,217
Look around.
Does this place really suit you guys?

550
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,347
But

551
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,934
my boys worked really hard for you.

552
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:36,188
We killed and buried people
just as you ordered.

553
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,607
-We cleaned up after--
-Damn it!

554
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,777
Make it short. Get to the point.

555
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,116
Give us a chance to live
like normal people.

556
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,492
"People"?

557
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,329
What have you been, then?

558
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,834
Weren't we just your obedient mutts?

559
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,629
What?

560
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,132
"Mutts"?

561
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,562
For fuck's sake.
Do you have to be so harsh?

562
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,773
You're making me feel like shit now.

563
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,735
Fine, you asshole.
You'll get your own when it's time.

564
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,944
So just be patient.

565
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,030
Okay?

566
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,618
By the way,

567
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,288
do you know any of my boys' names?

568
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,500
Is there anyone except you
I should know about?

569
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,795
Still, they're all working hard for you,

570
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,756
so I'd appreciate it
if you at least called them by name.

571
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,091
All right. Hey.

572
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:50,262
Take this, grab some food with your boys,
and wash up at a public bath.

573
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,098
You stink, you bastard.

574
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,682
Thank you, sir.

575
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,521
Hey! Toss this on your way out.

576
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,940
I don’t need Mr. Kim's ghost haunting me.

577
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,274
-You dumbass.
-It hurts!

578
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,235
-I took it out.
-Come on, for fuck's sake.

579
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,072
-That fucking hurts, you bastard.
-Hey, this bastard is…

580
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,865
He's here!

581
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,450
He's here!

582
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,869
Jeong-man, is this place ours now?

583
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,914
Jeong-man, what is this?

584
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,915
You look upset.

585
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,334
From now on,

586
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,254
Yong-gu will manage this place.

587
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,171
Fucking hell!

588
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,257
Gong Seok-ho, that son of a bitch!

589
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,092
-Why?
-U-tae.

590
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,179
-Did you search the place?
-There is a storage room.

591
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,973
But it's locked.

592
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,059
Mr. Kim knew he was gonna fucking die.

593
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,228
Maybe he fed us some bullshit
to fuck us over?

594
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,273
-Hey, Chang-ju.
-Yes?

595
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,818
Take the boys to that gosiwon on the news
and see if there's anything there.

596
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,653
U-tae, come with me.

597
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,697
-Oh man.
-Hey, let's go. Come on!

598
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,115
Guys.

599
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,619
Take this, go take a bath,

600
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,079
and eat something good.

601
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,249
Sorry it came to this
after all your hard work.

602
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,168
Hey, Jeong-man. What's wrong?

603
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,003
-Hey, it's okay.
-Jeong-man!

604
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:04,920
-Hey!
-Let's go.

605
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,177
Hey, what's up with you? What is it?

606
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,846
Seriously, what's gotten into you?
Jeong-man!

607
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,850
-You know where Mr. Kim's car is, right?
-Why?

608
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,019
Let's check it out.

609
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,939
Fuck-gyu, grab your mom's ID
and get over here quickly.

610
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,110
-Enjoy.
-Can we get a rolled omelet?

611
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,530
Of course. One rolled omelet, please!

612
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,617
DAESEONG RESTAURANT

613
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,208
Hey!

614
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,129
What's on your mind, Gyu-jin?

615
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,756
Go ahead. You can tell me.

616
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,051
Could I have 50,000 won?

617
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,678
50,000 won?

618
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,475
Why do you suddenly need money?
Is something going on?

619
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,728
No, nothing's going on.

620
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,355
I just need money.

621
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,858
Do you really need it now?

622
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,444
Yes, I need it.

623
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,114
I'm sorry.

624
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,116
Goodness, sorry for what?

625
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,285
I'm busy, so just take it from my wallet.

626
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,079
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD

627
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,915
Thanks for the food, ma'am!

628
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,166
Have a great day!

629
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,139
-I'm going now, Mom.
-Okay, see you later.

630
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,448
Hey, here comes Fuck-gyu!

631
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,326
Hey, Fuck-gyu!

632
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,712
Did you bring it?

633
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,430
What are you doing?

634
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,858
Fuck-gyu, you son of a bitch.

635
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,652
You wanna die?

636
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,570
Well, actually…

637
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,998
Am I a fucking joke to you?

638
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,626
I couldn't just bring my mom's ID
so suddenly, so--

639
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,336
Then steal her wallet, fucker.

640
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,806
I'm really sorry…

641
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,436
but you're using her ID
to borrow from a loan shark, right?

642
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,441
But the thing is, my mom works so hard.

643
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,320
Instead, I'll take racier photos.

644
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,868
Why the hell do I care
how hard your mom works?

645
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,663
Well…

646
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,498
Do I need to care about that?

647
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,333
No.

648
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,460
Let's try this again.

649
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,463
Can you bring her ID by tomorrow or not?

650
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,721
Yes or no?

651
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,685
Yes or no, you fucking asshole?

652
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,229
I'm sorry.

653
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,606
You fucking son of a bitch! Damn it.

654
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,525
Hey, just beat him up.

655
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,612
Fucking loser.

656
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,796
Where are the car keys?

657
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,631
He said to check the tires.

658
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,549
Look for them.

659
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,803
Hey, the car keys…

660
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,598
Found them!

661
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:09,683
Open it up.

662
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,353
Get out of the way.

663
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,908
What the hell? Holy shit.

664
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:39,713
Jeong-man.

665
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,842
This doesn't feel right.
Let's think it through.

666
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,055
Hey, you can't be rash about this!

667
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,641
What can you do with just one gun?

668
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,769
If things go wrong,
both of us are fucked for sure!

669
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,563
So you're just gonna beg for scraps
from that bastard Gong?

670
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:58,857
U-tae.

671
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,693
That bastard will never give us a chance.

672
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,948
"Just wait. We're almost there."
It's all just fucking talk!

673
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,868
You, me,

674
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,578
and our boys.

675
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,624
That bastard is giving us false hope
and messing with us.

676
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,793
What should we do?

677
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,213
-Fuck.
-Keep living this way?

678
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,140
U-tae.

679
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,894
I see this…

680
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,899
as an opportunity.

681
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,795
Where's the gun from?

682
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,006
It came by courier.

683
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:07,384
Why would a stranger send you
a package by courier

684
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,386
with a gun in it, of all things?

685
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,226
Ever gotten a parcel
from an unknown sender?

686
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,728
No, I have no idea.

687
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,860
When does the Gyeongin courier arrive?

688
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,570
Between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.

689
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,405
Have you seen this person around?

690
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,531
No.

691
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,742
What day is the recycling picked up?

692
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,702
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

693
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,211
Check thoroughly.

694
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,342
Are we sure he wasn't bullshitting us?

695
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,927
He said it was here.

696
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,637
Wait.

697
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,264
This isn't it. This is annoying.

698
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,099
This is the police.

699
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,101
What's going on?

700
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,520
Well…

701
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,982
We're trying to sell these boxes
for some extra cash.

702
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,401
-You got a problem with that?
-Do you?

703
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,612
Didn't you see the police line back there?

704
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,032
This is a crime scene.
You can't just come in here.

705
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,200
I can't read English.

706
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,369
-You dumbass.
-Thank you for your hard work.

707
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,731
Yes, sir?

708
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,025
Hey, you know what Yu Jeong-tae told us?

709
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,319
I don't think we need to worry.
It was all a lie.

710
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:50,821
Sorry?

711
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:55,742
We checked all courier records.
There are no deliveries to his address.

712
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,705
In fact, he hasn't received
a single package in the past three years.

713
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,124
He keeps saying weird stuff

714
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,961
about everyone having a trigger
or something.

715
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,504
He'll be a pain to deal with.

716
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,257
Anyway, we're checking
the camera from the scene

717
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,883
and nearby dashcam footage.

718
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,969
I'll call you if we find anything.

719
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,512
Understood.

720
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:17,597
By any chance…

721
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:23,311
Well, if you ever need help,
feel free to call me anytime.

722
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,772
Will do. Thanks. Have a good one.

723
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,437
23S-2549.
Jeon Won-seong is in that car, right?

724
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,521
Hey, get closer.

725
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:07,939
Yeah, Do?

726
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,358
Yu did receive a package. I saw the box.

727
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,529
But I think a man named Jeon Won-seong
in our area got the same one.

728
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,739
What? Jeon Won-seong?

729
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,866
We're chasing that bastard now.

730
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,952
We're almost on him. I'll call you back.

731
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:22,829
Okay.

732
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,379
Jeon Won-seong! Get out of the car!

733
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,589
Get out!

734
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:40,847
Hey, get out.

735
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,016
Hurry up!

736
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,519
What? Move out of the way.

737
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,106
Excuse me! Why are you doing this?
What did we do wrong?

738
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,400
Sir, did you give this person a ride?

739
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,404
This guy? He got out a while back.

740
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,283
Detective Seo!

741
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,328
Jeon Won-seong's ankle monitor and phone.

742
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,077
Who are you?

743
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,536
That hurts.

744
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,122
Wait!

745
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,333
My name is Moon Baek.

746
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,793
Moon Baek.

747
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,711
What are you doing here?

748
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,088
Well, I…

749
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,716
I came to pick something up.

750
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,051
A package.

751
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:26,211
