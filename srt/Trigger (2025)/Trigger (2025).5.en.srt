1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,874
Mrs. Oh!

2
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,627
Are you all right?

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,172
It's the coldest day of the year.

4
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,257
Are you able to stand?

5
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,136
Let's go. I'll take you home right now.

6
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,846
Goodness, thank you.

7
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,114
Let me take that.

8
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,205
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,250
I owe you another one.

10
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,588
Please keep the promise we made.
You agreed to take a break every hour.

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,383
I'd like to, but it's not easy.

12
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,387
I need to keep fighting.

13
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,766
-So others'--
-So you can keep others' children safe.

14
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,895
Because the world won't change
unless you do something, right?

15
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,065
I understand how you feel,

16
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,693
but your health comes first.

17
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,362
Goodness.

18
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:58,618
You're the only person
who understands and cares about me.

19
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,163
Just doing my job.
Go on in and get some rest.

20
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,081
All right.

21
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,625
Hold on. Just one moment.

22
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,794
Wait here for just a moment.

23
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:21,015
I just made this kimchi,
and it turned out great. Take some.

24
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,434
It's okay, Mrs. Oh.
I'm eating really well.

25
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,230
Come on, you said you love my side dishes.

26
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,483
-I'm really okay, Mrs. Oh.
-Please.

27
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:36,197
I'm giving this to you
because you remind me of my son,

28
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,282
so just take it.

29
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,828
Thank you.

30
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,290
Get some rest.

31
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,610
Mrs. Oh, we're here. You'll be all right.

32
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,488
You need to stay awake, okay?
Can you hear me?

33
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:22,160
Only authorized personnel may enter.
Please wait outside.

34
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,085
Is she gonna be okay?

35
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,639
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

36
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,017
Where are you going?
I asked where you were going!

37
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,871
"Police In Name Only" is coming in.

38
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,502
What the hell?

39
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,254
The bastard is back.

40
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,594
I warned you, didn't I?

41
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,473
Has this cop bastard
completely lost his mind?

42
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,685
Where is Gong Seok-ho?

43
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,585
What's all this?

44
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,672
LEE DO

45
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,426
Where are you? What's going on here?

46
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,679
Pat them down
and check if they have an address list.

47
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,972
An address list?

48
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,599
Guys, search all these bastards' pockets.

49
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,517
Hold him down.

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,060
What? Hold me down? Fuck you!

51
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,812
Stay still, you dirtbag.

52
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,982
Fuck off, you son of a bitch.
Don't fucking touch me.

53
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,445
You fucking bastards.

54
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,739
Fuck this shit! That fucking hurts.

55
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,075
What is this?

56
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,660
Do!

57
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,079
Did you check the car in that alley?

58
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,831
No, there's no camera over there.

59
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,917
So I was checking
if any nearby cameras caught anything.

60
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,085
And the address list?

61
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,299
What exactly is this address list?

62
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,727
Compare them.

63
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,941
"5 Domyeong-ro 1-gil."

64
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,943
"Oh Kyeong-suk."

65
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,653
What is this?

66
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,490
This is the same address.

67
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:06,908
That's right.

68
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:11,204
I don't think the recent shootings
were the work of individuals.

69
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,580
Then what were they?

70
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,542
An organized crime.

71
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,714
The gun deliveries imply someone
is exploiting these people's situations,

72
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,092
hoping they will pull the trigger.

73
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,803
The perpetrators
of this series of shootings

74
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,972
were not people with jobs
that allowed easy access to guns

75
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,725
or the financial resources
to smuggle them.

76
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,435
They were just ordinary citizens.

77
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,436
YEONGSEONG GOSIWON

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,939
I suspect that the delivery
of these guns indicates

79
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,526
that a person or an organization
is exploiting their situations,

80
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,194
hoping they will pull the trigger.

81
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,781
The address list before you
is evidence of that.

82
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,828
So each of these boxes
contained a gun and an address list?

83
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,503
Why did they put this in?
For what purpose?

84
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,382
To expose those who received
the address list to each other

85
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,385
because it may cause anxiety.

86
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,013
This means the recipient knows
where more guns are,

87
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,600
while someone else knows they have one.

88
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,270
You remember what Yu said, don't you?

89
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,354
There are

90
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,523
more guns.

91
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,192
There are more people with guns.

92
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,988
Someone might come to you
looking for a gun,

93
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,406
or if you need more guns--

94
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,116
Go find them for yourself?

95
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,495
That's right. Jo U-tae came here
looking for a gun after seeing this list.

96
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,372
Hey, lady.

97
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,000
You have a gun, don't you?

98
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,669
They're not just handing out guns.

99
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,340
They could be watching everything
about those who received the guns.

100
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,303
By the way, what's up with the names
on this address list?

101
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,971
Take a look here.

102
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,682
There should be a nickname
from the phone account setup.

103
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,309
They probably used the nickname.

104
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,603
This is all personal information.

105
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,229
How did they get it?

106
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,649
Everyone on that list
likely has malware on their phone.

107
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,318
Yes, that's correct.

108
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,654
Yu, Jeon, and Oh's phones
were all infected with malware,

109
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,615
granting full access to their phones,

110
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,327
including call logs, text messages,
and personal information.

111
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,287
Wait a minute.

112
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,374
But didn't they all say
there were no actual delivery records?

113
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,754
So I think they deliberately disguised it
as a package.

114
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,799
Package deliveries
are a daily routine in Korea,

115
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,302
and people rarely touch
or notice others' packages.

116
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,180
Seriously, who the hell
is behind this crap?

117
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,473
And for what?

118
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,728
If this is true, this is no small matter.
Let's verify the facts first.

119
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:46,025
Verify these people's real names
and if they match their actual addresses.

120
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,488
Most importantly, make sure
to check for guns and seize any found.

121
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,031
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,783
Detective Seo.

123
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,201
Yes, sir.

124
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,497
Lee Do found all this out?

125
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,793
Yes, Officer Lee found all this out,
including today's Oh Kyeong-suk case.

126
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,421
He's already suspended.
Tell him not to get into more trouble.

127
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,506
Yes, sir.

128
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,592
Still, we got this lead, thanks to him.

129
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,427
-We should push harder.
-Yes, sir.

130
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,513
-You get what I mean?
-Yes, I understand.

131
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,974
-And tell him he did well.
-Yes, sir.

132
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,069
Officer Lee.
Are you free to talk right now?

133
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,237
Yes, go ahead.

134
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,324
I did some digging on that Moon Baek guy.

135
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,369
Dongwol Industry
is a state-certified arms supplier

136
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,371
that exports weapons for military use.

137
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,751
They have really tight security
and only respond to official letters,

138
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,004
so I just checked a few basics.

139
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,134
He worked there until the end of last year
before resigning.

140
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,388
The reason for his resignation
was terminal cancer.

141
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,224
I heard he had a great rep
among his coworkers.

142
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,559
Is that so?

143
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,354
By the way, how did you end up
getting involved with him?

144
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,856
Well, it's a long story.

145
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,275
Let's keep this between us for now.

146
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,068
Okay, Officer Lee. Will do.

147
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,497
Seriously?

148
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:28,085
Where the heck have you been?
You can't just leave without telling me!

149
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,925
-You've been here this whole time?
-Of course. Can't you tell?

150
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,103
This doesn't concern you, so why…

151
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,192
Huh?

152
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,277
Who are you?

153
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,114
If you're grateful,

154
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,616
just say thank you.

155
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,625
I just can't figure you out.

156
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,761
If only I had answered the call…

157
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,974
What did…

158
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,437
Mrs. Oh say earlier?

159
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,148
What?

160
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,485
In the car.

161
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,195
I'm impressed.

162
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,116
With everything going on,
you still caught all of that?

163
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,662
She just said,

164
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:51,210
"I can die without regrets now,
so you don't need to try so hard for me."

165
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,629
That was all.

166
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,512
By the way, why do you treat her
like your mom when she isn't?

167
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,014
Just because.

168
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,519
She treats me like her own son.

169
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,564
I see.

170
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,152
Still, your real mom
might feel hurt to hear that.

171
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,408
She passed away when I was young.

172
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,161
Stay still, you bastard!

173
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,329
You are under arrest for murder.

174
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,456
-Let go!
-Stay still!

175
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,374
You have the right to an attorney.

176
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,293
You have the right to remain silent.

177
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:36,797
Sorry.

178
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,677
I don't have a mom either,
so I asked out of curiosity.

179
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,973
Did yours pass away too?

180
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,143
I have no idea.
She could be dead or alive.

181
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,857
All I know

182
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,861
is that it snowed heavily…

183
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,698
the day I was abandoned.

184
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,789
PLEASE WRITE DOWN
THE CHILD'S NAME AND DATE OF BIRTH

185
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,925
Excuse me.

186
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,932
Are you putting your baby in there?

187
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,979
Then let me take it.

188
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,398
I take them out of there anyway.

189
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,983
Well…

190
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,735
It's okay.

191
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,904
It's okay.

192
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,075
The baby will be cold
if you put it in there.

193
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,246
Does the baby have a name?

194
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,332
A name?

195
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,044
I wonder if my mom, who abandoned me,

196
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,588
gave me a name.

197
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,771
Is it a boy or a girl?

198
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,274
No clue. Let's bail before we get caught.

199
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,280
Man, a boy is worth much more.

200
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,544
Why not just buy both
if you're already buying?

201
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,754
If you only take one fucking eye,

202
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,382
how am I supposed to sell
a fucking one-eyed freak?

203
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,011
They say they only need one.
In exchange, they promised good money.

204
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:47,970
What?

205
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,555
They promised good money!

206
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,849
How much are we talking?

207
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,893
One big one. How does that sound?

208
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,478
All right. Just tell me the blood type.

209
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,521
Blood type AB.

210
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,772
Sure, of course!

211
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,317
-Pick a nice fresh one.
-Of course I will.

212
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,446
All right. Let's open the door.

213
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,782
Let's make some money.

214
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:15,122
Let's see. Blood type AB…

215
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,335
Hey!

216
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,671
Yeah, you. Come out here.

217
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,173
Come on.

218
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:33,140
What are we drinking tonight? Soju?

219
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,224
Nope.

220
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,602
Then beer? Nope.

221
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:41,148
Hard liquor.
We're having some hard liquor.

222
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,652
Let's drink some hard liquor. Oh yeah.

223
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,736
Dear me.

224
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,530
Good work today. You get to keep one.

225
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,201
Hey! Let's go grab some hard liquor!

226
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,580
At that moment, I had a feeling…

227
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,669
my life wasn't going to be
a walk in the park.

228
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,633
And that feeling quickly became reality.

229
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,014
After being returned a few times
by adoptive parents,

230
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,309
they finally sent me far away.

231
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,358
-Mom.
-What?

232
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,152
What's so great about me going to the US?

233
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,613
Everything will be better than here.

234
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,032
If you stay here,

235
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,369
your life will end up in the gutter.

236
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,539
The US is the land of opportunity,

237
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,291
so go and make the most of it.

238
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:46,088
And if you want to be loved,
always wear a smile.

239
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,553
One more thing. I'm not your mom,
so don't remember me as one.

240
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,471
It's burdensome.

241
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,643
"And if you want to be loved,
always wear a smile."

242
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,773
What a fucked-up thing to say.

243
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,697
She called it the land of opportunity…

244
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,911
but it turned out worse than the gutter.
It was a living hell.

245
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,824
My memory is so good
that I can still feel that pain vividly.

246
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,206
Still, don't pity me too much.

247
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,375
Thanks for today.

248
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,336
Go get some rest.

249
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,379
It's fine.

250
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,634
I might not have time,
but I've got plenty of loyalty.

251
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,636
I'll wait with you.

252
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,609
Fuck-gyu.

253
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,362
Fuck-gyu.

254
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,368
Don't ignore me, you little fucker.

255
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,579
You better be waiting at karaoke later.

256
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,419
Why should I?

257
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,420
What?

258
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,760
Goddamn, why is this bastard
acting up again?

259
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,554
I just don't want to go.

260
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,890
Say that again.

261
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,851
You don't want to?

262
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,644
No.

263
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,813
You fucking bitch.

264
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,357
Want me to leak your pics?

265
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,902
-Seong-jun.
-Get to class now, you punks!

266
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,864
Why aren't you going in?

267
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,574
The bell rang. Get moving.

268
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,584
-Hey, get lost.
-Okay.

269
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,175
Hey.

270
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,051
Say that again.

271
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,220
You don't want to?

272
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,973
You don't want to?

273
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,766
Answer me, you fucking bitch.

274
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,312
Okay.

275
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,646
Stop it.

276
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,403
Hi, guys.

277
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,030
Hello.

278
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,116
What page are we on today?

279
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,576
"Stop it"?

280
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,536
Today, we're going to…

281
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,454
Hey.

282
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,248
Since when did you have a choice?

283
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,335
A slave just shuts up
and does as he's told.

284
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,015
Call her a fucking math bitch.

285
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,686
-I don't want to.
-Do it.

286
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,316
Do it.

287
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,569
I said do it, you motherfucker.

288
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,404
Do it.

289
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,657
Do it.

290
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,204
-What the hell?
-Park Gyu-jin.

291
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,623
What is it? What's the matter?

292
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,585
Hey, you son of a bitch.

293
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,587
Stop it.

294
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,924
When I tell you to stop, just stop.

295
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,927
I told you to stop.

296
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,931
Stop it.

297
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,642
Fucking stop! Just stop it.

298
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:13,063
Stop it, you fucking asshole.
Just stop it!

299
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,280
Fucking shit!

300
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,743
Officer Lee, that motherfucker.

301
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,913
What's all this about?

302
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,623
That's what I want to know.

303
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,503
Who is this guy,
and why is that pig on my ass about him?

304
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:42,926
This is…

305
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,596
What is it? You know him?

306
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,223
He's Gu Jeong-man's lackey.

307
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,224
What?

308
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,059
Are you sure?

309
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,769
On the day we took care of Mr. Kim,

310
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,272
I saw this guy standing behind him
with my own eyes.

311
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,940
Gong, you motherfucker!

312
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,443
You fucking bastard! Hey!

313
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,486
-Hey!
-Jeong-man!

314
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,790
Gu Jeong-man, that fucking piece of shit.

315
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,336
Dad, can you help me out?

316
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,339
Huh? Why?

317
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,758
Did you get into trouble? What happened?

318
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,677
Can you lend me some money?

319
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,304
What for? What do you need it for?

320
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,181
I'm not saying I won't pay you back.

321
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,309
Is something up with the captain lately?

322
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,853
You'll understand
when you have kids of your own.

323
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:39,024
Hey, just pretend you don't know
until he brings it up himself.

324
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,400
Yes, sir.

325
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,736
I'm just worried. That's all.

326
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,821
Oh dear. Why are they arguing?

327
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,615
Just move back in, then!

328
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,701
Emergency contact for Oh Kyeong-suk?

329
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,041
The surgery went well,
so there's no need to worry too much.

330
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,460
Could we talk for a moment?

331
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,886
Mrs. Oh Kyeong-suk
had an internal organ infection,

332
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,056
so after surgery,
we put her in a negative-pressure room.

333
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,058
However, her test results…

334
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,061
Thank you, Mrs. Oh Kyeong-suk.

335
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,855
We'll need to manage the infection
for a few more days.

336
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,569
This afternoon, a subway incident occurred

337
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,115
when people, startled by a peddler
selling toy guns, fled,

338
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,534
tripping over one another
and getting injured.

339
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,536
Amid a spate of recent shootings,

340
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,540
passengers mistook
the toy guns for real ones,

341
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,918
instantly throwing
the subway train into chaos.

342
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,963
Funny how quickly
the world can change, huh?

343
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,050
That's how scary guns are.

344
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,386
Guns are scary?

345
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,138
Yeah.

346
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,142
Guns are scary.

347
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,021
A long time ago,
there was a very peaceful village.

348
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,443
One day, a man left a gun
in the town square and vanished.

349
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,196
But before long, the gun vanished,

350
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,491
and the village
began to change dramatically.

351
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,871
As more people were shot
and killed throughout the village,

352
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,875
distrust began to spread
among the villagers.

353
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:25,255
People started forming massive lines
at the gun store to buy firearms.

354
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,470
A man watching it…

355
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,683
smiled in satisfaction.

356
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,146
Why do you think he smiled?

357
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,152
Perhaps he thought
it turned out the way he intended.

358
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,781
Making them believe guns are justice
and rely on their power.

359
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,038
And those people?

360
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,706
Huh?

361
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,210
The people who received those guns.

362
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:08,840
To them, a gun could actually represent
both justice and power.

363
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,802
A gun represents
neither justice nor power.

364
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,473
It does nothing
but lead you to self-destruction.

365
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,144
So you should stop searching for guns too.

366
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,897
You said you didn’t have much time.

367
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,399
You should spend it on yourself.

368
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,450
So who is that man?

369
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,664
The man who left the gun.

370
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,126
An Asian with blue eyes.

371
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,337
That's what I heard.

372
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,055
The boys are all here?

373
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,890
Yeah, I checked myself.

374
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,685
Jeong-man!

375
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,936
Hey, wait here.

376
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,188
Damn it.

377
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,949
Shit, when did so many of them show up?

378
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,285
How is U-tae doing?

379
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,495
According to the nurses…

380
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,166
he could be in a wheelchair for life.

381
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,420
Fuck!

382
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,673
I told him not to be reckless.

383
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,802
What about that bastard?

384
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,222
Have you found the pig
who did this to U-tae?

385
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:40,890
Not yet.

386
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,601
We're still looking.

387
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,228
Damn it. Just wait
and see what happens for now.

388
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,402
No chance of improving with surgery?

389
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,987
I won't do it.

390
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,700
I don't want to feel
any more pain in this life.

391
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,211
Fucking son of a bitch.

392
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,094
Aren't you coming?

393
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,805
Sorry.

394
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,167
Hello, Officer Jang.

395
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,587
I'm at the hospital right now.

396
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,048
I'm heading down.

397
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,259
See you downstairs.

398
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,513
No, I don't need anything right now.

399
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,682
Okay, got it.

400
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,517
Officer Lee.

401
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,019
Let's grab some food before we go.

402
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,646
I'm hungry.

403
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,482
All right.

404
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,446
Excuse me.

405
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,073
Yes?

406
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,617
It's been bothering me for a while.

407
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,954
I think it's your phone.

408
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,165
My apologies.

409
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,712
SEOK-HO

410
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,326
-Hello, Officer Lee.
-You're here.

411
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,579
This is Moon Baek.
And this is Officer Jang.

412
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,873
Hello.

413
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,833
-Let's go.
-Sure.

414
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,585
Good night.

415
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,337
-Take care of yourself.
-Okay.

416
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,968
Bye!

417
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,701
Keep your distance. It'll be too obvious.

418
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,248
Why won't this bastard stop calling me?

419
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,627
-Why isn't he answering?
-No idea.

420
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,711
SEOK-HO

421
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,380
Are you sure it's okay to ignore his call?

422
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,175
That bastard will get more suspicious.

423
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,596
Fucking hell. Talk about shitty timing.

424
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,974
Hey, pipe down.

425
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,605
-Hello, sir.
-For fuck's sake.

426
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,774
Why haven't you answered my calls?

427
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,486
I'm sorry.
A few of my boys got hurt on a job.

428
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,654
Goddamn it.

429
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,198
-My mind's been all over the place.
-Hey.

430
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,034
-Yes?
-Get over here right now.

431
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,536
Sorry?

432
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,581
-Now?
-That's right, you son of a bitch.

433
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,959
Get your ass over here right away.

434
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,043
Understood.

435
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,964
What should we do?

436
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,717
Turn the car around.

437
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,665
Now,

438
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,876
no more problems, right?

439
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,420
Yes, sir.

440
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,506
Just give us the order.

441
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,760
Find people desperate
to get their hands on a gun.

442
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,387
Yes, sir.

443
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,016
And make no mistakes.

444
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:38,933
Yes, sir.

445
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,127
Bring up the location of the guns.

446
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,007
Look forward to it.

447
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,344
A new world will soon arise.

448
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:34,677
