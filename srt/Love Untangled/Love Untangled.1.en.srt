1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,023
I was five when I first confessed my love.

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,276
It was a success,
but it happened on a grave.

3
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,695
And the boy was my cousin.

4
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,405
KANG-JIN, I LIKE YOU

5
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,699
The second time was in third grade.

6
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,203
I wrote "I like you" on a note,

7
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,373
and he wrote back, "I like you too."

8
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,376
Then he moved schools the very next day.

9
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,088
Seriously, why say yes in the first place?

10
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,341
Then it happened.

11
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,593
Three, two, one.

12
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,679
My curly hair genes started kicking in.

13
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,641
Three, two, one.

14
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,729
Unlike my fraternal twin Hye-ri,

15
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,647
my hair turned into a tangled mess,

16
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,734
and so did my life.

17
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,330
The day I was gonna ask out
the boy next door,

18
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,169
he left with Hye-ri instead,
her hair all sleek and perfect.

19
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,632
That's when I decided.

20
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,969
I'll never confess my love ever again.

21
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,352
Never.

22
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,108
I said never.

23
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,612
LOVE UNTANGLED

24
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,031
SIMPLE DIY HAIRSTYLES

25
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,546
Hey.

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,464
What are you doing?

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,218
Hey! It's my turn this week.

28
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,303
I gotta listen to Good Morning Pops.

29
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,560
Mom, she's breaking our deal.

30
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,312
Why all the fuss
this early in the morning?

31
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,190
She always does whatever she wants.

32
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,485
But she says she needs it to study.

33
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,738
And, Se-ri,
you only ever listen to Korean pop.

34
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,616
Then I want a CD player.

35
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,619
Sure, just trade your mom for one.

36
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,537
Here.

37
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,289
Honey.

38
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,707
What are you watching?

39
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,125
PAK SE-RI, GOLF QUEEN

40
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,752
-Come eat.
-Look, Se-ri. Check that out.

41
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,171
Nothing is impossible.

42
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,673
She's the best in the world.

43
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,384
-Some things are impossible.
-That's not true.

44
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,886
I said come eat.

45
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,970
Your name's Se-ri too.

46
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,098
Here, this hair right here.

47
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,436
This curly hair you gave me
is impossible to straighten.

48
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,313
Oh, come on.

49
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,732
That's money saved on perms.

50
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,193
Dad! It actually costs way more.

51
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,320
Do you know
how expensive straightening is?

52
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,696
Will you pay for it?

53
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,073
No breakfast if you don't come now!
Come eat!

54
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,658
All right.

55
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,119
-Hey, Oh-my-Seri!
-Hurry up!

56
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,079
Come on out!

57
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,295
Hye-ri was being a pain again
this morning.

58
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,755
Yeah?

59
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,131
What now?

60
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,179
-I won.
-Give it.

61
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,096
Here.

62
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,141
Hey, is it true
she came top in her school again?

63
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,018
Whatever, I don't care.

64
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,186
What's this?

65
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,481
Hey, you two are nothing alike.
Are you really sisters?

66
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,234
Da-ul, don't push it.

67
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:58,321
Yeah, and Oh-my-Seri here
is far cuter than Hye-ri.

68
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,990
-Sol-ji.
-Hmm?

69
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,534
Do you owe Se-ri or something?

70
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,412
Se-ri, just this once,
can we switch deskmates?

71
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,164
Why? You have Sung-rae again?

72
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,500
I can tolerate him,
but not as my deskmate.

73
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,918
My ears can't take it.

74
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,253
Hey!

75
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,421
Oh-my-Seri and Solbangul!

76
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,881
What a lovely day!

77
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,258
It's him.

78
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,884
Hurry, let's go.

79
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,600
Hey!

80
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,271
GARAM HIGH SCHOOL

81
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,615
Here.

82
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,450
-It looks so heavy.
-Just take it.

83
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,165
It's Kim Hyun.

84
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,042
Isn't that Hyun?

85
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,043
Look at him!

86
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,922
It's Kim Hyun!

87
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,221
Kim Hyun.

88
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,183
The boy that half of my school
has a crush on.

89
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,814
Did he just wave at me?

90
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,857
Do you know her?

91
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,990
What was that?

92
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,366
Why did he wave at you?

93
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,660
Well,

94
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,454
at the beach yesterday--

95
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,247
-Yes, what?
-Go on.

96
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:40,298
It was nice out, so I went for a swim.

97
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,272
KIM HYUN

98
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,333
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,920
Same school, huh?

100
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,383
I thought only I knew this spot.

101
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,346
That's what I thought too.

102
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,391
Wait, he left his clothes
right next to yours?

103
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,725
Yeah.

104
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,312
Why? Why did he do that?
Maybe it means something.

105
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,939
Seems flirty.

106
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,860
Guys, excuse us.
Not interested in any of that.

107
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,154
Make way. Let us through.

108
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,072
Move it.

109
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,990
1ST SEMESTER 2ND MOCK EXAM
SENIOR CLASS RANKINGS

110
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,494
Why are you even looking?
You're not on it.

111
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,331
-Hyun.
-It's really him.

112
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,249
100TH, KIM HYUN

113
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,918
Se-ri, he's moving
to the self-study room, then.

114
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,964
The self-study room is
only for the top 100 students.

115
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,090
Legend has it,

116
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,051
if you ask someone out there,
it always works.

117
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,805
No more ocean swims for me.
I always get hungry in there.

118
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,142
I'm too sticky to go for tteokbokki,
but too lazy to go home and shower.

119
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,227
But I always end up craving tteokbokki.

120
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,855
And it tastes better when you eat out.

121
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,524
Hey, have you been to Cheongsu Snacks?

122
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,608
Sung-rae.

123
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,069
You have?

124
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,573
Now I get why they say
their ears hurt around you.

125
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,532
Who said that?

126
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,159
Was it Sol-ji?

127
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,286
Hey, Ma Sol-ji!

128
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,913
Ever been to Cheongsu Snacks?

129
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,958
Stop talking, will you? You talk too much.

130
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,335
Don't you have stuff to do?
Finished writing lines?

131
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,422
Lines? Of course…

132
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,424
I haven't.

133
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,682
Attention.

134
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,100
Bow.

135
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,227
Good morning.

136
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,272
Today, I need to tell you

137
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,816
some bad news.

138
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:08,654
The school trip you missed last year
because of the typhoon,

139
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,782
you're going this year.

140
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,579
Quiet!

141
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,501
What kind of school sends seniors
on a school trip?

142
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,003
The school board has lost it.

143
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,840
So, for your lines assignment,

144
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,426
I want two notebooks a week.

145
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,345
-What?
-Oh no!

146
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,262
Please!

147
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,723
Over here.

148
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,683
I'm open!

149
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,063
-Wow.
-Nice one!

150
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,022
Good shot.

151
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,984
-Hey.
-Huh?

152
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,571
To Won-yeong!

153
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,365
-Right here.
-Pass it!

154
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,449
One more pass.

155
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,827
-Nice!
-All right.

156
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,205
I'm doing it.

157
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,706
Here you go.

158
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,375
Ma'am.

159
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,293
I'll take a Neverstop.

160
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,476
Could you keep this
for the tall boy playing--

161
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,602
Kim Hyun?

162
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,354
Yes! How did you know?

163
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,275
There are just too many SRs today.

164
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,319
Su-rin, Seong-ryeon, and now Se-ri.

165
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,448
Think of something unique
to catch his eye.

166
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,535
With all those, his bladder's gonna burst.

167
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,703
FOR HYUN
FROM JI-HYE

168
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,497
Can I have one?

169
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,291
It's hot.

170
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,379
Rock, paper, scissors.

171
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,797
-Loser eats this?
-Yeah.

172
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,258
Park Se-ri.

173
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,676
Flintstone.

174
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,722
Flintstone's real name is Ko In-jung.

175
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,390
Done some brushing today, have you?

176
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,643
The nickname
comes from her Bronze Age hairstyle.

177
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,770
Just calmed it down a bit.

178
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,443
Together, we used to straighten our hair
with pencil boards.

179
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,989
You're into Hyun too?

180
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,710
PARK SE-RI

181
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,566
"Park Se-ri."

182
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,528
It's a pretty name.

183
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,032
It suits you.

184
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,321
PARK SE-RI

185
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,862
Hey!

186
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,866
Help!

187
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,162
Hey, wake up!

188
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,080
You gotta be kidding me!

189
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,308
You okay?

190
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,685
Are you all right now?

191
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,649
You really scared me.

192
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,111
Why did you go in if you can't even swim?

193
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,199
What the hell?

194
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:11,957
Damn it! Stay out of the water, mister.
It's dangerous.

195
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,639
GARAM HIGH SCHOOL

196
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,641
FACULTY ROOM

197
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,100
I see, so that's what happened.

198
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,897
Don't distract others, though,
even if you're not taking the CSAT.

199
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,816
I know you're a year older,

200
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,901
but try to get along with everyone.

201
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,279
Breaking news! Someone's here!

202
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,532
This is huge!

203
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,617
You always say that.

204
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,371
-Guess what I saw in the faculty room.
-What? What is it?

205
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,132
Today, we have a new student
joining us all the way from Seoul.

206
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,051
-Seoul?
-Introduce yourself.

207
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,305
I'm Han Yun-seok.

208
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,225
That's it?

209
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,478
That's it.

210
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,315
Look at his leg.
Bet he caused trouble before coming here.

211
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,277
-Take the seat at the back.
-I heard he got held back a year.

212
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,487
What? He got held back?

213
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,322
Se-ri, what's all that jabber?

214
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,286
Yun-seok.

215
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,954
Don't cause trouble.

216
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,875
-And, all of you, be nice to him.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,835
How many days till the CSAT?

218
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,254
184 days.

219
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,797
What's our job as seniors?

220
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,716
Studying.

221
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,800
That's all.

222
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,315
We meet again.

223
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,774
Mister.

224
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,320
Yeah.

225
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,408
So this must be from yesterday.

226
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,292
Still, you're lucky I was there.
That was a close one.

227
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,710
Mister.

228
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,628
Right.

229
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,139
Hey, what was that? You know each other?

230
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,642
No. We met at the beach yesterday.

231
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,226
Huh? At the beach?

232
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,770
Doing what?

233
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,355
It's a long story.

234
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,440
You went there for Hyun?

235
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,153
-Right?
-No, I didn't.

236
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,446
-Come on.
-You did.

237
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,031
You definitely did!

238
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,492
-You didn't?
-I said no!

239
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,409
You did!

240
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,411
-Yes, you did.
-Just tell us.

241
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,894
Hey. Isn't that Sung-rae?

242
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,063
What is he doing?

243
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,363
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you creeping like that?

244
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,572
Look at Yun-seok.

245
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,410
Umbrella, bags, crutch.
He's got his hands full.

246
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,578
Then why don't you go help him?

247
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,373
Well, I don't really want to make a fuss.

248
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,544
Sung-rae, you are
the walking, talking fuss.

249
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
What? Come on!

250
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,802
You're getting all wet.

251
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,846
Mister.

252
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,975
-I'm fine.
-No, you're not.

253
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,727
We're gonna be late. Walk faster.

254
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,061
Please.

255
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:03,981
Look.

256
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,691
Now Se-ri is helping him.

257
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,738
Stop, you three.

258
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,865
Sung-rae, get over here.

259
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,120
Your buddy's struggling with a bad leg
in the rain,

260
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,831
and you look perfectly dry and cozy.

261
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,124
It's not like that--

262
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,001
Don't just stand there. Take his bag.

263
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,678
Se-ri, do you have anything to say?

264
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,556
Me?

265
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,853
It's just the rain.
You know me. I didn't get a perm.

266
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,896
Not that.

267
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,773
Your name tag.

268
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,817
What? Where did it go?

269
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,487
I put it on this morning, but it's gone.

270
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,447
You'd better have it on tomorrow

271
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,741
or I'm making you an appointment
for some extra curls.

272
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,825
Actually, I…

273
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:08,712
PILOT SITE FOR SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM
GARAM HIGH SCHOOL

274
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,262
Run!

275
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,223
Stop pushing!

276
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,393
Hey.

277
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,020
Over there.

278
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,188
Oh my.

279
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,232
He looks so helpless.

280
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,568
Why does he keep getting on my nerves?

281
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,203
Oppa.

282
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,454
Enjoy your meal.

283
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,332
He's our classmate.
What's with the formality?

284
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,209
But he's older, so he's an oppa.

285
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,753
There's no need.

286
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,089
See? Mister wants it that way.

287
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,467
Se-ri, you're one to talk.
Why do you call him "Mister"?

288
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,137
Yeah, you can just call him oppa.

289
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,056
Nah, I just can't say that, ever.

290
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,978
I've never said that my whole life.
I'm almost allergic to it.

291
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,314
Whatever's fine.

292
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,442
All right, Yun-seok.
Let's keep it casual around here.

293
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:13,944
Eat up.

294
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,196
Shall we do that, then?

295
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,574
I mean, can I?

296
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,036
By the way, oppa,
I heard Se-ri rescued you at the beach.

297
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,454
Huh?

298
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,039
That means she's your savior.

299
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,082
Right?

300
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,586
Yun-seok, I'm your lifesaver, aren't I?

301
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,463
I carried your umbrella earlier
and even grabbed your lunch.

302
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,800
Ice cream.

303
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,263
Ice cream!

304
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,348
-Thanks for the ice cream.
-Sure.

305
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,352
I'm not saying it because of this,
but you're kinda cool.

306
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,980
Hey, you barely even know him.

307
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,774
I heard you're ditching the CSAT.

308
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,651
How did you know?

309
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,819
Well, our teacher…

310
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,697
Anyway, you have my respect.

311
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,949
Giving up is never easy.

312
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,035
-Look at me. I can't let go.
-What's this?

313
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,203
Hold still.

314
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,204
PARK SE-RI

315
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,413
Wow, that looks real.

316
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,999
But, Se-ri,
what'd you really do with your name tag?

317
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,459
I wish I knew!

318
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,668
Maybe someone took it?

319
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,464
PARK SE-RI

320
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,425
They say keeping someone's name tag
makes them like you back.

321
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,344
Someone must have a crush on you.

322
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:21,678
She's right.

323
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,097
Someone must've taken it.

324
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,935
Someone's clearly holding on to it!

325
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,562
He's keeping it safe for you!

326
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,649
You really think someone took it?

327
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,944
Man, that makes it tough.
I'm already into Hyun.

328
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,614
What if he shows up with my name tag
and says he likes me?

329
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,456
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

330
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,586
Yeah.

331
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,005
Yes, well, I'm fine.

332
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,674
I'm so sorry.

333
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,259
-What are you doing?
-Hurry up!

334
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,593
I'm coming!

335
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,180
You're really okay, right? See you around.

336
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,225
Hey! Get it together, man!

337
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,852
Move up!

338
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,107
I think he knows what he's doing.

339
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,067
You saw him smile? That gaze was intense.

340
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,778
Are you serious? He was looking at me?

341
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,531
I'm telling you,
he was totally flirting with you.

342
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,575
Maybe he hit you on purpose
just to come over.

343
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,911
Right?

344
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,664
I don't think so.

345
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,879
What do you mean?

346
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,590
I just don't think he did it on purpose.

347
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,678
Oh yeah? Are your eyes that fast?

348
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,347
It was clearly an accident--

349
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,348
Hey!

350
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,435
Whatever. Se-ri, don't listen to him.

351
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,603
Forget it. What's his problem?

352
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,688
Let's go.

353
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,448
Can't you read the room, bro?

354
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,247
I heard Hyun's into Lee Hyo-ri.

355
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,415
Really?

356
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,001
Yeah, he prefers her to Sung Yu-ri.

357
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,419
It's the long, straight hair.

358
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,255
Hey! Se-ri!

359
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,924
Breaking news!

360
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,925
What is it?

361
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,011
I'm not in the mood right now.

362
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,512
She's got straight hair!

363
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,265
Oh, come on. You guys are on that too?

364
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,517
No, Flintstone came with straight hair!

365
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,686
What? Who? Flintstone?

366
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,063
You mean our Flintstone?

367
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,570
Flintstone?

368
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,631
Flintstone.

369
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,091
How…

370
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,343
how did you…

371
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,267
Oh, this? I got a straight perm.

372
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,896
I'm not buying it.
You've had them so many times before.

373
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,981
It's not just any straight perm.

374
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,358
Magic.

375
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,235
Magic straight perm.

376
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,531
What's more,
it's a Seoul magic straight perm.

377
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,665
Where?

378
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,168
Rose Hair Salon.

379
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,504
How much?

380
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,797
200,000.

381
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,134
What? 200,000 won?

382
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,056
SPECIAL DEAL
ALL LENGTHS 200,000 WON!

383
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,475
SEOUL MAGIC STRAIGHT
RAINPROOF AND NATURAL!

384
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,272
Hi there. Do you have any questions?

385
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,648
ROSE HAIR SALON

386
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,485
Yes, about the Seoul magic straight perm.

387
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:10,657
I've tried so many straight perms,
but they never lasted a day.

388
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,909
What's so different about this one?

389
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,162
What's different?

390
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,330
It's just a whole different process.

391
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,666
Different chemicals, different equipment.

392
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:24,546
It straightens your hair
like you were born with it.

393
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,591
But anyway,

394
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,676
your hair…

395
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,596
It's quite something.

396
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,349
Well, it's still doable.
Would you like to try it?

397
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,518
1000 WON

398

ROSE HAIR SALON

400
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,523
Mom, let me help.

401
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,365
Go inside. I got this.

402
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,367
Let me help.

403
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,245
-"Mom"?
-It's fine, really.

404
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,162
Let's go in.

405
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,754
It's working!

406
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,924
What is?

407
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,967
Look.

408
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,136
It's all about the angle and spacing.

409
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,055
I should've tried this sooner.

410
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,101
"Wonder… ful."

411
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,728
"Ideas."

412
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,817
Amazing, isn't it?

413
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,235
-You want one?
-Yeah.

414
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,570
Want me to make you one?

415
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,654
Me too.

416
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,323
Not bad at all. It'll save time.

417
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,725
Yun-seok?

418
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,435
What are you doing here?

419
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,771
I was just passing by.

420
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,189
What about you?

421
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,025
Getting a haircut?

422
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,778
No. This is my mom's place.

423
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,324
Oh, really?

424
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,951
Well then, I guess I better say hello.

425
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:02,954
Wait!

426
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,081
Yun-seok, is that you?

427
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,459
Ma'am. Good afternoon.

428
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:08,835
Yun-seok…

429
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,131
I mean, oppa and I are in the same class.
My name is Park Se-ri.

430
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,635
The one with the crazy curls?

431
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,721
So you're friends with Yun-seok.

432
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,556
Yes, that's right.

433
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,309
You know I saved him
in the water, don't you?

434
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,310
What?

435
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,483
I mean, what if I hadn't been there?

436
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,069
Just thinking about it
makes my hands shake.

437
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,155
I wonder why he was in there
when he can't even swim.

438
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,156
Mom.

439
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,659
I didn't mean to go in. I just slipped.

440
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,744
I see.

441
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,704
You saved his life.

442
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,789
That's right.

443
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,165
I saved him.

444
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:52,003
You know, I literally risked my life
for Yun-seok that day.

445
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,008
Se-ri, was it?

446
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:02,013
Are you still interested
in that magic straight perm?

447
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:06,309
Of course I am! I'm more than interested.

448
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,394
I see.

449
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,728
You know,

450
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,981
it's been tough for Yun-seok
with that cast on his leg.

451
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,692
And he has no friends.

452
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,609
Pardon?

453
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,528
What do you mean?

454
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,989
We are super close! Aren't we?

455
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,742
Oppa is in good hands with me.

456
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,286
All right.

457
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,040
If you help him out till his cast's off,

458
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,669
then I'll think about
giving you that magic straight perm.

459
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,504
Really?

460
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,756
Yes, of course!
You have nothing to worry about.

461
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,258
-Okay.
-Leave it to me!

462
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,093
Hmm?

463
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,023
Wow, looks delicious.

464
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,108
I'm off!

465
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,403
-What about breakfast?
-It's fine. I'm busy!

466
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,988
-I can do it.
-Come on out.

467
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,656
-Good morning.
-Hi.

468
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,829
Can't you see he's injured?

469
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,748
Come on!

470
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,474
ROSE HAIR SALON
SEOUL MAGIC STRAIGHT PERM

471
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,643
Check out Rose Hair Salon.

472
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,897
Come to Rose Hair,
the best spot for straight perms.

473
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,607
Rose Hair Salon.

474
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,150
Try the Seoul magic straight.

475
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,068
Excuse me, Mr. Curls.

476
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,488
"Mr. Curls"?

477
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,575
Come here and your hair
will be straight as ever.

478
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,036
Why would I want to do that, huh?

479
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,412
It looks good.

480
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,289
No, I don't think you get it.

481
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,375
This Seoul magic straight
will actually straighten your hair.

482
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,752
I got this in Seoul.

483
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,712
Cost me 150,000 won.

484
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,970
What the…

485
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,100
You don't need to do this.

486
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,478
Hey, come on. Give them back.

487
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,562
Let go!

488
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,314
Give me that!

489
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,232
I said--

490
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,025
Oh no!

491
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,237
What are you doing?

492
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,738
Just stand still for a second.

493
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,534
-You okay?
-Maybe I broke my rib.

494
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,868
Should've played smarter.

495
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:33,081
Good thing I know how to land.
If it happened to you, you'd be dead.

496
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,583
Yeah, right. I'd have made the shot.

497
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,085
What are you talking about?

498
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,547
You think you can ball? Are you that good?

499
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:42,882
Hey.

500
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,467
Is he gone?

501
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,052
Huh?

502
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,728
Man, that was really close.

503
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,314
I can't let him see me looking like this.

504
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,484
Like what? You look the same.

505
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,987
Han Yun-seok.

506
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,780
We're in trouble.

507
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,824
-Darn it.
-What is it?

508
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,576
Follow me.

509
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,370
-Why? Where are we going?
-Hurry up!

510
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,711
Be careful.

511
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,355
Oh God!

512
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,774
Hey, are you all right?

513
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,110
Oh no. Your cast's soaked.

514
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,906
What's this place anyway?

515
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,325
This is my dad's storage room.

516
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,409
Wait.

517
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,207
Here.

518
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,674
You can get changed there. I won't look.

519
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,177
Is this yours?

520
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,931
No, that's my dad's.
Everything here is his.

521
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,481
Are you done?

522
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,360
Yeah.

523
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,202
All of this is your dad's too?

524
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,536
Yep.

525
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,040
Oh, except for this. This is my spot.

526
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,085
Do you like comic books?

527
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,044
No.

528
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,838
I mean,

529
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,715
I've just never read one.

530
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,758
What?

531
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,844
You've never read a comic book before?

532
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,805
That's right.

533
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,102
Hey.

534
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,397
I don't show these to just anyone.

535
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,190
Sit down.

536
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,819
They're my dad's, so no lending.
But you can come read sometimes.

537
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:08,987
I'll allow it.

538
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,697
No, I'm fine.

539
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,907
Hey, Yun-seok.

540
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:17,787
Seriously, you cannot miss out on this.

541
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,509
Here.

542
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,435
For God's sake.

543
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,230
You have a long way to go.
You should come by more to read.

544
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,857
The padlock combination here is

545
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,692
four, eight, six.

546
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,609
What?

547
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,654
-Four, eight, six?
-Hey, keep it down!

548
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,989
Someone could hear you.

549
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,742
Who? There's someone else here?

550
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:59,954
No, I mean we don't want
anyone else knowing it's 486 too.

551
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,081
-Two? 4862?
-No.

552
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,292
No, it's not 4862!

553
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,752
Come on!

554
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,046
Give me your hand.
I'll write it down for you.

555
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,465
No, I got it. It's 486.

556
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,050
Hey! Shush!

557
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,386
Make sure you keep this a secret.

558
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,638
Only my dad and I come here.

559
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,474
Especially Sung-rae.

560
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,226
If he ever finds out, it'll all be over.

561
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,397
Ugh, my ears still hurt because of him.

562
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,496
GO FOR HYUN'S HEART

563
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,039
First of all, thank you all so much…

564
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,041
OPERATION
"LOVE CONFESSION IN SELF-STUDY ROOM"

565
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,960
…for taking part
in the biggest moment of my life.

566
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,505
Don't be silly, girl. No way I'd miss it.

567
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,090
We're friends, aren't we?

568
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,551
Here.

569
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,849
-This is how you fold it, right?
-Yeah.

570
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,893
What are we doing?

571
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,144
What else?

572
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,814
Oh-my-Seri is going to ask Hyun out.

573
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,024
You can fold crane eggs, can't you?

574
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,943
Crane eggs?

575
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,403
Crane's eggs?

576
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,322
Crane eggs.

577
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,244
We'll fold each with all our hearts
and make exactly 1,000.

578
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,578
You think 1,000 is enough?

579
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,373
Mi-jin from the next class
folded 1,000 cranes, not eggs.

580
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,208
Then we'll make 10,000.

581
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,626
-What?
-10,000?

582
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,544
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

583
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,962
-Not possible.
-We can do it!

584
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,338
-Too many.
-Sounds great.

585
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,173
-No, it doesn't.
-You fold 1,000.

586
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,174
-No.
-Let's do it.

587
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,676
Yun-seok.

588
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,553
Where are you going?

589
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,723
Don't you realize
how big your role is here?

590
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,684
My role?

591
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,601
Yes.

592
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,857
"Seoul magic straight perm.
Han Yun-seok in charge."

593
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,944
But I'm not good at paper folding--

594
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,737
You're our friend, aren't you?

595
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,655
That's right.

596
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,575
I guess Seoul kids
are all about themselves.

597
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,035
No, it's fine. Let him go.

598
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,913
He's probably super busy
with something else.

599
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,833
This is what I get for saving his life.

600
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,585
-Uh-oh.
-Oh dear.

601
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,878
It's all right.

602
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,296
Now,

603
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,089
from here,

604
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,175
make one more triangle.

605
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,177
Hey, that's a good-looking triangle.

606
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,559
-Read it aloud. "Until."
-"Until."

607
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,604
"I didn't know what I wanted
until I met you."

608
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,691
"I didn't know what I wanted
until I met you."

609
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,860
"Until" is a conjunction…

610
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,489
When did you fold so many?

611
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,170
Hey!

612
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,428
Was I walking too fast? Sorry.

613
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,556
It's okay.

614
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,724
Rock, paper, scissors!

615
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,102
Rock, paper, scissors!

616
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,609
You owe me three notebooks next week.

617
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,069
Wait, sir.

618
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,153
Please.

619
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,322
You want four?

620
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,744
Han Yun-seok.

621
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,249
Why aren't you turning in your lines?

622
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,793
Oh, I hurt my leg, so--

623
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,545
And you lost your mind too?

624
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,674
Do you write with your foot?

625
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,635
BAEK SUNG-RAE

626
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,594
Bro.

627
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,597
No reasoning with him. He's the law.

628
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,225
Hey, why not?

629
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,061
It could mess with my exams.
What are you gonna do then?

630
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,896
It's just one day.

631
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,358
Do you know how much each day matters
to the school's top student?

632
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,027
Shoot.

633
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,821
Hwang Sang-cheol.

634
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:05,825
Switch with me just once.
It's really important.

635
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,953
I said no! It's not happening!

636
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,039
I really wasn't gonna say this,

637
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,292
but do you think he'll say yes?

638
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,419
You think Hyun's that desperate?

639
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,255
Wake up.

640
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:22,383
You must know
you're just not on his level.

641
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,054
What's that chalk-covered nerd
rambling about?

642
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,180
He must be insane!

643
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:33,227
Someone needs to switch seats with her
to ask Hyun out in the self-study room.

644
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,229
What a jerk move.

645
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,606
-What's he got besides good grades?
-Ignore him.

646
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,903
Hand me my bag. I'll carry it.

647
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,041
I can carry it myself, you know.

648
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,045
Thanks.

649
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,796
Wait.

650
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,181
Here.

651
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,396
Se-ri.

652
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,816
Are you crying?

653
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,821
I mean,

654
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,241
who does Sang-cheol think he is?

655
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,952
Hey…

656
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,501
Look…

657
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,965
You forgot this.

658
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,010
I don't care. Go inside.

659
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,057
JUNE MOCK EXAM FOR 1999 CSAT

660
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,742
Han Yun-seok.

661
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,121
Are you taking the mock exam?

662
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,455
Yes.

663
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,374
All right.

664
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,847
Finished?

665
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,432
Yes.

666
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,920
I thought you said you don't read comics.

667
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,048
You told me to.

668
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,651
What are you doing?

669
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,777
What do you think?

670
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,489
I'm praying with all my heart and soul.

671
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,699
But it's already submitted.

672
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,827
Be quiet.

673
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,621
I'm being serious right now.

674
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,927
Honestly,

675
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,596
I don't know what I'll do with my life.

676
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,974
There's nothing I'm good at
or really like.

677
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,726
That's not true.

678
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,688
There's something you're good at.

679
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,524
What?

680
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,192
Swimming.

681
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,778
Well, I guess so.

682
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,905
That's how I met Hyun too.

683
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,283
Seriously,

684
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,621
the second I get my hair straightened,
I swear I'm gonna tell Hyun how I feel.

685
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,208
Is straight hair necessary?

686
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,001
Of course.

687
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,254
Who on earth would like this hair?

688
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,311
Hey.

689
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,022
What's this?

690
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,525
You filled up the whole thing?

691
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,031
I don't know what to say.

692
00:42:56,115 --> 00:43:00,119
I don't get why
this is so important, but sure.

693
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,664
Of course it's important.
It means everything.

694
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,958
But these are useless in the end.

695
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,544
Han Yun-seok,

696
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,671
this is your problem.

697
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,965
Does it have to be useful
to mean something?

698
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:19,096
There's a bit of everyone's heart in here.
Me, you, and the guys.

699
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:25,603
Even if Hyun rejects me,
the times we shared will stay in here.

700
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,981
But, of course,
Hyun wouldn't do that to me.

701
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,781
All right. I shall also give you a gift.

702
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,911
Pretty, isn't it?
You can use it to write your lines.

703
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,081
But our teacher's just ridiculous.

704
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,208
Why is he making you write lines too?

705
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,963
Yeah. I've done lots of weird stuff
since I moved here.

706
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,054
Yun-seok.

707
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,222
You…

708
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,517
you got your cast off!

709
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,312
-Yeah.
-Congratulations, Yun-seok!

710
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,439
I mean, oppa.

711
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:11,899
Hello, Se-ri.

712
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,692
Good morning.

713
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,778
Thanks for all your hard work.

714
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,113
Do you want to come by and get your perm?

715
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,115
I'll do it for free.

716
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,075
What?

717
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,618
Really?

718
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,828
You're really going to do it for free?

719
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,916
Thank you so much!

720
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,001
-Shall we do it today?
-Oh, well…

721
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,380
Not today. I'll come by when I'm prepared.

722
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,173
"Prepared"?

723
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,509
Oh, it's nothing.

724
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,685
Hey, what's going on?

725
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,145
Se-ri, look.

726
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,855
What is it?

727
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,774
What?

728
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,317
"Han Yun-seok"?

729
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:56,819
Hey!

730
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,654
Yun-seok.

731
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,906
What's that all about?

732
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,450
You needed a spot in the study room.

733
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,368
What?

734
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,038
Oh my God!

735
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,332
You're freaking awesome!

736
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,919
You're seriously the best, for real!

737
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,298
What? Aren't you guys glad?

738
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,216
What's wrong?

739
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,385
Well, it's not that.

740
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,471
It looks like Hyun got bumped out.

741
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,225
I can't find his name anywhere.

742
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,818
100TH PLACE, SON HAE-GYO

743
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,246
He was just trying to help you.

744
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,972
-Bok-hee.
-Hi.

745
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,891
-You busy?
-Not at all.

746
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,100
Have some of this.

747
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,479
You shouldn't have. Thanks for this.

748
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,939
Did you hear about Jang-mi
from down the street?

749
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:16,857
Rose Hair?

750
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,651
Everyone's making a fuss
about her son topping the exam.

751
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,530
Yeah, but I also heard
he's not taking the CSAT.

752
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,825
Life's unfair, isn't it?

753
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,743
Exactly.

754
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,623
They say her husband's a professor
at Seongbuk University Hospital in Seoul,

755
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,917
and his family is a big deal.

756
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,418
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

757
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,879
Then what are the two of them
doing way out here?

758
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,423
He was pathologically jealous of his wife,

759
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,135
and he bullied his kid,
never happy with anything he did.

760
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,762
But he's such a good kid.

761
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,763
I know.

762
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,475
Hurt deep down,
he couldn't settle at his old school,

763
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:55,312
and the stress has him
sitting out this year's CSAT.

764
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,523
Oh dear.

765
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,359
Apparently, Jang-mi's sister
lives in America,

766
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,194
and she wants her to come.

767
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,914
Yun-seok?

768
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:15,874
Se-ri, you're here.

769
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:17,918
Dad?

770
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,378
What?

771
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,256
Yun-seok.

772
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,883
What are you doing there?

773
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,594
Oh, I made him stay for some ramyeon.

774
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,388
Ramyeon?

775
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,519
Let's see.

776
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,147
So,

777
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,816
about earlier…

778
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,193
Sorry for storming off like that.

779
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,570
It's okay.

780
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:49,116
By the way,
I guess you're smarter than you look.

781
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,368
Smarter than I look?

782
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,204
Yun-seok, do you like taking pictures?

783
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,415
-Pardon me?
-Here.

784
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,875
These are disposable cameras.

785
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,835
You can come and take as many as you need.

786
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,753
There's a ton back there.

787
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,298
My dad runs a photo studio.

788
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,009
Se-ri, did you guess well on the test?

789
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:11,138
Dad, don't say that.
I'm already feeling down about the exam.

790
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,266
What for? You never do well on exams.

791
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,853
Dad, stop.
Don't you have any expectations of me?

792
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,771
Of course I do.

793
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,607
Just not about your grades.

794
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,652
That's the same as nothing.
But you expect a lot from Hye-ri.

795
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,072
Tell me, has Hye-ri ever gotten you
a glass of water?

796
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,240
-Never.
-Exactly.

797
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,117
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

798
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,744
That's why you're the best!

799
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,662
-Right?
-Right.

800
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:47,257
Stop pulling your hair down.
You'll have no hair left to straighten.

801
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,677
Just let me have this.
Hyun's gonna be there too.

802
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,971
Hey, so how will you ask Hyun out?

803
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,725
That's the thing. What do I do?

804
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,521
Give her a break.
You're stressing her out.

805
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,440
Well, I didn't mean to.

806
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,734
It's a shame
after everything we've prepared.

807
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,902
Don't you agree?

808
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,947
School trip.

809
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,573
What did you say?

810
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,493
I can do it on our school trip.

811
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:18,288
I like it. It will have a campfire
and the perfect vibe.

812
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,374
And we'll be out of our uniforms.

813
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,096
Coming through, guys.

814
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,974
Why are you coming this way?
Not going to PE?

815
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,184
I gotta leave this with the teacher first.

816
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,477
What is it?

817
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,275
-What's this?
-What's this?

818
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,362
Oh my. It's so pretty.

819
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,489
Hey!

820
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,074
No touching.

821
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,577
My aunt sent it to me from America,
and it's expensive.

822
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,331
If you're that worried,
just stay here and look after it yourself.

823
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,792
No, we're playing buddyball today.

824
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,628
I love playing buddyball.

825
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,845
Stop dawdling, and, everyone, partner up.

826
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:17,556
If the person wearing the vest
gets hit, both are out.

827
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,266
Want to team up with me?

828
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,435
How dare you, Flintstone.

829
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,438
Sure. Go get a vest. I'll be the thrower.

830
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:28,734
What?

831
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,111
Be my buddy?

832
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,698
Okay, sure.

833
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,743
Who's attacking first?
I need one from each side.

834
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,245
All right.

835
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,581
You guys?

836
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,752
You.

837
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,753
Hey.

838
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,839
-Me?
-Yeah.

839
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,390
Here we go.

840
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,852
What?

841
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,897
In front of you.

842
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,365
Guard the vests!

843
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,000
Catch!

844
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,468
Are you insane?

845
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,596
Wait, I wasn't really trying to dodge it.

846
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,606
Seriously?
Why is she glued to him like that?

847
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,536
Nice!

848
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,872
Hey! Over there!

849
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,502
-Here!
-Sol-ji, shield me!

850
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,136
Go, Class 7!

851
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,847
Class 7!

852
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,307
-Get Se-ri!
-Watch your arm.

853
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,771
-Behind!
-Nice!

854
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:30,856
Nice!

855
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,066
Sung-rae,
you did that on purpose, didn't you?

856
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,943
Over here!

857
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,220
Oh-my-Seri, you okay?

858
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,263
-She's fine!
-What were you thinking?

859
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,098
-Head inside, all of you.
-Shit!

860
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,725
Everyone inside.

861
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,856
Crap.

862
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,362
Oh man.

863
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,155
Come on!

864
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:07,535
Seriously, why did I do that?

865
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:14,376
Yun-seok, this is Se-ri.

866
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,337
What are you up to? Are you well?

867
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,633
Man…

868
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,771
Yun-seok, this is Se-ri.

869
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,732
I'm sorry about earlier.

870
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,863
You know, it wasn't on purpose.
I don't know why I did that.

871
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,742
But I felt safe behind you.

872
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,415
Wait, what? What am I saying?

873
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,710
I can't with this.

874
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,176
Who's this?

875
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,352
You have one message.

876
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,104
Se-ri.

877
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,398
This is Hyun from Class 4.

878
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,693
Today was fun.

879
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,113
But that must've hurt.

880
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,615
You saved me out there.

881
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,075
Thanks.

882
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,036
I'll see you around.

883
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,508
You have one message.

884
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,054
Hey, it's Yun-seok.

885
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,930
How's your face?

886
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,684
I feel bad just leaving you like that.

887
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,063
I'm not mad at you, so don't worry.

888
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,859
Don't go rubbing eggs on that bruise.

889
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,986
You could get salmonella.

890
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,948
Get some ointment instead.
It'll heal faster that way.

891
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,410
All right. See you tomorrow.

892
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,287
Bye.

893
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,970
YOUTH RETREAT CENTER FACILITY MAP

894
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,179
-We'll take this path.
-Right.

895
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,806
The problem is getting the power.

896
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,057
Then, Ha-young,

897
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,309
you guys set up this area.

898
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,061
The main thing is getting power.

899
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,397
-I'll get it from right here.
-Hey!

900
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,357
-Come on.
-Don't ruin it.

901
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,525
Guys.

902
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,490
-Dang, girl.
-Yikes.

903
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,159
-How'd you even…
-It's fine.

904
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,618
I'm all right.

905
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:36,911
Anyway, where were we?

906
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:37,829
Here.

907
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,372
-Electricity.
-That's right.

908
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,124
Where can we get it from?

909
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,041
Thanks.

910
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,710
-From here?
-Well…

911
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,961
I'll take care of it.

912
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,922
Sung-rae, you know,
you're a real pro at this.

913
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,633
If this works,
Hyun's gonna be so into you.

914
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,261
You picked out baby names?
Better start thinking now.

915
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,262
Hey.

916
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,763
I'll catch you guys later.

917
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,016
You're leaving?

918
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,434
-Bro.
-We've just started.

919
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,686
-We have a job for you too.
-Okay.

920
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,273
All right, then, you can't complain later!

921
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,445
That's Park Chan-ho!

922
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,741
MOBILE GRADUATION PHOTO STUDIO

923
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,075
Three, two, one.

924
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,161
Great.

925
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,413
-Hey, look at you.
-That's a villain's beard.

926
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,957
-So pointy.
-What's that on your chin?

927
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,542
-Ahem!
-Is that seaweed?

928
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,922
My goodness,
look what her dad made her wear.

929
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,592
Golfer Pak Se-ri and her caddie!

930
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,763
Look, like this.

931
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,181
Fists in the air.

932
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,265
Good.

933
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,850
Take your socks off.

934
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,310
Take them off.

935
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,603
Oh, come on.

936
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,313
Dad, is this really necessary?

937
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,525
Seriously…

938
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,070
Give me a break.

939
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,407
Why is Dad making me do this?

940
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:58,660
Ugh.

941
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,246
God, I hate my hair.

942
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,206
Well, I like it.

943
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:06,751
Ready?

944
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:12,382
All right, here we go.
Let's see that pose.

945
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,301
Mr. Caddie.

946
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,679
-You gotta celebrate with her.
-Bigger smile!

947
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,973
-Okay.
-All right, look happy!

948
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,474
What's wrong with your face?

949
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,059
You're excited!

950
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,185
Good!

951
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,069
Hello.

952
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,696
Hi, Se-ri.

953
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,031
-It's hot.
-Oops. I'm sorry.

954
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,033
Are you okay? My goodness.

955
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,243
Se-ri.

956
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,579
I'm just so busy at the moment.

957
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,831
Can you go sit in the shampoo chair
for now?

958
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,332
Okay.

959
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,295
Oops. I didn't see that.

960
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,088
That must have hurt.

961
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,006
All right.

962
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,093
Yun-seok!

963
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,095
Can you shampoo Se-ri for me?

964
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,597
What?

965
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,599
You want him to do it?

966
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,809
He's pretty good at it.

967
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,564
I'm really sorry.

968
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,284
Okay.

969
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,120
Here I go.

970
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:35,882
Sorry.

971
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,799
You okay?

972
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:47,977
Here I go again.

973
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,562
Okay.

974
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,036
All done.

975
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,539
Have a good day.

976
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,793
You must be so happy with it.
It turned out perfectly.

977
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,003
-Do you mean it?
-Of course.

978
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,131
I guess I'll take this out for a spin.
Oh yeah.

979
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,509
-I feel good.
-Come again. No washing today!

980
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:20,593
All right.

981
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,178
Okay.

982
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:28,017
Did he get a Seoul magic straight too?

983
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,310
Sure, of course.

984
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,772
I see.

985
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,691
Wait, what's going on here?

986
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,192
This is odd.

987
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,652
Huh?

988
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,654
Yun-seok.

989
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,699
Did you use conditioner on her?

990
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,159
Oh, did I?

991
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,912
You weren't supposed to do that!

992
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,580
The perm won't take now.

993
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,124
Really?

994
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,001
Don't act clueless.
You know better than I do.

995
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:58,172
This isn't like you at all.
What were you thinking?

996
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,216
Mom, I'll be back in a bit.

997
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,927
Wait, where are you going?

998
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,637
What's gotten into him?

999
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:09,767
Se-ri, sorry about that.
I'll wash your hair again.

1000
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,144
Hurry now.

1001
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,313
Come on, hurry.

1002
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,820
Quiet!

1003
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,367
Anyone heard from Se-ri?

1004
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,370
There, she's coming!

1005
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,947
-So pretty!
-It's amazing!

1006
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,616
Hey, the curls are completely gone!

1007
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,327
It's, like, crazy smooth.

1008
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,543
Looks great. It's worth the money.

1009
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,424
You're just too idealistic

1010
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:28,471
Your gaze alone
Won't get a girl to make a move

1011
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:31,891
Girls like that don't exist
And I'm no different

1012
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:35,144
Just like this

1013
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,620
Hello!

1014
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:53,621
Nice to see you.

1015
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,373
-Mr. Park, hello.
-Hi!

1016
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,335
Look over here. That's it!

1017
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,854
-That's enough.
-Wait, just one more.

1018
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,314
Take one with Won-yeong.

1019
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,152
Three, two, one.

1020
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,738
Okay! Three, two, one!

1021
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,463
"Letter to my parents."

1022
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,885
"Mother, Father, it's me, Sang-cheol."

1023
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,055
"I know things have been tough."

1024
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:57,727
"Not realizing how hard
last year's economy hit us,

1025
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:01,772
I just kept whining
and made it harder on you."

1026
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,233
"Mother, Father."

1027
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,654
"You always say sorry to me."

1028
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,909
"But you've done nothing wrong."

1029
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,177
-He's here.
-Yeah.

1030
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,559
Hey!

1031
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,062
It's beautiful.

1032
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,315
Good work. It's lovely.

1033
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:45,733
Oppa.

1034
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,193
The blanket.

1035
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,239
Right. Yes.

1036
01:05:58,871 --> 01:05:59,747
Se-ri.

1037
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:00,998
Are you ready?

1038
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,875
Stay focused.

1039
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,543
You can do this. You look amazing.

1040
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,128
-You've got this.
-So pretty.

1041
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,380
-You hear me?
-Give it.

1042
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,175
"I will repay every last bit."

1043
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,511
"Thank you,

1044
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:15,721
and I'm sorry."

1045
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,764
You startled me.

1046
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,557
-"I love you."
-Follow me.

1047
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,475
Why?

1048
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,062
"Even in another life,
I'd choose to be your son."

1049
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:30,361
-Quickly.
-What?

1050
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,365
Hello, everyone.

1051
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:39,203
I'm Garam High's official photographer,
Park Hong-il.

1052
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,543
Go that way.

1053
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,295
-That way?
-Yeah.

1054
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:18,826
I'm back.

1055
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,578
-Come.
-Scoot over.

1056
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:22,830
Sit down.

1057
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:33,841
I wonder who put all these lights up.

1058
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,055
It's pretty.

1059
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,057
Yeah.

1060
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,436
I like your new hair.

1061
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:56,697
The crane eggs.

1062
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:58,866
That was you, right?

1063
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,161
How did you know?

1064
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:05,039
The jar had "Park Hong-il"
written on the bottom.

1065
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,624
Isn't that your dad?

1066
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,292
It was cute.

1067
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,045
When you blocked that ball for me too.

1068
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,380
Man, you were super athletic.

1069
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,674
Right. Yeah.

1070
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:19,637
I should've known when I saw you
swimming that well at our beach.

1071
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,639
"Our beach"?

1072
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,184
Only you and I know that spot.

1073
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,689
What are they saying?

1074
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:31,607
Don't know.

1075
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,151
-Can you hear them?
-No.

1076
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,456
So

1077
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,960
did you want to say something to me?

1078
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,715
Yes, I did.

1079
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,050
That's right.

1080
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,973
Well, say it. You're making me nervous.

1081
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:10,187
-What's happening?
-Huh?

1082
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,313
What are they saying?

1083
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,274
Shush, I can't hear them.

1084
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:20,865
Ah, with our love

1085
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,493
Hyun.

1086
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,953
Yeah?

1087
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:30,082
I liked you a lot.

1088
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,503
Because of you, I got a straight perm

1089
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,214
and made those crane eggs too.

1090
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:40,342
But,

1091
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:44,889
now that I'm here in front of you,

1092
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:47,725
I can't stop thinking about someone else.

1093
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:50,936
And bring light within

1094
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:55,024
Ah, with our love…

1095
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,402
They're leaving.

1096
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,987
Let's go.

1097
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:04,700
Forever unchanging

1098
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:11,165
We'll reach out to dark places…

1099
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:12,082
Did you tell him?

1100
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,918
You guys dating now?

1101
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,212
I dunno, stop asking.

1102
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:17,630
Why?

1103
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,215
What happened?

1104
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,592
Be quiet. We'll get in trouble.

1105
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:28,390
Ah, with our love

1106
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:33,771
Forever unchanging

1107
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:40,110
I always thought I had to change
for someone to like me.

1108
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:45,199
Like I needed to be better and prettier.

1109
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:47,701
But

1110
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:52,289
I don't think about any of that
when I'm with him.

1111
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:54,500
Is that right?

1112
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:04,718
Wow.

1113
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,554
I don't know who it is,
but I'm jealous of him.

1114
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,602
You must like him a lot.

1115
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,524
You think so?

1116
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:57,122
Uh, I got Audition Vol. 2 for you.

1117
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,084
Okay.

1118
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,008
I've got studying to do, so you go ahead.

1119
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,719
AUDITION

1120
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,806
But you can't take it home.

1121
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,100
I'll dive into it after the exam.

1122
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:29,822
Darn it.

1123
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:33,492
My hair keeps falling.
I don't know what to do with it.

1124
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,509
Yun-seok.

1125
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,223
Don't you have any questions for me?

1126
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:01,437
About what?

1127
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,273
About me and Hyun.

1128
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,025
You're not curious?

1129
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,863
How did it go?

1130
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,323
Well,

1131
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:14,950
I didn't ask him.

1132
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:21,748
Why not?

1133
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:25,502
Well,

1134
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,337
I need to study.

1135
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,720
Don't tell the others though.
They'll be disappointed.

1136
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:36,972
All right.

1137
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,852
And, Yun-seok…

1138
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,357
can you buy me a giant taffy
to wish me luck for my exam?

1139
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:53,739
You think bigger taffy
means better scores?

1140
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,741
Man, you're so…

1141
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,243
All right, just read your comic book.

1142
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,204
Seriously.

1143
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:07,711
8 DAYS UNTIL THE CSAT

1144
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,048
Hey.

1145
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,510
Stop distracting me. I'm studying.

1146
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,971
Forget studying.
It's time to practice guessing.

1147
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,352
I could've studied more
if we didn't have to do lines.

1148
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,482
I just want it all to be over.

1149
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:32,486
I want to go see the ocean.
It's so pretty in winter.

1150
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:37,157
If it snows,
it'll look like Flintstone's snow globe.

1151
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:41,203
You live right by the ocean,
and you're not tired of it?

1152
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,705
And have you ever seen snow in Busan?

1153
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:46,750
Still, it's possible.

1154
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:55,592
Hey.

1155
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,012
Isn't that Yun-seok?

1156
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:00,847
What?

1157
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:03,850
That looks like Flintstone.

1158
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:22,828
Where did you find something like that?

1159
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,163
Oh, Se-ri asked for a big one.

1160
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,749
Is it too big?

1161
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:30,419
The bigger, the better.

1162
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,466
Maybe I'll try the CSAT next year.

1163
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,012
Really?

1164
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:48,061
I thought you just hated the idea.

1165
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,273
I don't know.

1166
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,442
I think I can take it now.

1167
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,073
What?

1168
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:06,371
Here.

1169
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,540
What is this?

1170
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,751
You asked for a giant taffy.

1171
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:16,965
Right.

1172
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:18,967
Thanks.

1173
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,977
Hey! Yun-seok!

1174
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,564
Um…

1175
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,149
Are you

1176
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,235
and Flintstone close?

1177
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,738
Flintstone?

1178
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,159
No.

1179
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,996
Then why are you two hanging out?

1180
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:56,380
What, can't I hang out
with a school friend?

1181
01:17:56,463 --> 01:18:00,425
Friend? Since when were you two friends?

1182
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,596
Se-ri, good luck tomorrow.

1183
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:07,891
Hey, wait!

1184
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:09,810
You've got this!

1185
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:11,228
Hey!

1186
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:13,271
Han Yun-seok!

1187
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,236
Seriously, what the heck?

1188
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:27,661
Se-ri.

1189
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:29,037
-Here.
-I'm really sorry.

1190
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,373
There's no way I can go today.

1191
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:33,875
Dad, it's fine. How old do you think I am?

1192
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,211
Mine is close by, so I can go alone.

1193
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:37,754
Didn't I tell you?

1194
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,966
I said don't eat that
because it might've gone bad.

1195
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,594
Se-ri, should I take you there?

1196
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:47,639
It's okay, really. Just go with Hye-ri.

1197
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,725
Too bad it's not the same test site.

1198
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,309
Good luck, Hye-ri.

1199
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,853
-Thanks.
-Be right back.

1200
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:54,062
All right. See you.

1201
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,356
Aim for the top!

1202
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,399
COLLEGE MEANS DATING

1203
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:58,483
Nothing can stop you!

1204
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,818
Good luck.

1205
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,654
GOOD LUCK WITH THE EXAM
GET A PERFECT SCORE

1206
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,406
1999 COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC ABILITY TEST

1207
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,199
You got this!

1208
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:08,952
You got this!

1209
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,594
I'm sorry.

1210
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:42,861
Go crush it!

1211
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:45,363
Hey!

1212
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:50,911
Se-ri,

1213
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:52,370
good luck with the exam.

1214
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,373
Okay, thanks.

1215
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:00,962
Oops.

1216
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:11,348
You've got this!

1217
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,943
Two times two is four.

1218
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:24,069
-So…
-Yes!

1219
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,154
…the answer is four.

1220
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,698
Goodness, how long will this last?

1221
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:31,993
Gosh, that's just great for our trip.

1222
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,578
Show some pity, will you?

1223
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:40,377
Se-ri.

1224
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,299
Aren't you gonna…
check the answers at all?

1225
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,302
Every six months, the interest…

1226
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,933
I think I skipped a line
in my answer sheet!

1227
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,434
Hey.

1228
01:20:56,935 --> 01:21:01,606
It's all right. Who knows?
Maybe you scored higher that way.

1229
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:06,444
You're right.

1230
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,330
Everyone,

1231
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:19,416
you've done well.

1232
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:25,505
And for those of you who think
writing lines cost you the exam,

1233
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:29,092
I was just helping with an excuse.

1234
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:30,927
You would've wrecked it anyway.

1235
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,262
Well,

1236
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,723
you can't change the results now.

1237
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,224
So from now on,

1238
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,226
have all the fun you want.

1239
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,353
Yes, sir!

1240
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:44,316
If you're interested,
come to the jokbal alley by seven.

1241
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,736
Jokbal!

1242
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,242
How about some tteokbokki
to raise our spirits?

1243
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:55,452
Sounds good.

1244
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:58,955
I can't believe
food is on your mind even now.

1245
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,081
Of course.

1246
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,791
Hey, actually,

1247
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,502
I gotta go do some stuff for my mom.

1248
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:05,587
You're not eating?

1249
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,546
No.

1250
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:07,464
Okay.

1251
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,007
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

1252
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:13,929
I've got some stuff to do too.
You guys go ahead.

1253
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:14,846
Really?

1254
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,181
That's a bummer.

1255
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,558
-I know.
-See you!

1256
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,831
Se-ri.

1257
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:46,211
What was that?

1258
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:15,532
Walk a bit more?

1259
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:18,243
Shall we?

1260
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,036
Okay.

1261
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:23,999
Let's race!

1262
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,917
Hey, wait for me!

1263
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:31,506
Whoa!

1264
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:36,344
You're pretty fast.

1265
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,096
Careful.

1266
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:43,601
Hey.

1267
01:23:49,315 --> 01:23:52,902
Do you remember I saved you right here?

1268
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,904
-Of course I do.
-Yeah?

1269
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:58,491
Seriously, what were you thinking
when you jumped in here?

1270
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,203
Honestly?

1271
01:24:05,331 --> 01:24:06,416
That day,

1272
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:11,129
I was thinking about what would happen
if those waves took me.

1273
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,467
I was having a really hard time.

1274
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:21,890
But then, funnily enough,

1275
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,350
I saw someone swimming there.

1276
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,397
She was having so much fun.

1277
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,038
PARK SE-RI

1278
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:47,415
-Where did you--
-I was holding onto it.

1279
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,543
To remember the person who saved me.

1280
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,133
I'm so glad it was you, Se-ri.

1281
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,069
Se-ri.

1282
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:24,202
I like you.

1283
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:59,070
We're here again.

1284
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:01,865
Yeah.

1285
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:09,330
Hey,

1286
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:12,667
what are you doing on Sunday?

1287
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:16,880
I'll be seeing you.

1288
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:21,885
Oh, is that so?

1289
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,345
Okay.

1290
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,264
I'll see you then.

1291
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:57,480
Mom.

1292
01:27:58,064 --> 01:27:58,898
Oh.

1293
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:00,608
Hi.

1294
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:06,656
Looks like
I need to go to Seoul on Sunday.

1295
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:09,117
Why all of a sudden?

1296
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,995
I heard there's new equipment
at the suppliers' in Seoul.

1297
01:28:12,495 --> 01:28:15,498
You know I'm nothing without my equipment.

1298
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:17,500
Want me to come with you?

1299
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:18,835
No.

1300
01:28:18,918 --> 01:28:21,963
People will wonder why the shop's closed.

1301
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,799
You should stay and explain to them.

1302
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,342
Okay.

1303
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:28,886
Do we have everything?

1304
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:33,016
I'm off now. Take care of Busan for me.

1305
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:36,728
Don't worry. Busan's in safe hands.

1306
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:39,188
That's reassuring.

1307
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:41,065
Se-ri, hurry up!

1308
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,775
See you on Sunday.

1309
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,736
Okay. Enjoy your trip.

1310
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:46,154
All right, let's go.

1311
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:47,071
Okay.

1312
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,489
-Bye.
-Bye.

1313
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:49,991
Yeah, bye!

1314
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,202
Aren't you coming?

1315
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:54,537
I said okay!

1316
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:56,205
Will you hurry up?

1317
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:58,708
Hi, Sol-ji.
Sunday at Gwangalli Beach, right?

1318
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:02,253
I'm counting on all of you.
You guys are the best.

1319
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,546
Thank you so much.

1320
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:05,673
You heard her.

1321
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,594
This is the last project
of our school days.

1322
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,437
Aren't you cold?

1323
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:24,525
Sure, it's cold,
but we can't miss the stars.

1324
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:28,154
My sweet Hye-ri and Se-ri,

1325
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:30,573
I hope all your dreams come true,

1326
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:33,159
and you have happy lives.

1327
01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:37,330
Wait.

1328
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:38,331
What about me?

1329
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:42,168
-Your dream's already come true.
-It has?

1330
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:45,088
You married me.

1331
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:46,839
You must be insane!

1332
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:48,925
-What?
-Unbelievable.

1333
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:52,762
You said that was your dream
when you asked me out.

1334
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:54,472
Zip it, old man.

1335
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,728
Hey! Speed it up!

1336
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:01,813
Is this right?

1337
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:02,730
-This?
-No.

1338
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,109
-Stick it here?
-Yeah.

1339
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,278
It won't stand.

1340
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,824
-Ha-young.
-Yeah?

1341
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:14,075
Look. Is this okay?

1342
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:16,035
Yeah, looks good.

1343
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,793
Hey, they're coming!

1344
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:25,795
-What?
-Come on!

1345
01:30:26,295 --> 01:30:28,047
Run!

1346
01:30:37,348 --> 01:30:38,224
You must be cold.

1347
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:39,183
What?

1348
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:41,185
No, I'm okay.

1349
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,151
No!

1350
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,404
-Go?
-Now?

1351
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:58,786
I knew you'd need this.

1352
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,581
Oh, thanks.

1353
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:05,960
Do you want to go inside?

1354
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:06,919
Huh?

1355
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,838
No, I'm fine.

1356
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:23,394
Not now. Go back inside.

1357
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,606
Huh? To the right?

1358
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:27,940
-Right?
-Okay.

1359
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:28,858
That way.

1360
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:34,906
Wait, is that the cue? Should we hit play?

1361
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:39,494
-Se-ri, just a moment.
-Huh?

1362
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:46,626
Go back inside! Go inside!

1363
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:54,926
I need to use a phone.

1364
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:06,229
Just wait. Wait for my cue!

1365
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:09,065
What?

1366
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:11,400
Wait!

1367
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:16,989
Hey.

1368
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:18,908
Are you okay?

1369
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:21,369
Se-ri, I'm sorry.

1370
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,913
I need to go to Seoul right now.

1371
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:26,707
My mom's in the hospital.

1372
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:34,674
SE-RI ♡ YUN-SEOK

1373
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,308
Se-ri.

1374
01:32:45,518 --> 01:32:47,853
It's fine. We can do it again.

1375
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,941
I'm so sorry. You all worked so hard.

1376
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:56,153
Don't worry. We'll do it again.

1377
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:07,039
Please leave a message.

1378
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:10,626
Yun-seok.

1379
01:33:11,794 --> 01:33:14,088
I can't seem to reach you.

1380
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:17,925
Is your mom doing okay?

1381
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:22,555
Leave me a voicemail
when you get the chance.

1382
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:25,057
I'll be waiting.

1383
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,542
I LIKE YOU TOO

1384
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:13,022
Have you gotten taller?

1385
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:20,071
It's been quite a while.

1386
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,198
Is that how you greet your father?

1387
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:26,827
She slipped on the stairs.

1388
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:30,122
You know how clumsy she can be.

1389
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,376
I heard you skipped the CSAT.

1390
01:34:37,129 --> 01:34:39,423
She never cared about your studies.

1391
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:41,842
And she calls herself a mother.

1392
01:34:48,557 --> 01:34:49,850
So you did this to her?

1393
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:01,278
This is why I don't trust her.

1394
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:06,033
She said you're happier
and more cheerful down there,

1395
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:09,036
but you've just become rude and dumb.

1396
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,798
Han Yun-seok.

1397
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:24,510
Get back home.

1398
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:37,231
FOR RENT

1399
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:42,653
Man, what happened to him?

1400
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,697
I wish he could just call us.

1401
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,200
My mom says the realtor received a call.

1402
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,370
Apparently, the paperwork's all done.

1403
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,207
But the call wasn't from Yun-seok's mom.

1404
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:57,209
What does that mean?

1405
01:35:58,043 --> 01:36:01,046
Her husband's a professor
at Seongbuk University Hospital.

1406
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,674
He bullied his kid,
never happy with anything he did.

1407
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:05,384
I have to go.

1408
01:36:07,386 --> 01:36:08,471
Se-ri!

1409
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:17,021
Where are you going?

1410
01:36:17,521 --> 01:36:18,522
Se-ri!

1411
01:36:20,357 --> 01:36:26,322
This is Saemaeul Train No. 11,
bound for Seoul Station.

1412
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:42,797
SAEMAEUL TRAIN TICKET
BUSAN TO SEOUL

1413
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,513
Show your love through giving.

1414
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:56,018
SEONGBUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

1415
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:03,818
Well…

1416
01:37:04,568 --> 01:37:06,320
Excuse me.

1417
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:09,782
Is there a patient
named Baek Jang-mi here?

1418
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:49,613
BAEK JANG-MI

1419
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:57,538
Auntie called.

1420
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:05,796
She said to come to America now…

1421
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:11,385
because once we return home,
he'll never let us leave again.

1422
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:18,225
We should go, right?

1423
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:35,701
To be honest, I don't know what to do.

1424
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:43,709
I don't want to go.

1425
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:04,897
Mom.

1426
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:07,733
I don't want to leave.

1427
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:12,863
I just…

1428
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:18,077
I just want to go back to Busan.

1429
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,189
Hi.

1430
01:39:47,272 --> 01:39:48,273
It's me.

1431
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:51,652
I can't get a hold of you.

1432
01:39:53,445 --> 01:39:56,490
I have something to tell you.

1433
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,290
Yun-seok.

1434
01:40:08,919 --> 01:40:10,254
I miss you.

1435
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:13,924
I miss you so much.

1436
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,628
Hi, it's me.

1437
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,548
I can't get a hold of you.

1438
01:40:55,799 --> 01:40:57,885
I have something to tell you.

1439
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:04,975
I thought about it while you were gone.

1440
01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:10,189
I don't think I see you
as anything more than a friend.

1441
01:41:11,648 --> 01:41:12,608
And

1442
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:17,154
if we keep spending time together,

1443
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:20,240
it'll probably lead to misunderstandings.

1444
01:41:23,535 --> 01:41:25,245
It's better if we stop seeing each other.

1445
01:41:27,623 --> 01:41:29,750

Wow, I never thought I'd see this day.

1450
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:20,300
-Well done.
-Thank you.

Wow, S.E.S. You all look amazing.

1453
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:30,102
-Right?
-Right.

1454
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:31,645
And quit smoking.

1455
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:37,484

01:44:29,221 --> 01:44:33,100
SE-RI AS PAK SE-RI
HER FACE SAYS IT ALL

1465
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:40,315
YOU FOUND ME!

1466
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:43,485
I LIKE EVERY VERSION OF YOU, SE-RI

1467
01:44:48,865 --> 01:44:52,452
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU LAUGH

1468
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:56,123
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU MAKE ME LAUGH

1469
01:45:03,213 --> 01:45:05,340
I JUST LIKE YOU

1470
01:45:10,762 --> 01:45:14,516
I'LL BE ROOTING FOR YOU ALWAYS

1471
01:45:19,938 --> 01:45:21,857
Hi, Se-ri.

1472
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:27,612
I'm writing down my feelings here

1473
01:45:27,696 --> 01:45:29,364
with pictures of things you like.

1474
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:33,410
Your dad helped me with this,
and I hope he kept it a secret.

1475
01:45:43,086 --> 01:45:45,005
Like you once said,

1476
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:49,217
I filled this with my heart
from all the times we shared,

1477
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:51,303
and that alone makes me happy.

1478
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:54,723
Se-ri,

1479
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:59,353
you pulled me out of the water
and my dreams.

1480
01:45:59,936 --> 01:46:01,813
For that, I'm truly grateful.

1481
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:06,151
Your name,
which I held tightly in my hand…

1482
01:46:06,234 --> 01:46:07,736
CHRONICLES OF LOVE

1483
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:10,447
…is now engraved in my heart
and can't be erased.

1484
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,826
I am so glad

1485
01:46:16,244 --> 01:46:18,538
I met you on that windy day.

1486
01:46:31,802 --> 01:46:33,637
I love you, Park Se-ri.

1487
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:14,010
Keep it straight!

1488
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,429
Arms straight!

1489
01:47:15,512 --> 01:47:18,014
Keep your pace. Turn!

1491
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:39,953
-Hey.
-Oh-my-Seri!

1492
01:47:40,036 --> 01:47:41,872
Where are you? What's taking so long?

1493
01:47:42,497 --> 01:47:44,833
Man, I can't get used to your voice.

1494
01:47:44,916 --> 01:47:47,544
My class just ended. Stop bugging me.

1495
01:47:47,627 --> 01:47:49,087
Fine. Just hurry up.

1496
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:51,423
Will you guys stop?

1497
01:47:51,506 --> 01:47:54,176
Hey, save that for when we're not around.

1498
01:47:54,259 --> 01:47:55,343
No.

1499
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:57,387
-Oh my God.
-You're so cute!

1500
01:47:58,388 --> 01:48:00,098
You're just so cute.

1501
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:01,433
You're cute too.

1502
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:04,352
Stop. My eyeballs are melting.

1503
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:05,812
Have a bite.

1504
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,147
Can I get a medium beer?

1505
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:09,566
Hey, don't blow the blind date tomorrow.

1506
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,152
I never said I'd do it.

1507
01:48:12,235 --> 01:48:13,612
Hey.

1508
01:48:14,404 --> 01:48:15,864
You won't come?

1509
01:48:17,365 --> 01:48:19,826
But I already saved
the lucky table for you.

1510
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,411
Lucky table?

1511
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,456
That's where it all begins.

1512
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:25,874
Sir.

1513
01:48:26,374 --> 01:48:29,336
I told you it's a secret.
You weren't supposed to tell!

1514
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:30,754
You're right.

1515
01:48:31,254 --> 01:48:32,464
It's fine.

1516
01:48:33,048 --> 01:48:36,968
Confess your feelings there,
and it just works every time.

1517
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:38,053
I did too.

1518
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:41,389
My darling's from Seoul,

1519
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:43,808
and we met right here.

1520
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:48,897
Honey.

1521
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:51,274
All right.

1522
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,484
I'll be right there.

1523
01:48:55,403 --> 01:48:56,696
Please come tomorrow.

1524
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,698
You definitely have to now.

1525
01:49:01,117 --> 01:49:03,078
There are couples everywhere.

1526
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:12,170
Oh-my-Seri, you better show up tomorrow!

1527
01:49:13,004 --> 01:49:14,839
You have to, for me!

1528
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:30,981
Please come again.

1529
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:38,530
What are you thinking about?

1530
01:49:43,159 --> 01:49:44,202
Well,

1531
01:49:44,744 --> 01:49:47,038
years ago, on that beach,

1532
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:51,876
I planned the love confession of my life.

1533
01:49:52,836 --> 01:49:53,920
Did it work?

1534
01:49:55,755 --> 01:49:58,633
I wouldn't be sitting here if it did.

1535
01:49:58,717 --> 01:50:01,219
You never know who you'll meet in life.

1536
01:50:01,886 --> 01:50:03,972
I never thought I'd live in Busan either.

1537
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:38,340
SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY
I'M NOT FEELING WELL

1538
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,896
YOU LOOK FINE TO ME

1539
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:04,616
Hello? What is this?

1540
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:07,827
Hello?

1541
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,664
Where are you right now?

1542
01:51:10,747 --> 01:51:12,374
-Hey!
-Mr. Kim Yeong-sik?

1543
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:14,376
-Here!
-Hello?

1544
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:15,293
Over here!

1545
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:21,257
Babe!

1546
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:37,649
Seriously, are you messing with me?

1547
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:39,984
Se-ri.

1548
01:52:15,437 --> 01:52:16,479
How have you been?

1549
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:26,865
Yun-seok.

1550
01:52:28,825 --> 01:52:30,160
I'm sorry.

1551
01:52:33,455 --> 01:52:36,791
I lied to you back then.

1552
01:52:37,959 --> 01:52:40,837
I actually missed you so much.

1553
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:43,298
I know.

1554
01:52:43,798 --> 01:52:44,924
You told me.

1555
01:52:47,385 --> 01:52:48,261
I did?

1556
01:52:50,263 --> 01:52:51,598
You didn't know, did you?

1557
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:54,434
The messages get saved,
even if you hang up.

1558
01:52:55,769 --> 01:52:56,770
Yun-seok.

1559
01:52:58,021 --> 01:52:59,397
I miss you.

1560
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:02,192
I miss you so much.

1561
01:53:14,370 --> 01:53:16,498
I didn't want to delete your voice,

1562
01:53:16,998 --> 01:53:19,000
so I've been paying my pager bill
all this time.

1563
01:53:27,926 --> 01:53:30,470
Here. I have something for you.

1564
01:53:40,688 --> 01:53:43,608
I made one every time I thought of you,
and it became this.

1565
01:53:45,985 --> 01:53:47,904
Come on…

1566
01:53:50,615 --> 01:53:51,574
Se-ri.

1567
01:53:53,618 --> 01:53:54,536
Will you…

1568
01:53:56,746 --> 01:53:57,747
be my girlfriend?

1569
01:54:02,168 --> 01:54:03,044
Yeah.

1570
01:54:09,175 --> 01:54:11,177
Finally…

1571
01:54:29,028 --> 01:54:32,615
Oh-my-Seri's got a boyfriend!

1572
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:40,748
I thought it was over long ago,

1573
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:45,044
but our final love confession
turned out to be a success.

1574
01:55:02,145 --> 01:55:02,979
Hey.

1575
01:55:03,897 --> 01:55:04,856
Gimme.

1576
01:55:05,398 --> 01:55:06,274
Give me that.

1577
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:10,278
Give it here.

1578
01:55:10,778 --> 01:55:12,614
-Give me some too.
-Okay.

1579
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:13,698
Here.
