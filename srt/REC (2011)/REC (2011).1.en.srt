16
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,250

When I first saw you I was confused
whether you're gay or not

56
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,417
Look, now you've got so much hair.

Well, do you want me to spill everything?

67
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,250
It's just I didn't have chances,

231
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,417

00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,958
What are you shooting now?

235
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:09,667
Recording that we're doing,

236
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:14,750
is like 5th year anniversary album?

237
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,167
But, it's feel like i'm shooting a porn.

238
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:20,500
Porn... Don't be up-tight.

239
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,083
Well, just call it 'YA-DONG'.

240
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,250
'YA-DONG'?

241
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,083
Yeah, That's more relevant.

242
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,375
5years.... That's long time.

243
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,833
How was it?

244
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:36,917
I'll be honest.

245
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,542
Go on!

246
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:47,792
My boyfriend name is Song young-jun,
30 years old.

247
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,417
He's such a kid at that age.

248
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,833
So one-sided mind. totally one-sided.

249
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,417
You always want to your own way.

250
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,708
Not a human being. Just animal.

251
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:04,625
That means you been going out
with animal all these years.

252
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,833
Yeah. it's animal.

253
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,375
So.

254
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,583
But because of me,

255
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,125
he became a human being

256
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,292
I'm so pleased.

257
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:21,917
Then, next time when you asked
to be with Mr. Song again?

258
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,818
Never again.

259
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,142
How should I?

260
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,558
He always want to his own way.

261
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,304
Picky choice of meal,

262
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:39,067
go to movies only he wants.

263
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,250
And have sex when he wants.

264
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,833
Whatever he only wants.

265
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:49,125
If someone asks me to do it again

266
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,292
I won't do it. i'll stop them.

267
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,208
You're so mad at me.

268
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,542
It pouring out so naturally.

269
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,792
Why not? I'm telling the truth.

270
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,042
Are you feeling guilty?

271
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,542
Yes, It hurts.

272
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:09,542
Sharp sword ran through my heart.

273
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,500
It hurts.

274
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:23,500
I feel like i'm a celebrity.

275
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,000
Right this before,
You were saying you won't do it.

276
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,417
I'm getting used to it now.

277
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,333
What we gonna do?

278
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,708
What?

279
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,208
You probably get pissed after you saw this.

280
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,708
Why?

281
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,333

00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,833

00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,042
No! no!

292
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,667
When you hated me most?

293
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:19,667

294
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,042

00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,208
"Korea gay community is not change."

Actor quite not fit the line, kind chubby.

332
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,542
I don't see any fat.

333
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:58,625
His face in not so attractive either.

334
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:03,250

335
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,000

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,000
What kind of person is
young-joon's boyfriend?

342
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:24,958
My boyfriend?

343
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,083
Yes.

344
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:32,250
I have one boyfriend.

345
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,542
He is...

346
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:48,083
Young and spoiled.

347
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:51,750
Simply a baby.

348
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:54,917
Is that all?

349
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,292
I'm so disappointed.

350
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:11,958
My darling is just sweet and tender.

351
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,000
And he is mature even though he's young.

352
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:20,875
What happen, you're commending?

353
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,208
Today is special day.

354
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,792
Special day.

355
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,625
What do you like about me?

356
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,417

357
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,667
Yes.

358
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,417
I just can't pick one thing,

359
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,750
but good person?

360
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,542
Feeling good, nice feeling.

361
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,375
Nice feeling.

362
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,750
With you, I feel comfortable
without any thinking.

363
00:23:55,875 --> 00:24:03,167
This sort of things led to us until now.

364
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:09,083
Usually, romance of gay guys in Korea
are 1 year equals 10 years.

365
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:14,458
5 years equal 50 years

366
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,250
that means we're married couple.
Am I right?

367
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,708
Married.

368
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:23,375
Married, then who is husband
and who is wife?

369
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,125
I'm a top, that means i'm a husband.

370
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,833
What is that, you're very conservative.

371
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:31,667
Oh. no.

372
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:35,500
For that matter, i'll be doing a top today.

373
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:39,292
You think? If you think you can try, go ahead.

374
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:42,125
You're born bottom.

375
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,667
Come here. come.

376
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,292
Let me go.

377
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:52,833
Put the camera down.

378
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,750
Come here, bottom boy.

379
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,333
Bottoming for me.

380
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,958
Sorry, I was wrong.

381
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,625
You always pounding me like this,
did you know?

382
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,167
I don't know, didn't know

383
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:11,042
I'll let you know.

384
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,875
How much do you like me?

385
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,458
How much?

386
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,458
This big.

387
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:26,500
What? really?

388
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,792
All except for this big. would you believe?

389
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,458
Should I believe or what?

390
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:39,083
Well, How much do you like me?

391
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,292
As much as we made love.

392
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,625
As much as we made love?

393
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:48,750
Then we should do it everyday.

394
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:58,083
Honestly, What am i for you?

395
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,333
To me?

396
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:05,417
You were being corny.

397
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:10,917
But I like corny.

398
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:15,417
Not being covered up, That's being honest.

399
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,250
Is there anything would you like to do?

400
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,250
Now?

401
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,667
We have finish 'YA-DONG' first.

402
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,167
Later...

403
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,792
Later?

404
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:31,875
That beach, I'd like to go there again.

405
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,750
Where you asking me to break up
with big fuss.

406
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,417
Yeah, there.

407
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:43,167
Even though, I loved it there.

408
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,375
Go again, I'm promise.

409
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:51,125
When we go if you ask me to break up again.

410
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,917
I'll do it.

411
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:57,792
That was, when I was young.
Now I'm grown up.

412
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:01,042
I don't believe you. It's not convincing.

413
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:06,292
Now, let's get into the main course?

414
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,000
Main course?

415
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:01,333
Look up, I can't see your face.

416
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:06,708
Young-joon, in the future....

417
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,625
You're not going to upload this on 'P2P'?

418
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,750
I'll upload this later as...

419
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:16,125
'VEGEMIL-B and SOLEMIO's 5th year
anniversary sex tape' on internet.

420
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,875
If that happens, you're dead meat.

421
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,750
You can't trust me?

422
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:24,875
You didn't act like I can trust you.

423
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,083
I was a bad person to you.

424
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,958
Well, now you know.

425
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:38,083
Are we going to break up someday, right?

426
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,417
Why are you talking about that,
all the sudden?

427
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:45,917
Why?

428
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:48,333
When time comes...

429
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:52,250
I'm wondering, how I'm gonna feel
when i'm watching this film.

430
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,125
I'll just masturbate.

431
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,375
You're so low! dirty!

432
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,167
Am I low? dirty?

433
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:09,958
Yes.

434
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,583
Would you like taste of dirty?

435
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,583
Tickle me,

436
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:23,917
Sorry.

437
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,500
I told you shave some.

438
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:35,625
Hey...?

439
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,875
What?

440
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,292
Can you live without me?

441
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:42,250
Of course, there are so many
good gays out there.

442
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:43,625
Right!

443
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:55,208
I think we should remember this moment.

444
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,625
Like video that we're recording now.

445
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,833
You told me, you gonna masturbate.

446
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:03,292
You always acting so sensitive about
for funny jokes that I made.

447
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,917
You should just listen to me what I say.

448
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:09,708
You don't seem to respect me.

449
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,417
Anyway...

450
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,458
Do you like making love with me?

451
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,875
What are you going to do, if I said not really?

452
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,542
I'll make up to you.

453
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,250
Young-joon?

454
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,250
Yes?

455
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,875
My darling?

456
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,292
Why?

457
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:51,250
Your eyes look sad.

458
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,833
Even after I do this?

459
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,083
Come on.

460
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,125
Slowly.

461
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,333
Give it to me.

462
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:02,083
What's wrong with you?

463
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:04,125
It's nothing.

464
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,917
Such a kid.

465
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:12,000
I think something in my eyes.

466
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,167
I'll record this.

467
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:20,250
To make fun of you, later.

468
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,708
You were just a kid after all.

469
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:38,250
I can smell you from my hands.

470
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,167
Try smell them.

471
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,958
It's nice.

472
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,083
Do you know that?

473
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:58,375
While i'm working, when I think of you,

474
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,875
I smell my hands.

475
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:08,625
Each time I do that,
It feels like i'm talking to you,

476
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,958
and having sex with you

477
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:17,208
It just feels like you're just next to me.

478
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,417
Aren't you a pervert?

479
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:21,750
What?

480
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,917
If i'm a pervert, you're one, too.

481
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:27,583
That makes us, pervert couple.

482
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:03,000
Your smile is your best feature.

483
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,500
I wish you always smile.

484
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:12,458
Darling, can you make that face again.

485
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,167
Look at this.

486
00:51:44,792 --> 00:51:49,292
Surprise!

487
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:58,167
I didn't expect anything today,

488
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,917
but I was really really happy.

489
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:16,042
Thank you for loving me and care about me.

490
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:26,000
And thank you for making me happy.

491
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:52,083
You were always my best,

492
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,417
and will be.

493
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,417
I think,

494
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:15,500
we are happy people.

495
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:28,625
As time goes by, many things will be forgotten.

496
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:40,125
I think we should remember today, forever.

497
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:58,833
You're liar. I don't smell anything.

498
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:16,500
Don't skip your breakfast
because I'm not with you.

499
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:26,042
Don't smoke because you get stress.

500
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,167
When you're drunk,

501
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:39,167
ask help to other people next to you.

502
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,583
I had so many things wanted to say.

503
00:54:55,250 --> 00:55:02,250
But, I'm worried you might think it's too much.

504
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:09,708
However,

505
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:14,458
take care of yourself, well. right?

506
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,958
Can you promise me?

507
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:57,417
Your nose is runny.

508
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:04,750
Did you record? got it?

509
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:07,958
My darling, I'm recording all of this.

510
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:09,750
You should‘ve record them.

511
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:12,000
It's disgusting.

512
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,958
Come here.

513
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:41,667
I'm tired.

514
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,083
It's too much.

515
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,375
Catch me if you can.

516
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,750
It's tough.

517
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:13,667
For the last...

518
00:59:13,792 --> 00:59:16,750
Record us that we're heading towards beach.

519
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:21,042
Step into the water.

520
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:26,875
I can't see my face.

521
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,125
Hold on.

522
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:29,708
Can we... do that?

523
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:35,375
Can we... do that?

524
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,750
I don't think so.

525
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:53,958
No. no. no.

526
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:10,000
Joon! joon! joon!

527
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:16,000
Start!

528
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:17,125
One.
