1
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:14,072
This minimalist design that you got going here,

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,650
it’s just not working for me.

3
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,934
I have to disagree with you, Mom.

4
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,650
The design is perfect.

5
00:00:20,908 --> 00:00:24,233
It’s a huge improvement from the previous design of this house.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,358
This feels more homey.

7
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,045
I don’t want too big of a house and closed off

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,717
where family members can’t even see each other anymore.

9
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:32,945
Like ours.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,618
I heard you resigned

11
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:37,400
because of Miguel’s case.

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,080
Why?

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,400
For you, Luna.

14
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,207
I knew it was important to you and Kierra.

15
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:47,484
I didn’t want to disappoint you.

16
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:50,900
I know we’re not the same people anymore.

17
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:54,725
I want you to understand, Luna, that I’m really trying.

18
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:57,650
I want you to give me a second chance.

19
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:03,124
Move over ladies…

20
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,500
- Your goddess– - Wow!

21
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:05,498
has arrived.

22
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,617
Wow!

23
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:10,039
Hey, the Boracay trip is set in stone, okay?

24
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:12,942
I already declined two photoshoots for this.

25
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:16,601
Don’t worry, Via even came home for this vacation.

26
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:57,233
Thank you!

27
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:59,427
Enjoy!

28
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,682
Wow! I’m so excited.

29
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,267
You ruined the shot, Yanna.

30
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,520
Do you remember what you and Kalix did here before?

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,479
Of course not.

32
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,106
Please, you don’t have to pretend.

33
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,108
I remember what you told me, about the bathtub—

34
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,026
Didn’t you two—

35
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,652
Come on, Ke, shut up!

36
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,778
You did a taste test.

37
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,530
What do you mean, Yanna?

38
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,449
You both had a little taste of each other.

39
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,909
Maybe you can do it again.

40
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,827
They just might.

41
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:26,122
For Kalix and Luna’s taste test, cheers!

42
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,498
Yes, for taste testing!

43
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,333
Cheers!
Hurry up.

44
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,376
- Hey! - Come on, Luna.

45
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,045
Don’t play hard to get. Come on.

46
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,046
Convince me.

47
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,505
- Come on, Luna. - Come on, please.

48
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,090
I’ll kiss you if you keep this up.

49
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,843
- Nevermind. Cheers! - Cheers!

50
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,887
Cheers!

51
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,578
Why don’t you just have a taste test again?

52
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,242
You’re both single anyway,

53
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:52,567
and you can get back together.

54
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,065
There’s a bathtub!

55
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,050
Why don't you do it again?

56
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:58,785
Come on girls, stop teasing Luna.

57
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,973
It’s such a big decision to get back with an ex.

58
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:04,834
It’s been a long time since you broke up with Kalix,

59
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,275
you did nothing but study and work.

60
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,817
I’ve been on multiple dates, Via.

61
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:13,233
It just didn’t work out, okay?

62
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,150
It didn’t work out because you weren’t working hard for it.

63
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:20,103
It’s understandable after what happened between her and Kalix in the past,

64
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:22,464
Luna’s still scared to fall in love again.

65
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,826
But, I have to say, props to Kalix for stating his intentions.

66
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,562
No more mind games.

67
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:30,590
You’re right. I actually think Kalix seemed really mature.

68
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:32,492
He was being so sweet to you on-site,

69
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:34,525
acting like your husband.

70
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:38,025
Really? So, what’s stopping you?

71
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:40,458
I guess I'm scared.

72
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,983
I don’t know if it’s still worth it for us to try again.

73
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:45,400
I get it.

74
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:48,817
But how would you know if you won’t even try?

75
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,192
What’s the worst that could happen?

76
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,811
You’ve survived a heartbreak, remember?

77
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:57,108
I don’t wanna go through that pain again, Yanna.

78
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:58,749
Who says you will?

79
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,288
What if it all works out?

80
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,967
Kalix isn’t pressuring you for an answer, right?

81
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:05,817
So make use of this time to think things through.

82
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,978
She’s right. Just use our time here in Boracay to think, Luna.

83
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:14,692
That’s true and don’t be pressured to decide right away.

84
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:17,396
Love can wait, especially if it’s worth it.

85
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:19,042
Hey, hey!

86
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,767
That’s not even the main issue.

87
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:23,483
Did he or did he not cheat?

88
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:25,775
He said he didn’t.

89
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:28,775
He said he’ll explain when I’m ready.

90
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:30,117
There you go.

91
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:31,195
That’s going to be between the both of you.

92
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,554
Let’s not butt in, girls.

93
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,179
Right! Besides,

94
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:37,625
let’s stop talking about all this love drama.

95
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,116
We should let Luna contemplate on how she feels for now.

96
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,359
Besides, we’re here in Boracay to enjoy.

97
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,470
Should we just have gone to Pobla, or BGC,

98
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:46,914
or even Sam’s condo?

99
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:49,372
Let’s all bless Boracay with our presence.

100
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:52,945
Move over, the goddesses are here!

101
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,789
See? I'm right!

102
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:12,884
Hello, Kalix.

103
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,958
Hey! I just arrived here in Malaysia.

104
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,651
Enjoy your stay in Boracay.

105
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,817
Will do.

106
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,150
You better take care there

107
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:23,817
and good luck with your meeting.

108
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:27,852
Thank you. I’m a little bit nervous to meet the client, but—

109
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:31,746
He’s a big-time Filipino businessman here in Malaysia.

110
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:33,664
Why are you even nervous?

111
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,867
Remember, you’re a bar topnotcher.

112
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:36,921
Thank you.

113
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:41,067
Luna,

114
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:43,832
about our conversation last week,

115
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:46,150
I’m not rushing you to give me an answer.

116
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:47,608
I know.

117
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,531
I guess it’s good that...

118
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:54,795
we’re on separate trips so that we can think clearly.

119
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,733
Well, I don’t need extra time to think about it.

120
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,942
I’m already sure about you.

121
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,687
And again, I’m not pressuring you to give me an answer right away.

122
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:07,442
I’m willing to wait for it,

123
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,525
and work hard for it, okay?

124
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:13,171
Okay.

125
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,532
And please, enjoy your stay in Boracay.

126
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,483
You deserve it.

127
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,502
All right, go ahead and prepare now.

128
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:21,861
Take care, bye.

129
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:22,921
Bye.

130
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,358
Hey, wait for me!

131
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:30,092
Are you done flirting?

132
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:30,993
Yes, let me join.

133
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,519
I’ll throw your phone away.

134
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,845
Wait for me, hey.

135
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,460
All right!

136
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:36,528
Okay.

137
00:07:36,553 --> 00:07:39,014
One, two, three… Pose!

138
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:42,067
Let’s do a wacky shot!

139
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,250
One, two, three, taste test!

140
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:46,218
Taste test!

141
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:54,108
One more, pose!

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,432
Sorry, Joe, we’re taken.

143
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:05,417
Oh, except these two.

144
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:09,551
These two, they’re single, very single. Yes!

145
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:12,142
- Oh, that’s all right, ladies. Next time. - Let's go.

146
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:14,432
Wow, you really ignored them, Luna?

147
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:16,432
You’re really just focused on one guy, huh?

148
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:18,434
Well, that’s because she’s not single.

149
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:21,771
She’s just in a very complicated relationship.

150
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:23,022
- Oh, I forgot! - Right?

151
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,108
All right then, for her future taste test!

152
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:28,486
- Let’s go! - For her future taste test!

153
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,243
Hey!

154
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:57,519
Luna!

155
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:00,101
You’ve been on your phone this whole time. Come, swim with us.

156
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,269
You’re such a flirt!

157
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:05,017
You’re such a KJ… As in, Kalix Jace!

158
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:07,441
Hey, don’t tease Luna!

159
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,587
She just might fall for him again!

160
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:13,006
Come on guys, stop it.

161
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:15,783
She might get back together with him right now!

162
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:20,963
Hey, you're adding fuel to fire!

163
00:09:20,988 --> 00:09:23,574
I’m not affected by any of your teasing.

164
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:37,817
Jeez, he keeps updating and sending me reminders.

165
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:40,008
I know what you’re trying to do here, Kalix.

166
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:42,368
But sure, I’ll entertain you.

167
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:52,275
Luna: They’re still swimming. We’ll eat later.

168
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:11,547
Luna: Hey, don’t bother!

169
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,400
Luna: Fine, I'll send it later. When's your meeting?

170
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:52,987
Luna: It's just you two?

171
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:08,193
Wow, he’s even reassuring you now.

172
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:10,130
Hey! How long have you guys been standing there?

173
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:14,127
I’m impressed that he remembered to greet us, too.

174
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:16,192
And, he’s also getting us food.

175
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,318
Right!

176
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,650
He’s really wooing you.

177
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:21,619
Don’t make it easy for him.

178
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:24,480
Let’s test how much he really likes you.

179
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:25,632
I agree.

180
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,369
I know he already knows what he lost after you broke up.

181
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:29,952
But, let’s show him more.

182
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:32,317
Let’s show him what he missed out on.

183
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:34,339
How?

184
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:36,400
Leave it to me.

185
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,259
Like this?

186
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:42,697
It’s not working for me, girl. Sam, teach her some poses.

187
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:45,808
Just stick your butt out, pull your stomach in, and chest out.

188
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:46,865
Just like that!

189
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,892
Take off your sunglasses, then—

190
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:49,896
Like this?

191
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,356
Yes, hold still!

192
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:52,890
Three, two, one!

193
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:53,816
There you go.
Okay, okay, love it.

194
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:57,099
Wait a minute, your hair. There you go, all good.

195
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,275
Throw your hands in the air!

196
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,058
Wow, what caption should we put?

197
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,466
Maybe, “ride the boat with me.”

198
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:14,576
What? “Wanna ride a boat with me?”

199
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,895
Type in, “wanna ride with me?” then use the emoji—

200
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,691
That’s how you do it!

201
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:19,759
Hurry!

202
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:20,993
All right!

203
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:26,599
There you go.

204
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:30,770
- He’s really quick! - Oh my god!

205
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,840
You’re really taking Kalix’s breath away with all your posts. My god!

206
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:38,809
Wait a sec, he has a post, too.

207
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:45,660
Apparently, it’s Luna who had her breath taken away.

208
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:50,390
We still need to push this to the next level.

209
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:53,334
Now, let’s do a sexier pose.

210
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:55,586
She’s right, let’s move past the college level poses

211
00:12:55,611 --> 00:12:57,637
to an attorney level pose.

212
00:12:57,672 --> 00:12:59,924
Huh? What are you talking about?

213
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,346
What do you mean by “attorney level” pose?

214
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:08,210
Attorney level is when Kalix would have to sue you for being too sexy, Luna!

215
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:11,119
Here are the flowers. Put some…

216
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:12,353
There you go.

217
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:14,667
So, it's like your naked, you know!

218
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:16,791
Put your hands here.

219
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:18,484
Perfect!

220
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:20,153
- Feel sexy… - Don’t move! Hold that pose!

221
00:13:20,153 --> 00:13:21,863
Hold on, the flower’s missing…

222
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,503
Is this okay?

223
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:29,579
Perfect! Look at this, hurry!

224
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:34,083
- Hurry up and post it… - Perfect!

225
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:41,841
Kalix replied.

226
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:42,884
What did he say?

227
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:44,010
Really?

228
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:46,095
Saw your pictures.

229
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:51,517
And so? What do you think?

230
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,011
The bathtub looks familiar.

231
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:03,738
And he said that I look beautiful, too.

232
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:06,782
Perfect!

233
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:10,145
See how effective the attorney level photos are?

234
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,525
Let’s post more.

235
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:13,888
Why didn’t you post this?

236
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:15,220
I don’t want to.

237
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:18,540
This is the thirst trap photo. You have to post it.

238
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:20,326
I don’t want to, Yanna, no.

239
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:21,519
Suit yourself…

240
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:23,233
Yanna, stop.

241
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:24,692
Hey, what are you doing?

242
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:27,574
You guys should quit teasing each other through your posts.

243
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,775
It’s so obvious how much you still like each other.

244
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:33,045
What? Did you post it?

245
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,025
No.

246
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,544
You sent it to him, as a direct message!

247
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:38,873
Damn you, Yanna!

248
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:41,722
All right, just relax, okay? Don’t panic.

249
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:44,445
Let’s wait for Kalix’s reply first and then panic after.

250
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:45,530
What?

251
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,531
Sorry!

252
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,636
I just wanted you to make progress.

253
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:54,430
It’s Kalix! Kalix replied! I’m so nervous.

254
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:55,498
I’m so nervous.

255
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:56,666
Open it so you’ll know.

256
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,085
- Just hurry up and open it! - Come on, hurry.

257
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:00,753
You’re so slow.

258
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:07,093
I’m in a meeting. Call you later.

259
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:09,679
- That’s it? - Thirst trap…

260
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:10,830
That’s it.

261
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:13,474
That’s it?

262
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:07,824
Why do you wanna be a lawyer?

263
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:11,332
Do you want to be a corporate lawyer or a criminal lawyer?

264
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:12,387
Criminal lawyer.

265
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:13,705
Why do you wanna be a criminal lawyer?

266
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,225
So I can get you out of jail.

267
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,587
Don’t be silly!

268
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:20,316
Future lawyer. I see.

269
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,435
What are your plans after law school?

270
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,652
I’m planning to work as a defense attorney in a law firm.

271
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:28,096
I’m planning to open my law firm, too.

272
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:31,317
There’s constant high pressure and expectations. It’s like,

273
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,983
I can’t even make a single mistake.

274
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,442
You know what, Kalix.

275
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:38,150
You’re doing well.

276
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,926
Luna?

277
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:46,192
They’re going up now.

278
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,733
Okay, keep stalking.

279
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:50,064
I am not!

280
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:53,942
Jeez, you liar.

281
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:56,150
What is it? Tell me.

282
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:58,692
Nothing.

283
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:01,817
They look so happy.

284
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:03,817
For the record, I’m not jealous.

285
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:05,733
I’m happy for them.

286
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:10,567
I witnessed the time when being a lawyer was just a dream to them.

287
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,817
Now, they’re living the dream.

288
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:20,351
But we also achieved our dreams, right?

289
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:23,025
Yes, we did.

290
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,586
I’m just sad that

291
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:32,317
I wasn’t in Kalix’s life back then to witness him reach those milestones.

292
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:35,983
I’m actually questioning myself…

293
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:37,983
What if,

294
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,525
what if we were still together then?

295
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,438
What if,

296
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,817
I didn’t give up on him?

297
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,442
What if,

298
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:55,233
I had the courage to talk before

299
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,290
I decided to break up with him?

300
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:01,942
It’s useless, though.

301
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:04,733
I wasn’t there

302
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,900
because I chose to leave.

303
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:10,567
What if you stop dwelling on the what if’s?

304
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:16,442
There’s no point in dwelling on Kalix’s past memories.

305
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:18,442
It’s over and done with.

306
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:21,358
Just focus on the things that you can do now, at the present.

307
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:25,067
Besides, if you and Kalix get back together,

308
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:29,275
you both can create new memories with each other, right?

309
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,288
And witness more milestones in life.

310
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:34,704
This time,

311
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,983
you both would have each other.

312
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:42,983
Answer his call.

313
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:45,900
He might want to start making new memories with you.

314
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,025
I’ll go ahead and check on our reservation.

315
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,335
Hi, Kalix!

316
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,798
Luna, what’s up?

317
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:57,775
Sorry to call you so late, by the way.

318
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:59,979
My meeting just finished.

319
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,839
Don’t worry about it.

320
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:02,928
How was the meeting?

321
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:04,330
It was just initial counseling

322
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,733
but it looks promising.

323
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:07,567
I think he’ll hire us.

324
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,590
Oh, wow! Congratulations!

325
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,016
See how easily you got it? And to think that you were so nervous earlier.

326
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,025
Why did you call?

327
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:20,817
I don’t wanna lie.

328
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,192
I just miss you.

329
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,983
Your voice,

330
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:26,692
Your face,

331
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:31,356
How could you miss me after seeing so many of my posts?

332
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:35,189
By the way, the photo you got, it was Yanna who sent it, not me.

333
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:36,900
Doesn’t make any difference.

334
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:40,108
You look great, as always.

335
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,400
You just reminded me of our time in Boracay.

336
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:47,118
Don’t be silly.

337
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:52,372
Are you currently busy?

338
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:54,150
No, my meeting’s done.

339
00:19:57,216 --> 00:20:00,275
What we talked about last week…

340
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,469
I think I’m ready to—

341
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,291
Luna, sorry to cut you off but...

342
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:08,442
there’s someone at the door.

343
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,917
I’ll be back because my phone is charging, okay?

344
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:11,943
Give me a second.

345
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:13,009
Okay.

346
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:16,774
Kalix…

347
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,400
Hey! What’s up?

348
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,635
You know my room, right?

349
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,423
Yes.

350
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:22,758
You should stop by.

351
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:24,535
Let’s have some fun.

352
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:25,369
Okay!

353
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:27,033
Okay, I’ll just take a shower first.

354
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,650
- All right! - Bye!

355
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:35,678
Do you

356
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:41,275
still think about our first night together?

357
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:49,673
Luna, please, wait!

358
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:52,371
You cheater!

359
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:54,358
Please let me explain!

360
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:07,692
Hey, why do you look upset? What happened?

361
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:10,215
Huh?

362
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:16,608
Why aren’t you answering his call? What did you two talk about?

363
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:39,525
I don’t know anymore.

364
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:43,145
I’m just so confused.

365
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:48,733
Kalix is alone right now with that woman.

366
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,817
What did she mean by having fun?

367
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:56,608
You all know about—

368
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:59,275
about how

369
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:03,275
my mind works after getting cheated on.

370
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:08,733
I know that we’re not even together right now.

371
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:11,159
I know that.

372
00:22:14,562 --> 00:22:19,483
But I still felt that pain like it was only yesterday.

373
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:23,150
It really hurts.

374
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:28,172
Luna,

375
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:31,775
it’s okay to have these feelings.

376
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:34,442
We understand what you’re going through.

377
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:38,150
Remember Luna, this is not your fault.

378
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:39,548
Luna,

379
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:42,189
you and Kalix are my friends.

380
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:44,608
So I want the best for both of you.

381
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,077
We’re still not one hundred percent sure if Kalix is fooling you.

382
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:50,317
But whether or not he is,

383
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,483
he’ll always trigger your trauma.

384
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,120
As long as you two haven’t resolved your past issues,

385
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,650
Kalix will remind you of that wound.

386
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:00,858
What I’m trying to say is,

387
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,460
you and Kalix should have a serious talk.

388
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:05,329
Not just about what happened tonight,

389
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:08,275
but way back to what, what happened ten years ago.

390
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:10,483
To have closure.

391
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:12,488
To tie loose ends.

392
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:14,194
After that,

393
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:16,983
you’ll know if you should stay in each other’s lives.

394
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,813
She’s right.

395
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:21,986
It’s best if you two get to talk it out.

396
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:24,233
So you and Kalix should really find time to talk.

397
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:27,968
I don’t think I can handle talking about the past.

398
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,314
I know Luna.

399
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:31,775
I’m sorry you’re going through this but,

400
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:35,275
all this he said she said, has to end.

401
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:37,817
For your peace of mind, too.

402
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:40,765
It’s okay.

403
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:43,317
Oh, Luna…

404
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:47,033
We’re here for you.

405
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,483
Come on, let’s just eat.

406
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:55,567
Let’s eat!

407
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:01,728
Don't cry anymore.

408
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:02,753
Let’s all eat now!

409
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:03,545
- Want some squid? - Smile now.
No.

410
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,422
- Pizza. - Right.

411
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:06,757
- She wants pizza. Want some pizza? - Okay.

412
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:08,008
- Come on. - She’ll have a bite.

413
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:09,093
Take a bite now…

414
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:10,302
Ke…

415
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:12,721
- She’ll have some pizza. - Come on.

416
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:13,931
Come on, Luna.

417
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:16,308
Take a bite…

418
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,820
Luna: Kalix, let's talk.

419
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:11,171
- Luna. - Kalix?

420
00:25:11,196 --> 00:25:13,267
I booked the earliest flight to get here.

421
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,375
I can’t let this wait any longer.

422
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:18,483
There’s something important I have to tell you.

423
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,898
Kalix, it’s really late now.

424
00:25:20,923 --> 00:25:21,924
Let’s talk tomorrow.

425
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:25,483
If ten years ago, I just walked away without fighting,

426
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,692
this time I won’t commit the same mistake again.

427
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,650
Luna, please.

428
00:25:35,397 --> 00:25:38,317
Just ten minutes of your time. I’m begging you.

429
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:54,833
What?

430
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:56,717
What do you have to say, Kalix?

431
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:58,733
Tell me now so we can both get it over with.

432
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:00,442
Luna, listen.

433
00:26:01,388 --> 00:26:03,567
I know you heard what Lorraine said,

434
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:05,483
but it’s nothing.

435
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:08,525
Please, trust me.

436
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:11,106
We were just going to open a bottle of champagne.

437
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:13,233
We were with all of our partners.

438
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:16,692
That’s all.

439
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:21,025
I’m really serious about fixing things with you, Luna.

440
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:26,623
I know I should’ve told you this a long time ago.

441
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:29,317
And I’m so sorry it took so long.

442
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,483
I just honestly didn’t see no use.

443
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:39,108
I tried explaining it to you so many times

444
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:42,983
but it just came to a point that I got so tired of everything.

445
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:46,817
But not you.

446
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:52,150
It just—

447
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:55,733
There was so much happening in my life back then.

448
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:04,608
But I never cheated on you, Luna.

449
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,108
Bullshit, Kalix.

450
00:27:07,382 --> 00:27:10,775
So many years have passed and you’re still gonna lie to me?

451
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,483
You’re still gonna keep fooling me?

452
00:27:14,653 --> 00:27:16,345
I’m telling you the truth.

453
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,228
Then, what was that before?

454
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:20,187
What was that video?

455
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,192
Why did you kiss Amy?

456
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,460
I did not kiss her.

457
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:32,796
Amy!

458
00:27:34,183 --> 00:27:36,227
All right, truth or dare?

459
00:27:36,252 --> 00:27:41,275
- Truth! - Dare!

460
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:43,673
- Dare! - She said dare, guys.

461
00:27:43,974 --> 00:27:47,144
So, I dare you to kiss someone you like in this room.

462
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:49,727
Hold on, hold up.

463
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:51,581
Unfortunately, Kalix has to go.

464
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:53,322
Yes, sorry guys. Gotta go.

465
00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:55,140
Still have a date in Tagaytay.

466
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,454
Oh shit! Oh shit!

467
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:59,162
What is wrong with you?

468
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:01,575
- Kalix… - Don’t touch me.

469
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:02,326
That's enough.

470
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:04,745
No, I've had enough of you, Amethyst.

471
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:06,732
What is your problem?

472
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:10,242
I’m sorry, they just told me to kiss the man that I like.

473
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:12,067
Know your boundaries.

474
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:13,766
I have a girlfriend.

475
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:16,173
Which part of that do you not understand?

476
00:28:16,198 --> 00:28:18,575
Come on, you want to be a lawyer, right?

477
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:21,903
I’m sorry, I just didn’t think you’d be this upset.

478
00:28:21,928 --> 00:28:23,591
- Bro, that’s enough. - Are you an idiot?

479
00:28:23,616 --> 00:28:25,557
Don’t you dare cry.

480
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:27,890
I asked you a simple goddamn question.

481
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,126
Have you lost your mind?

482
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:31,903
You are goddamn stupid!

483
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:33,044
Kalix, I’m sorry.

484
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:34,583
Remember this,

485
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:37,983
I don’t like you and I will never like you.

486
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:39,805
So from now on,

487
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,858
stay away from me, okay?

488
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:50,150
Happy Valentine’s!

489
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,607
What’s wrong?

490
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:57,482
Nothing.

491
00:28:57,943 --> 00:28:59,732
Let’s sit.

492
00:28:59,757 --> 00:29:02,232
Okay. Did you drink alcohol?

493
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:05,473
Who were you with? Where were you?

494
00:29:08,035 --> 00:29:09,453
Just a little.

495
00:29:09,478 --> 00:29:10,858
We had a free cut.

496
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:14,650
Were you with Adonis and Amethyst?

497
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:17,909
Yes.

498
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:18,983
Okay.

499
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,468
I love you.

500
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:28,995
I love you too, Luna.

501
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:31,608
Always remember that.

502
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,108
I will.

503
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,122
I know.

504
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:40,483
I should have told you immediately.

505
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:44,068
My mistake is that I tried to settle everything on my own.

506
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:46,650
Luna, it was my friendship.

507
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:50,442
So I thought it was my problem.

508
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,650
I was on the right side and I just didn’t have enough courage to tell you.

509
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:00,942
We were in a relationship together

510
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:04,233
and I realized that I should have told you everything.

511
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,525
About that situation,

512
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:10,025
about my decisions.

513
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:16,692
I’m just really sorry if I failed to be completely honest with you.

514
00:30:18,724 --> 00:30:20,464
You know I love you.

515
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,331
I would’ve understood no matter what you tell me.

516
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:31,775
Mixed signals, jealousy,

517
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:37,025
I even managed to brush off the insults your mother gave me.

518
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:41,036
But when I saw that video Amy sent…

519
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:45,442
I just felt so much pain, Kalix.

520
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:50,572
It made me feel so insecure.

521
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:52,733
I felt pathetic.

522
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,608
I even questioned my worth every night.

523
00:30:57,537 --> 00:30:59,858
I gave you everything, didn’t I?

524
00:31:01,105 --> 00:31:02,483
Everything.

525
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:07,900
But you still made me feel like

526
00:31:08,057 --> 00:31:10,427
I’m a person that’s not worth loving.

527
00:31:10,472 --> 00:31:13,232
But it’s not like that, Luna.

528
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:16,051
Then, how come I felt that way, Kalix?

529
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:17,983
You couldn’t let me in.

530
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:21,233
I tried.

531
00:31:23,352 --> 00:31:25,733
I really did try, Luna.

532
00:31:26,826 --> 00:31:30,900
I was always waiting for a moment for you to be ready to listen to me.

533
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:37,442
And maybe I didn’t realize that I was dragging it for too long.

534
00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:49,858
You were also not yourself at that time.

535
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:56,814
And so, I just realized that you couldn’t listen to me yet.

536
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:02,358
I couldn’t talk to you

537
00:32:04,773 --> 00:32:06,733
nor listen to you

538
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:10,525
because of everything that was happening then.

539
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:16,608
I was so lost at that time, Kalix.

540
00:32:25,374 --> 00:32:29,150
I wasn’t asking you to forgive me, Luna.

541
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:35,650
I chased you because I really needed you at that time.

542
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:41,442
So many painful things happened to me years ago.

543
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,942
Things that I kept all to myself.

544
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:50,150
I was lost, too, Luna.

545
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:52,608
I’m sorry.

546
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:57,442
I felt so tired, too, Luna.

547
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:01,317
But not with you.

548
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:06,303
I wanted to give up on everything,

549
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,525
except you.

550
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:15,847
I needed you so badly.

551
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:21,491
Kio had some lung complication.

552
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:25,108
It was for his health why I stopped smoking.

553
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:27,083
Kio, eat your meal first

554
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,083
so we can get your favorite cake.

555
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:32,428
Okay, Kuya. But I need to pee first.

556
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:33,817
Okay, go.

557
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:37,077
Hey!

558
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:39,454
Kio!

559
00:33:39,804 --> 00:33:42,182
- We thought he was cured - Kio!

560
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:44,733
from his complications after he underwent several treatments.

561
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,775
Suddenly his lung disease came back.

562
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:50,482
Kio!

563
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:51,475
The doctors found out

564
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,275
that Kio’s lung complication became more serious.

565
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:56,403
Doc…

566
00:33:56,428 --> 00:33:57,804
Doc, what are the findings?

567
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,122
Doc Martinez,

568
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:02,747
we found a small lung nodule in your son’s right lung.

569
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,982
But we need to conduct more tests

570
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:08,226
and we are hoping that it’s benign.

571
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,710
There was a possibility that the lung nodule

572
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:13,692
they found inside Kio’s lung was cancerous.

573
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:17,833
I wanted to tell you

574
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:20,775
but I felt like it would add to your worries.

575
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:25,709
You had your own problems and I didn’t want to add up to it.

576
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:28,404
Hello?

577
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,900
Kalix, where are you?

578
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,983
Are you okay?

579
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:35,961
I feel so stressed in school.

580
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:37,122
I'm burnt out.

581
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:39,739
There's so many requirements and exams.

582
00:34:39,764 --> 00:34:41,779
They're all on the same deadline.

583
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:45,224
I don't know how to finish them all.

584
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:47,483
You can do it, Luna.

585
00:34:48,848 --> 00:34:50,483
One task at a time.

586
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:54,583
Just take as much breaks as you need.

587
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:58,358
Don’t stretch yourself too thin, okay?

588
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:02,317
I love you.

589
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:04,525
I love you too.

590
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:07,630
Bye.

591
00:35:15,787 --> 00:35:18,123
I didn’t want you to worry about me,

592
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,992
so I didn’t tell you about my problems.

593
00:35:21,264 --> 00:35:23,911
I tried to wait for the right moment

594
00:35:23,936 --> 00:35:26,793
but things took a turn for the worst soon after.

595
00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:29,025
There was no turning back.

596
00:35:29,324 --> 00:35:32,775
After they found out that the lung nodule was benign,

597
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:35,775
we thought Kio was going to be okay.

598
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:38,631
But days later he got admitted again

599
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:40,858
because of other complications.

600
00:35:42,202 --> 00:35:44,025
Kio is critical.

601
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:46,767
They will try to operate on him tomorrow

602
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:50,275
but he continues to be unresponsive to the meds.

603
00:35:51,523 --> 00:35:53,775
Those days were the hardest.

604
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:56,505
I needed someone to talk to.

605
00:35:56,608 --> 00:36:00,653
I wanted to tell you everything but another problem came up.

606
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:02,388
Bro, where are you?

607
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:04,265
We have finals today!

608
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:05,308
I can make up for it.

609
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:07,727
Bro, you've skipped so many times.

610
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:09,479
You'll fail if you'll be like that.

611
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:11,464
Luna needs me right now.

612
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:17,005
Despite the weight of my own problems,

613
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,115
Luna…

614
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,458
I had to set them aside.

615
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,635
I just knew instinctively

616
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,578
that I needed to be there for you.

617
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,317
I’m here.

618
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:29,974
I had been keeping everything to myself.

619
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:31,668
Keeping it all together

620
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:35,246
until you found the video of Amy kissing me.

621
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:37,130
You cheater!

622
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,724
Please let me explain!

623
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,346
It was too late to explain everything

624
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:44,958
and you refused to give me a chance to explain myself.

625
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:46,775
It’s my fault,

626
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:48,900
and I admit that.

627
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,983
I was so down.

628
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,801
I started to lose focus.

629
00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:55,411
My grades took a major blow.

630
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:56,562
You need to reconsider my grades.

631
00:36:56,587 --> 00:36:59,965
I can do additional academic work. I will do everything.

632
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:01,743
The thing is Mr. Martinez,

633
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:04,187
I have already looked into your grades

634
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:07,233
and there is simply nothing we can do about it right now.

635
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:09,468
Even with your midterm grades,

636
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,279
it is not enough to pull up your final grades.

637
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:13,847
It is just too low.

638
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:14,983
But sir…

639
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:17,900
There must be something I can do.

640
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:22,501
You will just have to retake these subjects again next semester.

641
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:24,320
Sorry, Mr. Martinez.

642
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:26,650
You cannot proceed to fourth year.

643
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:28,348
Excuse me.

644
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,583
But sir—

645
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:31,287
Sir?

646
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:33,567
Sir?

647
00:37:33,938 --> 00:37:36,524
I failed two subjects that semester.

648
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:38,343
I couldn’t believe it.

649
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:41,388
You are such a disappointment, Kalix.

650
00:37:41,413 --> 00:37:43,123
I’m so sorry, Mom.

651
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:44,525
Sorry?

652
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:47,424
Kalix, I have enough problems as it is.

653
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:51,400
Why do you have to add up to it, huh?

654
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:53,567
I’ll make up for it, Mom.

655
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:56,804
I want to proceed with Law school.

656
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:58,650
Oh, okay.

657
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:01,185
You want to proceed to Law school?

658
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,108
Well then, pay for it yourself!

659
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,942
At my lowest,

660
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:09,233
all I needed was you.

661
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:12,612
But you needed time and space.

662
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:15,978
So I waited for you to be ready to talk to me.

663
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:17,916
But it didn't happen,

664
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:21,402
and what's worse, you told me you didn't love me anymore.

665
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:24,419
During the times I was so crushed with what you did to me,

666
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:27,155
Sevi has always been by my side.

667
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,051
Luna, I–

668
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:30,951
You think I’d still be hung up on you?

669
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,942
That I’d stay loyal to you?

670
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:35,483
After what you did?

671
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:38,650
I don’t love you anymore, Kalix.

672
00:38:38,823 --> 00:38:42,233
Kalix, we’re done. I don’t think I can trust you again.

673
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:45,025
So please,

674
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,353
just go.

675
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:51,202
I didn’t believe you.

676
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,232
I could see it in your eyes that you still loved me.

677
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:58,601
I love you

678
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:01,747
so damn much.

679
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:05,483
I could never cheat on you.

680
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:10,076
But it was so obvious that you wanted me out of your life.

681
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:17,608
I almost lost everything.

682
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:20,770
I almost lost my dream of becoming a lawyer.

683
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,552
I almost lost my brother.

684
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,025
And I lost you.

685
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:29,548
I really wanted to give up, Luna.

686
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:34,068
I didn’t know what I was living for anymore.

687
00:39:38,438 --> 00:39:42,108
I am so tired.

688
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:54,370
I want everything to end.

689
00:40:10,837 --> 00:40:12,422
Kuya?

690
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,983
Where am I?

691
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:16,317
Kio!

692
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:19,857
You’re at the hospital, okay?

693
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:21,606
Everything’s gonna be all right.

694
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:23,041
It’s fine. Okay?

695
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:25,192
- Okay, Kuya. - Okay.

696
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,692
My brother needed me.

697
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,882
And that was the reason I had to keep going.

698
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:44,045
I wanted to tell you, Luna.

699
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,406
I really tried.

700
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:52,402
I just didn’t wanna add to whatever you were carrying at that time.

701
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,358
I’m sorry.

702
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:02,086
I’m sorry you went through all of that by yourself.

703
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,480
I should’ve just listened to you.

704
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:10,909
But I let my anger

705
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:14,521
and my doubts get the best of me. I’m sorry.

706
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:17,249
I’m sorry.

707
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:20,456
Luna…

708
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:22,427
Hey.

709
00:41:25,184 --> 00:41:27,186
It’s nobody’s fault.

710
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:31,730
There was too much on both of our plates.

711
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:37,282
I was too cowardly and weak to fight for us.

712
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:42,997
And because of that one mistake,

713
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:46,039
I lost you.

714
00:41:48,198 --> 00:41:51,701
I may have overcome my problems now,

715
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:55,900
and became the lawyer I always dreamt of…

716
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:03,900
but there will always be a void inside of me, Luna.

717
00:42:04,842 --> 00:42:06,817
Because I lost you.

718
00:42:14,302 --> 00:42:16,983
Almost ten years have passed.

719
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:22,513
Too much time has been stolen and taken from us.

720
00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:30,985
I don’t want to live another ten seconds without having you back in my life.

721
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,567
So,

722
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,823
if you give me another chance...

723
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:42,453
I promise

724
00:42:44,168 --> 00:42:46,692
I will never let go of you ever,

725
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:49,358
ever again.

726
00:44:13,629 --> 00:44:15,529
We have a yacht party.

727
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:16,972
I’ll be there.

728
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:20,458
See you!

729
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,477
See you!

730
00:44:26,146 --> 00:44:27,814
Hey, this view is amazing!

731
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,654
Come here, hurry.

732
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:30,972
You wanna dance?

733
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:33,374
- Let’s go! - I don’t know how to dance.

734
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:34,817
Come on!

735
00:44:37,653 --> 00:44:39,071
Are you cold?

736
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:41,068
A bit.

737
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:43,884
I have a jacket in my bedroom.

738
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:45,619
I’ll go with you.

739
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:02,345
Good morning.

740
00:45:02,653 --> 00:45:03,667
Luna.

741
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:04,583
Yes?

742
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:06,858
What are your thoughts about marrying me?
