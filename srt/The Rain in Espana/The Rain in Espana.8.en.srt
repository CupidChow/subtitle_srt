1
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:14,431
Sorry!

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,814
- Sorry, sorry. - No, it's okay.

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,008
Those are very important client files.

4
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:21,205
I’ll do anything to make it up to you. I’m really sorry.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,523
Anything?

6
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:24,545
Yes, anything.

7
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:26,343
Do my house in Tagaytay.

8
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,257
Attorney!

9
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:30,175
Here’s a package for you.

10
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:32,595
It’s from Valeria Construction.

11
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:34,680
Return those to Architect Luna Valeria.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,929
I would rather have you repay me

13
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:38,267
through your professional service, Architect Valeria.

14
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:39,435
Sevi,

15
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:41,007
will you be my engineer for

16
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:44,228
- Kalix’s house project in Tagaytay? - You’ll accept the project?

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,480
Luna?

18
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,087
You’re Luna, right?

19
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:49,613
- Yes. - I’m Kio,

20
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,599
Kio Martinez.

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,781
Kio?

22
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:54,825
- Yes. - Kio!

23
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:56,285
Mom’s looking for you.

24
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:58,009
Isn’t Luna still very pretty?

25
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:00,664
You got the telescope back?

26
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:02,458
The moon looks so beautiful.

27
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,775
Yes, beautiful.

28
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,682
Luna.

29
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:42,808
What?

30
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:44,268
Are you hitting on me?

31
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,526
If yes…

32
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:50,232
so what?

33
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:56,159
I mean,

34
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:58,579
we’re both single.

35
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,919
You still haven’t changed, Attorney.

36
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:10,615
You’re still a flirt.

37
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:13,302
What do you really want?

38
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:14,590
Huh?

39
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,013
I’m just looking out for you.

40
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:19,553
Jeez!

41
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:22,681
I know what you’re doing.

42
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:26,477
If you’re not being serious, don’t—

43
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:29,605
I have never cheated on you, Luna.

44
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:30,986
Never.

45
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:38,903
You’re good.

46
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:40,935
You’re actually a good actor.

47
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,801
So good.

48
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:45,370
This is why a lot of people believe in you.

49
00:03:46,163 --> 00:03:47,706
Because you know how to act.

50
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:49,374
I’m telling the truth.

51
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:50,474
Truth?

52
00:03:51,752 --> 00:03:53,162
Are you serious?

53
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:55,672
So, what did I see then?

54
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:58,240
Was I just seeing things?

55
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,184
Just my imagination?

56
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,593
You know, Kalix,

57
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:04,428
I was stupid then.

58
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:06,990
But I wasn’t crazy.

59
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,212
You’re drunk

60
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:12,156
and we should just talk about this when you’re sober.

61
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,919
I’m drunk?

62
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,230
I’m not drunk

63
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,529
and we have nothing to talk about.

64
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,740
Okay?

65
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,033
Luna, where are you going?

66
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,326
Mind your own business.

67
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:25,529
Luna!

68
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:28,038
Luna, are you okay?

69
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,644
Hey…

70
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,340
I don’t ask help from cheaters like you.

71
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:36,281
Luna, you shouldn’t drive. You’re drunk.

72
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,808
And you shouldn’t have followed me.

73
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:42,185
Listen, it’s best if someone sober can take you home.

74
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:44,146
What if something happens—

75
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,975
Okay? Stop.

76
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:50,310
Stop acting like you care.

77
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,562
But I do care.

78
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:52,833
Don’t.

79
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,523
Okay? Don’t. I can–

80
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:56,525
I can take care of myself.

81
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:57,776
Take care of yourself?

82
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:58,902
You can’t even walk straight

83
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:00,612
and you think you can drive a car?

84
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,155
Why do you care?

85
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,795
Luna, where are your friends?

86
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,455
There has to be someone sober that can drive you–

87
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:12,040
Bastard! Okay?

88
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,001
- Luna, I’m justtrying to help you. - Fuck you.

89
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,513
Why did you even come back to my life?

90
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:22,240
Do you just want to apologize for all the fuck ups you did before?

91
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,864
Is that it?

92
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,138
Fine, let’s do this.

93
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,615
So you can finally relax,

94
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:30,267
here it goes.

95
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:33,979
I forgive you.

96
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:35,513
Okay?

97
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:36,873
Happy?

98
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:39,108
Now, go.

99
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,154
Go.

100
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:43,322
- Out of my way. Go. - Luna…

101
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:45,240
- What? - You shouldn’t drive.

102
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,325
Quit it–

103
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:47,826
Leave me alone!

104
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:52,414
Luna, listen please.

105
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:53,749
Please, please!

106
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,099
Go away.

107
00:05:57,586 --> 00:05:59,421
All right, slowly.

108
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:01,131
Slowly…

109
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:02,633
Hey!

110
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,356
Luna?

111
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:06,010
Luna?

112
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:08,580
Hey.

113
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:12,708
Are you okay?

114
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:29,409
Okay.

115
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:31,349
There, on the couch.

116
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:37,172
Watch out, careful.

117
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,468
All right.

118
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:43,006
How’re you feeling?

119
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:45,388
You okay?

120
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,409
Drink this.

121
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:09,858
Okay.

122
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:16,999
Thanks.

123
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:18,709
I’m okay.

124
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:23,009
I’m glad you’re not hurt.

125
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,661
Your car was towed already.

126
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:29,720
Huh?

127
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,115
Did I bump into—

128
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,267
Yes, don’t worry about it.

129
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:36,623
They’ll fix it ASAP.

130
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:41,523
Thanks for bringing me home.

131
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:43,763
No problem.

132
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,778
I’ll–

133
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:49,537
I’ll pay for your...

134
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:54,077
time and for your gas.

135
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:55,162
No need.

136
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:59,841
I’ll call my secretary and tell her to send you the payment.

137
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:01,904
Okay.

138
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:04,224
About...

139
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:06,732
what we were talking about—

140
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:09,115
Forget about it. Not now.

141
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,851
You need to rest.

142
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:13,349
We can talk about it some other time.

143
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:15,287
Okay.

144
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:28,021
Are you sure you’re gonna be okay by yourself?

145
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:31,448
Yes.

146
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:33,158
Should I text Kierra?

147
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:35,724
No, no, I can handle myself.

148
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:41,779
Okay.

149
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:45,513
The key is by the door, okay?

150
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,062
Why did you get yourself so drunk last night?

151
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:04,606
Now you’re regretting everything you said to Kalix.

152
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:05,649
Take note,

153
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,818
she’s regretting what she remembered she said.

154
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:11,404
What about what she said that she can’t even recall?

155
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,240
Stop reminding me, please.

156
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,200
This reminds me of our time in college.

157
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,079
Didn’t Kalix also bring you home when you were drunk then?

158
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,707
This might just be the start of your love story again.

159
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:24,501
#LuKal.

160
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:27,003
It’s going to be #LuKa-Luka

161
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:30,340
if she’s crazy enough to fall for him again.

162
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:33,635
Honestly, why are you guys always missing when I’m drunk?

163
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,826
No, Luna, we were just there.

164
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:38,306
Yes, the club was jam-packed

165
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:40,529
and you just couldn’t find us.

166
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:44,146
And it’s always Kalix who finds you, right?

167
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:48,400
Is the universe working overtime to get you two together again?

168
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,193
¡Es un tramposo!

169
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:52,154
Isn’t Kalix a cheater?

170
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:54,906
You better be careful, Luna.

171
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:57,784
I can’t take it if I see you crying again.

172
00:09:58,243 --> 00:10:01,413
Or maybe we just also assumed that he cheated?

173
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:05,083
Yes and he’s not even together with Amethyst.

174
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,170
And he did not represent Miguel.

175
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,132
So, you’re saying they’re both single right now

176
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:13,925
and they’re even working together?

177
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:15,802
So what?

178
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:19,222
It’s just work. He’s my client,

179
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:21,099
I’m his architect. That’s all there is to it.

180
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:23,833
What if he tries to win you back?

181
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:29,274
So, are you going to give him another chance?

182
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:31,526
If he cheated, it’s a pass.

183
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:33,904
If not, go ahead.

184
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:38,950
Whatever your decision is, Luna, I’m all for it.

185
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,369
You know what’s best for you.

186
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:42,537
Question is,

187
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:44,581
do you still want him, Luna?

188
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,084
Oh, come on.

189
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:50,837
It’s too early for this kind of interrogation.

190
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:54,132
Let’s wait ‘til my hangover passes.

191
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,719
Mommy, let’s go!

192
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,554
Okay, Avi, let’s go.

193
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:01,181
I’ll go ahead, girls.

194
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:02,682
I need to bring her to school.

195
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:05,060
Luna, you know what you gotta do.

196
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,438
Flirt responsibly and… maturely.

197
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:11,120
No flirting is gonna happen, okay?

198
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:12,859
And hurry up,

199
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,736
your daughter will be late for school.

200
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:17,322
Besides, I gotta go, I don’t have a car today.

201
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:18,298
Bye!

202
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:20,867
- Bye! - Bye!

203
00:11:57,435 --> 00:11:59,061
Good morning, Architect.

204
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:03,025
I had your car fixed last night.

205
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:06,162
I felt bad because

206
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:09,754
I think I’m partly to be blamed why you crashed the car in the first place.

207
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:12,665
Thanks.

208
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:15,228
Thank you for having it fixed.

209
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,407
Sorry, you had to take a rental today.

210
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:21,662
It’s okay.

211
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:29,728
Wait!

212
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:16,564
- Attorney! - Yes?

213
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,070
Glad you’re here. I need your signature.

214
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,696
I can sign them now.

215
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:25,325
There’s your daughter? Architect!

216
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,202
Mrs. Chu! How are you?

217
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:28,495
Oh my gosh!

218
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:29,829
How are you?

219
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:31,206
How are you, my dear?

220
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:32,624
What brings you here?

221
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:36,127
No, I just brought a thank you gift for you.

222
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,715
I really love the design you did for our Clark house.

223
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:44,504
You listened to all my requests and made it great.

224
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,781
I’m really glad that you liked my designs.

225
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:49,516
And because she liked it,

226
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:52,394
she told me she wants to do another project with us.

227
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:55,939
Yes, yes, yes! It’s for my nephew.

228
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:58,775
He just came home from California

229
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:01,528
and he plans to settle here for good.

230
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:03,867
Since he’s having his own house done,

231
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:05,740
I recommended you because

232
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:13,265
I know that you’re the best architect for residential projects.

233
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,132
I’m so excited, Mrs. Chu. Thank you very much.

234
00:14:16,157 --> 00:14:17,710
You know, Architect,

235
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:20,256
my nephew is still single.

236
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:25,844
Nate, Lorice, sorry, sorry. I just have to say this because–

237
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:28,763
because, you’re so beautiful,

238
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,099
you’re even successful and—

239
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:35,493
and it’s baffling to me that you’re still single.

240
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:44,415
Well, I think guys are scared because I’m overqualified.

241
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,323
No, but kidding aside,

242
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:49,423
I’m not ready to settle down yet.

243
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:52,787
Actually, Mrs. Chu, there’s a lot of guys who want to go on a date with her.

244
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:56,142
But none of them have passed her standards. Right, Dad?

245
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,418
That’s so true.

246
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,139
Mom.

247
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:02,517
Better to be sure

248
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,017
than to settle with a jerk and a cheater.

249
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:10,859
That’s why I’m hoping that you’ll meet my nephew.

250
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:15,101
Not only as an architect but also personally.

251
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:17,729
He’s handsome and kind.

252
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:18,938
Wait, wait, wait.

253
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:22,915
Do you have any specific type?

254
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:26,720
Someone—

255
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:30,563
Someone loyal and honest.

256
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:34,570
Oh my god, this is perfect.

257
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:40,043
Oh wow! Great. I think I can vouch for my nephew.

258
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:42,545
And I think you guys would be perfect together.

259
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:45,548
He definitely fits your standards.

260
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:47,842
So, so what,

261
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:49,564
are you interested?

262
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:51,638
Who knows,

263
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,645
you might get along with each other.

264
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:57,227
I’m so excited.

265
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:02,125
Why didn’t you accept Mrs. Chu’s offer?

266
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,609
Her nephew might really be handsome

267
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:07,237
and he might even fit your standards.

268
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,821
I don’t need someone handsome, Ke.

269
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,740
What I want is someone loyal.

270
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,785
Besides, there’s nothing wrong with focusing on work.

271
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:15,431
That’s too bad.

272
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,968
It’s been so long since you fell in love.

273
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:20,400
You’re getting older but you choose to focus on working.

274
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:24,798
Age doesn’t matter when it comes to love.

275
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:28,798
Besides, I can do all things a guy can do for me.

276
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:32,304
If someone comes, I’ll welcome him in.

277
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:35,860
If there’s no one, then I’ll be fabulous on my own.

278
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:37,242
Architect?

279
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,688
Oh, someone did come.

280
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:43,009
Sorry, what’s that?

281
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,692
Attorney, come in.

282
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:46,943
Architect Valeria,

283
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:49,737
you might have a hangover and these may help.

284
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,910
Architect Ynares, please, have some too.

285
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,454
Attorney, thank you. This is so sweet of you.

286
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:01,958
Luna, aren’t blueberries your favorite?

287
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,336
This mango is my favorite since it’s so sweet.

288
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:08,470
Anyway, I’ll get going now. I’ll leave you two.

289
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,509
Thank you, Attorney.

290
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:14,376
You may sit.

291
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:19,684
Attorney,

292
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:23,555
you don't have to do this every time we have a meeting,

293
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:25,438
It’s not part of the contract.

294
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,727
I know.

295
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,188
I brought you these fruits ‘cause I want to.

296
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:37,660
Do you like the designs?

297
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:40,330
Why did you choose the royal blue tile?

298
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,657
Bachelor’s pad for your master’s bedroom.

299
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:45,418
Oh, it’s definitely not gonna be a bachelor’s pad.

300
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,757
Like I mentioned before,

301
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:48,501
this is gonna be a family home.

302
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:51,888
I’ll be sharing the master bedroom with my future wife.

303
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:01,522
If you don’t like royal blue, hold on.

304
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:07,653
Maybe you can choose some colors here.

305
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,322
So…

306
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:12,612
light copper would work

307
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:15,407
or green tree,

308
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:18,126
or green river.

309
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:21,735
What color do you prefer?

310
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:24,930
What color do you prefer?

311
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:30,346
I told you to design it the way you want it.

312
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:33,262
Not the way you think I want it.

313
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,935
All right then.

314
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:43,393
I’ll send you the revisions through email.

315
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:46,270
Thank you for the trust.

316
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,439
It really meant a lot.

317
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,274
This makes the job easier.

318
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:53,449
I’ll be waiting.

319
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,711
Please make sure that the delivered materials are correct.

320
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:07,291
And follow up with our suppliers.

321
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,127
We need to meet the deadline. Okay?

322
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,546
- Yes, Architect. - Okay, thanks.

323
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,319
Oh! Perfect timing.

324
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:17,765
Are you sure we’re not closing off the veranda?

325
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:21,472
I like it as it is.

326
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:23,980
This place is special to me.

327
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,326
The—

328
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:31,958
Do you have your pegs for the guest bedroom?

329
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,852
You can send them to me through email

330
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:36,627
so that I can discuss it with the interior designer.

331
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:38,948
Or, Architect,

332
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:40,408
we can always text.

333
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:42,025
It’s just faster that way.

334
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:44,596
I don’t have your number.

335
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,677
I did not change my number.

336
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,127
I deleted your number.

337
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:54,005
Oh.

338
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:55,381
Okay.

339
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:56,674
Give me your phone.

340
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:57,717
Huh?

341
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:00,619
Give me your phone, so we can exchange numbers.

342
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,312
Oh, okay.

343
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:07,852
Here.

344
00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:10,697
Okay, uhm---

345
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:14,726
I’ll just text you regarding any updates with this house.

346
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,533
Here you go.

347
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,407
By the way, I sent you a follow request the other day.

348
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,147
Really?

349
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:26,996
Sorry, I haven’t been checking my socials recently.

350
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:28,383
I’ve been busy.

351
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,875
Are you active in social media now?

352
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,014
Not really.

353
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:36,156
I just like to keep up with the people I care about.

354
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,972
Oh, because I’m your architect.

355
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:47,945
You’d wanna know what’s happening in my life.

356
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:54,690
Maybe you’d want to see the master’s bedroom since

357
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,578
they’re putting up the wallpaper already.

358
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:58,008
Sure.

359
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:02,140
Are you okay?

360
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:04,283
Yes, sorry. I’m just dizzy.

361
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:06,452
Architect, you might be hungry or

362
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:09,080
dehydrated or even fatigued. Sit down.

363
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,123
- Kuya, chair please. - No, no!

364
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:11,707
No, it’s okay. It’s okay.

365
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,751
It’s just a slight migraine. I can manage.

366
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:14,710
No.

367
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,328
Let’s take a break first. We can continue later.

368
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:18,811
- There’s no need. - Thank you!

369
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:20,484
- I’m all right. - Sit down.

370
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:21,686
Sit down.

371
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:27,570
Okay.

372
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:42,703
Everyone, let’s take a break. I bought some food.

373
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:43,895
Thank you.

374
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:45,602
You’re welcome.

375
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:48,234
Go ahead, don’t be shy. Eat up.

376
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,205
Come on, you guys can sit here.

377
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:52,623
Guys, sit here.

378
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:54,851
I bought some food.

379
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:59,000
I’m not hungry, but thanks.

380
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:02,186
Eat up, Luna.

381
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:04,343
You shouldn’t waste Attorney’s treat.

382
00:22:05,553 --> 00:22:07,008
Thanks, Attorney.

383
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,347
The boys are grateful.

384
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:09,898
No problem, Engineer.

385
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:16,397
Eat first.

386
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:26,407
Let me.

387
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:32,872
Lucky you.

388
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:46,851
I’m on it.

389
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:49,223
I'm about to eat.

390
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:17,835
Hello?

391
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:20,564
What?

392
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:21,718
Mom…

393
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:24,733
You’re coming here?

394
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:30,296
So, what do you think, Mom, Dad?

395
00:23:30,872 --> 00:23:32,077
I like it.

396
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:34,640
It’s simple and practical.

397
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:37,269
Yes, I agree, Dad.

398
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:41,278
The first time I saw the design, I really did like it.

399
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:43,888
Is this it?

400
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,925
This is the design?

401
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:48,781
What do you mean?

402
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:50,871
I mean, it’s just…

403
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,827
I expected more.

404
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:56,126
You know, simple is different from simplistic and this

405
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:57,748
is simplistic.

406
00:23:57,748 --> 00:24:00,673
I feel it’s too plain, it’s too bland.

407
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:03,587
We’re still at 60% of construction, Mom.

408
00:24:03,587 --> 00:24:04,944
It’s not yet finished.

409
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:07,216
But I’m sure that once everything is done

410
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:09,260
and everything is set in place,

411
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,538
you will see how amazing this house can be.

412
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,295
Amazing?

413
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,928
I’m not sure.

414
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,790
I mean, judging from the layout,

415
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:21,443
I think I like how the house looked before.

416
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,530
I’m sorry, who are they again?

417
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,304
Mom, Dad,

418
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:29,640
Architect Luna Valeria, Engineer Sevi Camero.

419
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:31,234
Hi.

420
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:32,608
Good afternoon.

421
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:34,718
Luna Valeria?

422
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:37,872
Are you—

423
00:24:37,872 --> 00:24:39,040
Yes.

424
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,124
Wow!

425
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:43,315
You were just an architecture student when we first met you.

426
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,627
It’s good to see that you are practicing your profession now.

427
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,065
Thank you.

428
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:51,214
Dear, I’ll be blunt.

429
00:24:52,094 --> 00:24:55,198
Is there a way for you to fix this, maybe improve it?

430
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,079
I just feel that it’s too open,

431
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:59,231
you know, like there’s no privacy.

432
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:04,273
And your design, by the way, is too common. You know?

433
00:25:04,273 --> 00:25:06,901
This minimalist design that you got going here

434
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:08,991
it’s just not working for me.

435
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:11,702
I have to disagree with you, Mom.

436
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,871
The design is perfect.

437
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:17,583
It’s a huge improvement from the previous design of this house.

438
00:25:17,953 --> 00:25:19,752
This feels more homey.

439
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:22,129
Where a family can actually live in.

440
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,683
I don’t want too big of a house and closed off where family

441
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:27,706
members can’t even see each other anymore.

442
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:29,887
Like ours.

443
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:33,641
Just to add, Doc,

444
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,685
I designed it this way to let more natural light in.

445
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:41,482
And to have a better view of this beautiful landscape outside.

446
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:44,105
We wouldn’t want to waste it, right?

447
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:47,571
We should maximize the beauty of nature here in Tagaytay.

448
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,402
And to be honest,

449
00:25:50,402 --> 00:25:54,286
the original walls made the house look small and constricted.

450
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:56,784
With this open floor layout,

451
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:58,714
people can see more of each other.

452
00:25:58,893 --> 00:25:59,954
Plus,

453
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:04,034
the layout is flexible so it’s easy to reconfigure the furnishings.

454
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,128
Kalix do you really like it?

455
00:26:07,128 --> 00:26:09,718
Yes, Mom. A hundred percent.

456
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:13,628
Every design element of this house is well-thought of.

457
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:18,060
Architect Valeria did a really great job.

458
00:26:19,515 --> 00:26:20,724
Fine.

459
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:22,393
If you say so.

460
00:26:22,393 --> 00:26:24,191
You’re the one who’s gonna live here anyway.

461
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:35,411
What happened earlier was really intense.

462
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:38,664
Kalix’s mom is really scary.

463
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:41,742
What are you going to do when she becomes your mother-in-law?

464
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,352
Are you crazy?

465
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:46,737
But it’s good that he finally defended you.

466
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,829
Feeling giddy now, aren’t you?

467
00:26:49,854 --> 00:26:53,048
What do you mean? I’m actually confused.

468
00:26:53,048 --> 00:26:57,026
He’s been very sweet this week and

469
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,830
his comments seem to have an underlying meaning to it.

470
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,102
That makes me think that he and I still have a chance, like we can still be—

471
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:06,812
I don’t know anymore, it’s just annoying.

472
00:27:06,812 --> 00:27:08,479
What if there really is a chance?

473
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:09,839
Stop assuming things.

474
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:11,108
This is just work.

475
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:13,235
Jeez! You never change.

476
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:18,026
Besides, this is my first time seeing a client who keeps visiting the site.

477
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:19,995
This is out of town, you know?

478
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:21,620
I wonder why.

479
00:27:22,203 --> 00:27:24,830
Kalix just might be a hands-on client.

480
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,495
Or… he just wants to come see you.

481
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,293
That’s nonsense.

482
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:31,011
Stop putting meaning into this,

483
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:33,214
we are strictly professional.

484
00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:36,104
Strictly professional or–

485
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:37,468
Just strictly professional!

486
00:27:37,468 --> 00:27:39,178
You hear me? Okay? Happy now?

487
00:27:39,178 --> 00:27:41,096
This is just work, strictly professional.

488
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:42,870
Okay, okay.

489
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,401
Answer it.

490
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:48,412
- What? - I need to go home. ‘Cause…

491
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:50,147
- ‘Cause…? - I can’t be late.

492
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:51,868
- I don’t wanna be in trouble. - Is this work?

493
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:53,574
- I’ll go ahead. - Or are you going on a date?

494
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,726
- Bye. - Okay, I’ll go home soon too.

495
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:56,847
This jerk…

496
00:27:58,788 --> 00:27:59,878
Luna!

497
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:02,003
Can we talk?

498
00:28:02,952 --> 00:28:04,036
Okay.

499
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,206
Sorry about what happened earlier.

500
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:09,917
Personally, I really like your design.

501
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:12,933
It’s fine, don’t worry about it.

502
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:16,651
It’s normal for some people not to like my designs.

503
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:19,862
But, thank you.

504
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:21,925
I appreciate it.

505
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:32,768
By the way,

506
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:35,331
Adonis is inviting you for dinner.

507
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,677
Dinner?

508
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:39,158
It’s his birthday.

509
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:42,783
He says he wants to invite all of his closest friends.

510
00:28:42,783 --> 00:28:46,034
And he asked me to give you this.

511
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:53,335
Dear Architect, you better come to my birthday. I’ll be really sad if you don’t. Love, Adonis

512
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,847
So what do you think?

513
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,933
Are you coming?

514
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:03,386
Okay.

515
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:05,389
Great.

516
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:06,737
I’ll tell Adi.

517
00:29:06,932 --> 00:29:08,689
I’ll see you tomorrow night?

518
00:29:09,977 --> 00:29:11,478
Okay.

519
00:29:11,478 --> 00:29:12,896
I’ll go ahead.

520
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:14,189
Yeah.

521
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,001
Architect!

522
00:29:34,418 --> 00:29:35,919
You’re here.

523
00:29:36,545 --> 00:29:38,380
Happy birthday, Adi.

524
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,590
Wow! Thanks a lot.

525
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,855
You even gave me a gift.

526
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,423
Help yourself out.

527
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,350
Architect, glad you came.

528
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:48,223
So glad that you made it, Architect.

529
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:51,435
Am I early?

530
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:53,901
No, you’re right on time. We’re complete now.

531
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:56,612
Is it really your birthday, Adi?

532
00:29:57,733 --> 00:30:00,240
It's my birthday tomorrow.

533
00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:03,785
This is an advance birthday celebration with my best buddies.

534
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:07,039
You’re one of them so thank you for coming.

535
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:10,954
Excuse me, we’re just gonna go ahead.

536
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:12,122
We left something.

537
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:14,249
Come on guys, that’s just lame.

538
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,228
I know you are planning a surprise for me.

539
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,796
All right then, go ahead, I’ll pretend like I have no idea.

540
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:20,611
Don’t be too full of yourself!

541
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,924
Let’s have a drink?

542
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:22,963
Sure.

543
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:25,947
Seriously, thanks for coming.

544
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,388
I really appreciate it.

545
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:31,600
Of course, I don’t want you to sulk just because of me.

546
00:30:32,684 --> 00:30:35,658
You’re such a nice person. Just like Kalix.

547
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:38,103
But so scary at work.

548
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:42,699
Especially when we were both in that firm where we handled criminal cases.

549
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,824
Adi, can I ask you something?

550
00:30:46,824 --> 00:30:47,991
Sure.

551
00:30:50,953 --> 00:30:53,330
Didn’t Kalix leave his old firm?

552
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,221
Yes, since he didn’t have a choice.

553
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,000
Why didn’t he have a choice?

554
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,752
Our boss said that

555
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:01,986
it’s either he’s gonna resign or he’s gonna take a certain case.

556
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,341
What certain case?

557
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:07,510
The one about that mayor’s son, about–

558
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:10,305
Miguel Villaflor?

559
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:11,721
Yes! Yes, that one.

560
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:17,688
After our boss gave him that ultimatum, it didn’t even take Kalix an hour to decide

561
00:31:17,688 --> 00:31:20,478
and give his letter of immediate resignation.

562
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:22,431
He decided that quickly.

563
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:26,049
He took cases worse than that

564
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:28,340
but that was the only one he rejected.

565
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,200
I didn’t really get it.

566
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,017
He could’ve won easily.

567
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:35,210
They said he was going to be paid four times his salary.

568
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:40,299
But Amethyst took the case, didn’t she?

569
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:42,676
Kalix asked her to take it.

570
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,045
How come?

571
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,655
No idea.

572
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:49,266
That was also Amy’s first loss.

573
00:31:51,096 --> 00:32:01,134
Happy birthday, Adi…

574
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:07,988
Happy birthday, happy birthday…

575
00:32:07,988 --> 00:32:12,868
Happy birthday, Adi…

576
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:14,203
Make a wish!

577
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:15,430
Thanks, guys!

578
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,833
- Yes sir, to many more years, brother. - Finish this.

579
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:20,959
Cheers!

580
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:24,247
Yo, let’s take this champagne later?

581
00:32:24,272 --> 00:32:25,273
Yes, let’s do it!

582
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:27,633
Bro, do you wanna smoke?

583
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:29,009
Sure, let’s go.

584
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:30,492
- Excuse us. - Excuse us.

585
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:34,000
Would you like some wine?

586
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:38,437
Kalix, can we talk?

587
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:52,273
I heard you resigned because of Miguel’s case.

588
00:32:55,202 --> 00:32:56,297
Yes.

589
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:00,062
Why?

590
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,538
Because that’s the right decision.

591
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:07,796
I couldn’t work with them anymore.

592
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,250
Adi said that you could have easily won that case.

593
00:33:12,682 --> 00:33:14,703
Why did you leave then?

594
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:18,234
I didn’t want to defend an abuser.

595
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:20,680
Maybe they offered a lot of money,

596
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:23,031
but they couldn’t buy my principles.

597
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:26,328
Alleged, remember?

598
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,211
Innocent until proven guilty.

599
00:33:31,196 --> 00:33:32,773
You’re learning something.

600
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:37,469
You said your opinions won’t matter in court.

601
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:41,305
It’s only the court who’s going to decide if someone’s guilty or not.

602
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,680
So why did you reject the case?

603
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:52,507
For you, Luna.

604
00:33:55,637 --> 00:33:57,695
I knew it was important to you.

605
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,578
For me?

606
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:01,953
Why?

607
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:05,391
I knew it was important to you and Kierra.

608
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:09,625
I didn’t want to disappoint you, Luna.

609
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,031
I don’t understand.

610
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:19,617
I wasn’t even in your life when this all happened.

611
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:22,508
You were never gone.

612
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,930
Many years have passed and you were never really gone.

613
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,258
Even after all these years have passed?

614
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,930
It was hard to forget what we had, Luna.

615
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:51,632
And I told you,

616
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:56,976
I would give up anything for you, Luna.

617
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:01,492
I wanted to keep my word.

618
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:11,180
You shouldn’t have sacrificed your job for me, Kalix.

619
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:14,016
If I had taken that case,

620
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,469
you would’ve hated me forever.

621
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:21,234
You would have never talked to me again.

622
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:25,883
And I can’t ever live with that.

623
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:35,258
Sorry, I have to take this call.

624
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,407
- Dad? - Luna,

625
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:40,409
sorry for the short notice.

626
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:42,369
Can you drop by the office tonight?

627
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:44,079
There’s just a rush revision needed.

628
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,123
Okay, Dad.

629
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:48,601
You have to leave?

630
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:00,297
Architect Valeria…

631
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:05,406
Take care.

632
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:09,391
You too.

633
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:24,539
You were never gone.

634
00:36:24,953 --> 00:36:29,094
Many years have passed and you were never really gone.

635
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:15,003
Luna, it means moon.

636
00:37:15,003 --> 00:37:17,589
Now you’ll remember me everytime you look at the moon.

637
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:18,965
Like a curse.

638
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:20,875
More like a tattoo in my brain.

639
00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:22,617
A beautiful one.

640
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:25,222
One that I’m never gonna forget.

641
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:31,641
I can see it! The moon looks so beautiful.

642
00:37:32,604 --> 00:37:33,617
Yes,

643
00:37:33,914 --> 00:37:35,123
beautiful.

644
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:10,430
I spoke with the landscape designer

645
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,937
and they said that bay fencing and wood decking

646
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:16,445
would match the outdoors to the interior.

647
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:19,734
If you have any concerns, let me know.

648
00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:22,539
No, that sounds good.

649
00:38:26,408 --> 00:38:28,727
Why, Kalix?

650
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,140
What?

651
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:35,023
Your post.

652
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:36,812
Your caption.

653
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:39,507
What about it?

654
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:45,195
The caption you had is my name.

655
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:48,031
I posted it because it was special to me.

656
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:52,360
Special?

657
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:05,187
Because we got to talk things out.

658
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:09,430
Things I should’ve said earlier.

659
00:39:14,998 --> 00:39:16,836
I’ve been thinking recently.

660
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:19,289
About,

661
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:21,891
regrets.

662
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:27,102
I regret failing that semester.

663
00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:32,000
So many things changed after that.

664
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:37,007
Your dreams?

665
00:39:39,022 --> 00:39:40,945
Everything, Luna.

666
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:48,219
Everything started falling apart at that time.

667
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:51,851
But most especially, the future I dreamt of.

668
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:55,247
If I could go back in time

669
00:39:56,656 --> 00:40:00,909
and change something, I would go specifically to that one semester.

670
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:05,460
And do anything to not let you think

671
00:40:05,485 --> 00:40:08,027
that I cheated on you, Luna.

672
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,339
Because I didn’t.

673
00:40:11,514 --> 00:40:13,129
I really didn’t.

674
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:18,228
And I would be willing to explain everything to you

675
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:20,082
as long as you’re ready.

676
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:23,358
As long as we’re both ready to listen to each other

677
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:24,832
with an open mind.

678
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:31,113
How about you?

679
00:40:33,118 --> 00:40:35,097
Do you have any regrets?

680
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,605
That one night

681
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,910
when I said I didn’t love you—

682
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:47,716
I didn’t believe you.

683
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:49,128
But it stopped you.

684
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,593
You gave up.

685
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:52,550
I didn’t give up on you.

686
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:54,556
On us.

687
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:58,351
You just felt like you wanted to get rid of me so badly

688
00:40:58,351 --> 00:41:01,105
that you even have to lie about your own feelings.

689
00:41:01,688 --> 00:41:03,714
So why are you back, Kalix?

690
00:41:05,316 --> 00:41:07,418
Why are you even telling me all this?

691
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:09,199
I was doing great already.

692
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,293
Because I want you back, Luna.

693
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:31,011
You are the future I dreamt of.

694
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:37,605
And trust me I regret every single day of the past years…

695
00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:42,378
that I just walked away from you.

696
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:46,847
That I did not fight for us.

697
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,847
A lot has happened, Kalix.

698
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:01,652
So many things have changed.

699
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:03,035
I know.

700
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,527
I know we’re not the same people anymore.

701
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:09,246
But my feelings for you never changed.

702
00:42:10,715 --> 00:42:14,390
I meant it when I said that my feelings for you were never gone.

703
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:18,478
I want you to understand, Luna, that I’m really trying.

704
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:21,439
And I want you to give me a second chance.

705
00:42:22,936 --> 00:42:27,278
I know I’m asking too much but if you could only give me one more chance.

706
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:31,032
Just to prove myself to you one last time.

707
00:42:31,653 --> 00:42:33,321
If you still don’t want me after that,

708
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:34,911
I promise

709
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,039
you won’t see me ever again.

710
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:42,818
I’m scared.

711
00:43:42,904 --> 00:43:45,143
I don’t know if it’s still worth it for us to try again.

712
00:43:45,143 --> 00:43:49,310
Use this Boracay trip to relax and think about it.

713
00:43:49,939 --> 00:43:51,310
Hello, Kalix.

714
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:53,610
Hey! I just arrived here in Malaysia.

715
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,404
Enjoy your stay in Boracay.

716
00:43:55,737 --> 00:44:00,909
I guess it’s good that we’re on separate trips so that we can think clearly.

717
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:01,910
Again,

718
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:04,630
I’m not pressuring you to give me an answer right away.

719
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,457
I’m willing to wait for it

720
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:09,209
and work hard for it.

721
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:11,920
I know he already knows what he lost after you broke up.

722
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,046
But, let’s show him more.

723
00:44:13,046 --> 00:44:15,396
Let’s show him what he missed out on.

724
00:44:17,373 --> 00:44:20,094
You look great, as always.

725
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:22,755
You just reminded me of our time in Boracay.

726
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:24,057
There’s someone at the door.

727
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:26,601
I’ll be back ‘cause my phone is charging, okay?

728
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:27,602
Give me a second.

729
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:28,811
- Okay. - What’s up?

730
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:30,772
You know my room number, right?

731
00:44:31,064 --> 00:44:32,982
- Yes. - You should stop by.

732
00:44:32,982 --> 00:44:34,521
Let’s have some fun.
