1
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,245
Call Carmi.

2
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,623
Hello, Architect?

3
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,833
Carmi,

4
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,127
please prepare all my contracts for signing.

5
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,213
I’m around España now.

6
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,923
I’ll arrive at 8:15 AM sharp.

7
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,508
It’s all prepared, Architect.

8
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,303
Just reminding you of your 8:30 am meeting

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,221
with the president and the CEO.

10
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,890
Carmi, I know.

11
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,600
I saw it on my calendar.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,934
Thank you.

13
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,102
Bye, Carms.

14
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,882
- KIERRA: LUNA, WHERE ARE YOU? - What?

15
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:29,172
THEY'RE HERE IN THE OFFICE NOW.

16
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:24,879
Hello, Ke.

17
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:27,001
Hello, where are you?

18
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,893
I’m here, in the parking lot.

19
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,435
You weren’t answering my text.

20
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,154
I thought something happened to you.

21
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:37,159
You’re so dramatic. I’m here, I’ll be right there.

22
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,126
Oh no, my umbrella.

23
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:41,962
I’m getting off, see you.

24
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:42,754
Bye.

25
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:51,346
What a day!

26
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:52,722
Ma’am, ma’am.

27
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:54,307
It’s raining, ma’am.

28
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:55,934
- Yeah. Thanks. - Let’s go

29
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:56,893
Good morning, Architect.

30
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,019
Good morning.

31
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:01,022
Good morning, Architect.

32
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,148
Good morning.

33
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:03,733
Architect, let me take those.

34
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,026
- Thanks, Carms. - Tissue?

35
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:05,777
Oh, what happened to you?

36
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,320
Isn’t it obvious? I’m soaking wet.

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,030
As usual, you didn’t bring any umbrella.

38
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,407
I’ll gift you one on your birthday.

39
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,243
You know, Ke, you’ve been saying that since college. Don’t bother.

40
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,370
Hurry up, they're waiting for you.

41
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,917
Dad, Mom. Sorry, I’m late.

42
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,053
Luna, what happened to you?

43
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,215
I was stuck in traffic, then it suddenly rained.

44
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,857
I told you to get a driver

45
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:28,884
so that you wouldn’t have to worry about that.

46
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:30,107
That way, you won’t be late.

47
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:31,425
I’m sorry.

48
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,822
So what is this meeting all about?

49
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:36,137
Is this about the project in Santa Rosa?

50
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:38,394
No, no... It’s not about that.

51
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:40,457
Oh, so what is it?

52
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,400
Well Luna,

53
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:43,982
with the passing of Attorney Ramos two months ago.

54
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:45,876
The company has been looking for

55
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:49,279
somebody who can fill up the position of Head Legal Counsel.

56
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,947
And those are big shoes to fill.

57
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:54,826
You know that Attorney Ramos served our company for twelve years.

58
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,411
Were you able to find someone?

59
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,715
Fortunately, yes.

60
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:01,333
Oh that’s good to hear. Knowing your standards,

61
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,627
you hired the best person for the job.

62
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:06,379
Yes, he is the best person for the job.

63
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:08,006
- He is. - Actually you know what,

64
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:09,841
he used to be a defense lawyer.

65
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:12,093
And now, he has his own law firm.

66
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:14,054
And also a bar topnotcher.

67
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:16,473
Wow, impressive background.

68
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:18,975
Who is he? I would like to meet him.

69
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,852
Here, take a look.

70
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,609
Attorney Kalix Jace Martinez.

71
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:30,387
He will be our new Head Legal Counsel.

72
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:32,656
Kalix?

73
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:33,198
Yeah.

74
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:35,659
We just want you to know before we tell everyone.

75
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,243
How did that happen?

76
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:37,953
Well,

77
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:40,705
we interviewed several lawyers and he stood out.

78
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:43,083
Why didn’t you tell me before hiring him?

79
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,268
Luna,

80
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:48,380
I understand you have history with Attorney Martinez,

81
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:51,400
but that was during college, you were still young then.

82
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,109
And besides I told you.

83
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:55,261
We interviewed several lawyers–

84
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:56,096
Really?

85
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:58,108
Out of all the lawyers that you interviewed,

86
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,784
you still chose Kalix?

87
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:02,268
He was the best one available for us.

88
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:04,312
And besides, I really believe in his principles

89
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:05,992
and credibility as a lawyer.

90
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,816
He’s really good for the company.

91
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,395
Principles and credibility?

92
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:12,023
I don’t know about that.

93
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,071
Luna,

94
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,614
we really thought that

95
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:16,170
this wasn’t going to be an issue to you

96
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:18,052
because what happened between the two of you–

97
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:18,953
But Mom–

98
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:22,233
Sorry! Sorry!

99
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:25,850
- Sorry, sorry. I’m sorry! Come on. - Luna!

100
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,294
- Are you already tipsy? - Come on, Luna.

101
00:06:28,294 --> 00:06:29,879
- No. I’m not tipsy yet! - Oh my god!

102
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,841
Come wipe this off, we might find someone handsome here.

103
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:34,509
It’s just that Luna hasn’t gotten any sleep yet.

104
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:35,719
She studied all-night.

105
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,758
Oh, are you okay?

106
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:41,099
- I’ll buy you water, just a minute. - Via, come on, I’m okay.

107
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,184
Yanna’s being slow with passing the shots too.

108
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,811
Wow, alright then.

109
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,354
You know guys,

110
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:49,190
just let Luna be drunk so she can get herself a boyfriend.

111
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,234
Gosh, look at her, she’s all dried up.

112
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:53,862
- Hey! What do you mean dried up? - Just kidding, I’m kidding.

113
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,530
- You’re crazy. - Kidding.

114
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,406
That’s not true.

115
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:59,367
It’s just that the one I deserve hasn’t come around yet.

116
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,162
So now I’m just prioritizing my studies.

117
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,221
Studies.

118
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:05,415
That’s good though, study first before flirting.

119
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:07,709
Jeez, you can do that at the same time.

120
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,044
Just remember,

121
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:13,339
drink more than moderately, study hard and–

122
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,384
- Flirt responsibly! - Flirt responsibly!

123
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:17,927
Here you go. Silly you.

124
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,679
Finish that.

125
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,222
Take it straight because that’s the last shot.

126
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:22,741
I’ll buy another bottle.

127
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:23,992
Oh, nice!

128
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:27,001
I’ll definitely drink this straight up to make the most of it.

129
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:28,997
It’s so far going here.

130
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:30,899
You should all be grateful that I love you guys.

131
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:33,401
Yuck!

132
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,444
Okay,

133
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:37,655
just reminding you that we still have classes tomorrow.

134
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:41,076
My Papa’s strict, so our cut-off is at 12 midnight.

135
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:42,160
1 AM.

136
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,411
12:30?

137
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,080
Fine, then!

138
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,456
- Okay. - Jeez!

139
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:48,124
Okay, okay.

140
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:50,168
Girls, I want to make a toast to us.

141
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,412
Since highschool, we’ve always been high achievers

142
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,370
and I’m high-key proud of us.

143
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:57,358
Now that Luna, Kierra, and Via are sophomores,

144
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:59,969
and Yanna and I are juniors in college,

145
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:01,488
things are gonna get tough.

146
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,766
But let’s continue chasing after our goals and dreams, okay?

147
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:05,600
That’s right!

148
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,604
We may drop when we drink, but we never drop our academics.

149
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:10,355
- Never! - Never!

150
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:13,066
We’ll throw up but we’ll never throw off the Dean’s list.

151
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:13,942
- Yeah! - Yeah!

152
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:15,110
- Yeah, that’s right. - Right?

153
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,944
Guys, I love it.

154
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:18,279
But I also have a good cheer–

155
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:22,700
For our friendship and our dreams.

156
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,328
- Cheers! - Cheers!

157
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:35,296
Oh my god, he’s here.

158
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:36,381
Who?

159
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,757
My new crush.

160
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:40,343
So that’s why we came here, to see your crush?

161
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:42,554
Stay low-key, don’t look their way.

162
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:43,763
They’re about to sit.

163
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:44,597
Don’t–
Come on–

164
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,475
- Which one is he? Which one? - Come on, girls.

165
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,435
The one wearing black.

166
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:51,938
- Come on! - They’re all wearing black.

167
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,774
The one wearing a gold necklace.

168
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:26,973
Hey, find someone handsome?

169
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,433
Someone handsome? Anyone?

170
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:29,517
You found someone handsome?

171
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:30,351
Huh?

172
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:31,728
No– What?

173
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,062
N-no, she’s stuttering.

174
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:34,355
Liar!

175
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:35,648
- No one! - Who? Who is it?

176
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:36,524
No one!

177
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:37,996
- No? - No one?

178
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,195
He’s so hot.

179
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,363
You know, you’re too slow.

180
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:44,449
If I were you, I’d be long gone.

181
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:46,659
Go already, go for it, come on.

182
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:47,869
I can do this.

183
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,287
- I can do this. - Go!

184
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:51,456
Let’s go!

185
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:52,749
One more shot, one more!

186
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:55,627
- She can do this! - Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!

187
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:58,396
- Yes, yes! - I can do this, okay?

188
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,340
Hey, where are you going?

189
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,132
All right!
- Let her be, - Really? Seriously?

190
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:04,219
- This is rare, let’s support her. - Really? Seriously?

191
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:05,828
Let’s go, let’s go.

192
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:07,972
Hi.

193
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,391
I’m Sam, and you are?

194
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:11,684
Adonis.

195
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:12,852
Sorry, what?

196
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:15,038
Adonis.

197
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:16,648
Adonis, can I sit here?

198
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:21,402
Adi, you need to move your car, someone’s going out.

199
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:22,779
Excuse me.

200
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,408
What do you need?

201
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,868
So grumpy.

202
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:29,702
What?

203
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:32,413
Nothing, we don’t need anything.

204
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:34,356
Come on, let’s just go.

205
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:35,466
Hi!

206
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:36,559
Oh my gosh, hi!

207
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:38,503
KJ, you’re here.

208
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:42,006
And with your taxation book, what are you a nerd?

209
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,427
The hell, you’re a nerd. You’re a nerd.

210
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:50,890
Midnight snack!

211
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,434
Instant noodles again.

212
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,186
Of course, we should save up

213
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:57,956
so we can drink more and buy art supplies at Jomar’s.

214
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:01,109
Why don't you make Jomar your boyfriend so that we can really save up?

215
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:02,904
- Crazy! - Just kidding.

216
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,337
Hey, you know,

217
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:05,662
I feel bad for Sam.

218
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:07,825
She was ignored by her crush earlier, right?

219
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,842
You really felt bad for Sam?

220
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,865
She’s pretty, she can quickly find someone new and more handsome.

221
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,348
I agree with that.

222
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,375
But speaking of handsome–

223
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,014
You like that guy from Katipunan, don’t you?

224
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,250
The one with Sam’s crush.

225
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:24,731
Huh?

226
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,853
Of course not.

227
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:29,178
No.

228
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,514
Jeez!

229
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:34,876
Stop pretending. The guys from Sam's school were really handsome.

230
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:38,162
Didn’t I tell you, Ke? I’m not into rich kids.

231
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:39,289
Why?

232
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:40,857
You’re rich too.

233
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:43,626
What if his parents won’t like me?

234
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,695
Then just like in soap opera,

235
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,679
I am offered millions just to stay away from him.

236
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:50,341
Then let’s just accept the money.

237
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,693
We can use that for our drinking sessions

238
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,388
and we wouldn’t be eating instant noodles at night.

239
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:58,178
We’ll be having caviar and tartufo.

240
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,879
Wait a sec, how did we get here? You’re good at changing topics.

241
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,714
I just asked if you were into him.

242
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:05,965
Well?

243
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,800
Oh you’re being defensive. You’re into him, huh?

244
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,843
You’re into him?

245
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:09,844
You’re into him.

246
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:11,179
Admit it.

247
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:12,305
Well?

248
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:14,573
Yes.

249
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:16,726
He’s a ten,

250
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:18,202
but

251
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:19,479
so stern.

252
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:23,204
And looks like he has a girlfriend, so I’ll pass.

253
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:24,334
So you really are into him.

254
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:27,994
That was a lot of talk, you even brought up soap operas.

255
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:30,859
You know,

256
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:33,368
it seems that you’re too focused on romance.

257
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:34,243
Wow.

258
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:35,912
Let’s just study first.

259
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:37,872
Study?

260
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:42,600
Come on, can’t you rest a bit? Look at the time.

261
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,876
Oh please, I still have energy.

262
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:47,875
I should submit this on time.

263
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,379
You know I can’t afford to be out of the dean’s list.

264
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:51,652
You know what they say,

265
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:55,181
you get hired easily if you're a consistent dean’s lister.

266
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:57,100
Hey, we’re still in our second year.

267
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,391
That’s far from now.

268
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:01,079
Your parents isn't really giving you any pressure.

269
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:02,313
Not really.

270
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:04,023
I just don’t want to disappoint them.

271
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:08,219
Of course, I am the next generation, Architect Valeria.

272
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:10,254
That’s why I’m giving my best this early.

273
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,860
At this rate,

274
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:14,750
once you graduate you’ll be a lead architect already.

275
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:18,641
Lead Architect, Louisse Natasha Valeria.

276
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,196
Perfect. Then include to your company–

277
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:24,602
Architect, Kierra Ynares.

278
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:25,795
Beautiful!

279
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:30,667
Okay, fine. I’ll work on my plates, too.

280
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:33,743
Our group being grade-conscious can really be motivating.

281
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:35,895
I’m sure they’re all studying, too.

282
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,642
But, I’ll eat first.

283
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,627
I’m almost done anyway.

284
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:48,427
Well…

285
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:24,464
Excuse me.

286
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:45,598
Hello, Dad.

287
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:46,865
Kalix.

288
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,558
Where are you now?

289
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:50,521
I’m in the elevator already.

290
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:52,703
Okay, just wait for me in the clinic.

291
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:54,325
Alright, see you.

292
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:11,717
Kalix… Kalix.

293
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,588
Just be extra careful, Sevi.

294
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:18,693
It won’t be good if that gets injured again.

295
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,303
It might be worse.

296
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:23,387
Avoid straining your ankle as much as possible.

297
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:27,248
In a few days, you’ll be able to walk properly.

298
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:30,286
Just maintain minimal movement, okay?

299
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,839
All right, Doc. Thanks a lot.

300
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:39,177
Why didn’t a veterinarian check on you?

301
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:41,531
Because your doctor wasn’t available.

302
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,516
- Huh? Huh? - Huh? Huh?

303
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:44,267
Hotdog.

304
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,418
Asshole.

305
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,329
Here, your special request.

306
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,647
Wow.

307
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,552
But if I didn’t reach out, you wouldn’t even come visit me, huh?

308
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,110
Where’s Ke, by the way?

309
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:56,712
You keep complaining.

310
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:59,115
Come on, Ke still has class.

311
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:01,467
So, how’s this stupidity going?

312
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:04,662
Have you ever seen a King Tiger that looks like a kitten?

313
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:05,454
A kitten?

314
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:08,107
What kitten? Check this out.

315
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:12,645
Hey, I might get bashed by your fans,

316
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,422
thinking that I was the reason for your injury.

317
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:16,282
Wow, you’re concerned?

318
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:19,003
Of course, I’m concerned. You’re my best friend.

319
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:21,487
Besides, you might not be able to go back to school.

320
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:24,175
Since you’re the team captain, we won’t win in basketball.

321
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,226
Here, eat. Your worms might be getting hungry.

322
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,252
Jerk!

323
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:30,229
Have you eaten already?

324
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:40,489
I really heard the name “Kalix.”

325
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:41,949
Hey nuthead!

326
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,351
What are you talking about?

327
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:45,494
Sevi.

328
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,564
I have a new crush, I met him at the Pop-up.

329
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh… Really?

330
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,495
Was it that “Kalix?”

331
00:16:54,738 --> 00:16:57,773
He’s so handsome and tall, too.

332
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:59,717
But I can’t find him online.

333
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:03,738
Oh no, that’s unusual.

334
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:05,598
If he doesn’t have any socials,

335
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:07,028
he might be hiding something.

336
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:09,619
Stop overreacting. Are you referring to yourself?

337
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:11,207
Huh? Me?

338
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:12,663
I’m a good boy.

339
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:14,607
Ah, good boy.

340
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:17,443
- So you’re a good boy, just like a dog. - Yeah, ain’t I?

341
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:20,196
- All right then, Sevi. - Ain’t I? Ain’t I a good boy?

342
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:20,780
Fetch!
Hey!

343
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:23,532
You lunatic, you’re completely nuts.

344
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:24,669
Good boy.

345
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:31,957
Well, what’s the full name of this Kalix?

346
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:35,753
I don’t know yet since we’ve only met twice.

347
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:40,383
But you know, I’m totally on cloud nine, I feel so giddy.

348
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:41,133
I know.

349
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:42,968
But it’s just a happy crush.

350
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:46,681
He’s so handsome and it's just for some inspiration.

351
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:47,807
For inspiration?

352
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:50,459
Why would you still need one, when you already have me?

353
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:51,745
Huh?

354
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:56,190
See this?

355
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,257
Yuck, that’s disgusting.

356
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:21,345
Hello, mom.

357
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:24,348
Sorry, I’ll be home late.

358
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:28,293
It suddenly starts raining and we just finished our project.

359
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:31,158
Yes, please tell Dad I said hi.

360
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:33,894
I’ll text you when I get to the condo.

361
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,271
Bye, mom.

362
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:47,869
Hey.

363
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:50,661
I haven’t read the cases yet.

364
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:52,845
Okay.

365
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:57,590
Yes, I’ll send them over.

366
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,388
Okay, I’ll se–

367
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:02,680
Bye.

368
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:13,464
It’s so annoying, the rain just keeps pouring.

369
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:15,681
I don’t even have an umbrella.

370
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:21,208
Sorry, I didn’t bring an umbrella.

371
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:22,443
Huh?

372
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:24,740
Were you talking to me?

373
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:28,537
Don't mind me, I’m not trying to borrow an umbrella.

374
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:43,255
Hello, how are you?

375
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,049
Yes,

376
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:48,035
I’m still waiting for the rain to stop.

377
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,347
I’m starting to get hungry, I haven't eaten yet.

378
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,603
Don’t be silly, I don’t have a boyfriend.

379
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,628
You’re studying in Katipunan, right?

380
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:24,550
Yes.

381
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,244
I saw you at the Pop-up last time.

382
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,771
You study here?

383
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,543
Yes, right there.

384
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,266
Architecture?

385
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:38,220
Yes.

386
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,729
You?

387
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:41,130
Engineering?

388
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,893
Management.

389
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:46,831
Management Engineering?

390
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,575
Legal Management.

391
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:52,384
When are we going to hangout in Katipunan?

392
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:56,764
Wow! I thought Katip is too far? Happy crush for sure.

393
00:21:56,764 --> 00:22:00,476
Sam, you coming?

394
00:22:00,476 --> 00:22:02,353
All right! Let’s hangout in Katip tomorrow! More chances of seeing him.

395
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:14,715
I've only been in their campus a few times.

396
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,139
Right. So this is where they eat.

397
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:18,629
Am I pretty?

398
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:22,598
Ke! Come on.

399
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:24,249
- Yes, you look good. - Jeez.

400
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:27,002
I told you, your make up’s perfect and you even let your hair down today.

401
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:30,249
Of course. We travelled all the way so I have to make the most out of it.

402
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,108
Oh, Sam is coming.

403
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,670
Her class is done.

404
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:39,967
You know, I want to study here but they don’t have Architecture.

405
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,825
So many hotties.

406
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,478
Stop it, Ke. I’m looking for someone.

407
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:47,206
- Oh my god, there he is! - Huh?

408
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:52,639
- You are so annoying. - You just expected too much!

409
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:00,094
Hey, Luna.

410
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,203
There he is. He’s really there now.

411
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:03,288
- There he is. - You can’t fool me again, Ke.

412
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:06,000
Silly, there’s your crush. That’s your crush, right?

413
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:08,258
Not this time, Ke. Stop.

414
00:23:08,602 --> 00:23:10,396
You’re so stubborn, he’s right there.

415
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:11,489
Ouch!

416
00:23:11,514 --> 00:23:13,465
Let's hangout later?

417
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,804
That’s right!

418
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:24,660
He’s so hot.

419
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:26,729
- Calm down, calm down. - He’s so hot.

420
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:29,665
How do I look? Do I still look good?

421
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,734
Wait, who’s that?

422
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,844
- Huh? - She acts like his girlfriend.

423
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:35,504
Look here.

424
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:37,239
Your hair’s so messy.

425
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:38,782
There, handsome.

426
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,739
Anyway, I'll go to the cafe if you wanna hang out.

427
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:43,057
Bye.

428
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:52,938
You think she’s his girlfriend?

429
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:55,007
- Girls! - Maybe not, maybe just a close friend.

430
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:56,866
- Hi! - Hey, hi.

431
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:00,571
Have you been waiting long?

432
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:02,556
Not really, but what’s the plan tonight?

433
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:05,167
Our friend here wants to go out.

434
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:08,058
Kalix might see you, Ke.

435
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,374
I have an idea that would make Luna happy.

436
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:14,532
Wait.

437
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,153
Adi!

438
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:18,201
Hi! Hi guys.

439
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:19,310
What’s up?

440
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,565
They’re friends now?

441
00:24:22,872 --> 00:24:25,250
That’s how it’s done, you just move on quickly.

442
00:24:25,304 --> 00:24:27,598
We’ll have a small party at my condo tonight.

443
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:28,717
There’ll be food and drinks.

444
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:31,101
If you guys want to come, you can bring your other friends too.

445
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:31,752
Sure!
Just send us the loc.

446
00:24:32,628 --> 00:24:33,712
Okay.

447
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:34,755
I’m down, too.

448
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:36,549
Nice.

449
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:40,010
You, KJ?

450
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,930
Pass.

451
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,181
I still have stuff to do.

452
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:47,434
Too bad.

453
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:52,481
Your perfect brows and flowing hair have been wasted.

454
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:54,399
All right, I’ll see you guys later.

455
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:55,713
Kalix.

456
00:24:55,738 --> 00:24:57,907
If you change your mind, just come.

457
00:24:58,362 --> 00:24:59,029
Okay?

458
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:00,906
I’ll go ahead, bye.

459
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,533
Bro,

460
00:25:02,825 --> 00:25:05,410
I actually miss hanging out with him.

461
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,411
Me too.

462
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,750
Bro, let’s go on a road trip to Baguio!

463
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,877
I’m trying to save up on gas, bro.

464
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,504
Yes, inflation's fucked up.

465
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:17,047
I agree.

466
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:22,636
That's true! This bottle of tequila is 1,500 now.

467
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:26,014
Even the jeepney fare went up now with an additional two pesos.

468
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:28,142
You ride the jeep?

469
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:31,270
Yes, everything’s going crazy expensive.

470
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,339
That’s true.

471
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:35,649
Everything’s going crazy, right Luna?

472
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:36,817
You’re crazy.

473
00:25:36,817 --> 00:25:38,277
Come on, join us.

474
00:25:38,277 --> 00:25:40,097
- Go ahead, I’ll finish this first. - Okay.

475
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,540
Hey, are you okay?

476
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:43,740
I’m just not in the mood.

477
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,784
Go ahead, enjoy yourselves.

478
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:47,553
KJ, my man!

479
00:25:47,578 --> 00:25:49,872
Yo, five second shot.

480
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:53,250
I’m not drinking.

481
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:56,253
Did you bring your taxation book?

482
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:57,671
- Hi Kalix. - Boring.

483
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:00,777
Well, are you in the mood now? You feel better now?

484
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:08,974
Bye!

485
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:13,620
- There’s still chips there, help yourself. - Sure.

486
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,230
Sam, I'll go ahead too.

487
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,525
- Okay, bye! Thank you. - We’ll go together.

488
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:21,195
- Thank you. - Bye... bye.

489
00:26:21,195 --> 00:26:23,155
- Bye. - Bye.

490
00:26:23,864 --> 00:26:25,824
Come on, sleep in the bed. It’s much more comfortable.

491
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:31,705
Hey, you’re too slow.

492
00:26:31,705 --> 00:26:33,207
Hurry up.

493
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:35,442
I’m just trying to prepare myself. Don’t be too excited.

494
00:26:36,768 --> 00:26:39,188
Girls, we’ll go ahead.

495
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:41,173
Alec's gonna show me his…

496
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:42,407
car.

497
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:44,801
Aren’t we going home?

498
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:47,162
Let’s go. I’m tired and sleepy.

499
00:26:48,847 --> 00:26:51,433
No. We’re not going home yet. Not yet.

500
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,089
- Excuse me. - Huh? Let’s go home.

501
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:55,229
Hi.

502
00:26:55,254 --> 00:26:56,630
You really don’t want to drink?

503
00:26:56,738 --> 00:26:57,773
I’m good.

504
00:26:57,773 --> 00:27:00,025
Oh, because you’re reading, huh?

505
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:01,193
What is it?

506
00:27:01,193 --> 00:27:02,361
For school.

507
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:04,404
Legal Management, right?

508
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:06,365
Yes.

509
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:08,742
What year level are you?

510
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,911
Third.

511
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:12,496
Just so you know, I’m in second year.

512
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:14,498
Just sharing.

513
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:23,715
He’s so hard to talk to. One question, one answer.

514
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:26,051
Just get straight to the point.

515
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:29,263
Bro. Bro?

516
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:32,557
Buy us some more alcohol. We’ve run out of drinks.

517
00:27:32,557 --> 00:27:34,101
Or should I buy?

518
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:35,102
You’re drunk.

519
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:37,646
What are you saying, bro? I’m not drunk.

520
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:41,149
Don’t be a killjoy, bro. Come on.

521
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:42,192
Fine.

522
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,906
Hey, Kalix!

523
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:49,074
Kalix, she’ll go with you.

524
00:27:49,074 --> 00:27:50,742
Luna will go with you.

525
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:51,326
Yes!

526
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:54,997
- You’re gonna buy something too, right? - I have something to buy!

527
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,968
You smoke?

528
00:28:12,264 --> 00:28:15,809
I saw you buy one pack a while ago.

529
00:28:17,102 --> 00:28:18,864
No, it’s for Leo.

530
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,241
I stopped smoking last year.

531
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:23,521
Why?

532
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:26,309
Health reasons.

533
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:33,285
You’re so hard to talk to, you know?

534
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:37,080
One question, one answer. You even give short answers.

535
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,874
If this was an essay,

536
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:40,625
you’ll barely pass.

537
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:44,476
You?

538
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:46,248
You smoke?

539
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:49,593
Me?

540
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:51,595
No, it stinks.

541
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:54,341
You’ll be a lawyer, right?

542
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:57,869
Yes, you?

543
00:28:57,894 --> 00:29:01,481
Me, a lawyer? Of course not.

544
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:04,566
I mean, what’s your plan?

545
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:09,554
Oh, to be a lead architect.

546
00:29:11,907 --> 00:29:14,493
Then the school you chose, it’s good.

547
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:30,124
By the way, why are you always in my school?

548
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:32,443
My parents are both doctors there.

549
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:36,014
Wow! Why didn’t you just take Medicine?

550
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,416
Being a doctor would suit you.

551
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:44,731
I’m sorry, did I say something wrong?

552
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:46,566
I’m sorry.

553
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:48,735
No, you’re good.

554
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:54,796
Sorry, what’s your name again?

555
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:59,663
We’ve been talking for a while now and you don’t even know my name.

556
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:02,791
Why are you asking?

557
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:04,091
I can’t?

558
00:30:05,781 --> 00:30:08,408
Louisse Natasha Valeria.

559
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:10,145
Too long.

560
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:13,565
You can call me, “Love.”

561
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,872
Just kidding! Luna.

562
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:23,454
You can call me Luna.

563
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,456
I guess you’ll add me to your socials?

564
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:29,688
I’m not active there.

565
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:31,153
But you do have socials?

566
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:35,115
Type in your socials.

567
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:49,771
@kalixjm in IG.

568
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:53,150
KJ Martinez in FB.

569
00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:55,302
That’s why I couldn’t find you.

570
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:57,385
What?

571
00:30:58,655 --> 00:30:59,865
Ah, I mean–

572
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,892
KJ? Why KJ?

573
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,990
It’s my nickname, short for Kalix Jace.

574
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:09,435
Ah, too long.

575
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,379
Can I call you "Mine" instead?

576
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:22,996
Hey, I added you to my socials.

577
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:24,356
Okay.

578
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,124
Aren’t you going to accept it?

579
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,944
- I’ll think about it. - Hey, wait!

580
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:38,512
- Hi, Kierra. - Hi, Kierra.

581
00:31:38,537 --> 00:31:40,497
- Hi, Luna. - Hi.

582
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:45,560
He still hasn’t accepted your friend and follow request?

583
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:46,753
Not yet.

584
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:53,443
Zero post, 2345 followers, 342 following?

585
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:56,071
Later, another would be added.

586
00:31:56,071 --> 00:32:00,450
One, a.k.a @lunavaleria.

587
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:05,121
But it’s been a day and still no update.

588
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:07,565
Maybe he hasn’t seen it yet.

589
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:10,560
Or maybe he just forced himself to give me his socials.

590
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:11,628
Maybe he’s just not online.

591
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:13,505
Or maybe he just doesn’t care.

592
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,898
Maybe he’s just busy.

593
00:32:14,923 --> 00:32:17,300
Or maybe he just doesn’t like me.

594
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:21,263
Maybe this is it.

595
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:25,100
Oh, someone else accepted.

596
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,145
You know, just manifest it, they say it works.

597
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,106
I wouldn’t want that.

598
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:34,025
This is it, he will never accept my requests.

599
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:37,195
If that’s the case, there’s nothing we can do.

600
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:44,869
Maybe this is just some Cebu lechon or Pampanga’s tocino, jeez.

601
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:53,962
- Ke, look! Look! - Why? Why?

602
00:32:57,065 --> 00:32:59,442
Wait, wait.

603
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:03,263
So you are now friends online and in real life,

604
00:33:03,263 --> 00:33:04,431
so you know what to do.

605
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:06,766
Yes! I’ll be starting the operation–

606
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:07,601
- Hashtag - Hashtag

607
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,768
LuKal!

608
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:09,894
Lu-Lukal?

609
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:11,271
Luna and Kalix!

610
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,772
Wow, you are a love team already?

611
00:33:12,772 --> 00:33:14,024
Hurry and message him first.

612
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:15,942
Okay, I’ll send him a message.

613
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,644
What are we going to say?

614
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:24,034
Hi, thanks for accepting. Send.

615
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:33,086
He types so slow, what is this, a letter?

616
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,672
He said, “hey!”

617
00:33:37,672 --> 00:33:38,715
Hey! Hey!

618
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:43,303
He said, “hey!”

619
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:59,611
Luna: So what’s your thought on Hernandez v. CA?

620
00:34:04,032 --> 00:34:05,492
Kalix: Tf?

621
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:06,743
L: Why?

622
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:09,371
L: I’m curious about the case.

623
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:14,668
K: What are you curious about?

624
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,338
L: The case.

625
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:21,341
K: Did you even read it?

626
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,426
L: Of course.

627
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:26,367
K: What’s the ruling?

628
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:33,269
K: See?

629
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:35,772
K: You don’t even know.

630
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:37,871
L: I do know.

631
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:41,945
L: The decision of the CA,

632
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:44,197
L: is affirmed.

633
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,909
K: All right, then.

634
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:50,245
K: Tell me the facts.

635
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:58,670
L: You want a fact?

636
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,380
L: Here's a fact:

637
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,007
L: If I would be given the chance to make a law,

638
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:06,428
L: It would be the right to have you.

639
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,267
K: Wtf

640
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:27,991
Let’s see if you can ignore this.

641
00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:31,770
Good morning, woke up like this.

642
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:07,489
See, it worked. Shit!

643
00:36:07,514 --> 00:36:10,642
I’m pretty. I’m so pretty!

644
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:13,845
All right then, what’s “caspering?”

645
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,915
Caspering is the friendlier version of ghosting.

646
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:20,210
They just slowly leave you hanging.

647
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,254
Luna: Class is done. Just chilling with my friends.

648
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:25,799
So how about this, what’s “haunting?”

649
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:26,466
Kalix: ?

650
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:29,177
Haunting is easy.

651
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:33,056
L: Did you eat already?

652
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:35,322
K: Yes, you?

653
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:41,106
L: Wow! You’re asking me if I have eaten?

654
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:44,300
L: Will you get mad if I don't?

655
00:36:47,487 --> 00:36:49,948
L: Just kidding.

656
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:55,286
L: Yes, I just had lunch.

657
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,297
L: When are you coming back to our campus?

658
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:08,675
K: Why?

659
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:11,469
K: You want to see me?

660
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:14,955
Seriously? Is that okay?

661
00:37:15,827 --> 00:37:17,829
Hey, are you listening?

662
00:37:17,962 --> 00:37:19,022
Huh?

663
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:25,006
Oh that’s why she’s not listening, she’s busy flirting.

664
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:28,152
K: On Wednesday, I guess. Wednesday?

665
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,489
He said Wednesday.

666
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:34,284
Wednesday.

667
00:37:47,596 --> 00:37:48,790
Hey.

668
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:50,503
Hi!

669
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,968
Oh, you’re here?

670
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:54,345
Yes, I said I would visit on Wednesday.

671
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:56,389
Yes.

672
00:37:56,414 --> 00:37:58,315
Sorry, I forgot.

673
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,016
Come, sit here.

674
00:38:02,478 --> 00:38:03,658
Come closer.

675
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,595
You smell nice. What’s your perfume?

676
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,371
That’s not important.

677
00:38:12,363 --> 00:38:14,282
So what are you doing here?

678
00:38:14,282 --> 00:38:15,825
Did you visit your parents?

679
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:17,362
No, they're busy now.

680
00:38:17,943 --> 00:38:19,821
I came here to see someone.

681
00:38:20,788 --> 00:38:23,416
Is that someone named Luna?

682
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,338
No, actually my friends are here.

683
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:29,672
At Dapitan.

684
00:38:29,672 --> 00:38:31,633
Is that so?

685
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:34,761
Then why aren’t you in Dapitan? Why are you here?

686
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:37,430
Well,

687
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:39,891
I just wanted to say hi.

688
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,021
How are your plates?

689
00:38:45,313 --> 00:38:47,607
You have a high word count today.

690
00:38:47,749 --> 00:38:51,044
I'm finishing it now, it's due tomorrow.

691
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:52,278
Cramming.

692
00:38:52,278 --> 00:38:53,565
How are your cases?

693
00:38:54,405 --> 00:38:56,407
Done for next week.

694
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:57,867
Wow!

695
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:00,995
Such an ideal student, perfect!

696
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:05,208
I’ll check that later.

697
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,710
Tell me about your parents.

698
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:10,113
What kind of doctors are they?

699
00:39:11,297 --> 00:39:14,634
My mom is a neurosurgeon and my dad is an Ortho.

700
00:39:14,634 --> 00:39:16,886
Awesome.

701
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:18,763
How many siblings do you have?

702
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:22,392
My sister is in med school and I–

703
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:25,971
Sevi’s so irritating.

704
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:31,275
You know what,

705
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,593
just take the call.

706
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:34,612
I’ll talk to you later.

707
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:50,303
Hey, Sevi, what is it? You’re so annoying.

708
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:56,175
It's been two days since the last time I heard from crush. I miss him!

709
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,495
Huhu the flirting has come to an end!

710
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:05,243
OMG, they’re going to Astro bar! Let’s go, Ke! I need a Wing Girl.

711
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:07,812
Let’s invite the girls.

712
00:40:07,837 --> 00:40:10,465
Yes!

713
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:25,288
Let’s shot!

714
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:27,498
Cheers!

715
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:34,672
If you can’t find me later, don’t look for me.

716
00:40:34,672 --> 00:40:36,966
Just remember,

717
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:42,680
- study first and flirt responsibly! - study first and flirt responsibly!

718
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:48,603
Adi and Leo are here!

719
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:49,520
- Hi! - Adi!

720
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,980
- Hi girls! - Hi!

721
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,607
Hello girls.

722
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:53,858
Let’s party later.

723
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:55,026
Sure.

724
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:59,447
I thought Kalix was with them, where is he?

725
00:40:59,447 --> 00:41:01,699
He’ll be here soon, don't worry.

726
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:04,494
- Let’s just dance. Let’s go! - Let’s dance.

727
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:06,187
Let’s go!

728
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:39,070
Guys, I’ll just go to the bathroom.

729
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,113
Huh?

730
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:43,407
I’m tired. I’ll just sit down, I’ll just sit.

731
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:44,117
Huh?
I’ll sit.

732
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:46,285
I’ll go with you.

733
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:47,328
Let’s go.

734
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:50,206
What, now it’s just the two of us.

735
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:52,208
Via, are you sure you’re okay?

736
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,544
Yes, I’m fine. I’ll just take a rest.

737
00:41:54,544 --> 00:41:55,128
Sam!

738
00:41:55,128 --> 00:41:56,587
Oh hey. Hi!

739
00:42:01,217 --> 00:42:03,386
Where’s Yanna? She’s taking too long.

740
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:05,638
Haven’t you gotten used to her yet?

741
00:42:05,638 --> 00:42:06,514
She’s taking so long.

742
00:42:06,514 --> 00:42:08,307
Fine, let’s just dance.

743
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:13,563
Hey, I'll go over there. Wait a minute, just wait.

744
00:42:15,857 --> 00:42:18,734
Hi, wanna take a shot?

745
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:19,777
Okay.

746
00:42:19,777 --> 00:42:21,112
I’m Shan, by the way.

747
00:42:21,112 --> 00:42:21,988
Luna.

748
00:42:21,988 --> 00:42:23,573
Nice meeting you.

749
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:24,907
Are you single?

750
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:26,117
Yes.

751
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:27,577
Wanna change that?

752
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:39,172
- Cheers. - Cheers.

753
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,472
Kalix?

754
00:42:50,683 --> 00:42:52,018
I’m sorry.

755
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,378
Kalix?

756
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,882
Kalix!

757
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:55,646
Brother.

758
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:58,424
Hey, you didn’t tell me you were here.

759
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:00,242
Hey.

760
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:06,591
What’s wrong, why are you ignoring me?

761
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:08,201
Not even a hello?

762
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:09,410
Or just a hi?

763
00:43:11,628 --> 00:43:13,004
Kalix!

764
00:43:13,138 --> 00:43:15,224
Hey, wanna shot?

765
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,751
Saw you on the dance floor.

766
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:20,838
You’re gorgeous.

767
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:22,465
Thank you.

768
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:23,716
I’m Marcus.

769
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:31,766
Is there a problem?

770
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:33,142
Kalix!

771
00:43:42,276 --> 00:43:43,361
One more shot.

772
00:43:43,903 --> 00:43:45,112
One more.

773
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:57,917
Hello?

774
00:43:57,917 --> 00:44:00,253
Luna, where are you? We’ll go to a different bar.

775
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:01,379
Huh?

776
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:03,489
I’m heading out, I’ll be out.

777
00:45:17,913 --> 00:45:19,258
Good morning.

778
00:45:22,698 --> 00:45:26,119
No! We’re not hiring him.

779
00:45:28,043 --> 00:45:30,838
Luna, he already signed the contract.

780
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:33,617
Actually, he’s coming in today for our initial meeting.

781
00:45:33,642 --> 00:45:35,394
Are you serious?

782
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:37,850
No, I’m not ready to meet him.

783
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,686
I really cannot, I’m really sorry.

784
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,412
Architect Valeria.

785
00:45:48,437 --> 00:45:50,006
It’s been a while.

786
00:46:33,656 --> 00:46:37,743
Amazing! I’m glad you thought of coming home.

787
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,622
Don’t get mad right now, please, forgive me already.

788
00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:43,833
Whatever! You owe us an explanation.

789
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,209
Okay… Okay!

790
00:46:45,209 --> 00:46:47,503
He brought me to his condo.

791
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:50,089
I slept at Kalix’s place.

792
00:46:50,506 --> 00:46:52,299
I puked all over his bathroom.

793
00:46:55,428 --> 00:46:56,637
Look at this.

794
00:46:56,637 --> 00:46:58,556
Do you think they’re together?

795
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:00,391
They look like they’re just friends.

796
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:01,225
I'm not sure.

797
00:47:01,225 --> 00:47:02,643
They’re always together.

798
00:47:02,643 --> 00:47:05,771
So? We’re always together, too. But–

799
00:47:05,771 --> 00:47:07,476
Hi, Kalix.

800
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:10,668
This is my friend, Sevi.

801
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:12,611
Sevi, this is Kalix.

802
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:16,313
Hey bro, Sevi.

803
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:17,585
You’re Sevi.

804
00:47:19,743 --> 00:47:22,621
A good relationship is built on honesty.

805
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:27,543
That’s why as early as now, I'm asking about him and Amethyst.

806
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,195
Are you in a relationship?

807
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:29,795
What?

808
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:32,640
Do you have a crush on Amethyst?

809
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:33,799
I have to go.

810
00:47:34,467 --> 00:47:35,634
Thanks for the dinner.

811
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,796
Why? Are you mad?

812
00:47:37,887 --> 00:47:40,473
You’re confusing me, Luna.
