1
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:14,225
I wanna break up.

2
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:16,443
I don’t.

3
00:00:16,922 --> 00:00:18,466
Enough.

4
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:21,280
I’m done.

5
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:23,760
I’m tired of all this.

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,900
During the times I was so down with what you did to me,

7
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,087
Sevi has always been by my side.

8
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:37,312
What are you doing?

9
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:40,895
Sorry. I just got curious.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,881
I’ll just come back next time when you’re not busy.

11
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:45,999
Sorry!

12
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:47,376
- Sorry, sorry! - No, no…

13
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:49,375
Those are very important client files.

14
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:52,514
I’ll do anything to make it up to you. I’m really sorry.

15
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,774
Anything?

16
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:56,134
Yes, anything.

17
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:57,765
Do my house in Tagaytay.

18
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:41,782
Attorney!

19
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:43,700
Here’s a package for you.

20
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,951
What package?

21
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,348
Who sent that?

22
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:50,832
There’s no name attached to it actually,

23
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:52,990
but it’s from Valeria Construction.

24
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:02,052
That’s cute.

25
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,375
Yes!

26
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,892
Return those to Architect Luna Valeria.

27
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,078
Huh?

28
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:10,119
Okay, sir.

29
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:11,547
Thank you.

30
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:19,683
He is so annoying!

31
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:27,566
Hey! What happened?

32
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,453
Look at this.

33
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:31,313
Kalix is so annoying.

34
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:32,833
Why, what did he do?

35
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,085
I sent him a gift package.

36
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:37,295
But he gave it back to me. What the heck does that mean?

37
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:39,506
- Your apology was not accepted. - Huh?

38
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:41,450
Who does he think he is?

39
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:43,977
Maybe he just didn’t like what you sent him.

40
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,346
What is this anyway? What’s this? Humi–

41
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:47,764
Humidifier, Luna?

42
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:50,392
- Are you an old lady? - Why?

43
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:51,643
He definitely needs something to help him relax

44
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:54,688
while he fixes all the documents I ruined.

45
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:56,481
See? I’m quite thoughtful.

46
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:59,234
Sure you are. You do seem worried.

47
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:01,403
You even thought it through.

48
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:06,032
But you do know the apology Kalix is willing to accept, right?

49
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:09,851
Since he lost a job because of the documents you ruined,

50
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,914
it just makes sense that he demands to get something job-related in return.

51
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:16,209
Ke, you know why I didn’t accept the project, right?

52
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,305
I know and I heard the rumor that

53
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:24,373
Kalix was part of Mi-Miguel’s legal team.

54
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:26,041
But…

55
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,138
I did my research

56
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,515
And I didn’t really see his name in the list

57
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:33,133
of the Villaflors’ legal representatives.

58
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:36,343
I did see Amethyst’s name, though.

59
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:37,925
What?

60
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,471
Are you serious?

61
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:43,767
But it’s fine if you don’t want to talk about it.

62
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:48,505
No, I’m okay. He’s behind bars now.

63
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,148
I can talk about him.

64
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:54,664
Just make sure to clear it up with Kalix, okay?

65
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,583
We shouldn’t take this project for granted.

66
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,836
You should just stay strictly professional.

67
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:02,719
Unless there’s some other reason as to why you keep rejecting him.

68
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:04,704
Don’t be silly!

69
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,509
You’re overthinking.

70
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,762
Seriously, Luna, do you still have feelings for him?

71
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:09,387
Huh?

72
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:12,265
No. Of course not. What are you talking about?

73
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:14,625
It’s been years. No.

74
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,604
Okay. Sure.

75
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:20,616
Sure. If there’s any other reason, I get it.

76
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:25,779
We, architects, have certain preferences with the projects we work with.

77
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:28,114
But you still need to apologize.

78
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,609
Instead of just giving him this nonsense.

79
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:33,362
Do what’s right.

80
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:38,749
- Come in. - Welcome.

81
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,792
Are you here to stare at me?

82
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:52,711
No.

83
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:55,161
I’m here to give my formal apology.

84
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,750
Can you forgive me now?

85
00:05:56,986 --> 00:06:00,046
I’m really sorry for spilling water over your documents.

86
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:03,555
I’m willing to pay for all the damages that I’ve cost.

87
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,546
That’s how sorry I am.

88
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,542
I appreciate the written apology and the gifts.

89
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,523
But I had to return it because people might think

90
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:27,592
that those are bribes from the clients.

91
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:29,943
I clearly do not want that.

92
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:31,586
I would rather have you repay me through

93
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:33,614
your professional service, Architect Valeria.

94
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:35,617
You already know what I’m talking about.

95
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:38,270
I already sent you the proposal and the contracts.

96
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:42,010
I know you already rejected the project, twice.

97
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:44,846
But maybe this time, you’ll accept it.

98
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,560
Can I ask you a personal question?

99
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,649
Depends on the question.

100
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:59,463
Did you represent Miguel Villaflor in court?

101
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:05,033
Who said I did?

102
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,511
Some rumors.

103
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:12,937
Well, I didn’t.

104
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:17,429
I value my morals, Luna.

105
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,914
Do you have anything else to say?

106
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:39,148
I’m busy.

107
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:40,625
Actually, I do.

108
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,205
May I sit?

109
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:51,765
I’m interested to talk about the proposal.

110
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,309
This contract is flawless, I can’t find any loopholes.

111
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:04,234
Duh, your client is a lawyer.

112
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,857
Sorry, I came from the site.

113
00:08:07,857 --> 00:08:09,437
What’s with the meeting?

114
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:11,653
Sevi,

115
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:15,375
will you be my engineer for Kalix’s house project in Tagaytay?

116
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:16,825
Wait a minute,

117
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,476
you’ll accept the project?

118
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:20,837
What made you change your mind?

119
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:24,617
I came from his office earlier and we were able to talk.

120
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:27,937
You’re right Ke. He wasn’t one of the lawyers of the Villaflors.

121
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:30,757
I just needed to confirm it once and for all.

122
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:35,620
So, you accepted it just because you had the wrong idea?

123
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:38,731
Of course I wanted to make sure

124
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:41,926
he wasn’t one of the lawyers of that jerk who hurt Kierra.

125
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:44,335
I won’t have it any other way.

126
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,633
I value my principles.

127
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:49,166
And no one can pay me to do otherwise.

128
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:50,775
I appreciate it, Luna.

129
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:53,027
You even made my feelings your priority.

130
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:54,617
Of course, Ke.

131
00:08:57,117 --> 00:08:58,952
What about my feelings?

132
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:02,605
Is Kalix okay with me being the engineer of his house?

133
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,914
In case you forgot, you made me the

134
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:07,321
third party of your break up, remember?

135
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,001
Oh, come on!

136
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:11,445
Are we still going to bring that up?

137
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,433
Besides, I already told Kalix that you’ll be my engineer.

138
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,011
That’s part of the deal.

139
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:19,637
Okay, then.

140
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,898
Just remember Luna,

141
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:25,518
this is strictly professional. Don’t take anything personally.

142
00:09:25,518 --> 00:09:28,813
Of course. I’m professional.

143
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:31,149
I’ve worked with difficult clients

144
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,931
and Kalix is just my ex.

145
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:35,832
I can easily handle him.

146
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:39,199
So professional… Okay.

147
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:40,867
Easily, huh?

148
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:53,296
Just remember Luna, this is strictly professional.

149
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:55,882
Don’t take anything personally.

150
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:57,967
Get a hold of yourself, Luna.

151
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,720
Architect Valeria.

152
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,165
Attorney Martinez.

153
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:05,475
Thank you for meeting me this early.

154
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:06,634
It’s fine.

155
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:08,228
I hope you have good news

156
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,610
for me to meet you this early in the morning.

157
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:23,761
I’m accepting the project.

158
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,211
That’s great.

159
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:30,708
I’m glad you changed your mind.

160
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:32,946
Well, I have to admit,

161
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:35,243
it’s hard to reject a project this good.

162
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:39,545
And renovating residences is my specialty.

163
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,822
Besides,

164
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:43,057
you even accepted all of my conditions.

165
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,445
Of course.

166
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:48,212
Anything to get the best architect to say yes.

167
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:58,236
So, let’s get to work?

168
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:04,158
I’m really looking forward to working with you, Architect Valeria.

169
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:54,915
Be professional, Luna.

170
00:11:58,345 --> 00:11:59,763
You’re early.

171
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:02,768
There’s no traffic.

172
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:04,829
I see.

173
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:09,586
Do you still remember the house?

174
00:12:11,893 --> 00:12:13,118
Not really.

175
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,876
Okay.

176
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:18,642
I’ll tour you around.

177
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:19,899
After you.

178
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:38,235
As you can see, the house is not in great condition.

179
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,244
Haven’t been here since I got my own condo.

180
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,480
I brought you here,

181
00:12:58,122 --> 00:12:59,938
because I wanna show you every side of me.

182
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:03,165
Even the most vulnerable parts.

183
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,300
What I’m trying to say is—

184
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:08,509
I like you, Luna.

185
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,798
Are you okay?

186
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,922
Yes.

187
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:22,720
It’s just dusty.

188
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,001
Yes.

189
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,024
Should we see the living room?

190
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,040
Okay.

191
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,686
Sorry, I didn’t hire a cleaner since

192
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:38,634
construction is gonna start soon.

193
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,102
Obviously looks rundown.

194
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,264
What’s that again?

195
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:46,309
Nothing.

196
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:48,991
It’s obvious that no one has been coming here

197
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,726
based on the house’s condition.

198
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:54,025
Seems like you took your time with having this fixed.

199
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:55,553
Yes.

200
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:58,873
I couldn’t find the perfect architect to remodel the house.

201
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:06,213
Hold on.

202
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,687
Hello?

203
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:12,078
Alright.

204
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,313
I'll have it checked when I get to the office.

205
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:16,350
Sure, bye.

206
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,144
Luna– it means moon.

207
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:20,813
Now you’ll remember me everytime you look at the moon.

208
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:21,939
Like a curse.

209
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:24,299
More like a tattoo in my brain.

210
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:25,762
A beautiful one.

211
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:27,914
One that I’m never gonna forget.

212
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:31,847
Luna?

213
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,723
The telescope isn’t there anymore.

214
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:41,231
Yes, I kept it so it won’t break.

215
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:46,262
I didn’t expect you would still remember it.

216
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,333
Luna?

217
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,170
Sevi, come in. I’m in here–

218
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:14,333
We’re in here.

219
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:18,179
Engineer Camero,

220
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:19,833
so nice to see you.

221
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,192
How you doing?

222
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,902
Doing well, Attorney.

223
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:27,171
I’m so excited to renovate your house.

224
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:28,684
It’s in such a good spot.

225
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:30,848
I’m glad you accepted the project.

226
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:33,208
You were Architect Valeria’s special request.

227
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:38,724
Excuse me.

228
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,415
I have to take this.

229
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,774
I’ll leave you two for a while.

230
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,106
Feel free to do whatever you have to do, okay?

231
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:50,303
What took you so long?

232
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:52,921
Traffic was bad. I can’t help it.

233
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:56,426
Fine! Come on, let’s just do this quickly so we can go.

234
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:58,203
- Do your measuring. - Okay.

235
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:02,458
This house is really nice.

236
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,583
It just needs a lot of fixing.

237
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:06,695
What’s his plan with this house anyway?

238
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,286
He said we’ll discuss the floor plan later.

239
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:34,106
Hey, Luna!

240
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:37,008
You were staring so hard.

241
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:39,535
What? I was not staring.

242
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:40,963
Okay.

243
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:42,239
If you say so…

244
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:47,270
What’s with the face?

245
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,005
Did something happen earlier?

246
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,389
I don’t know.

247
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:57,658
It just feels awkward coming here after all these years.

248
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,804
While he was giving me a tour of the house,

249
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,830
the memories just came rushing in.

250
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,923
Like–

251
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:08,384
I couldn’t breathe.

252
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:09,645
So,

253
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,755
it still hurts when you remember the past?

254
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,124
I don’t think there’s a break up that isn’t sad, Sevi.

255
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,229
Can you still turn back now?

256
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,260
No, I already signed the contract.

257
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:27,228
And I don’t want to seem unprofessional.

258
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:29,420
Honestly,

259
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,490
this house is special to me.

260
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,690
It’s actually really sad to see it in this state.

261
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:37,994
That’s why

262
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:39,729
I really want to have it fixed.

263
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,432
Make it a bright

264
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,588
and happy place again.

265
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,476
Well,

266
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:47,269
that’s a really good motivation, Luna.

267
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,698
I know that all of the projects you accept

268
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:52,221
have an important reason behind it.

269
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:57,300
I’m sure it would be awkward at first, but–

270
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:00,119
I know you’ll be able to handle it, right?

271
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,048
You always give me the best moral support, Sevi.

272
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:11,010
That’s why I wanted you to be my engineer.

273
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:13,838
Just don’t introduce me as your boyfriend ever again.

274
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:15,631
So disgusting.

275
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:17,383
I already apologized to you.

276
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:19,844
You jerk. Stop reminding me.

277
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:22,304
We have dinner tonight, okay?

278
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,265
You’re my mascot, my moral support.

279
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:25,933
You have to be there.

280
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,894
I can’t go.

281
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:30,627
I have to be somewhere.

282
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,752
I thought you were my mascot?

283
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,077
Sorry.

284
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:37,801
Fine.

285
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,662
Send my regards to the person you’ll be with.

286
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:43,025
Hey, it’s not like that.

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,293
Don’t worry about tonight.

288
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:47,877
You know how to act like you’re okay, right?

289
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:49,988
You think that's funny?

290
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,367
What are you having?

291
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,065
I’m getting beef soup.

292
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:02,322
Maybe we shouldn’t eat out next time.

293
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:04,893
Some people might get the wrong idea.

294
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,129
Why?

295
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,237
Your boyfriend might get mad?

296
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,596
Boyfriend?

297
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:12,437
Who?

298
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,523
Engineer Camero.

299
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:15,566
Huh?

300
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,651
What are you talking about? We’re just friends.

301
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,627
But

302
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,291
even if we were together,

303
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:26,368
it’s none of your business.

304
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:28,330
I did not say I care.

305
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:32,416
Let’s just talk about the house.

306
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:34,643
No. Let’s eat first.

307
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:37,299
Sir?

308
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,463
Can we also have the menu for the dessert?

309
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:47,998
Thank you.

310
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:49,502
He’s even having dessert.

311
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:58,204
So, about the house, how do you want it?

312
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:01,024
Is it just going to be two floors or do you prefer three?

313
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:03,165
What do you think?

314
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:07,451
I need to know how many residents will be living in the house

315
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:08,916
so that I can design accordingly.

316
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,588
It would be just me–

317
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:12,722
and my future family.

318
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:19,291
O-okay.

319
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:23,133
Are you good with having one master bedroom

320
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,010
and two normal ones

321
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,323
or do you prefer three normal bedrooms?

322
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,975
You decide.

323
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:32,977
Huh?

324
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,661
Who’s going to live there, you or me?

325
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:37,354
Like what I promised,

326
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,744
I’m giving you full creative freedom.

327
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:44,229
Architect Valeria, design it like your dream house.

328
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,968
I want to be impressed.

329
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:59,461
Of course, I still need to know the non-negotiables.

330
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:02,089
- Stuff I shouldn’t– - Attorney Martinez?

331
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,342
Attorney!

332
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:08,095
- Claire. - Attorney!

333
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:11,557
How are you? I missed you.

334
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:15,838
I was looking for you at your old firm but they said that you already left.

335
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:17,448
Yes.

336
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,988
Sorry! Girlfriend?

337
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:24,971
No, she’s not.

338
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,366
A client?

339
00:21:28,174 --> 00:21:31,330
No, she’s just someone I know.

340
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:32,843
I see.

341
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:36,823
Oh well! It’s so nice to see you.

342
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:38,266
I really missed you.

343
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,385
If you need anything, just go to my condo.

344
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,495
You know where it is.

345
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,297
- Yes. - Bye!

346
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:51,276
Who was that?

347
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,487
Your fuck buddy?

348
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:56,675
She was a client.

349
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:01,007
Okay.

350
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,861
Whatever it is that you’re thinking—

351
00:22:06,682 --> 00:22:08,041
stop it.

352
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,643
You’re always so quick to judge.

353
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,307
We should probably just have dessert next time?

354
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:28,646
It’s getting late.

355
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:31,471
Let’s just talk about this next week.

356
00:22:31,636 --> 00:22:34,908
Enjoy the weekend with whoever it is you’re with.

357
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:38,431
Sure.

358
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:41,685
Sir? Excuse me.

359
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:45,845
Sorry, we don’t need the menu.

360
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:49,362
Can we just have the bill, please? Thank you.

361
00:22:56,156 --> 00:22:57,532
Excuse me.

362
00:23:02,545 --> 00:23:03,563
Amy?

363
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:06,212
Hey,

364
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:07,956
what’s up?

365
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:23,772
Hey, the boracay trip is set in stone, okay?

366
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:26,734
I already declined two photoshoots for this.

367
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:29,945
Don’t worry, Via even came home for this vacation.

368
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:33,490
I’m just glad that Arkin had free time.

369
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,784
Besides, Sam has been texting me nonstop

370
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:38,245
to come home so that we can all go on this trip.

371
00:23:38,245 --> 00:23:41,123
My god, yes. They’re always so busy!

372
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:42,166
I’m sorry, too.

373
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,993
I’ve been swamped with projects lately.

374
00:23:44,018 --> 00:23:47,588
If you only knew how much I’ve been dying to go for a drink.

375
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:50,215
Is Luna making you do all the hard work?

376
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:52,384
- Exactly! She’s so bossy. - Hey!

377
00:23:52,384 --> 00:23:53,969
Excuse me, I am not.

378
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:57,514
- I’m a cool boss. - Even for getting a drink.

379
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:00,476
Hey! Hey, I think that’s Yanna.

380
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:02,144
- Wait a sec. - Here she is.

381
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:04,515
Hold on.

382
00:24:06,273 --> 00:24:07,274
Hello!

383
00:24:07,274 --> 00:24:08,734
It is her.

384
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:11,070
Move over ladies…

385
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,446
- Your goddess– - Wow!

386
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:14,490
- has arrived. - Wow!

387
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,533
- Damn, girl! - You’re late.

388
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:17,910
- Look at you! - I’m sorry,

389
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,205
the flight was delayed. But look, I even made sure–

390
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:23,373
- Ouch! - Oh, it hit her eyes!

391
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:24,333
Sorry…

392
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,168
- Stunning outfit. - Damn, Yanna!

393
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:27,753
- I followed the dress code. - So flirty.

394
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:29,296
Sorry, baby.

395
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,748
- I’m just glad you’re here. - I know.

396
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,729
Hey, what did your husband say?

397
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,172
I just told him

398
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:38,847
that we’re having a girls night out,

399
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:41,135
so he’s in charge with our daughter.

400
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,453
Come on.

401
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:44,937
- Let’s drink? - Cheers!

402
00:24:44,937 --> 00:24:47,481
I love weekends like these, you know?

403
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:49,316
No work, no clients,

404
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:51,744
just rest and relaxation.

405
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,153
Why?

406
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:55,299
Is Kalix a stressful client?

407
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,873
I thought you’re free to design whatever you want?

408
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:00,077
- Isn’t that the dream? - It is!

409
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:02,496
Only if the client is cooperative.

410
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:04,456
Of course I still need directives.

411
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:06,959
Kalix is the one who’s going to live in that house, not me.

412
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:11,046
But as expected, he gave nothing. All he said was “I want to be impressed.”

413
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:13,257
Didn’t you talk about it during the meeting?

414
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:14,466
We should have!

415
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:17,666
But some client of his came and flirted with him.

416
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:19,972
So we weren’t able to discuss anything about the project.

417
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:21,223
Really, flirting?

418
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:22,791
Would Kalix even do that?

419
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:23,905
Well,

420
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,596
the girl did say

421
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:29,648
that if Kalix needs anything, he could just go to her condo.

422
00:25:29,648 --> 00:25:31,233
That just means

423
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:33,385
that Kalix knows where she lives.

424
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:35,404
She’s probably his fuck buddy.

425
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:37,990
It was just so surprising.

426
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,409
He’s still flirting like that even while he’s together with Amy.

427
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:42,369
Did he not change at all?

428
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:44,454
- He’s still with Amy? - Yes!

429
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:45,622
- Really? - And you know–

430
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:47,527
- I even heard their conversation. - Well?

431
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:53,166
He just looked really happy and in love while talking to her.

432
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:57,877
That’s still not enough proof that they’re still together.

433
00:25:57,902 --> 00:26:00,554
And it’s the same with the female client.

434
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:03,307
There wasn’t any concrete proof that she’s Kalix’s fuck buddy.

435
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:05,267
Let’s not jump into conclusions.

436
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,102
Jeez, I know what I saw.

437
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:08,270
No, wait–

438
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,692
we all know that you no longer see Kalix the same way you did before, right?

439
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:15,694
But maybe…

440
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:18,655
Just maybe– it wasn’t what you think it was.

441
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:22,034
Maybe it’s all just an assumption.

442
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,493
No.

443
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:26,580
I’m sure, I saw how he was acting.

444
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,915
Hold on.

445
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:30,751
Why do you look so affected with all this?

446
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:32,002
Are you actually affected?

447
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:33,045
Of course not!

448
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:34,546
I’m not,

449
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:36,632
I’m just telling you about what happened.

450
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:38,675
Whatever he does is none of my business.

451
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:41,854
- Hmm… - Hmm…

452
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,381
Are you sure?

453
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:44,848
They do say

454
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:49,768
that if you still have feelings for your ex even after all these years–

455
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:54,557
it just means that you’ve always loved him.

456
00:26:58,403 --> 00:27:00,364
You’re so funny, Yanna.

457
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:02,491
No, I just can’t relate to that idea.

458
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:05,118
I don’t have any feelings towards Kalix at all.

459
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,781
You really don’t care anymore?

460
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:11,792
She’s not affected by him.

461
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,776
I am not affected by him.

462
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:17,464
Even if he is my client, we just have a working relationship,

463
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,299
I’ll still do my best, of course.

464
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,301
But I’m not gonna impress him.

465
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,239
If that’s what you say.

466
00:27:25,264 --> 00:27:26,598
Okay.

467
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:29,393
If you say so. She doesn’t care.

468
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:30,823
No, she doesn’t.

469
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:39,055
Hey!

470
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,651
Go sleep inside.

471
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:43,661
- Huh? - Sleep inside.

472
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:45,188
- They’re all in there. - Where are they?

473
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:47,604
They’re sleeping inside the room.

474
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:48,963
Be careful.

475
00:27:51,568 --> 00:27:53,028
Aren’t you going to sleep?

476
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:54,791
No, I have something to finish.

477
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:56,026
Okay.

478
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:07,721
Architect Valeria, design it like your dream house.

479
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,401
I want to be impressed.

480
00:28:10,295 --> 00:28:12,307
So you wanna be impressed.

481
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:18,052
Architecture is not an easy course.

482
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:20,079
You will have many sleepless nights,

483
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,018
finishing multiple plates,

484
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:26,791
while juggling other subjects and student responsibilities.

485
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:30,153
You might get too tired and break down

486
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:33,698
thinking, “why did I even choose this course?”

487
00:28:34,306 --> 00:28:36,433
That’s a true story, by the way.

488
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,174
But, it’s very rewarding.

489
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,844
There aren’t many professions where you get to see your

490
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:45,073
creativity and vision come to life–

491
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:49,019
as a building or a house that will last a lifetime.

492
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:52,506
Whenever I pass by a house I designed,

493
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:55,862
I feel so proud knowing that I was the architect who did it.

494
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,338
So just keep your eyes on your goals

495
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,776
and always remember the reason why you’re taking this course.

496
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,742
- Yes? - Hi, Architect Valeria.

497
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,102
May I ask,

498
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:08,947
what was your motivation in becoming an architect?

499
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:11,572
My parents are architects, too.

500
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:13,663
Ever since I was young,

501
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:15,525
it has always been my dream.

502
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:20,205
To see clients filled with joy after seeing their home,

503
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,173
their dream house, turn into reality with my help.

504
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:26,822
Have you done your own dream house, Architect?

505
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:28,284
Not yet.

506
00:29:29,486 --> 00:29:31,154
I don’t have anyone to share it with.

507
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:34,997
But maybe, someday.

508
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:38,033
At least, I still have something to look forward to.

509
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,828
Architect,

510
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:42,234
I’m just curious.

511
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:44,236
How were you able to balance your personal life

512
00:29:44,236 --> 00:29:46,626
and your studies when you were still a student?

513
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:50,775
It’s just so amazing that you graduated as a Summa Cum Laude.

514
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,703
Did you even have a social life back then?

515
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:55,501
Of course!

516
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,283
Of course. I think

517
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:01,672
I was drunk every weekend.

518
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:03,255
I’m sorry, ma’am.

519
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:07,611
But just remember to be responsible.

520
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:09,985
You have to know your priorities.

521
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,970
Finish your deadlines on time.

522
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:16,580
Start your plates early so that you can go to parties after.

523
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:19,896
May I ask, Architect?

524
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:22,822
Did you ever have a boyfriend when you were still studying?

525
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:28,939
Hey, your questions are getting too personal.

526
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:31,657
Yes,

527
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:34,001
but it wasn’t easy.

528
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:38,437
So, don’t get too serious with your relationships.

529
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,963
Just enjoy your youth.

530
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:42,884
And yes, it’s okay to have a lovelife.

531
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,644
She said it’s okay, ma’am.

532
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:52,087
Luna?

533
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:55,937
You’re Luna, right?

534
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,384
I’m Kio,

535
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:58,910
Kio Martinez.

536
00:30:59,603 --> 00:31:00,896
Oh my god, Kio?

537
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:02,689
- Yes. - Kio!

538
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:04,399
How are you?

539
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,734
I’m okay.

540
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:07,486
You’re all grown up now.

541
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:10,263
You were still young the last time I saw you.

542
00:31:10,288 --> 00:31:11,832
I thought you forgot about me.

543
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:15,444
I’m the one surprised since you were basically a baby back then.

544
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:17,673
No, I recognized you from the pictures.

545
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:19,314
You’re hard to forget, Ate Luna.

546
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:21,166
I mean, you were my brother’s ex after all.

547
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,417
Kio!

548
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:24,637
Mom’s looking for you.

549
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:27,457
Wait Kuya, I’m still talking to your ex.

550
00:31:27,482 --> 00:31:29,541
Isn’t Luna still very pretty?

551
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:34,077
Yes.

552
00:31:36,272 --> 00:31:38,275
Luna always looks nice.

553
00:31:41,414 --> 00:31:43,376
And you look disheveled.

554
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:46,587
Kuya, stop treating me like a kid. I’m fourteen now.

555
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,597
Why don’t you get your own child?

556
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,876
Luna, you’re single, right?

557
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:53,692
Huh?

558
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,542
Ma-Maybe.

559
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:58,068
Yes! Perfect.

560
00:31:58,093 --> 00:32:01,221
Bro, break up with that girl so you can settle down and stop bothering me.

561
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:02,791
Kio, watch your words.

562
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,650
You don’t just say that to people.

563
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:06,895
Mom’s looking for you at the hospital,

564
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,353
come on. Go!

565
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:09,463
Okay, fine.

566
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:10,978
- Bye, sis. - Bye, Kio.

567
00:32:11,003 --> 00:32:12,463
It was nice seeing you again.

568
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:17,248
Sorry about that.

569
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:18,697
No problem.

570
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:21,384
What are you doing here, by the way?

571
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:24,354
I was invited for a career talk.

572
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:26,751
But I’m about to go now. Gotta go to Tagaytay.

573
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,159
Is that so?

574
00:32:28,868 --> 00:32:30,447
I’m going there, too.

575
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:33,171
What are you going to do there?

576
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,991
I forgot some client files the last time I was there.

577
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,882
Should we go together?

578
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:43,290
No need! Besides,

579
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,166
Sevi’s picking me up.

580
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,437
Perfect timing, Sevi’s calling me.

581
00:32:47,462 --> 00:32:48,593
Hold on.

582
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:52,070
Hello, Sevi.

583
00:32:52,357 --> 00:32:54,943
Sorry, Luna. I can’t pick you up.

584
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:57,937
Looks like I have to stay onsite a bit longer.

585
00:32:58,013 --> 00:32:59,723
Huh? I didn't bring my car today.

586
00:32:59,723 --> 00:33:01,554
How will I get to Tagaytay?

587
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,125
I’m really sorry. Maybe someone else is going the same way?

588
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,236
Maybe you can ride with them?

589
00:33:32,922 --> 00:33:34,109
Sorry.

590
00:33:37,503 --> 00:33:40,367
I didn’t know you liked that genre.

591
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:44,054
That’s Kio’s playlist. I’m–

592
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:48,242
He usually play his songs when-whenever I’m driving him to school.

593
00:33:48,296 --> 00:33:51,945
I usually don’t play music when I drive

594
00:33:52,817 --> 00:33:54,656
so I didn’t notice.

595
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:57,861
Okay. Too defensive.

596
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:02,937
By the way,

597
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:05,250
I was surprised that

598
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,713
Kio still remembers me.

599
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:10,429
He said he was reminded because he saw pictures of me.

600
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:12,644
What pictures?

601
00:34:13,963 --> 00:34:15,256
Well…

602
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:18,796
maybe he saw you from my socials?

603
00:34:18,843 --> 00:34:19,886
Huh?

604
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:22,929
Didn’t you delete all of my photos in your socials?

605
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,717
Are you stalking my account?

606
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:37,038
Anyways—

607
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:42,866
About the floor plan, any feedback on that? Is it okay?

608
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:46,375
I actually have been meaning to talk to you about that.

609
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,569
It’s good, Luna.

610
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:52,125
I like the open plan layout

611
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:56,211
from the living room and to the dining and the kitchen.

612
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:00,139
The house will definitely look more spacious.

613
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:04,648
I also like the south-facing windows in the master bedroom.

614
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:08,022
I love waking up to the natural sunlight.

615
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:11,218
It’s like you read what’s on my mind.

616
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:14,093
I hired the right architect.

617
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:25,160
Does this mean that the floor plan is now approved?

618
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:27,195
Yes.

619
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,267
Why don’t you answer?

620
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:44,476
Your girl might have something important to say.

621
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:45,776
Girl?

622
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:47,171
I’m single

623
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:49,765
and Amy is not my girlfriend.

624
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:51,477
Really?

625
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,341
- Kio did say– - Well, Kio’s wrong.

626
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:56,687
You know how teenagers can be.

627
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:15,093
You got the telescope back?

628
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,468
I thought you kept it since it wasn’t being used?

629
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,429
Yes, I passed here the other day and decided to bring it.

630
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,015
I missed looking at the moon.

631
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:44,812
Let me check it.

632
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:51,132
I think it’s not set properly.

633
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:54,431
I can’t see the moon.

634
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,960
Let me help you.

635
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:06,382
Excuse me.

636
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,352
Sorry.

637
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:20,531
Yes, got it.

638
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:21,648
Okay.

639
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:32,684
I can see it! The moon looks so beautiful.

640
00:37:34,176 --> 00:37:35,302
Yes,

641
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:36,718
beautiful.

642
00:37:42,212 --> 00:37:43,288
Huh?

643
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:45,414
You said something?

644
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,875
I didn’t hear it.

645
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,296
No.

646
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:52,327
I just said it’s getting late.

647
00:37:56,394 --> 00:37:57,520
Okay.

648
00:37:57,835 --> 00:37:58,835
Let's go.

649
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:02,342
Yeah. After you.

650
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:13,453
Let’s cheers, girls!

651
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:16,976
Cheers!

652
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,500
I like this music.

653
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:25,273
Hey, Sam, I thought you were going to close the club when we’re here?

654
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:28,718
I’m sorry, it’s the weekend, cash is pouring.

655
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:30,745
Also, I seated you at the VIP table.

656
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,146
Are you still complaining?

657
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:34,381
There are a lot of guests.

658
00:38:34,406 --> 00:38:36,857
Your business is really doing well.

659
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,820
- Congrats! - Of course.

660
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:43,683
What if we look for someone Luna and Kierra can flirt with tonight?

661
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:46,878
So that we can end your dry season, girl.

662
00:38:46,903 --> 00:38:47,992
Hard pass.

663
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:51,109
How about you?

664
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,494
Oh, she’s not answering.

665
00:38:54,494 --> 00:38:55,578
Why?

666
00:38:55,603 --> 00:38:57,703
Are you saving yourself for Kalix?

667
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:00,332
Bitch, of course not!

668
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:04,170
This is taking too long.

669
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,523
I thought you guys would immediately make out in the office or something.

670
00:39:07,824 --> 00:39:09,951
Isn’t Kalix making a move on you?

671
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:17,183
Anything to get the best architect to say yes.

672
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:21,508
Seems like you took your time with having this fixed.

673
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:25,094
I couldn’t find the perfect architect to remodel the house.

674
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:30,788
I can see it! The moon looks so beautiful.

675
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:32,573
Yes,

676
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,289
beautiful.

677
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,605
What’s with that smile?

678
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,298
You remembered something.

679
00:39:42,323 --> 00:39:43,543
She remembered something.

680
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:45,503
- Hey, you’re blushing hard! - Damn, girl!

681
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:47,797
Drink a little more and you’ll spill the beans.

682
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,006
The past is in the past.

683
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:50,800
I am not going back to my ex. Never!

684
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,469
Come on, Luna, I know you.

685
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:56,031
You always hide your feelings whenever you act that way.

686
00:39:56,056 --> 00:39:58,375
- So what is it? - No, I just wanted–

687
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,652
You know what, let’s just enjoy this evening.

688
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:03,479
The night is young and so are we.

689
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:05,314
And so are we with rosy cheeks.

690
00:40:05,314 --> 00:40:06,983
Yes!

691
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:11,135
Luna, your past just walked in.

692
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:15,408
Hey!

693
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,280
Hello to him, then.

694
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:23,165
Let’s just stop with this Kalix topic.

695
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,684
Get up, let’s enjoy!

696
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:27,594
Come on! We should all dance!

697
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:29,788
- Let’s go! - Yes!

698
00:41:19,592 --> 00:41:20,634
Sam–

699
00:41:21,051 --> 00:41:22,552
Hello, Sam?

700
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:24,913
I went to the bathroom. What’s up?

701
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:26,623
We’re in the private room upstairs.

702
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:28,375
We’re just freshening up.

703
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,383
Yanna’s going home soon since Avi called her

704
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:35,406
and Arkin just called Via.

705
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:36,580
Huh?

706
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:39,859
Why are you all in the private room?

707
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:44,468
You guys are too weak, I still wanna have fun!

708
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:47,996
Okay then. Bye.

709
00:41:48,534 --> 00:41:49,578
Sir!

710
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:50,959
One more shot.

711
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:52,797
One more.

712
00:41:54,652 --> 00:41:56,054
There you go.

713
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,603
Attorney… Attorney Perez!

714
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:08,354
- Luna. - I knew it.

715
00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:09,897
You okay?

716
00:42:09,897 --> 00:42:11,107
Are you single?

717
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:12,525
- Huh? - Huh?

718
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:13,651
You’re drunk.

719
00:42:13,651 --> 00:42:14,902
Where are your friends?

720
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:18,406
Why aren’t you answering my questions?

721
00:42:19,824 --> 00:42:21,701
Yes, I’m single.

722
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:23,703
- Why? - Then let’s kiss.

723
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:25,037
- Come here. - Luna, Luna!

724
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:26,330
I– Luna! Luna!

725
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,914
I don’t wanna die yet.

726
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,405
Adi!

727
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:32,964
Is my kiss gonna kill him?

728
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:34,991
He’s such a killjoy.

729
00:42:36,632 --> 00:42:37,925
Hello…

730
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:39,405
Hi.

731
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,224
Wanna kiss?

732
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:42,680
- Sure. - Okay.

733
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,890
Let’s kiss.

734
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,851
I’m sorry, she’s with me.

735
00:42:46,851 --> 00:42:48,060
What are you doing?

736
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:49,959
Why are you butting in my business?

737
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,147
Luna, you’re drunk.

738
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:52,440
Where are your friends?

739
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,276
Why do you care? I just wanna dance.

740
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:58,154
If you’re gonna bother me, I’m gonna stop dancing. I’ll just go.

741
00:42:58,154 --> 00:43:00,453
Luna!

742
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:02,799
Luna!

743
00:43:02,824 --> 00:43:03,991
What?

744
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:06,031
Are you hitting on me?

745
00:43:07,314 --> 00:43:08,732
If yes…

746
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:11,539
so what?

747
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,257
Do you like the designs?

748
00:44:01,758 --> 00:44:04,514
I told you to design it the way you want it.

749
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:07,257
Not the way you think I want it.

750
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,897
Do you have any specific type?

751
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,022
Someone loyal and honest.

752
00:44:17,942 --> 00:44:19,443
Great.

753
00:44:19,443 --> 00:44:22,446
I think I can vouch for my nephew.

754
00:44:22,446 --> 00:44:25,157
I think you guys would be perfect together.

755
00:44:25,157 --> 00:44:27,785
This minimalist design that you got going here

756
00:44:27,785 --> 00:44:29,593
it’s just not working for me.

757
00:44:30,496 --> 00:44:32,081
I have to disagree with you, Mom.

758
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:33,741
The design is perfect.

759
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:37,405
It’s a huge improvement from the previous design of this house.

760
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:39,757
This feels more homey.

761
00:44:40,238 --> 00:44:42,115
I don’t want too big of a house and closed off

762
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,719
where family members can’t even see each other anymore.

763
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:45,991
Like ours.

764
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:48,554
I heard you resigned

765
00:44:48,657 --> 00:44:50,343
because of Miguel’s case.

766
00:44:51,018 --> 00:44:52,228
Why?

767
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,413
For you, Luna.

768
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,316
I knew it was important to you and Kierra.

769
00:44:58,316 --> 00:45:00,943
I didn’t want to disappoint you.
