1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,240
Oh my god, he’s here.

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,300
Who?

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,180
My new crush.

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,390
Stay low-key, don’t look their way.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,320
Don’t– Come on–

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,810
You like that guy from Katipunan, don’t you?

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,900
The one with Sam’s crush.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,020
You’re into him, huh?

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,360
Admit it.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,650
Yes.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,690
He’s a ten,

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,700
but so stern.

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,110
What’s your name again?

14
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,580
- Louisse Natasha Valeria. - Too long.

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,240
You can call me, “Love.”

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,080
I’ll be starting the operation–

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,910
- Hashtag - Hashtag

18
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,000
LuKal!

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,170
Lu-Lukal?

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,330
Luna and Kalix!

21
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,920
Wow, you guys have a love team already?

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
The company has been looking for somebody

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,510
who can fill up the position of Head Legal Counsel.

24
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,970
Were you able to find someone? Kalix?

25
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,830
No, I’m not ready to meet him.

26
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,720
Architect Valeria.

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,070
Architect Valeria.

28
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,490
It’s been a while.

29
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,370
Yes, almost ten years.

30
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,270
Not that I’m counting.

31
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,400
What happened to you?

32
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,470
Are you okay?

33
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,310
Nothing.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,490
Attorney Martinez, you’re early.

35
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,490
Good morning, sir.

36
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,680
I met a client nearby, so I decided to come early.

37
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,390
That’s fine.

38
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,120
Perfect timing, let’s have a chat over coffee.

39
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,760
Luna, join us.

40
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,660
No. Uhm–

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,560
As much as I would love to,

42
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,420
I still have meetings to attend to.

43
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,490
What meeting?

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,020
Do you have a new project?

45
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,610
The big project in Sta. Rosa.

46
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,500
It’s on hold for now, dear.

47
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,250
I still have to brief the new architects.

48
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,830
Let Kierra handle that.

49
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,900
This meeting is important so you need to join us. Let’s go.

50
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,990
Freshen up first then follow us, okay?

51
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,310
It's almost done.

52
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,310
Kierra: Are you okay? 15 missed calls and no answer? Wow!

53
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,780
Via: WTF Luna, what do you mean you’re going home? I have your keys!

54
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,610
Sam: Hey thry asking whwre yiu r Whwre r u?

55
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,030
Yanna: Bitch where are you someone said you left the club with a guy?! Good luck!

56
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,710
Kierra: ARE YOU REALLY NOT GONNA ANSWER ME, LOUISSE NATASHA? I’M GONNA TELL ON YOU!

57
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,800
Luna: Hey guys, I’m fine. Kalix brought me to his house. Don't be mad.

58
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,660
Wow.

59
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,510
Thank you for breakfast,

60
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,580
for the bacon, egg, and water.

61
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,720
And there’s even brewed coffee.

62
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,370
Uhm…

63
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,130
Did something happen last night?

64
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,040
I can’t remember anything.

65
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,540
You wanna know what happened?

66
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,490
I can’t hear you, it’s too loud!

67
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,070
I’m heading out, I’ll be out.

68
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,910
Are you drunk?

69
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,630
No, I'm not drunk.

70
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,930
Where are your friends?

71
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,400
Huh? I don’t know.

72
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,770
Bro, she’s too drunk.

73
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,640
Yeah, I'll go look for her friends.

74
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,060
- Where are you going? - Home!

75
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,190
Bro, follow her.

76
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,440
- Are you bringing me to my friends? - Yes.

77
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,120
Wow, such a gentleman.

78
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,160
Your head, be careful.

79
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,880
Sam, answer your phone.

80
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,980
Stop honking the car.

81
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,640
Yo bro, have you and Leo found her friends?

82
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,850
We can’t find them here in the bar.

83
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,780
Maybe they went home already.

84
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,720
Bro, better take her home.

85
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,820
All right, all right.

86
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,020
Hi.

87
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,630
Where the hell are your friends?

88
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,370
Huh? Where the hell are my–

89
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:46,250
Oh! Kierra called earlier, before I fell–

90
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,880
–for you.

91
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,220
No, she said they were going to Sam's place.

92
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Sam’s?

93
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,150
Yes, I’m going to Sam’s.

94
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,310
I’m going home to Sam’s place.

95
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,520
Me and Sam live in the same building.

96
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,310
I can take you there.

97
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,690
But are you sure they’re at Sam’s?

98
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,190
Sure.

99
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,820
As sure as I am with you.

100
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,300
Seat belt.

101
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,180
Ding-dong.

102
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,710
- Sam! - Ding-dong, ding-dong.

103
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,540
Sam! Sam, are you home?

104
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,340
Sam!

105
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,560
Luna, there’s no one here.

106
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,290
Do you have Sam’s keys?

107
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,850
You’ve been wanting a kiss since earlier.

108
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,970
Luna, keys for Sam's condo.

109
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,020
Call Sam.

110
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,780
Is that in here?

111
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,540
Sam!

112
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,530
Sam, open the door.

113
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,030
I need to go to the bathroom, I’m gonna pu–

114
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,620
Luna, don’t vomit.

115
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,610
No, don’t vomit. Don’t vomit, no.

116
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,300
Okay, all right.

117
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,680
Take it out.

118
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,250
You're good, you’re good.

119
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,940
This isn’t Sam’s bathroom.

120
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,390
It’s not Sam’s.

121
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,940
It’s my bathroom.

122
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,180
Kalix.

123
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,770
That’s bad. Why are we here? You’re naughty.

124
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,260
You are a mess.

125
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,060
A mess? I’m a beautiful mess.

126
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,330
Come on, let’s get you to bed.

127
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,580
Bed scene? We’re not even done with the bathroom scene yet.

128
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,210
We’re going for the bed scene already?

129
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,570
Gosh, Kalix.

130
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,820
Kalix, why are we in your room?

131
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,600
Come on, we can’t do this.

132
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,100
This isn’t allowed, we have to date first.

133
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,320
Luna, be quiet.

134
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,230
What the hell are you doing?

135
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,230
Huh?

136
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,440
I stink.

137
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,950
Wanna take a sniff?

138
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,570
You want?

139
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,490
Look, you can sleep here tonight just–

140
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,700
do not vomit on my bed.

141
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,960
Okay.

142
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,000
Kalix!

143
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,390
Yes?

144
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,110
Are you leaving?

145
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,630
I miss you, stay a bit.

146
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,600
Stay, come here. Come here.

147
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,430
Such a snob.

148
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,380
Sorry.

149
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,850
We're not staying at Sam’s.

150
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,940
We all agreed that

151
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,710
they'll stay over at our place.

152
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,560
I wasn’t able to change clothes?

153
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,240
Obviously not.

154
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,910
You fell asleep.

155
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,850
I didn’t touch you.

156
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,650
If that’s what you’re worried about.

157
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,690
I know how important consent is, Luna.

158
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,570
No! That’s not what I meant.

159
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,110
Uh– I was thinking maybe I did something.

160
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,580
Thanks, by the way, for taking care of me and bringing me here.

161
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, and also for the food.

162
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,380
Did I vomit a lot? You want me to clean it up?

163
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,380
No need.

164
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,460
Let me at least wash the dishes.

165
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,660
Just eat.

166
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,960
Maybe I should just take you on a date.

167
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,430
Just kidding.

168
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,890
I’ll just eat now.

169
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,610
The egg is good.

170
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,000
This guy is just perfect.

171
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,110
You were saying?

172
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,210
Ah–

173
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,920
No, nothing.

174
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,170
I was saying

175
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,220
that it’s just perfect timing for me to leave now.

176
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,220
Hmm.

177
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,850
You might say,

178
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,840
that I’m invading your privacy.

179
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,140
Since last night, actually.

180
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,560
I let myself get drunk because of you.

181
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,060
What?

182
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,720
Nothing!

183
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,650
I said you were such a snob last night.

184
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,110
You were ignoring me.

185
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,450
Who was the guy you were with last night?

186
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,660
You guys seem pretty close.

187
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,830
Ah!

188
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,460
Some guy I just met.

189
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,250
‘Cause I’m so pretty.

190
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,790
You're jealous?

191
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,100
That’s why you were ignoring me?

192
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,260
Jeez!

193
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,510
Why would I be?

194
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,720
Such a snob!

195
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,600
My bag, thank goodness you found it.

196
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,370
It was under the bed.

197
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,670
Ah…

198
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,910
Sorry, I’m such a restless sleeper.

199
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,520
I’ll just give this hoodie back later.

200
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,020
I’ll wash it first.

201
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,110
I’ll make it up to you, I promise.

202
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,380
We’ll go on a date, okay?

203
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,740
Fine.

204
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,480
I’ll go home now.

205
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,610
Come on, you don’t have to see me out.

206
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,820
Ah…

207
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,140
Okay, I’m leaving.

208
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,320
Take care, Luna.

209
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,340
Hmm?

210
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,650
Take care.

211
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,590
Of course! For you, I’ll take care of myself. Jeez!

212
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,410
The door.

213
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,220
Amazing!

214
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,350
I’m glad you thought of coming home.

215
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,390
Damn, Luna. If you’re gonna be flirting around,

216
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,850
at least let us know. Don't ignore our messages.

217
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,860
If something happens to you, what would I tell your parents?

218
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,820
What happened to you last night?

219
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,630
Do you have a hangover?

220
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,950
And–

221
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,550
Is that Kalix’s hoodie?

222
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,700
I wanna join them but my head hurts so bad.

223
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,290
I’m just glad you’re alive, Luna.

224
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,480
Don’t get mad right now, please.

225
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,090
Forgive me already, okay?

226
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,500
Whatever! You owe us an explanation.

227
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,570
Come on, start!

228
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,670
What?

229
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,470
Okay… Okay!

230
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,200
- So slow. - Summary first.

231
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,150
Okay.

232
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,510
He brought me to his condo.

233
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,760
I slept at Kalix’s place.

234
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,080
‘Cause he couldn’t find you guys.

235
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,560
- Oh, so it’s our fault now. - It was so embarrassing...

236
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,420
I puked all over his bathroom.

237
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,320
I can’t tell if you were really embarrassed.

238
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,360
You seem giddy about it.

239
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,240
Fuck! Go into detail. Get to the exciting part.

240
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,950
Nothing.

241
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,040
- Nothing my ass! - Nothing?

242
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,250
Nothing, really! But that– that’s Kalix’s jacket.

243
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,330
- Nothing happened. - You fucker.

244
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,250
I’m serious, he even said–

245
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,000
“I know how important consent is.”

246
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,700
- See? - Oh my god!

247
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,260
Oh my god, green flag.

248
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,140
- Right? - So, what?

249
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,310
Are you in love with him?

250
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,270
We’re still in the “talking stage.”

251
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,980
But you know what? Kalix is a catch.

252
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,150
So I won’t be surprised if you fall for him.

253
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,230
Me too.

254
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,300
But you seem to have a lot of rivals.

255
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,400
You know what?

256
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,240
Just move on from that talking stage.

257
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,780
- Go all the way. - All the way!

258
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,740
Stop! That’s too much!

259
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,070
Can’t we just enjoy how things are right now?

260
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,990
We’re enjoying this.

261
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,460
Let’s get to the sad part next time.

262
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,750
By the end of all this.

263
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,770
And–

264
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,260
I gotta take a bath now. I really stink.

265
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,880
Yes, glad to know you’re aware.

266
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,470
- So that was it. - Come and eat first.

267
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,310
Kalix: message me when you’re home.

268
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,720
What is it?!

269
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,140
- What is it?! - Luna...

270
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,850
What is it?!

271
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,790
Nothing… It’s nothing, I just feel so gorgeous–

272
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,900
- Hey! - Oh! What? Why?

273
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,230
You’re blocking my gorgeousness.

274
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,070
Bitch! You little slut!

275
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,070
Keep it up! You better not fail.

276
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,660
Raise your skirt up more.

277
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,080
Kalix: are you home?

278
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,570
Look at him following up on me when I didn't response.

279
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,300
Luna: sorry for the late reply!

280
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,700
Luna: I just showered.

281
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,900
Luna: yup, i’m home now :)

282
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,010
Kalix: K

283
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,400
Luna: miss me already?

284
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,620
Kalix: *seen*

285
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,910
Kalix: *typing*

286
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,200
Huh?

287
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,670
Was I just ignored?

288
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,700
Amethyst...

289
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,790
Who is this girl?

290
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,160
Studying but busy taking photos?

291
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,960
Lots of time in your hands, huh?

292
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,890
Here, have some snack.

293
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,070
Is there something wrong?

294
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,880
Look at this.

295
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,360
Do you think they’re together?

296
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,490
They look like they’re just friends.

297
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,880
- I'm not sure. - Friends?

298
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,110
They’re always together.

299
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,580
So? We’re always together, too. But–

300
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,220
we’re just friends.

301
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,590
Hmm, point taken.

302
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,600
I should just ask to be sure, right?

303
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,930
You can!

304
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,050
Or, you can just ask his friends.

305
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,680
Why do you even have a crush on him anyway?

306
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,670
Good question.

307
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,790
You wanna know why he’s my crush?

308
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,160
He’s hot.

309
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,350
He’s tall too and really smart.

310
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,600
You know when I got drunk,

311
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,310
he took care of me and even brought me to his place.

312
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,020
- Really? - Yes.

313
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,920
So I know that he’s a good guy.

314
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,220
That should be expected.

315
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,010
If you’re a decent guy,

316
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,520
you would never take advantage of a drunk woman in a bar.

317
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,640
You’re right.

318
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,960
That should be the norm, right?

319
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,860
And that’s why you’re my friend, Sevi.

320
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,260
You set better standards for guys.

321
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,800
Especially since you’re the team captain.

322
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,390
No to toxic masculinity.

323
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,390
Hey, it’s your crush.

324
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,200
Sevi, do I look good?

325
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,290
Do I have dirt on my face? Am I pretty?

326
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,710
You look like a zombie.

327
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,790
Huh?

328
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,250
Hi, Kalix! Glad to see you here.

329
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,430
This is my friend, Sevi.

330
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,680
Sevi, this is Kalix.

331
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,140
Uhm, my friend.

332
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,000
Hey bro, Sevi.

333
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,750
You’re Sevi.

334
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,960
Luna, I’ll go ahead.

335
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,030
We still have practice.

336
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,420
Okay, take care! Thanks for the snack.

337
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,570
Are you close with him?

338
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,050
With Sevi? Yes.

339
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,960
We’ve been close since high school.

340
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,500
What are you doing here?

341
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,840
I thought you were studying in the library?

342
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,690
How did you know I was there?

343
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,820
Wild guess.

344
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,300
So why are you here? Are your friends in Dapitan?

345
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,840
I came here to see you.

346
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,750
Me?

347
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,880
Why?

348
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,340
You still haven’t returned my hoodie.

349
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,010
Oh…

350
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,790
You came here just for your hoodie?

351
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,110
You’re really making an effort.

352
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,870
Wanna get it from my condo?

353
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,510
I’ll cook dinner for you.

354
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,530
Don’t worry, Kierra’s there. I’m not gonna do anything to you.

355
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,720
Kidding! Only if you want to. If not, then maybe next time.

356
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,720
You know how to cook?

357
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,820
Of course!

358
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,180
I’m multi-talented, Kalix.

359
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,000
Okay then.

360
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,490
- Okay? - Let’s go.

361
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,530
Okay!

362
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,570
All right!

363
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,670
Let’s go!

364
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,080
Just feel at home. Don’t be shy.

365
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,710
Ke?

366
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,080
Ke!

367
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,610
I’m home.

368
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,450
Ke?

369
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,950
- Luna? - Where are you?

370
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,370
I’m with my groupmates. We’re still finishing up our plates. What’s up?

371
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,620
Kalix and I are here.

372
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,680
I thought you were here in the condo.

373
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,130
What time are you coming home?

374
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,610
I might be home late. Hey! Flirt responsibly.

375
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,520
All right, take care.

376
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,240
Ke will be home late.

377
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,790
That's an invasion of privacy.

378
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,140
I’m not intruding, you invited me here.

379
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,520
Just kidding! Come on.

380
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,910
Well, is it good?

381
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,620
You made this?

382
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,160
Yes, this too. Pretty, right?

383
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,980
It’s great.

384
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,860
You don't need to flatter me.

385
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,370
No.

386
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,400
You should design my house.

387
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,330
Really?

388
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,810
Mhmm. Okay then.

389
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,600
Someday, if you'll hire me

390
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,420
I'll give you a discount.

391
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,330
I’ll take note of that.

392
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,780
Wanna know what else you should take note of?

393
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,270
I’m really good at…

394
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,510
I’m really good at cooking! Come on.

395
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,920
I’ll just prepare the food and change clothes.

396
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,380
Don’t miss me too much.

397
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,220
Kidding!

398
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,990
Eat well.

399
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,210
Thank you.

400
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,260
Here you go.

401
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,180
Thank you.

402
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,600
Taste it.

403
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,380
Well?

404
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,820
Is it good?

405
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,150
It’s okay.

406
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,160
Huh? What do you mean, it's okay?

407
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,680
This is delicious.

408
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,290
This is my specialty.

409
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,580
Yes, it’s good.

410
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,350
Why couldn’t you just admit it?

411
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,720
Wait, let’s get to know each other.

412
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,540
What do you want to know?

413
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,600
Why do you want to be a lawyer?

414
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,700
Do you want to be a corporate lawyer or a criminal lawyer?

415
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,790
I’m fine with both.

416
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,070
You can’t have both, don’t go two-timing now.

417
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,410
Just pick one.

418
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,230
Criminal lawyer, as of now.

419
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,840
Wow! Why do you want to be a criminal lawyer?

420
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,140
So I can get you out of jail.

421
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,150
Don’t be silly!

422
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,140
I’m an angel. Look at me.

423
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,090
With that mouth of yours, I doubt.

424
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,900
Gosh!

425
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,640
Now, let's talk about your personal life.

426
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,930
Are you in a relationship?

427
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,180
What?

428
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,410
Are you into someone right now?

429
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,700
You’re quite focused on your studies.

430
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,820
I’m just curious if you’re in a relationship now

431
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,400
or if you have any past relationships.

432
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,540
All flings but nothing serious.

433
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,140
Let’s just not talk about that.

434
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,330
Do you have a crush on Amethyst?

435
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,820
I do not have a crush on Amy

436
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,030
or on anyone else, Luna.

437
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,490
Too bad.

438
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,140
What?

439
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,530
I actually thought you would be in a relationship soon.

440
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,830
I was willing to be your wingman.

441
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,160
Aren’t you interested?

442
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,370
Hey!

443
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,210
Let me do that. Come on.

444
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,110
Let me.

445
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,550
Look, I have to go.

446
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,370
Thanks for the dinner.

447
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,660
Huh? Are you mad?

448
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,830
You’re confusing me, Luna.

449
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,870
Luna: Ke! Come with me! Please!

450
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,960
Kierra: How did you even have a lovers’ quarrel?!

451
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,790
Luna: No idea! I just asked him if he had a crush on Amethyst. Then he just walked out!

452
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,960
Kierra: Come on, Luna! Why did you even ask that? Isn’t it obvious?

453
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,550
Kierra: Kalix has been making moves on you!

454
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,590
Luna: Idk Ke… I just don’t understand Kalix. Sometimes he’s sweet, sometimes he's cold.

455
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,050
Luna: He has this huge wall around him! But I seriously wanna break that wall.

456
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,010
Kierra: You’re in too deep! It’s the thrill of the chase.

457
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,350
Kierra: Since it’s your first time chasing after someone!

458
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,190
Luna: So come with me pleaseeee

459
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,150
Relax, Luna.

460
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,220
Kalix usually comes here around this time, so just wait.

461
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,280
What do you call a plant that goes to the bathroom?

462
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,740
- What? - Toilet-“trees.”

463
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,820
She said relax, not get stunned.

464
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,550
It’s Kalix.

465
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,910
Kalix is here, don’t look! Don’t look their way!

466
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,250
I just said, don’t look their way!

467
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,590
Don’t look.

468
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,970
You came all the way here just to avoid him? Don’t be stupid.

469
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,520
He might think that I went here to see him.

470
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,230
But that's the truth, right?

471
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:23,410
Yes, but let's just pretend that you’re the reason why I'm here.

472
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,710
Just so I can still keep my pride.

473
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,990
You know, Luna…

474
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,960
You better get your ass moving.

475
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,340
A lot of people here on campus have a crush on Kalix.

476
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,950
Everytime we have a school event, Kalix gets the most flowers.

477
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,370
So, if you’re still playing hard to get,

478
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,530
someone else will get him first.

479
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,750
It’s your chance, talk to him.

480
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,220
You can do it. Follow us.

481
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,550
Breathe in…

482
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,450
breathe out.

483
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,560
- Okay! - Okay? Okay.

484
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,600
- Okay, go. - Okay.

485
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,560
- Go on now. - You can do it!

486
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,470
May I have a chicken shawarma?

487
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,390
Thank you.

488
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,740
Hey! You’re here.

489
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,620
Wha– wow!

490
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,790
What a… coincidence!

491
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,220
We came here to visit Sam.

492
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,100
H-have you been here long?

493
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,790
What are you buying?

494
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,190
W-water!

495
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,300
Water.

496
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,720
Miss, I’ll get this water, please.

497
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,650
I see.

498
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,350
Well…

499
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,500
It’s just so hot, so we need another bottle.

500
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,130
Okay, I’ll go back now.

501
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,010
Let’s just go home. I don’t want this, I can’t talk to him anymore.

502
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,570
What happened now?

503
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,640
Really? After my pep talk?

504
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,000
It’s just so embarrassing, my pride is hurt.

505
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,970
I didn’t even do anything wrong.

506
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,450
Come on, I just asked a question. And now he’s with Amethyst.

507
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,760
He’s also with Leo and Adonis.

508
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,810
I’m done. I'm never gonna speak with him.

509
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,860
If he doesn’t wanna talk, then fine with me.

510
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,190
Your water.

511
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,280
You forgot it.

512
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,440
Thank you.

513
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,510
Can I sit here?

514
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,390
Of course.

515
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,420
Yes. Sure, Kalix.

516
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,040
Yes.

517
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,380
Ke, I need to buy something.

518
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,630
Will you come with me?

519
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,050
Sure, come on.

520
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,630
We’ll go ahead guys, okay?

521
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,300
We’ll be back.

522
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,010
Enjoy!

523
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,500
Is it okay with your friends to just leave them?

524
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,820
They’re grown ups, they can function without me.

525
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,250
So…

526
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,030
About last night–

527
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,540
What were you saying about being confused?

528
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,220
Confused with what?

529
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,180
Nothing.

530
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,610
What do you mean?

531
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,180
Let’s talk about it some other time.

532
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,660
Hey!

533
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,070
We’re going to the coffee shop to study, do you wanna join us?

534
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,410
You guys go ahead.

535
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,210
Well, if you change your mind, text me so I can order your usual.

536
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,030
Stop glaring at her.

537
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,460
Huh?

538
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,470
Glaring?

539
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,540
I’m not glaring at her.

540
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:14,970
All right.

541
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,290
So, you’re not gonna join them?

542
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,650
You ask too many questions.

543
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,060
I know you just want to be with me.

544
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,320
Did you miss me?

545
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,290
Come on, let’s study together.

546
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,480
I can’t today. I have some errands to run.

547
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,420
I’ll pick you up tomorrow at your school.

548
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,320
Okay!

549
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,540
It's not a problem. See, I don't have to ask you.

550
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,730
I know you just really missed me.

551
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,100
That’s all for today. Class dismissed.

552
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,050
- Bye, ma’am. - Bye!

553
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,250
- Ke! - Yes?

554
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,270
Help me apply eyeliner, hurry.

555
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,720
Such a flirt. You’re just gonna study with Kalix,

556
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,100
why would you need an eyeliner?

557
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,430
Can you make it winged?

558
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,290
You even want it winged!

559
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,900
Of course. Just because we’re studying doesn’t mean I’m not gonna flaunt it.

560
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,640
I still have to be pretty, especially I’m with my happy crush.

561
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,050
Glad that you and Kalix are good now.

562
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,750
Why did he even sulk anyway?

563
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,870
Just because you asked about Amethyst?

564
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,560
He didn’t tell me.

565
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,090
He doesn’t want to talk about it.

566
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Maybe he’s just not ready to open up about his personal life.

567
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,590
Didn’t you say his wall was way high?

568
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,320
Maybe it takes time to know people like them.

569
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,910
Yes, I know.

570
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,800
But you can’t blame me

571
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,730
for asking about his relationship status

572
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,710
or if he’s seeing someone else.

573
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,180
For me, a good relationship is built on honesty.

574
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,230
So, as early as now I might as well ask about him and Amethyst.

575
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,120
I’m just being careful, you know.

576
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,140
Then this is the right time to get to know Kalix.

577
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,540
You should really observe mysterious guys like him.

578
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,200
They’re the perfect example for “actions speak louder than words.”

579
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,640
So what are Kalix’s actions telling you?

580
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,280
I’m not actually sure.

581
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,640
It’s Kalix!

582
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,420
Hello, Kalix.

583
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,780
Hello, Luna?

584
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,550
I just have an emergency.

585
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,500
So, should we just cancel today?

586
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,330
No, we can still study later.

587
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,600
I just have to pick up someone.

588
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,450
- Someone’s joining us? - Yes.

589
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,700
Can you meet me at the restaurant instead?

590
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,560
I’ll text you the address.

591
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,150
Okay.

592
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,020
All right, see you.

593
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,120
Sure, bye.

594
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,770
Darn it!

595
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,710
I thought I could finally spend time alone with Kalix.

596
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,670
- He’s bringing someone. - Who?

597
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,790
I don’t know.

598
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,170
Oh well.

599
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,340
Maybe it’s just Adonis or Leo.

600
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,670
Don’t get ahead of yourself.

601
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,630
What’s important is that you get to spend time with your crush.

602
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,260
Let the other one become the third wheel.

603
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:11,210
YOLO, you only flirt once with someone for the first time.

604
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,390
Just savor the moments you have.

605
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,330
Will you finish this?

606
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,810
You talk too much.

607
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,690
- Make it pretty. - Then stop moving.

608
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,540
I wonder who he picked up...

609
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,540
Oh my god!

610
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,380
Is he your younger brother?

611
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,830
Kio, this is Luna. Say hi.

612
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,970
Hi!

613
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,820
Hello, Kio! How are you?

614
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,270
I’m okay.

615
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,660
Is Kio your nickname?

616
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,150
My name is Kian Oliver.

617
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,550
You're so cute!

618
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,960
I had no idea who you were picking up, I thought I'll be jealous.

619
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,430
Hey, I’m sorry I asked you to meet me here last minute.

620
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,890
There was no one home.

621
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,270
It’s okay.

622
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,820
Kio, do you want to eat?

623
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,880
Yes.

624
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,330
Come on, let’s eat.

625
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,610
Sit here.

626
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,230
How was school?

627
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,460
It’s okay.

628
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,620
It’s okay?

629
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,780
Waiter? The menu please.

630
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,680
Eat this.

631
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,870
Where is the cake?

632
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,190
You have to eat a proper meal first.

633
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,710
But I want the cake.

634
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,030
Kio…

635
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,910
Oh no.

636
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,310
Kio’s sulking now.

637
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,410
Kio.

638
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,000
Maybe we should just ask for the cake?

639
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,210
Don’t spoil him.

640
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,910
He should learn how to wait.

641
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,660
Kio, hey.

642
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,800
You trust me, right?

643
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,520
Then I promise you, you’ll eat the cake.

644
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,760
But first you have to eat this.

645
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,020
Okay?

646
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,730
Okay.

647
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,630
Yes? All right, good.

648
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,790
Waiter? Water, please. Thank you.

649
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,930
You’ll finish all of it, right?

650
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,070
Yes.

651
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,980
Okay, very good.

652
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,730
Is he your son, sir?

653
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,110
So cute!

654
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,640
No. He’s my brother.

655
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,770
Oh, sorry.

656
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,720
You and your girlfriend look cute together too.

657
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,010
She said we’re cute together.

658
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,340
I think we'd make cute babies together.

659
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,360
Right?

660
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,220
Eat.

661
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,560
With everyone that I joke with,

662
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,890
you’re the only one who doesn’t respond.

663
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,680
Is it really that corny?

664
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,070
Joke.

665
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,970
You joke a lot.

666
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,930
Then let’s just make it real.

667
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,450
Why are you looking at me like that?

668
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,350
Just eat.

669
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,810
Fine, I’ll eat now.

670
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,570
How’s the chicken, Kio?

671
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,810
It’s okay.

672
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,540
Kio’s so cute.

673
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,570
Are you close with him?

674
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,850
He still wants to be with you even after we brought him home.

675
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,230
Yes.

676
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,530
He says I’m his favorite brother.

677
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,980
Favorite brother? But you’re his only brother.

678
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,510
That’s right.

679
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,870
He’s such a jokester.

680
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,820
Don’t you miss him since you just go home every other weekend?

681
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,490
I do miss him.

682
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,440
But I prefer staying at the condo rather than at the house.

683
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,590
I need my freedom.

684
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,680
You know, with siblings,

685
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,450
it’s quite uncommon to be close to each other when you have a big age gap.

686
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,790
You and Kio look so cute together.

687
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,890
He’s like my

688
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,210
tiny best friend.

689
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,320
Mom and Dad are always so busy.

690
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,310
So is my big sister.

691
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,780
Growing up, I always felt alone

692
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,150
and I don’t want Kio to feel the same way.

693
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,280
So that’s why I try to do my best to be there for him. All the time.

694
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,620
Thank you for dinner. I had fun.

695
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,000
Me too.

696
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,350
Kio seems to like you.

697
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,140
Really?

698
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,220
I like Kio, too.

699
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,070
Kalix.

700
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,670
Yes?

701
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,370
I think…

702
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,850
I like you.

703
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,330
Excuse me, sir. Here’s your order.

704
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,180
- Thank you. - You’re welcome, sir.

705
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,320
So, I heard you topped the bar?

706
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,790
Yes, I guess I did.

707
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,040
Good for you.

708
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,380
Thank you.

709
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,090
And now you have your own law firm?

710
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,860
I’m really impressed, Attorney Martinez.

711
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,510
Blood, sweat, and tears, ma’am.

712
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,700
Hard work pays off.

713
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,670
Luna,

714
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,230
are you okay?

715
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,500
Yes, mom! Of course.

716
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,740
Why wouldn’t I?

717
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,130
So, I hope you guys are ready to work together.

718
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,660
No problem with me, sir.

719
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,110
I’m very much looking forward to working with Architect Valeria.

720
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,170
Good.

721
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,890
I hope you feel the same way.

722
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,110
Of course, Attorney Martinez.

723
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,650
I am beyond thrilled to work with you.

724
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,360
Kalix: Are you free tomorrow? Let’s study.

725
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,590
Ke won’t be able to come home.

726
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,650
She said there's flood on the road going home.

727
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,770
Is it okay if I spend the night here?

728
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,830
Hurry up! He’s in the parking lot.

729
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,860
Are you picking me up?

730
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,590
I really came here to see you.

731
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,600
We didn’t know you’re here.

732
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,390
I’m sorry, are we interrupting something?

733
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,020
I’m Amethyst, by the way. I don’t think we’ve met yet.

734
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,630
Kalix.

735
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:43,640
Do you still think about our first night together?

736
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,510
My parents just texted,

737
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,890
they’re asking me to go home.

738
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,470
It's supposed to be just a happy crush.

739
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,240
Why am I feeling this way?
