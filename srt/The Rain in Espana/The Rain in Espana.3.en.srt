1
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,724
Amazing!

2
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,268
I’m glad you thought of coming home.

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,478
Don’t get mad right now, please.

4
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,646
Okay? Forgive me already.

5
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,898
Whatever, you owe us an explanation.

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,233
Okay… Okay!

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,527
He brought me to his condo.

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,738
I slept at Kalix’s place.

9
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,615
I puked all over his bathroom.

10
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,619
Look at this.

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,371
Do you think they’re together?

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,125
They look like they’re just friends.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,207
I'm not sure.

14
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,531
They’re always together.

15
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:45,726
So? We’re always together, too. But–

16
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:47,223
Hi, Kalix!

17
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:50,573
Ah, this is Sevi, my friend.

18
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:52,600
Sevi, this is Kalix.

19
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,304
Hey bro, Sevi.

20
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:57,539
You’re Sevi.

21
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,282
- Are you in a relationship? - What?

22
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:04,434
Do you have a crush on Amethyst?

23
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:06,106
I have to go.

24
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:07,714
Thanks for the dinner.

25
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,960
Why? Are you mad?

26
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:12,164
You’re confusing me, Luna.

27
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:15,317
A good relationship is built on honesty.

28
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:19,430
So, that’s why as early as now, I might as well ask about him and Amethyst.

29
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:21,802
Kalix.

30
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:25,281
I like you already.

31
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,150
Ke, I’m about to leave the condo.

32
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:03,468
Huh? You’re still in the condo?

33
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,726
Yes, why?

34
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,769
Oh, nothing. It’s just that–

35
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,608
Surprise!!!

36
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,402
I missed you!

37
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,279
I missed you, too!

38
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,864
I missed you, Sam!

39
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,158
Hey! It’s been so long.

40
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,164
You should have told me that they're coming for dinner.

41
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,207
I'm not prepared.

42
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,544
Wow! You call this unprepared?

43
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,837
Hey!

44
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,022
Pre-game first.

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,340
Wine from Spain.

46
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,674
Woohoo! You know it!

47
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,967
Let's settle down.

48
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:41,037
Besides, it won’t be a surprise if we told you.

49
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:42,438
Don’t you have a shoot today?

50
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:45,308
It got canceled, but I was already out of my house

51
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,144
so I asked the girls if they’re free for a surprise visit.

52
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,189
Yes, the timing's perfect. I just got off my last flight this morning.

53
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,358
You know how the life of a flight attendant is,

54
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,318
it’s so hard to find time.

55
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,222
I’ve been awake since morning.

56
00:03:58,247 --> 00:03:59,322
Still jet-lagged?

57
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:03,309
Yes, I still haven’t adjusted. But–

58
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,795
That’s okay. What’s important is…

59
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:09,374
- We’re all together, finally! - That’s right!

60
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:14,379
Welcome back home, our architect from Spain.

61
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,880
Yes!

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,049
But, first order of business–

63
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,218
What’s up? I heard you have some news.

64
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,804
Oh my god, seriously you guys.

65
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,724
Did you all just come here to gossip? Can’t we have dinner first or something?

66
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,119
We’re not hungry yet. Spill the tea first!

67
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:32,959
Wow, such a deep sigh.

68
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,290
I want to resign.

69
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,374
Bitch, how?

70
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:40,010
What’s the issue? Is it because of work or is it about your past?

71
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:45,216
It’s crazy ‘cause it feels like the universe is playing tricks on me, you know?

72
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:48,300
It’s been years since I last saw Kalix, right?

73
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,280
Now, everywhere I go

74
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:54,017
no matter how I evade, I still bump into him.

75
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:56,186
Why? What happened?

76
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,270
¿Por qué?

77
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,111
This is what happened…

78
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:13,135
Let me help you.

79
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:21,431
Do you need help with that?

80
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:23,987
No.

81
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:26,613
Why are you here early?

82
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:29,761
The early bird catches the worm.

83
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:30,767
Right?

84
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:37,394
I have an early meeting and I have to review some documents.

85
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,902
Okay.

86
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,794
But this is what I couldn't stand–

87
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,737
I went to Dad’s office.

88
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:50,615
When I opened the door, guess who I saw?

89
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:53,752
Maybe he was there for a project?

90
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:56,413
Girl, do you know what they were talking about?

91
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:58,596
I don’t think you can beat me in golf.

92
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:03,665
Well, I just started but smy skills are pretty good.

93
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:07,338
Skills, you say? I’ll set our game.

94
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,234
Are you all right with that?

95
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,468
Deal.

96
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:16,182
It’s just so annoying that it feels like

97
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:18,560
he’s invading my personal space, you know what I mean?

98
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,771
He has his own office, so why can’t he just stay there?

99
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:23,023
Relax, come on.

100
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:25,275
Maybe he was there for a meeting.

101
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:28,961
Besides, you never told us the reason why you guys broke up.

102
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:33,074
Right! You just said that you both can’t focus on your studies.

103
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:36,202
Look at them now, they’re all in for the both of you to work together.

104
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:39,956
Come on, I don’t really need to tell it all in detail.

105
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:42,333
I don’t wanna relive the pain again.

106
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,517
Besides, it's emotionally draining.

107
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:48,321
And I don’t believe Dad actually needs him all the time.

108
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:51,681
Maybe he’s actually going there just to see you.

109
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:57,911
Bitch! He doesn’t need anything from me.

110
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:01,244
He seems happy, now that he has moved on.

111
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:04,481
The type who has forgotten everything that happened in the past.

112
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:07,567
Is that bitterness I’m sensing?

113
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,861
What bitterness?

114
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:13,135
Of course, not. Besides, I don’t care about him anymore.

115
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,827
You know, I just don’t want to feel the way I felt back then

116
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:20,205
when I was cheated on. It really hurts.

117
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,751
I guess that’s just the way it is.

118
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:26,713
The person on the receiving end

119
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,588
is always gonna remember what happened.

120
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:32,133
While the person who caused the pain, tends to just forget about it.

121
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,431
It’s so unfair.

122
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:39,015
Luna, do you still like Kalix?

123
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,291
- I think you still do. - No!

124
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:42,817
- Of course not. - You don’t?

125
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,291
I don’t! I really don’t. All I feel for him is anger.

126
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:49,567
Hey, calm down.

127
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,069
We know how pissed you are.

128
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,431
You know what? This wine is actually good for the heart.

129
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,865
Cheers!

130
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:57,450
- Cheers! - Cheers!

131
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,827
Cheers!

132
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:08,549
The ground should just open up and swallow me.

133
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:13,037
I am so embarrassed. I don’t know why I did it.

134
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:15,369
Calm down, its okay.

135
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,062
What happened anyway?

136
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:19,889
Okay, this is what happened…

137
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:23,966
I think…

138
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:27,558
I like you already.

139
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,793
Just kidding.

140
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,693
Did you actually believe me?

141
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:01,713
You know I like making jokes.

142
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:14,306
I'm not feeling well.

143
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:18,184
Maybe we should reschedule our study session.

144
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,993
I’ll just go home.

145
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:28,346
You sure?

146
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,125
You gotta rest.

147
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:47,936
So there! I actually got a stiff neck just to avoid facing him.

148
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:52,607
Besides from not saying “I like you” back, he didn’t even have any reactions at all.

149
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:56,736
I really have no idea why I did it, it’s so embarrassing!

150
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:59,364
You said you like him then you say it was just a joke?

151
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:01,699
That’s weak, Luna. You shouldn’t have taken it back.

152
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:03,576
Well, he didn’t have any reactions.

153
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:06,996
Of course, I just turned it into a joke ‘cause I was so ashamed.

154
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,873
This is weak.

155
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:10,924
You shouldn’t have stepped back.

156
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,853
If you were firm, we wouldn’t be having this problem.

157
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:14,760
She’s not like you.

158
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:17,465
Kalix’s actions are really confusing.

159
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:21,261
Based on her stories, it really seems like Kalix is into her, right?

160
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,929
But why didn’t he say, "I like you too"?

161
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:23,805
- Right? - Yes.

162
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:26,266
Isn’t he really confusing?

163
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:27,600
But wait–

164
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,229
Maybe he’s also confused with your actions.

165
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:34,732
Maybe he wasn’t sure if you were serious or not, right?

166
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:35,817
My goodness!

167
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:38,736
Let’s just stop talking about these boys.

168
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:41,781
This night is ours. Okay?

169
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,741
Let’s cheers!

170
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,201
Okay, fine.

171
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,787
Cheers!

172
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:57,755
- Okay, stand up. - You sure you can manage?

173
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,632
- Of course. I can take care of this. - Take care, okay?

174
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:01,384
Are you sure you guys will be okay?

175
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:04,082
- I’ll be fine, I’ll carry her home. - Hey, Yanna, your skirt!

176
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:06,556
Hey! My skirt’s just right here.

177
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:07,640
Hey!

178
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,601
- Careful! - It’s okay.

179
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:13,229
Left, right, left, okay.

180
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:15,273
- Take care! - Buh-bye!

181
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:16,858
Hey!

182
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,484
Bye!

183
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:19,910
Okay, let’s go home.

184
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:26,020
Kalix hasn’t texted me.

185
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:32,040
I know I’m not his girlfriend and I shouldn't be expecting his message–

186
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,363
but it still pisses me off that he hasn’t reached out to me yet.

187
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,129
Let me check his socials.

188
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,516
Maybe he really doesn’t like me.

189
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:51,142
Maybe he’s ignoring me because I keep making jokes.

190
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:52,852
What do you think, Ke?

191
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:54,824
Hey!

192
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:57,106
Who’s that “M?”

193
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:58,816
Nothing, no one.

194
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,693
Me-members. Group members.

195
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:01,944
- Nothing, no one? - We were just joking around.

196
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:05,615
That smile is giving you away, you flirt. I know that smile.

197
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:09,577
Kalix: you free tomorrow? let’s study.

198
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,207
- Oh? Wha– what happened to you? - Ke!

199
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,250
Why are you suddenly shrieking? Sit down.

200
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,754
Lord, thank you! Thank you.

201
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:23,257
Luna: Kalix, you still coming today? Looks like it’s gonna rain.

202
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:25,065
Kalix: Yes. It’s just the rain. I can handle it.

203
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,512
Luna: Okay :)

204
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:30,431
Kalix: And I already made this

205
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:32,016
Luna: Omg you cooked? That looks good! What is it?

206
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:33,309
Kalix: Shrimp Marinara with homemade pasta.

207
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:35,686
Kalix: It’s decent.

208
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:38,856
Luna: Perfect, I’m kinda hangry.

209
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,567
Kalix: You look so pretty for someone who’s hangry.

210
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:44,332
Kalix: On my way now.

211
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:45,608
Luna: Take care!

212
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,264
Don’t look at this.

213
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:54,650
But it’s good.

214
00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:56,836
It’s not finished yet.

215
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,891
Look at this instead. Go ahead, give your compliments.

216
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:02,231
Pretty, right?

217
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:04,376
- You made that? - Yes.

218
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:06,997
This is my dream house.

219
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,198
This is my driving force to do good in school.

220
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,159
Someday I want–

221
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,537
to build this with my hard-earned money.

222
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:18,664
I just have a simple dream.

223
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:21,667
To be a successful architect, just like my parents.

224
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:25,864
And to live a comfortable life with my family.

225
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,819
Have you always wanted to be an architect?

226
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:33,806
Yes. I really want to.

227
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,624
When I was young…

228
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,468
my parents would have clients

229
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:41,305
and then they would bring me to the site once the project is completed.

230
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,667
The family would be there and they would see their new house.

231
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:50,421
You could really see their happiness,

232
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:52,256
that’s the feeling I like.

233
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:55,634
To be able to provide happiness to others.

234
00:14:57,511 --> 00:14:58,846
That’s good.

235
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:03,392
It’s really nice, actually.

236
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:06,311
At least your dreams are in sync with your parents.

237
00:15:07,312 --> 00:15:10,065
Why, aren’t yours the same?

238
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:17,698
If you don’t want to talk about it, it’s okay.

239
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:20,617
No pressure, okay? No pressure.

240
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,335
They want me to become a doctor.

241
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,088
Especially my mom.

242
00:15:36,008 --> 00:15:39,011
Good thing they’re okay with you taking Law.

243
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:43,561
Not really.

244
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:46,844
We made a deal,

245
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:50,414
I have to keep my grades up and be in the dean’s list every single semester

246
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:53,066
or else, she’ll send me to med school.

247
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:56,307
That’s hard.

248
00:15:57,446 --> 00:15:58,464
Yeah.

249
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:04,286
There’s constant high pressure and expectations.

250
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:09,282
It’s like, I can’t even make a single mistake or I’ll lose everything.

251
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:14,638
You know what, Kalix?

252
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:16,916
You’re doing well.

253
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:21,683
Just don’t forget to rest

254
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:24,556
so that you’ll have energy next time.

255
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:56,797
Kierra: I'll just stay here at Tanya’s dorm. The rain is so strong, España is already flooded!

256
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:59,841
Ke can't come home.

257
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,118
Roads on the way here are already flooded.

258
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,565
I don’t think the rain will stop anytime soon.

259
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:16,441
It’s dangerous to leave, Kalix.

260
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:19,112
Do you want to stay here for the meantime until the rain subsides?

261
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,032
Let me check socials. Then let’s see.

262
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:29,079
See, the roads have been closed.

263
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,957
You pass through here, right?

264
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:39,502
Is it okay if I spend the night here?

265
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,589
I’ll sleep on the couch.

266
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,165
Of course, it’s okay.

267
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:50,511
But, I don’t think you’ll fit in the couch. You're too tall.

268
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:54,521
How about this…

269
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:59,769
You stay in my room. I’ll stay in Ke’s room.

270
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:13,127
Ke’s room is locked.

271
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,951
You know what, it’s fine. Look, I’ll just drive home.

272
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,673
Come on, Kalix, it's not safe.

273
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:23,467
You might end up stranded.

274
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:26,417
Let’s just do this...

275
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:30,387
Let’s just sleep together in my room so that we’re both comfortable.

276
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,402
Are you sure?

277
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:38,325
I won’t do anything to you, Kalix.

278
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:43,695
Let me just fix the room.

279
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,379
I’m sorry. I usually sleep on this side

280
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:56,863
I'm not used to sleep on that side.

281
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:01,463
Don’t worry, I’ll put this here in the middle so that you’re safe.

282
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:03,548
Lights on, lights off?

283
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:05,008
Any.

284
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:07,177
I can’t really sleep with the lights on.

285
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:08,720
Could you turn it off?

286
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,530
Hey! Put a blanket. It’s cold.

287
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,156
Move closer here.

288
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:30,909
It’s okay.

289
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,870
Don’t you feel uncomfortable in your position?

290
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,747
Maybe, just turn towards me.

291
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,712
Just sleep, Luna.

292
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:47,175
Kalix.

293
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:48,589
Hey!

294
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,304
Hey, Kalix!

295
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:56,116
He fell asleep.

296
00:19:57,227 --> 00:19:59,229
Now I can’t stare at him.

297
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:02,691
Hey, Kalix!

298
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,019
Good night, Luna.

299
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,300
Good night, Kalix.

300
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:51,262
Hurry up! He’s in the parking lot.

301
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:07,458
Wow, you went all the way here– fourteen kilometers from your school to my school.

302
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,630
Are you picking me up?

303
00:22:10,443 --> 00:22:11,570
I don’t know.

304
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:12,980
Maybe.

305
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,894
I really came here to see you.

306
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,269
Hop in.

307
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:23,790
Okay, thank you!

308
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:26,706
Take care.

309
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:43,560
Kalix: Done stalking?

310
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:51,443
Luna: Huh? I am not!

311
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:59,200
You like milkshakes?

312
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,744
Yes. How about you?

313
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:02,037
I love milkshakes.

314
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:03,914
Ah, perfect!

315
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,283
We’re a perfect match.

316
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:06,374
Out of milkshakes?

317
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:08,835
Yes! We really are a perfect match.

318
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:13,095
Luna: I accidentally liked it. Hehe.

319
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:16,343
Kalix: that’s the only picture you liked.

320
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,727
Luna: and so?!

321
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:29,356
Kalix: it means you only like me when my shirt’s off.

322
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:36,626
Perfect! There you go.

323
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:39,028
Now I have something to post when we become official.

324
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,313
Are we gonna be official?

325
00:23:43,074 --> 00:23:44,198
Yes?

326
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:47,080
Oh, stop. I’m not ready yet.

327
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:48,986
Just kidding.

328
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:52,073
Are you two together, now?

329
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:54,589
Huh?!

330
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:56,383
Are you two together already?

331
00:23:56,383 --> 00:23:58,593
What an interrogation.

332
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:00,303
No.

333
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:01,345
Not yet.

334
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,206
Even if you chat everyday?

335
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:05,308
He always picks you up from school?

336
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:06,434
Even slept on the same bed?

337
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:08,687
I hope you don't get stuck in the friendzone.

338
00:24:09,938 --> 00:24:11,106
Okay, fine.

339
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:14,234
I-I don’t know what we are.

340
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:18,071
Sometimes, I feel like we’re more than friends.

341
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:21,574
‘Cause he really makes me feel special.

342
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:23,284
But sometimes,

343
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:26,830
I think I’m just putting too much meaning since he’s my happy crush.

344
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,083
In short, you’re confused whether he likes you or not.

345
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,292
Exactly.

346
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:33,795
Why don’t you just confess, not as a joke, okay?

347
00:24:33,795 --> 00:24:36,339
Like, tell him how you really feel.

348
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,092
I mean, you’re used to making the first move.

349
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:40,587
I can’t.

350
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,556
Since when did Luna Valeria ever become a coward?

351
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:46,474
I’m not a coward, Ke!

352
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:50,145
I’m just worried that it would ruin our friendship.

353
00:24:50,145 --> 00:24:52,313
What if I confess,

354
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:54,607
and he doesn't feel the same way?

355
00:24:54,607 --> 00:24:56,359
That would make things awkward.

356
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,360
I might regret it.

357
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,529
So, you’re scared to lose him?

358
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:02,407
Ke, I’m not scared to lose him.

359
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:05,076
I just don’t want to ruin our friendship.

360
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,870
Besides,

361
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:11,082
my feelings for him aren't that deep.

362
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:13,727
I’m just enjoying what we have.

363
00:25:13,752 --> 00:25:15,211
Just a happy crush.

364
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:17,426
What?

365
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:18,494
Nothing…

366
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,771
Your happy crush just texted!

367
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:25,764
Kalix: are you free later? let’s study together.

368
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:30,310
Okay, I'll come over.

369
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,936
I’ll bring food.

370
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,300
Weak!

371
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:52,082
May I take your picture?

372
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:54,000
Just pretend it’s candid.

373
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:56,214
It’s fine.

374
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:04,565
So handsome.

375
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:08,223
Is it okay if I make this my wallpaper?

376
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,222
You can do whatever you want.

377
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:17,023
I hope you don't get stuck in the friendzone.

378
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:19,275
Why don’t you just confess, not as a joke, okay?

379
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:21,791
Like, tell him how you really feel.

380
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:29,619
Isn’t it weird?

381
00:26:31,704 --> 00:26:32,862
What’s weird?

382
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:38,962
To make you my wallpaper even if you’re not my boyfriend?

383
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,428
Bro, why weren’t you answe–

384
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:53,174
Sorry, we didn’t mean to intrude.

385
00:26:53,764 --> 00:26:55,433
We didn’t know you’re here.

386
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:59,149
I’m sorry, are we interrupting something between you and…

387
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:00,316
What’s your name?

388
00:27:01,658 --> 00:27:02,783
She’s Luna.

389
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:05,048
Ah. So, do you want us to leave?

390
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:07,948
‘Cause you haven’t been replying so we didn’t know if you had company.

391
00:27:09,784 --> 00:27:11,581
I’ll just go, Kalix.

392
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:13,263
No.

393
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,914
Everyone stays.

394
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:17,192
Let’s just fix whatever you guys brought.

395
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:20,503
- Come on. - Sorry Luna, we didn’t know you’re here.

396
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:21,921
Let’s just drink!

397
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:23,423
Okay guys, fix it up.

398
00:27:23,423 --> 00:27:24,487
Alright.

399
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:29,596
Bro, we don’t have any ice.

400
00:27:30,054 --> 00:27:31,181
What are we gonna do?

401
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,803
We can go to a convenience store. Come on.

402
00:27:34,828 --> 00:27:37,039
- Perfect, I can buy cigarettes. - Come on, let’s go.

403
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:42,525
Can I sit here?

404
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:50,909
I’m Amethyst by the way, I don’t think we’ve met yet.

405
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:52,035
Luna.

406
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:55,830
So, you’re an Archi major.

407
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,374
So what did Kalix say about your designs?

408
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:02,253
He’s not really a drawing and design kind of guy.

409
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:04,756
It’s not really what he’s into, as far as I know.

410
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:06,642
Nothing.

411
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:11,638
But you guys are pretty close. Considering you both don’t have a lot of similarities.

412
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:14,432
Yes, we’re close.

413
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,434
Nice!

414
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:18,645
I’m happy it’s working out for you.

415
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:21,272
Although, he almost always tells us

416
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:22,807
if he’s seeing someone…

417
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:24,901
Seriously, I mean.

418
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:28,613
So it’s funny that he hasn't mentioned you to us, like at all.

419
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:30,501
Well, KJ you know,

420
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:33,340
he’s really serious about his goals to become a lawyer

421
00:28:33,365 --> 00:28:36,034
so maybe he's not looking for anything serious right now.

422
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:49,331
We’re going to play truth or shot.

423
00:28:49,578 --> 00:28:52,135
If you can’t answer, take a shot.

424
00:28:52,488 --> 00:28:53,947
- Game! - Let’s do this!

425
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:55,224
Luna, don’t be shy.

426
00:28:55,224 --> 00:28:57,184
If you can’t take the shot, let Kalix take it.

427
00:28:57,184 --> 00:28:59,603
Jeez! These are just shots.

428
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:02,104
Maybe I’ll take the shots for him.

429
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:03,607
Just don’t get drunk.

430
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:06,307
Don’t worry. I don’t get drunk easily.

431
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:08,158
All right then,

432
00:29:08,183 --> 00:29:09,863
don’t underestimate Luna.

433
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:11,240
Okay, let’s start!

434
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,574
All right!

435
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,159
First bottle goes to…

436
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,577
- Adi. - Adi!

437
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:16,954
Truth or shot?

438
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:18,789
Truth, of course!

439
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:22,353
Why’d you turn down Sam?

440
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:25,587
She’s friend material for me, bro.

441
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:27,548
You bastard, too bad!

442
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:29,133
Sam’s a total catch!

443
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,218
Too bad about Sam.

444
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:34,430
Once she’s decided to move on from her crush,

445
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,889
there’s no going back.

446
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:39,362
- Okay, next? - Okay.

447
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:44,231
Okay, so who’s gonna ask Kalix?

448
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:45,252
Me!

449
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:50,509
Okay, Kalix.

450
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:53,732
Do you still

451
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:55,342
think about...

452
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:58,237
our first night together?

453
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:08,909
Okay!

454
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:12,955
Deflecting the question, I see.

455
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,099
- Okay, spin the bottle? - Yeah!

456
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:20,767
Okay, next round!

457
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:22,978
Ah!

458
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:27,670
Guys, my parents just texted me. They’re asking me to go home.

459
00:30:27,948 --> 00:30:29,026
You have to leave now?

460
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:30,360
Stay for a bit!

461
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,321
Luna, we’re just getting started.

462
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:33,739
It’s still early!

463
00:30:34,018 --> 00:30:36,366
No, my head’s been hurting as well.

464
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:39,187
I’ll drive you home.

465
00:30:42,596 --> 00:30:43,764
No need.

466
00:30:44,204 --> 00:30:46,682
They might think I’m your girlfriend.

467
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:48,530
I don’t wanna explain.

468
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,919
Besides, if you drive me home, you’ll get stuck in traffic.

469
00:30:50,944 --> 00:30:54,737
Just play spin the bottle with them, it seems like you’re all enjoying it.

470
00:30:56,303 --> 00:30:57,888
- Take care, Luna. - See you!

471
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:59,182
Bye, Luna!

472
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:05,979
Wasn’t this supposed to be just a happy crush?

473
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:09,122
Why am I feeling this way?

474
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:21,946
Luna!

475
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:40,923
Happy birthday, Sam!

476
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:44,393
Thank you so much, everyone!

477
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:45,630
I love you all!

478
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,574
Let’s enjoy the night!

479
00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:54,611
Happy birthday, Sam!

480
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:58,073
Fuck! Unlimited drinks, unlimited hotties!

481
00:31:58,073 --> 00:32:01,618
So, unlimited flirting for me!

482
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,137
Hey!

483
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:08,760
Luna, you might get drunk again and suddenly disappear! Take it slow.

484
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:10,787
What’s the problem? What happened?

485
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:12,754
And wow, why are you looking for guys?

486
00:32:12,754 --> 00:32:13,839
Don’t you already have one?

487
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,007
Excuse me!

488
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:17,467
I’m very much single right now.

489
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:18,802
Bitch is heartbroken!

490
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:19,886
Hey, what’s that?

491
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:21,388
Come on, you’ve been ignoring Kalix.

492
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:23,640
You weren’t answering his texts and calls.

493
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,476
I didn’t ghost him! I’m just ignoring him.

494
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:28,186
But why?

495
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:29,479
Did you two fight again?

496
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:33,358
Let’s just stop talking about someone who’s not even here.

497
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:35,402
Come on, let’s party—

498
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:36,612
I invited Kalix though,

499
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:38,596
but he said he might not come.

500
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:41,074
Well, he really shouldn’t come because I don’t want to see him.

501
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:42,909
Come on, let’s party!

502
00:33:16,588 --> 00:33:17,736
Hey, Via!

503
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:20,572
We’ll just go to the bathroom, we’ll finish all these later.

504
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:21,948
You better be back.

505
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:25,073
Hey, it’s the guy you ghosted.

506
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:26,182
Oh no.

507
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,637
They even came together.

508
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,783
Sam! I thought you didn't invite that girl?

509
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,006
I didn’t invite her,

510
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:39,831
maybe Kalix just brought her.

511
00:33:39,856 --> 00:33:41,775
Come on, chill!

512
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:44,846
This club is huge. Let’s just have fun!

513
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:47,349
Luna, wait, I just need to answer this.

514
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:50,127
Wait, wait! I’ll be back, just a sec!

515
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:54,235
Hey, come on! Let’s greet the birthday girl.

516
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:57,734
S-Shan!

517
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:01,655
Shan, Shan! Luna.

518
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:02,698
Didn’t know you’re here.

519
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:05,117
Sam, wait a minute. Let me sit, my feet hurt.

520
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:06,410
Just a minute.

521
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:09,454
Sam! Happy birthday!

522
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:11,120
- Sam, happy birthday! - Hi! Thank you.

523
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,403
Thank you!

524
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:17,379
Thank you, Amy.

525
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:19,339
- Hi, Kalix! - Happy birthday!

526
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,007
Wanna get a drink?

527
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:22,237
Hi!

528
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:24,463
Wanna take a shot?

529
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:25,767
Sure.

530
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:28,639
KJ, why aren't you drinking?

531
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,060
Cheers birthday girl!

532
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,104
Cheers!

533
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:35,182
What’s up?

534
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:36,940
Why are you here?

535
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,670
Let’s kiss.

536
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:40,620
Sure!

537
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:56,831
What?

538
00:34:56,856 --> 00:34:58,191
You okay?

539
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,948
Ke! Where are you?

540
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:03,798
I’m so pissed! You gotta know what happened!

541
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:06,448
Bitch! I’m back inside, where are you?

542
00:35:06,762 --> 00:35:09,055
I’m outside since it’s so noisy inside.

543
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:12,377
But fine! Wait for me there, I need to tell you what happened.

544
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:27,689
Glad you came.

545
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:30,299
Sam told me you're not coming.

546
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:38,120
Kalix?

547
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:39,752
Luna, fuck!

548
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:42,838
Do not play with me, please.

549
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,258
Kalix!

550
00:35:45,258 --> 00:35:47,177
For fuck’s sake!

551
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:49,945
What is your problem?

552
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:55,466
Nevermind.

553
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:58,911
What the hell, Kalix? What is wrong?

554
00:35:58,936 --> 00:36:01,647
I just don’t get you. You’re so confusing!

555
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:05,301
Can’t you just explain to me what exactly is happening?

556
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,735
Me?

557
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,927
Are you serious?

558
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:10,830
See? You can’t even answer me.

559
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:15,409
I get it now.

560
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,732
I guess that’s just how you act with everyone.

561
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:20,846
What did you just say?

562
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:23,471
Maybe it’s my fault for assuming things.

563
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:26,990
Can you just please leave me alone for now?

564
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,549
You’re so confusing, Kalix! So confusing!

565
00:36:31,752 --> 00:36:32,961
How, Luna?

566
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:35,720
Okay, how?

567
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:39,791
One moment, you treat me special

568
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:42,870
and then the next, you act so sweetly with Amethyst.

569
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:45,588
So what is it? I’m so confused.

570
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:47,948
I have no idea if you like me or not.

571
00:36:50,072 --> 00:36:52,033
That time during the spin the bottle game,

572
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:55,161
she even asked you in front of me

573
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,525
about your first night together.

574
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:01,917
Like I should just back off?

575
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:05,330
You’re so misleading, Kalix!

576
00:37:05,714 --> 00:37:06,965
I just don't understand.

577
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:09,009
I don’t know if you guys are fuck buddies?

578
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:11,666
Are you in a relationship with her? Was she your girlfriend?

579
00:37:11,923 --> 00:37:14,843
I don’t know if I should still keep my hopes up.

580
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,360
I don’t want to be misled, Kalix!

581
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:20,657
Luna, Amy and I are just friends.

582
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:24,165
Her question during the spin the bottle game was just a stupid little dare

583
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,692
that happened before.

584
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:28,784
Yes, we kissed before but it meant nothing

585
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:30,572
and I didn’t know how to answer the question

586
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:34,127
‘cause you were right in front of me and I didn’t want you to get the wrong idea.

587
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:36,734
So,

588
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,883
you don’t really like Amethyst?

589
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:41,901
No.

590
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,049
How about me?

591
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:49,174
What am I to you, Kalix?

592
00:37:57,891 --> 00:38:00,518
I guess, I wasn’t clear enough with my actions.

593
00:38:03,021 --> 00:38:04,057
I’m sorry.

594
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:08,166
There’s something I wanna show you, Luna.

595
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:10,690
Can you come with me?

596
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,924
What are we doing here, Kalix?

597
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:32,237
This is my parents' house.

598
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,721
And it will be mine once I graduate from Law school.

599
00:38:38,136 --> 00:38:40,861
The reason it’s still empty is because

600
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:43,674
I still can’t afford to buy things for this house.

601
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:48,956
Despite that, this place has been my resting place.

602
00:38:49,425 --> 00:38:52,512
I come here whenever I want to escape from everything.

603
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:56,204
I never brought any of my friends here.

604
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,293
Not Amy.

605
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:00,213
Not Adonis. Not Leo.

606
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:05,182
But I brought you here,

607
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:09,120
because I wanna show you every side of me.

608
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:13,987
Even the most vulnerable parts.

609
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,940
What I’m trying to say is–

610
00:39:29,691 --> 00:39:32,440
I like you, Luna.

611
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:40,994
And I’m really sorry if I haven’t been clear from the start.

612
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,890
You know that I’m not really good with words

613
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,876
so I tried showing it through my actions.

614
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:48,315
By doing that,

615
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:52,041
I guess, I just made you even more confused.

616
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:55,521
I’m sorry.

617
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:03,956
Are you crying?

618
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:08,055
You’re crazy.

619
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:11,733
You said you weren’t good with words, jeez!

620
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:15,904
I was just asking for a yes or no.

621
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:19,741
But you made it grand by showing off this house and giving your monologue.

622
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,838
I wanna show you the veranda.

623
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:31,377
Wow!

624
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:33,781
This is so beautiful.

625
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:37,579
You even have a telescope!

626
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:38,635
Yes.

627
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:39,916
Does it work?

628
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:41,012
Yeah.

629
00:40:41,012 --> 00:40:42,555
Can I use it?

630
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:46,443
Come on.

631
00:40:48,177 --> 00:40:49,345
Here, right?

632
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:50,912
May I?

633
00:40:50,937 --> 00:40:52,105
Yes.

634
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:54,491
Kalix!

635
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:57,424
I can see the moon! It’s beautiful.

636
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:00,065
The sky looks amazing.

637
00:41:01,618 --> 00:41:02,911
You know what, I–

638
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:06,815
I rarely see any stars.

639
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,968
‘Cause, you know, Manila is full of buildings.

640
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:13,776
I would love to go here every night.

641
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:17,299
I can bring you here every night.

642
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,268
You know, even without the telescope,

643
00:41:23,122 --> 00:41:25,065
you can still see the moon.

644
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:29,544
Luna.

645
00:41:30,637 --> 00:41:32,109
It means moon.

646
00:41:32,427 --> 00:41:34,471
Yes, you're right.

647
00:41:34,496 --> 00:41:38,140
Now you’ll remember me everytime you look at the moon.

648
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,372
Like a curse.

649
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:42,782
It’s not like a curse.

650
00:41:43,594 --> 00:41:45,640
More like a tattoo in my brain.

651
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:48,912
A beautiful one.

652
00:41:54,814 --> 00:41:56,726
One that I’m never gonna forget.

653
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:37,054
Let’s do the boyfriend-girlfriend thing.

654
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:41,153
Okay.

655
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:55,605
Can you and Sevi just wait for me in the restaurant?

656
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:57,565
This meeting will only take thirty minutes anyway.

657
00:42:58,316 --> 00:43:00,235
What’s the agenda? New project?

658
00:43:00,518 --> 00:43:02,311
He said it’s gonna be a project briefing.

659
00:43:02,445 --> 00:43:04,280
I guess it’s a VIP client.

660
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,658
To think that uncle will give the briefing to you.

661
00:43:06,658 --> 00:43:07,742
Exactly!

662
00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:12,306
I’m excited since it’s been a while since we got a passion project, right?

663
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:13,372
True.

664
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:17,961
I gotta go, the meeting’s about to start.

665
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:19,879
Dad! Let’s start the meeting?

666
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:21,506
Yes, we’re about to start.

667
00:43:25,404 --> 00:43:26,829
Hello, Architect Valeria.

668
00:43:31,762 --> 00:43:34,696
Why is Attorney Martinez here?

669
00:43:34,774 --> 00:43:36,317
Am I in the right meeting?

670
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:39,429
Yes, Luna. You’re in the right meeting.

671
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:42,040
And he’s here because he needs to be here.

672
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:44,295
Why?

673
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,905
Before anything else, Luna,

674
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:48,283
I just want you to know that this big project

675
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:51,327
has a very high sentimental value for the client.

676
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:52,836
And by the way,

677
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:56,626
the client requested specifically for you.

678
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,010
I’m lost.

679
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:06,196
Can you give me the project brief?

680
00:44:06,582 --> 00:44:07,634
Of course.

681
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:26,384
The rest house in Tagaytay?

682
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:29,423
That’s right, Architect Valeria.

683
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:32,868
I’m not here as your legal counsel, but as your client.

684
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,290
Let’s talk about the halloween break. What are your plans?

685
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,040
Luna, Kalix, what's your plan?

686
00:45:22,251 --> 00:45:25,797
We’re going to Boracay.

687
00:45:25,797 --> 00:45:28,925
- Wow! - What? Boracay?

688
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:30,635
Boracay is so beautiful.

689
00:45:30,635 --> 00:45:33,524
I’ve been here a couple of times, but I don’t know why–

690
00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:35,343
It’s more beautiful now.

691
00:45:38,618 --> 00:45:40,931
Maybe you can finish that later?

692
00:45:40,987 --> 00:45:42,102
Luna?

693
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:43,420
Where are you?

694
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:47,375
Good morning, Ke!

695
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:48,978
Hey, Ke!

696
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:51,800
Sorry, what’s wrong?

697
00:45:52,274 --> 00:45:54,693
By the way, this is Miguel, my boyfriend.
