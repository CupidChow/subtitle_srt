1
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,055
So, he’ll be in New York too?

2
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,515
Kalix and I will meet there.

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,267
By the way, I’ve already introduced him to Dad.

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,742
Wow! I never realized you were that serious.

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,898
Of course, this is for long-term.

6
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:26,250
They want me to become a doctor.

7
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:28,317
Especially my mom.

8
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,463
We made a deal, and I have to keep my grades up

9
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,699
and be on the dean's list every single semester.

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,632
Or else she will send me to med school.

11
00:00:34,657 --> 00:00:35,866
That's hard.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,204
Or maybe you’re neglecting your studies

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,790
because you’re so busy flirting with her.

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,083
No offense, dear, okay?

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,217
I just think that Kalix had better grades last year

16
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:47,890
when he was with his ex-girlfriend, Amethyst.

17
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,675
I’m sorry, girls.

18
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,817
I was too defensive last time.

19
00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:55,889
I know that you’re all just concerned about me.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,557
- Hello, Aunty? - Why? What happened?

21
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,350
Ke was rushed to the hospital. Come on!

22
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,393
Let’s go!

23
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,788
Your daughter was rushed to the E.R.

24
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,024
She was in and out of consciousness

25
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:44,697
we identified that there's head trauma that caused her concussion.

26
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,058
There was also bruising on her upper arm and abdomen.

27
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:52,087
The nature of these injuries are suggestive of physical abuse.

28
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,833
According to the nurse on duty,

29
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:58,695
Mr. Julian Miguel Villaflor brought the patient in

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,306
but he immediately left after filling out the forms.

31
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:05,213
The nurses tried to stop him from leaving but they couldn't do anything.

32
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:07,323
Based on the test results,

33
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:10,643
Kierra is clear of any internal bleeding.

34
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:14,510
Her physical injuries will heal with proper medical care.

35
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:15,912
Thank you, doc.

36
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:18,815
Thank you so much for taking care of Kierra.

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,134
We noticed since last night that

38
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,577
she was in a daze,

39
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,521
had no appetite and wasn’t talking to anyone.

40
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:29,908
I already referred the patient to Dr. Liza De Vera in Psychiatry

41
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,416
and she will come in tomorrow to evaluate Kierra.

42
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:34,734
Thank you, doc.

43
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:39,169
I suggest to extend her stay here in the hospital

44
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:41,863
so we can monitor her vitals.

45
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:43,279
Doc…

46
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,812
We’re gonna need your help in making a medical legal statement,

47
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,510
when we file our complaint.

48
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:54,260
I want justice for my daughter.

49
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:56,221
Please.

50
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:58,650
Please.

51
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:00,093
Of course, ma’am.

52
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,495
I’ll try to help as much as I can.

53
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:05,416
- Excuse me. - Thank you.

54
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:09,467
This is all my fault.

55
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:13,137
I shouldn’t have let Kierra stay in the condo.

56
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:17,349
If she was living with me at home, I could have made sure that she was okay.

57
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:19,143
Aunty…

58
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,118
I’m sorry.

59
00:04:21,143 --> 00:04:23,896
I’m so sorry for not being able to protect Ke.

60
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:27,805
- I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. - It’s okay. It’s okay.

61
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,438
My dear, don’t blame yourself. Luna, don’t blame yourself.

62
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:34,550
Sis, please don’t blame yourself, too. No one’s at fault.

63
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:39,121
Our next course of action is to find whoever did this to her

64
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:41,901
and definitely make him pay for whatever he did.

65
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:51,893
I’m so sorry, Aunty.

66
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,697
Ke…

67
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:09,381
You gotta eat, Ke, even just a little bit.

68
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,611
You won’t get better if you don’t.

69
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,345
What about some water, Ke?

70
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:21,622
Please? The IV won’t be enough for you to get better.

71
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:23,916
Ke.

72
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,669
You’re safe here, Ke.

73
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,213
We won’t let that asshole near you again.

74
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:32,508
And I swear to god if I see him, I’m gonna punch him in the face.

75
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:33,580
She’s right.

76
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:38,138
Your parents even went to the Women's Desk to file a complaint.

77
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,220
Miguel has been issued a subpoena.

78
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,572
He’ll be thrown to jail.

79
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:50,454
Ke, I already have your medical certificate.

80
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,197
It’s all good.

81
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:59,760
Don't worry, finals are almost done anyway.

82
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:01,416
Just focus on getting better.

83
00:06:01,705 --> 00:06:04,916
How about a tiny bite, Ke?

84
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:11,259
Ke.

85
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,197
Okay,

86
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:18,501
rest for now and sleep. We’ll just be outside.

87
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:20,986
Ke,

88
00:06:22,224 --> 00:06:24,705
we’re here for you.

89
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,916
We love you, Kierra.

90
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,303
Hey,

91
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:44,611
why did we have to go out?

92
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,172
How’s Ke?

93
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:49,448
Asleep. She’s fine.

94
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:52,212
Look at this.

95
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:56,300
“Fit for class?”

96
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,205
What the hell is this bullshit?

97
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,304
Why does this say that Kierra’s all better now?

98
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:03,002
Right? Isn’t it so frustrating?

99
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:06,477
They keep saying that Kierra is all better now and can be discharged.

100
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:08,477
That she’s just experiencing occasional mood swings

101
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:10,648
and loss of appetite.

102
00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:12,341
What the fuck?

103
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,403
Kierra hasn’t even eaten since!

104
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:21,258
I bet Miguel’s family threatened this hospital.

105
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:25,079
I mean, it’s obvious that she’s not mentally well.

106
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,039
What about her therapy,

107
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,838
how was it? Any update? Has it even started yet?

108
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:33,236
She might not be ready to tell her side of the story.

109
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:41,010
I don’t know what to do.

110
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:45,111
Aunty’s even getting sick because of all the worry.

111
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,185
This is all my fault.

112
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:49,728
Luna…

113
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:51,415
There you go again.

114
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,233
You’re blaming yourself again.

115
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:57,653
It's not your fault, Luna.

116
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:01,072
We live in the same condo, Via.

117
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:06,033
How come I didn't notice that something's going on with her?

118
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:09,565
I’ve been too selfish this whole time.

119
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,501
This is all my fault.

120
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:16,964
If only I asked her how she was, this wouldn’t have happened.

121
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,466
Luna, don’t carry the burden by yourself.

122
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,386
I always talk to Kierra and yet I didn’t notice anything.

123
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:23,679
She’s right, Luna.

124
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,406
We’re all at fault.

125
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:29,643
While her parents are busy with the case,

126
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:33,022
let’s take turns in taking care of Kierra.

127
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:38,819
If only I was there for Kierra, nothing like this would happen.

128
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,158
Luna…

129
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:46,118
Don’t blame yourself, it’s not your fault.

130
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:48,908
We’re all in this together.

131
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:05,070
Reminder, class–

132
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:08,599
your plates will be submitted by the end of the week.

133
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:12,811
And that will be considered as your final exam.

134
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,314
So for anyone who wants to be in the dean’s list,

135
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:18,442
this is your make or break project.

136
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:21,195
So please, take it seriously.

137
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,822
I hope you’ve all started it

138
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:29,244
because I won’t accept any late submissions.

139
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,873
All right? Well, I guess that will be all.

140
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,416
Class dismissed.

141
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,192
- Ma’am? - Yes, Ms. Valeria?

142
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,510
About Kierra Ynares,

143
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,595
she’s still in the hospital.

144
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,422
Would you extend the deadline for her?

145
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:52,810
Well, I received her medical certificate

146
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,314
and it’s stated clearly that she’s already fit for class.

147
00:09:57,314 --> 00:10:02,069
I see no reason for her not to submit her plates on time with the deadline I gave.

148
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,739
And that would be unfair for other students.

149
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:07,891
But she’s not mentally well, ma’am.

150
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,493
If that’s the case,

151
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:14,415
then you need to present a medical certificate from a psychiatrist.

152
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,668
It should come from them.

153
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:19,494
I’m sorry, Ms. Valeria.

154
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,964
No medical certificate,

155
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:25,112
no extension for deadlines.

156
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:27,533
Excuse me.

157
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,213
Luna!

158
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:33,891
We’re groupmates for the tropical design project.

159
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:37,312
We have a meeting tomorrow for our finals.

160
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:40,122
You weren’t responding in our online group chat,

161
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:41,649
just letting you know.

162
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:45,654
Sorry, I haven’t been checking my socials. What time would it be?

163
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:49,825
9 AM, since that’s the only time our other groupmates are available.

164
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:50,993
Okay, thanks.

165
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:52,953
You better be there.

166
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,413
All right.

167
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,604
You can do this, Luna.

168
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,291
You can do this, Luna.

169
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,150
Hey, Luna.

170
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,258
How are you?

171
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:51,094
I miss you. We haven’t seen each other in a week.

172
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,276
I miss you, too, Kalix.

173
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:56,516
I’m sorry I’ve been so busy this week

174
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,019
and with exams, too.

175
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,147
I also had to finish Ke’s plates.

176
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:05,108
Hey, there’s nothing to be sorry about.

177
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,486
Did you get any sleep last night?

178
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,864
Not really. About four hours, maybe.

179
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:14,054
Get some sleep tonight. Okay?

180
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:16,787
Have you eaten dinner yet?

181
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:18,163
I can bring you food.

182
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:19,831
No need, I’m fine.

183
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:22,334
I just have a lot to do.

184
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,920
Besides, aren’t you supposed to be busy with your finals?

185
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,104
You should focus on that.

186
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:30,259
Okay. I understand.

187
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:33,720
But you know I can always make time for you.

188
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,916
Right?

189
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,414
I know.

190
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,059
Just let me know how I can help.

191
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,603
How’s Kierra? How’s her therapy?

192
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:45,148
She still hasn’t been responding to her therapist.

193
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:47,776
She hasn’t even spoken with any of us.

194
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:49,736
She just sleeps all the time.

195
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,615
I can ask my parents for a good psychiatrist for her if you want?

196
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:55,033
It’s okay.

197
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,828
Sam recommended one already.

198
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:01,873
Maybe, I just need to keep convincing Kierra.

199
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:04,385
I really hope she gets better soon.

200
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:07,391
Look, I’m not gonna hold you up anymore.

201
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,882
Just please, don’t forget to eat and sleep.

202
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:12,092
Okay?

203
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:14,080
I love you.

204
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:16,955
I love you.

205
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:36,260
Ke would like this. Thank you.

206
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:38,986
I’m glad to help in any way I can.

207
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:41,330
Did you get any sleep last night?

208
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,414
You look tired.

209
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:43,999
About two hours.

210
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:45,947
Luna,

211
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:47,994
that’s just a nap.

212
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,422
You should get proper sleep tonight.

213
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,596
I’m worried about you.

214
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:56,345
I’ll rest once finals are over.

215
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:59,955
What about you? Don’t you have an exam tomorrow?

216
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:02,463
You should go home early.

217
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:04,721
It’s okay, I’ll...

218
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:08,182
I’ll just stay here and make sure you sleep.

219
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,360
My exam tomorrow is just a minor subject.

220
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:20,881
Aunty? Mommy?

221
00:14:20,906 --> 00:14:23,104
What happened, is anything wrong?

222
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:28,414
We just came from the City Prosecutor’s office

223
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:31,838
and the camp of Miguel just submitted their counter-affidavit.

224
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:36,718
They have controverting evidence that proves Miguel was at a party that night.

225
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,619
They even have witnesses,

226
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:40,812
photos,

227
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,349
and even videos.

228
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:48,480
Our lawyers said that the prosecutor is highly likely to dismiss our complaint

229
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,625
since we lack probable cause.

230
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,651
How could we lack probable cause?

231
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,679
Isn’t the camera footage from the emergency room enough?

232
00:14:55,704 --> 00:15:00,046
They said that the cameras were all under maintenance that night.

233
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:02,035
But Ke is the actual victim and also the witness.

234
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:06,246
I know, we can’t deny the fact that Kierra was abused that night.

235
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:11,343
But our evidence is not enough to prove that it was Miguel who did it. And–

236
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:15,713
they’re saying that these are all just lies made up by my daughter.

237
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:17,006
That bastard!

238
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:18,829
Mommy, we can’t let this happen.

239
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,677
He needs to go to jail!

240
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:22,681
I know. I know, Luna.

241
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:25,665
But we’re fighting with big dogs.

242
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,692
They have a lot of connections.

243
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:31,517
So I’ll make sure we’ll bring this to court. I promise you.

244
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:41,573
Ke!

245
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,970
Here’s your favorite pasta.

246
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:47,571
Kalix bought this for you.

247
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:53,728
Well?

248
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,150
Where’s the food-loving person that I know?

249
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,188
Ke.

250
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:12,938
The outside world misses you.

251
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:14,603
Get well soon.

252
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:16,915
Our school term is almost done, too.

253
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:19,592
You said you wanted to go to Tali beach.

254
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:20,743
Let’s go?

255
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:31,446
Ke?

256
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:36,111
Sam recommended a new therapist.

257
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,143
Therapist for victims of abuse.

258
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,485
You might consider it.

259
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,766
No pressure.

260
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:51,572
Ke?

261
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,013
I know it’s hard.

262
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:00,239
Take it one step at a time, okay?

263
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:03,010
We miss you.

264
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:08,742
Don’t forget that we all love you.

265
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:45,790
Luna, it’s 9 PM. We haven’t eaten dinner yet.

266
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:50,540
You’re hungry? There’s food in the fridge, just heat it up.

267
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,954
You haven’t eaten yet.

268
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:57,423
I’m not hungry. I’m fine.

269
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,190
Luna…

270
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:09,540
You don’t have to pretend that everything is fine in front of me.

271
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:14,183
If you need to cry, you can cry on my shoulder.

272
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:22,414
I can’t cry now. I have a lot to do.

273
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,156
I’m here.

274
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,343
I can help.

275
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:30,624
I want to help.

276
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,321
Kalix.

277
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:35,360
You need to study for your exam.

278
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:39,972
I’m okay, you don’t have to worry.

279
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:43,853
Hold on, I’ll get it.

280
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:53,759
Via?

281
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,823
Luna, can we talk?

282
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:59,343
What’s up with your late submissions?

283
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:03,289
Are you planning to fail your major subjects, Luna?

284
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:07,330
I just forgot about the deadline.

285
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:12,375
Why didn’t you take the final exam of 1123?

286
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,193
Did you forget about it, too?

287
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:16,977
My midterm grades were pretty high.

288
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:18,446
I'll still pass.

289
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,573
How about the project for tropical design?

290
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:22,725
Are you sure you’ll pass?

291
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:25,129
You didn’t even show up for the meeting.

292
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,329
Shit! I forgot.

293
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:31,940
Yes. Your groupmates told me that you were MIA.

294
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:34,806
You might not be on the Dean's List this semester.

295
00:19:36,236 --> 00:19:37,735
It’s just an award.

296
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,087
Do you hear yourself right now, Luna?

297
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,150
Seriously?

298
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:48,720
You think Kierra would be happy with everything you’ve been doing?

299
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,388
Luna, Kierra can catch up.

300
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,397
And if she can’t?

301
00:19:57,141 --> 00:20:01,415
- What if she fails this year? - There’s still summer classes.

302
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:05,259
She can attend summer classes. Kierra will catch up. We’ll find a way.

303
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:07,536
So don’t do this.

304
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,211
You have to get a hold of yourself.

305
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:16,250
Email this to me.

306
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,485
I’ll finish Kierra’s essay.

307
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:20,480
Take care of yourself, please?

308
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:22,215
- But– - Luna.

309
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,044
Listen to Via.

310
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,960
You need to rest.

311
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,880
I know you’re disappointed.

312
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:48,310
I know I can catch up.

313
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:50,638
I’m still a sophomore

314
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,505
so I’ll still be able to graduate with honors.

315
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,235
Besides, I’m not worried about my grades now.

316
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,240
There are many other things that are more important.

317
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:05,474
You don’t sound like yourself anymore.

318
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:08,649
How do I sound like?

319
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:16,427
You’re an achiever, Luna.

320
00:21:16,824 --> 00:21:20,279
You value your work and put so much passion in it.

321
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,790
But right now, you look like you’re just surviving.

322
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,859
At least I’m surviving, Kalix.

323
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:35,341
I am so tired.

324
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:43,603
I feel so lost.

325
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,014
I don’t know what to do anymore.

326
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,489
I can’t just leave Kierra alone.

327
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:03,287
Even if everyone says that I’m not at fault,

328
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:08,250
I still think that it is.

329
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,340
I feel so worthless

330
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:18,768
for not being able to see what was going on.

331
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,806
I’m her family.

332
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:24,767
I should have been the first to notice.

333
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:26,275
Me.

334
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:31,940
But I did nothing, I know nothing.

335
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:40,283
I feel so guilty, Kalix.

336
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:44,424
Especially now that the case isn’t going well.

337
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:55,881
I’m so sorry you’re going through all of this.

338
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:00,016
You’re carrying all of this by yourself.

339
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:03,514
And it must have been really hard for you.

340
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:15,860
Luna, please, let me help.

341
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,398
That’s what I’m here for.

342
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:23,265
We’re in this together.

343
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,770
Okay?

344
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:38,328
Everything will be all right.

345
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,427
Justice will be served, Luna.

346
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:44,101
I’ll make sure of that.

347
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:47,788
Thank you.

348
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,186
Thank you.

349
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,773
I feel so overwhelmed.

350
00:24:00,488 --> 00:24:03,859
And your presence is the only thing that comforts me.

351
00:24:04,116 --> 00:24:06,452
I’ll be your safe haven.

352
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,895
Should I sleep here tonight?

353
00:24:12,648 --> 00:24:13,898
You don’t have to.

354
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:16,660
I know you still have a lot to do.

355
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,143
Don’t worry about that.

356
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:24,906
I don’t want you to be alone tonight.

357
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,187
I’ll stay here. Okay?

358
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:41,594
Amy: I miss your lips. Kiss me again.

359
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:44,258
Amy: I am so drunk Kalix.

360
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:47,812
Amy: Why didn’t you take the finals today?

361
00:25:48,012 --> 00:25:52,516
Amy: Is it because you met up with Luna? I thought you weren’t going to be serious?

362
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:55,891
Amy: Did you tell her about us? Call me.

363
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:59,170
Amy: I miss you. Kiss me again.

364
00:25:59,195 --> 00:26:01,197
Amy: Baby, I miss this.

365
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:29,015
Luna?

366
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:02,132
Happy Valentine’s Day!

367
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,687
Happy Valentine’s!

368
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:09,500
What’s wrong?

369
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,383
No-nothing.

370
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:14,698
L-Let’s sit.

371
00:27:14,723 --> 00:27:16,461
You had a drink?

372
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,484
Who were you with? Where have you been?

373
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,689
Just a little.

374
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:24,090
We had a free cut.

375
00:27:25,197 --> 00:27:28,234
Were you with Adonis and Amethyst?

376
00:27:29,992 --> 00:27:31,073
Yes.

377
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,281
Okay.

378
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:34,599
I love you.

379
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:46,062
I love you too, Luna.

380
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:48,945
Always remember that.

381
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,458
I will.

382
00:28:13,404 --> 00:28:15,161
You’ve been quiet.

383
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,655
What’s up?

384
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,481
I’m okay.

385
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,919
Thanks for coming, by the way.

386
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:24,531
I know you’re busy.

387
00:28:24,556 --> 00:28:25,849
Of course.

388
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:28,711
You looked like you were about to cry.

389
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:30,825
Are you really okay?

390
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,513
What’s wrong, Luna?

391
00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:34,219
Sir, I’m very sorry. We really can’t allow it.

392
00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:36,972
I have to talk to her. No, you don’t understand. I have to see her.

393
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:38,349
Sir, she’s very unstable.

394
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,100
What are you doing here?

395
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:43,103
- Well?! - I didn’t do anything here.

396
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:45,022
- Acting all innocent? - I didn’t do anything here.

397
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,316
- You didn’t do anything?! - I didn’t do anything!

398
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:48,609
- I didn’t do anything! - Stop acting innocent!

399
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:50,486
- How could you hurt Kierra?! - I just have to see her.

400
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:52,613
- I didn’t hurt her! - How dare you even show yourself!

401
00:28:52,638 --> 00:28:54,390
Let go of me!

402
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:56,949
You are a terrible person!

403
00:28:56,974 --> 00:28:59,078
What the fuck, you can’t accuse me of anything!

404
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:02,414
- You coward! You’re such a coward, Miguel! - You cannot! You have no proof!

405
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:05,042
- Oh, I’ll sue you, I’ll sue the both of you! - Really? You gonna run to your daddy again?

406
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,043
You bastard!

407
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:07,419
- Let go of her! - You get her, man!

408
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:09,505
- And you! - Fucking get her! Go!

409
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:11,423
I know you were paid to keep quiet!

410
00:29:11,423 --> 00:29:13,759
Have you no shame, how could you?

411
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,427
- Shut her up! - Let go of me!

412
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:18,055
- Shut her up! - I said, let me go!

413
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:18,983
She’s too loud!

414
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,700
- Let me go! - Do your fucking job!

415
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:21,724
Get off her.

416
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:24,973
Let’s go, Sevi.

417
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,287
Luna!

418
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:30,056
Luna, wait!

419
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:32,194
Let’s talk! Luna!

420
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:34,113
This isn’t right, Sevi. Aunty needs to know about this.

421
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:36,073
- We have to report this. - Luna!

422
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:36,949
Luna, please!

423
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,651
- Luna, Kalix is… - I don’t want to see him.

424
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,928
- Don’t leave me with him. - Luna, please, wait!

425
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,038
You fucking cheater!

426
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:44,415
Please let me explain!

427
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,716
For what?

428
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:47,701
So you can do it again?

429
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:51,480
Kalix, it’s so obvious in the video that you were kissing Amethyst.

430
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:52,673
You piece of shit!

431
00:29:52,673 --> 00:29:53,832
- You– - You cheater!

432
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:56,260
You don’t understand, please hear me out!

433
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,637
Fuck you!

434
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:01,181
I don’t think you understand.

435
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:04,247
How long have you been cheating?

436
00:30:04,272 --> 00:30:05,690
How long has it been?

437
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:07,883
This happened on Valentine’s day?

438
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:09,857
You kissed her

439
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,777
and then met up with me that night

440
00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:14,361
like nothing happened?

441
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:18,323
You made me look like an idiot.

442
00:30:18,323 --> 00:30:20,617
You’re such a jerk, Kalix! You fucking jerk!

443
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:23,120
- Don’t touch me! - I could never do that!

444
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,455
I can never do that.

445
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,914
You already did!

446
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:29,438
You know my past, Kalix.

447
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,747
You know how much I hate cheaters.

448
00:30:33,237 --> 00:30:36,525
You know my past, Kalix!

449
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,305
You said I can be vulnerable in front of you

450
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:44,763
and I did but you still chose to hurt me.

451
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:46,916
You fucking son of a bitch.

452
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:49,184
You're such a jerk.

453
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:53,275
Don’t, don’t!

454
00:30:53,842 --> 00:30:56,345
- I love you so much, Luna. - No!

455
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,446
Please.

456
00:30:57,446 --> 00:30:58,572
Kalix…

457
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,293
I love you, Luna.

458
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:04,107
Fuck, Kalix.

459
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:06,861
I love you so much.

460
00:31:07,927 --> 00:31:09,739
So much.

461
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:17,473
Luna!

462
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,121
Luna, I’ve been waiting here all day.

463
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,738
Just give me five minutes.

464
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:23,060
Let me take you home.

465
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:25,786
Stop this, Kalix.

466
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:28,829
Isn’t it obvious? I don’t want to talk to you.

467
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:33,385
I won’t stop even if I have to wait for you here everyday.

468
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,385
This won’t stop me.

469
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,965
Focus on your exams.

470
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:41,865
‘Cause we’re over.

471
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,176
We’re done.

472
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:45,872
What do you mean we’re done?

473
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,182
Please, let’s talk about this.

474
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:51,275
Luna, please!

475
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,841
Are you okay?

476
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,249
I have something to tell you, Luna.

477
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:15,560
What?

478
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:18,516
I’m ready to get therapy.

479
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:22,380
Just remember to stay strong.

480
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:24,266
I love you, Ke.

481
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:09,904
Fucking stop this, Luna.

482
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:21,200
Hello?

483
00:34:21,702 --> 00:34:23,704
Sorry for bothering you.

484
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,821
It's just I’m breaking a promise.

485
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:27,072
What?

486
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:29,522
I’m losing it, Luna.

487
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:31,174
What do you mean?

488
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,867
Have a good night.

489
00:34:32,892 --> 00:34:34,560
I love you.

490
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,138
Hello, Adi?

491
00:34:43,463 --> 00:34:45,424
Are you with Kalix right now?

492
00:34:45,424 --> 00:34:46,810
Where are you guys?

493
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:57,138
What happened, why won’t he go home?

494
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:58,716
Luna…

495
00:34:59,104 --> 00:35:01,481
I have something very important to say.

496
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:06,659
Did Kalix say anything?

497
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:09,948
Wait, hold on. You still don’t know?

498
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,841
We didn’t talk the whole week.

499
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:14,622
Well,

500
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,565
Kalix failed the semester.

501
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,033
Failed?

502
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:22,586
He’s not moving up a year?

503
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,383
Look, Luna,

504
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:29,885
it’s not your fault.

505
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,935
It’s Kalix’s fault

506
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:33,993
and we’re not guilt tripping you.

507
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,767
He just didn’t want to tell you but

508
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,622
I think you should really know.

509
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:41,730
We can still do something about it, right?

510
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,880
Yes, if Kalix would just focus

511
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:47,708
and stop ditching exams just so he can go to you.

512
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:48,904
Bro.

513
00:35:59,596 --> 00:36:01,278
I need to go.

514
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,474
Please, bring him home.

515
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:23,146
I don’t want to meddle, Luna,

516
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:26,200
but I think you both need space.

517
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:29,396
This isn’t healthy anymore.

518
00:36:32,895 --> 00:36:34,255
I had no idea...

519
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:37,607
that we would end like this.

520
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:43,172
That we would ruin each other.

521
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,724
I can’t bear to see him anymore, Sevi.

522
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:53,053
You know,

523
00:36:55,262 --> 00:36:57,472
I feel bad with everything

524
00:36:59,558 --> 00:37:01,893
that’s going on with him.

525
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:04,563
But it’s so unfair.

526
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:08,644
I feel guilty even though he’s the one who cheated.

527
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:14,185
I don’t know, Sevi.

528
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,685
Luna, you don’t have to force yourself if you’re not ready.

529
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:23,352
You need time to understand everything that’s happening right now.

530
00:37:23,445 --> 00:37:27,543
So that when you both finally meet,

531
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,888
you’ll be able to talk without any grudge.

532
00:37:30,262 --> 00:37:32,723
For now, you gotta sleep.

533
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:34,810
It’s 3 AM already.

534
00:37:35,468 --> 00:37:38,224
Ke told me to stay in her room,

535
00:37:38,435 --> 00:37:41,216
so remember that I’m just here when you need me.

536
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:43,275
Thank you.

537
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:46,544
You’re such a good friend.

538
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,073
Of course.

539
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:51,625
I’m just here.

540
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:07,498
Sevi?

541
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,419
Sevi, are you up?

542
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:32,230
Luna, can we talk? Please?

543
00:38:32,255 --> 00:38:34,036
What are you doing here, Kalix?

544
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,513
Please, Luna, let’s work this out.

545
00:38:39,081 --> 00:38:42,084
I wasn’t able to sleep last night.

546
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:45,345
Because I felt so bad.

547
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,998
I wanna break up.

548
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,185
I don’t.

549
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,505
I’m not asking for your permission.

550
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:54,840
Our relationship works with us two,

551
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,591
you can’t just decide on your own.

552
00:38:56,591 --> 00:39:00,318
Our relationship ended when you started kissing another woman.

553
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:02,270
You asshole!

554
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:06,900
How dare you even think that I need your permission to break up.

555
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:11,021
You’re so harsh, Luna.

556
00:39:11,536 --> 00:39:13,832
You don’t even give me the chance to explain.

557
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:15,235
For what?

558
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,686
Just to listen to your excuses?

559
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:22,200
That I just misinterpreted that video of you and Amethyst?

560
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:26,482
You were never completely honest with me about Amethyst.

561
00:39:26,662 --> 00:39:28,145
I'm sorry.

562
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:31,529
I’m sorry, but I can’t trust you anymore.

563
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:34,185
You said you trusted me.

564
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:39,802
You broke my trust, Kalix.

565
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:44,794
So, I’m done.

566
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:47,130
Let’s just break up

567
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:49,616
because this isn’t healthy anymore.

568
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:55,099
You failed this semester because of me, right?

569
00:39:56,693 --> 00:39:58,737
It’s just a semester, Luna.

570
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:02,138
It’s not just a semester, Kalix, it’s your dream!

571
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:06,741
You know what’s annoying?

572
00:40:09,124 --> 00:40:11,590
That I’m feeling guilty

573
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:15,211
because I know that it’s my fault you failed.

574
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:17,615
I've been telling you–

575
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,676
don't lose your dream for me, Kalix.

576
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:24,911
You are the dream, Luna.

577
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,862
But you chose to hurt me.

578
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,652
You chose to hurt me, Kalix.

579
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:39,131
Enough.

580
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:41,571
I’m done.

581
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:44,157
I’m tired of all this.

582
00:40:44,182 --> 00:40:46,543
Please, just go.

583
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,235
No, Luna, please.

584
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:53,135
Please don’t leave me.

585
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:54,659
I need you.

586
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:59,487
Don’t do this to me, please.

587
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:01,964
Please?

588
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,846
I'm not in love with you anymore.

589
00:41:06,137 --> 00:41:08,348
That’s bullshit.

590
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:14,147
Luna?

591
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:28,493
During the times I was so down with what you did to me,

592
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:32,297
Sevi has always been by my side.

593
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:33,581
Luna, I–

594
00:41:33,581 --> 00:41:36,313
You think I’d still be hung up on you?

595
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:38,640
That I’d stay loyal to you?

596
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:41,341
After what you did?

597
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,610
I don’t love you anymore, Kalix.

598
00:41:46,152 --> 00:41:47,695
Kalix, we’re done.

599
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,922
I don’t think I can trust you again.

600
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:54,664
So please, just go.

601
00:41:58,285 --> 00:41:59,870
Let me go.

602
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:24,547
I love you so damn much.

603
00:42:28,303 --> 00:42:31,139
I could never cheat on you.

604
00:43:32,165 --> 00:43:39,297
Kalix: Be happy. Take yourself to the moon. I will love you until then.

605
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:29,264
Here's a package for you, attorney.

606
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:31,180
It's from Valeria Construction.

607
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:33,678
Return those to Architect Luna Valeria.

608
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:34,960
I would rather have you repay me

609
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:37,473
through your professional service, Architect Valeria.

610
00:44:37,473 --> 00:44:39,142
Can I ask you a personal question?

611
00:44:39,142 --> 00:44:40,685
Depends on the question.

612
00:44:40,685 --> 00:44:43,313
Did you represent Miguel Villaflor in court?

613
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:44,797
Who said I did?

614
00:44:44,897 --> 00:44:46,232
Some rumors.

615
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:51,446
This contract is flawless, I can’t find any loopholes.

616
00:44:51,446 --> 00:44:53,641
Duh, your client is a lawyer.

617
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:54,741
Sevi,

618
00:44:54,741 --> 00:44:58,469
will you be my engineer for Kalix’s house project in Tagaytay?

619
00:44:58,494 --> 00:44:59,536
Wait a minute.

620
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:01,633
You’ll accept the project?WEBVTT
You’ll accept the project?
