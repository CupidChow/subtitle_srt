1
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,118
I don't know. I’m scared, Via.

2
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:16,203
I don’t know if it’s still worth it for us to try again.

3
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:20,833
Just use our time here in Boracay to think, Luna.

4
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:23,278
Hello, Kalix.

5
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:25,513
Hey! I just arrived here in Malaysia.

6
00:00:25,538 --> 00:00:27,582
Enjoy your stay in Boracay.

7
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:29,792
I guess it’s good that

8
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:32,645
we’re on separate trips so that we can think clearly.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,758
Again, I’m not pressuring you to give me an answer right away.

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,082
I’m willing to wait for it and work hard for it.

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,777
I know he already knows what he lost after you broke up.

12
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:45,554
But, let’s show him more.

13
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,998
Let’s show him what he missed out on.

14
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:49,153
You look great.

15
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:51,530
You just reminded me of our time in Boracay.

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,407
If you give me another chance,

17
00:00:53,407 --> 00:00:56,102
I will never let go of you ever,

18
00:00:56,298 --> 00:00:58,271
ever again.

19
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:04,045
Maybe we should go back inside?

20
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,964
Hey,

21
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,117
I know everything I said is a lot to process.

22
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:11,119
Don’t worry about it.

23
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:14,623
Take as much time as you need to process everything, okay?

24
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:16,367
Thank you, Kalix.

25
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,644
- Let’s go? - Yes.

26
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,004
Okay.

27
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:22,047
Come on.

28
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:38,931
Were you cockblocked by the rain?

29
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:41,483
Yanna…

30
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:43,193
Stop it.

31
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:47,572
I just said that the moment was ruined because it started raining.

32
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:50,700
But you felt bad that nothing happened, right? Admit it already.

33
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,910
Yes.

34
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:55,038
Look at her smile.

35
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:59,709
But, I’m actually glad that it suddenly rained.

36
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,294
How come?

37
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:05,507
The tension was quite high for both of us.

38
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:07,919
In a way,

39
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:11,596
the rain stopped us from doing something that we might regret.

40
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:16,434
Wow! You’re so levelheaded.

41
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:20,097
I really admire your self-control.

42
00:04:20,122 --> 00:04:22,892
My cousin is so mature now.

43
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:26,319
And she even flirted responsibly.

44
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,990
I should have learned by now with all of the honest-to-goodness opinions you gave me.

45
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,284
So, thank you.

46
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:34,286
You’re welcome.

47
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:36,371
You did a good job, too.

48
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:44,768
Smile for the camera! Move a bit. One, two, three, smile!

49
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:47,841
This is the life!

50
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:50,552
Can we, like, extend our vacation, please?

51
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:53,840
I’m still not ready to face the stressful work.

52
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:58,852
Just let it all out later during our yacht party.

53
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:02,606
Yes, my god! I’m so excited to go party with you, girls.

54
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,650
I even made sure my dress was a stunner.

55
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:09,487
Oh my god, it’s Kalix!

56
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,660
Come on, girls. Let’s go.

57
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,661
You’re leaving me?

58
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,079
You’ll manage.

59
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,623
- Keep it up. - Let’s go.

60
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:20,290
Good morning!

61
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,374
- Hi Kalix! - Hi!

62
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:23,550
- Bye, Kalix. - Bye!

63
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,034
Let’s go, Yanna, hurry!

64
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,047
Hey!

65
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,215
Hi.

66
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:39,684
How’s your morning?

67
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,730
I didn’t get enough sleep

68
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,149
but it’s still a good morning.

69
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:51,071
Have you eaten yet?

70
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,238
My treat.

71
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:53,531
No need,

72
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:56,368
your company is already a treat.

73
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:57,702
I insist.

74
00:05:57,702 --> 00:06:00,288
I know what you went through last night.

75
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:03,208
You came here to Boracay from Malaysia.

76
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,751
That’s definitely a tiring trip.

77
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:06,378
It wasn’t.

78
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:08,296
I wanted to be here.

79
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:23,520
Answer it.

80
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,605
I’m sure it’s important.

81
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:27,315
I’ll make this quick.

82
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:32,904
One order of breakfast, please.

83
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,375
I’m so sorry, Luna.

84
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,627
It seems like I can’t join you for breakfast.

85
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:50,174
I forgot I have a video call meeting with my client.

86
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,331
It’s okay, I know that’s important.

87
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:54,941
I’m so sorry.

88
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,229
Make up for it later, we’ll have a yacht party.

89
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:01,391
But if you can’t go, don’t worry about it. No pressure.

90
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:03,182
I understand.

91
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,476
No,

92
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:06,211
I’ll be there.

93
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:09,399
Okay.

94
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,698
See you.

95
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:30,645
This is the life!

96
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,715
Hey, this view is amazing!

97
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:35,216
Hi!

98
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:36,676
- How are you? - Hey!

99
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:37,510
- Hi! - It’s nice to see you again.

100
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,636
Looking good.

101
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:40,472
You too. How are you guys?

102
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,074
We’ve been pretty busy.

103
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,559
We’re so glad to be here even if it’s just a short vacation.

104
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:47,437
I feel you. I had to change my flight to tomorrow.

105
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,773
I wanted to enjoy Boracay a little bit.

106
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,149
And Luna.

107
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,151
What’s that?

108
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:56,463
Nothing— You’ll be leaving tomorrow?

109
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:59,032
Yes, I have a court hearing tomorrow, so…

110
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:02,280
So you really just came here for Luna, huh?

111
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:04,204
So sweet!

112
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,498
Speaking of— here comes Luna.

113
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:08,750
She really took her time in the ladies room.

114
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:13,835
Hey!

115
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,173
Hey.

116
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:18,968
I was waiting for you.

117
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:23,121
Well, I’m here.

118
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,562
It’s party time! Come on, come on.

119
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,009
Let’s go!

120
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,536
Excuse me.

121
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,197
Guys, more drinks!

122
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:40,490
Let’s keep drinking!

123
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,575
¡Muchas gracias!

124
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:44,412
Are you Spanish now?

125
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,991
Hey, that’s my drink.

126
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:53,044
Huh? Oh, sorry. I thought that was mine.

127
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:54,671
You can just have this.

128
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:56,965
- Sorry. - It’s okay. I’ll just order another one.

129
00:08:57,842 --> 00:08:59,310
What do you call this thing when we were young

130
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,695
when you accidentally drink a glass that’s not yours?

131
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,263
Indirect—

132
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:04,347
kiss.

133
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,850
What’s that? How— How do you do it?

134
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:10,358
Can we play a game so that we’re not just drinking?

135
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,384
What game?

136
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:12,605
Body shot!

137
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:13,898
I’m in!

138
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,233
Join in, you two.

139
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,360
- Don’t be a killjoy. - You heard that, Kalix Jace.

140
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,903
Killjoys aren’t welcome here.

141
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:20,920
- What are the game mechanics? - Nothing.

142
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:23,283
You just choose the person you want to do a body shot with.

143
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:24,534
Should I go first?

144
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:26,077
- I’ll do it. - Okay!

145
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:28,121
Everyone’s joining, okay?

146
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:30,707
Pour a lot.

147
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:31,791
Let’s go, Yanna.

148
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,303
- I’ll take a full shot. - Full shot!

149
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:34,703
Full shot! Full shot!

150
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:36,272
Don’t you dare me.

151
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,220
Just kidding.

152
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,970
- Let’s go! - They don’t have to be too naughty.

153
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:57,192
So, I’m your first victim, huh?

154
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:00,445
Your turn!

155
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:02,113
Why me?

156
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:03,656
Because we said so.

157
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:04,866
Come on.

158
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,249
You don’t have to think about it,

159
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:08,802
we all know that you want to do a body shot with Luna.

160
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:11,162
Hey, stop putting pressure on him.

161
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:12,646
Come on, girls…

162
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,325
Oh, come on. Please?

163
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,128
No killjoys, right?

164
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:19,005
All right, take the shot.

165
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:20,280
No turning back now.

166
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:21,765
Go, Luna!

167
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,009
Hurry up!

168
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:53,623
Really? That’s so lame.

169
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:55,667
Couldn’t you make it more intense?

170
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:56,751
- Yes! Ours was– - Right here, see?

171
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:58,127
- Right here. - I know right.

172
00:10:58,127 --> 00:10:59,587
Luna, show Kalix how it’s done.

173
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:00,880
Huh?

174
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,006
What? Why me?

175
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:04,342
- Go girl! - We’re all doing it.

176
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:05,969
And this is me talking.

177
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,011
Can’t I do it with Via?

178
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:10,014
Seriously? He’s right there. Go for Kalix.

179
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:11,432
Hurry up and do a body shot with Kalix!

180
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:13,101
- Do it with Kalix. - Do it, Luna.

181
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,352
Go girl!

182
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,271
Body shot with Kalix, hurry!

183
00:11:16,271 --> 00:11:17,897
Okay, fine! Fine.

184
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:20,692
Okay, another drink.

185
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,665
That’s it?

186
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:40,378
How boring. Let’s just go dance, guys.

187
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:41,671
Let’s go, hurry! Let’s dance.

188
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:43,923
- Come on. - Let’s go, let’s go!

189
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:46,092
Okay, we’re just gonna dance.

190
00:11:56,602 --> 00:11:58,280
What time is your flight tomorrow?

191
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,484
11 AM. I have to be there after lunch.

192
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,157
So, does that mean that you can’t sleep late tonight?

193
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:11,570
I can.

194
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:17,582
This is my only chance to enjoy Boracay with you.

195
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,336
Okay. Let’s make it worth it.

196
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:26,007
You wanna dance?

197
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:27,800
- Come on! - I don’t know how to dance.

198
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,302
Come on! I’ll teach you.

199
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,386
Come on.

200
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,221
Let’s dance, let’s dance.

201
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:38,378
So, just feel the vibe and listen to the music.

202
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:04,170
You look great today.

203
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:07,340
You look hot.

204
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:43,501
Just a minute, I’ll get us some drinks.

205
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:44,669
Okay.

206
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:48,589
Hey, hold on.

207
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,007
You dropped this.

208
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:51,509
I’m sorry.

209
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,929
Turn around.

210
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,514
Can I?

211
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,249
Are you cold?

212
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,628
A bit. The air is getting quite chilly.

213
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:29,604
I have a jacket

214
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,007
in my bedroom.

215
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:33,426
I can pick it up before going to the after party.

216
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:34,802
No, it’s okay.

217
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:36,804
I insist.

218
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:43,220
You might get sick.

219
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:53,485
Fine. I’ll go with you to keep you company.

220
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:56,449
Okay.

221
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:35,279
Your jacket.

222
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,364
Thanks.

223
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:53,297
I’ll help you.

224
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:23,744
What’s wrong?

225
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:28,082
Nothing.

226
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:37,758
Let’s go.

227
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:40,720
Okay.

228
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,087
I love you, Luna.

229
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,626
Stand up.

230
00:17:53,785 --> 00:17:55,036
What?

231
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,614
Good morning.

232
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,777
Good morning.

233
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,663
You’re leaving?

234
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,533
Yes, love.

235
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:35,526
Have to catch a flight.

236
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:37,869
It’s okay.

237
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:41,424
I’m sorry.

238
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:43,368
You weren’t able to sleep last night.

239
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,818
There’s nothing to be sorry about.

240
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:48,730
Come here.

241
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:54,796
Closer.

242
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:07,159
Good?

243
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:15,034
Luna?

244
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,456
Yes?

245
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:20,414
What are your thoughts about marrying me?

246
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:28,804
Are you proposing right now?

247
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:32,509
I’m just asking you a question.

248
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:39,237
I haven’t thought about it yet.

249
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:40,581
Don’t worry.

250
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:41,977
No pressure.

251
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,660
I just wanna let you know that those thoughts cross my mind.

252
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:50,301
We can talk about it more when we both get back.

253
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:53,338
I’m just handling a big case right now so I’ll be busy.

254
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,919
But after that,

255
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,225
can I take you out?

256
00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:05,132
Of course.

257
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,592
Thank you for this short trip but sweet.

258
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,854
I’ll never forget this.

259
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,562
Take care.

260
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,831
I will.

261
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,324
- Bye. - See you.

262
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:45,714
Hey!

263
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:48,995
You girls really had fun in Boracay, huh? I saw the social posts.

264
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:51,111
Where’s Luna, by the way? What’s taking so long?

265
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:54,014
She texted me that she’s just parking. She’ll be on her way.

266
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:58,102
Excuse me, sir. Your meals are ready. Should I serve it now?

267
00:20:58,102 --> 00:21:01,313
Sure, please have this table ready first then serve it.

268
00:21:01,313 --> 00:21:02,933
Oh, wait a minute!

269
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:08,362
It’s so good. Thank you!

270
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,718
I miss hanging out here. Do you remember, back in college?

271
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:17,621
You’re right. I miss it too.

272
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,789
And the view–

273
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,124
Oh, there she is.

274
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:22,918
Hey, guys!

275
00:21:22,918 --> 00:21:27,715
My god, I was swamped with work and the traffic was so bad.

276
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:29,511
So…

277
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,784
What’s up with you and Kalix?

278
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:32,893
Have you seen him recently?

279
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:35,431
Really, Sevi, that’s your first question?

280
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:38,534
Not even a “How are you? Are you okay?”

281
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,972
But no.

282
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:41,979
We haven’t even talked to each other yet.

283
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:42,730
Huh?

284
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,190
It’s been almost two weeks since the Boracay trip.

285
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,650
How come you two haven’t spoken yet?

286
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,878
Is he still busy?

287
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:52,156
I figured. He hasn’t been visiting the site, too.

288
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:54,992
That’s because he’s handling a pretty big case right now.

289
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:57,143
Besides, he’s been updating me anyway.

290
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:00,206
I’m not even his girlfriend. So who am I to demand?

291
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:03,704
Why aren’t you though?

292
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:09,104
They had the chance to actually talk about their status when they were in Boracay.

293
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:11,220
But they did something else.

294
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:12,509
- Because they— - Nope, nope.

295
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:14,136
- I don’t want to hear the details. - Listen.

296
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:15,361
We're conservative here.

297
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:16,639
- Tell him. - I don’t want to hear it.

298
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:17,431
You need to.
- You need to. - I don’t.

299
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,976
- Tell him. - So this is what happened—

300
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:22,394
We just enjoyed ourselves.

301
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,229
Come on.

302
00:22:24,605 --> 00:22:28,150
Wasn’t your status already confirmed after what happened?

303
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,526
I mean, that wasn’t just a hookup, right?

304
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:30,861
Of course not.

305
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:33,948
And he even talked about marriage.

306
00:22:33,973 --> 00:22:36,058
That’s a whole other level, Luna.

307
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,201
You’re right.

308
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:44,189
But I still want us to talk things through on what our status really is.

309
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:47,394
I also want to hear it from him directly.

310
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,214
Like what Ke said, we don’t need to rush.

311
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:52,800
So, I’m willing to wait for Kalix.

312
00:22:58,321 --> 00:22:59,990
There really is a miracle!

313
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:02,284
The Luna Valeria,

314
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:04,269
is now willing to wait?

315
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:06,563
She’s not jumping to conclusions now

316
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:08,440
and she’s willing to listen first before reacting.

317
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,234
She also trusts him.

318
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:11,735
Wow! Major upgrade, girl.

319
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:14,738
Come on, guys, nothing new here.

320
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:16,065
It’s just me, Luna.

321
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:18,534
A very patient, Luna.

322
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:20,518
She knows how to wait now.

323
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:23,797
It’s Kalix.

324
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:25,199
And she’s quick, too.

325
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:26,709
Can we meet tomorrow…

326
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,836
Can we meet tomorrow?

327
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:30,295
I have a meeting tomorrow.

328
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,505
A meeting?

329
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:33,507
Oh, I can have it cleared up. I can clear it up.

330
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:34,967
I don’t think she’s talking to us.

331
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:36,844
She just said that she can wait.

332
00:23:36,844 --> 00:23:39,680
- But she quickly cancelled— - So quick…

333
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,807
- Amazing. - Did I say, upgrade?

334
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:43,642
- No, I said you’re pretty! So pretty. - Nothing, nothing at all.

335
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:45,811
- Awesome, right? - So pretty.

336
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:16,842
Why are we here?

337
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:19,136
Is this where our date will be?

338
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:21,513
I bought this land before.

339
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:23,307
I wanted to show it to you.

340
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,647
So, you brought me here to get my opinion as an architect.

341
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:33,067
Maybe.

342
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:36,862
I’m just kidding.

343
00:24:36,862 --> 00:24:39,156
I’m gonna bring you to Tagaytay.

344
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:41,158
But, before that,

345
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:43,273
I wanted to show you this lot

346
00:24:44,203 --> 00:24:46,297
and know your opinion about it.

347
00:24:48,248 --> 00:24:49,500
You’re getting spoiled.

348
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,912
You should’ve set a meeting with me.

349
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:54,706
Everything I do as an architect is paid, you know.

350
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:56,048
I’m willing to pay.

351
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:58,258
Is that so? Well then, okay.

352
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,382
I like the location

353
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:06,058
and the lot is pretty big.

354
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:07,601
What do you plan to do here?

355
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:10,104
I don’t know… yet.

356
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,600
Just sell it to me.

357
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:15,442
I’ve been looking for a lot for my dream house.

358
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:18,153
This is perfect.

359
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:20,437
Sure.

360
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:21,735
Really?

361
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,136
For how much?

362
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:28,205
60 million.

363
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:30,207
60 million?

364
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:31,917
Isn’t that too much?

365
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:34,242
Don’t you have any…

366
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:35,727
discounts?

367
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:37,796
An ex-girlfriend discount or something.

368
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:44,638
I know an easier way and cheaper way too for you to get this lot.

369
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:46,265
Okay then, let’s negotiate.

370
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,465
Well,

371
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:50,727
you can marry me.

372
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:58,234
Stop joking around.

373
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,310
The price for an ex-girlfriend is 60 million

374
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:02,545
but if you'll be my wife, it's free.

375
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,351
This is the second time you did this.

376
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,697
The next time you propose, I’m just gonna think that it’s a joke.

377
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:15,942
Hold on, wait.

378
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:17,552
I have to get this.

379
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,257
Hello?

380
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:21,800
What’s up?

381
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:24,553
What?

382
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:27,181
Okay. Yes, sure.

383
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:28,807
Just text me the address.

384
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:30,601
I’ll be there. Bye.

385
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,752
- I have to go, sorry— - What happened?

386
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,104
Amy was rushed to the hospital

387
00:26:36,104 --> 00:26:38,626
and Leo doesn’t want to give me the full details yet.

388
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,943
I’m worried.

389
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:42,065
Let’s go then. Let’s go to the hospital.

390
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:43,843
You’re okay with that?

391
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,135
Come on, Kalix.

392
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:48,463
You’re friends with Amy and I know you’re worried.

393
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:51,016
- Let’s go? - Yes, let’s go.

394
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,751
How’s Amy?

395
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:57,377
Amy was shot.

396
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:01,590
How is she?

397
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,300
Don’t worry, the bullet wasn’t too deep

398
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,719
so they were able to get it out.

399
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:07,763
She was conscious earlier.

400
00:27:07,763 --> 00:27:09,389
Maybe she just fell asleep.

401
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,894
Why was she shot?

402
00:27:13,894 --> 00:27:15,437
Do you have a suspect in mind?

403
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:17,657
She’s been receiving death threats ever since

404
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:19,679
she lost Miguel’s case and he went to jail.

405
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:24,613
Kalix, there’s paperwork I have to do.

406
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,115
You take care of Amy for now.

407
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:28,283
Her family is on the way.

408
00:27:28,453 --> 00:27:29,813
Sorry. Excuse me.

409
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:33,413
You wanna go in?

410
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:35,101
Do you want to check up on Amy?

411
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:39,954
I don’t know if I can, Luna.

412
00:27:40,754 --> 00:27:42,373
I feel bad.

413
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:44,109
It’s my fault.

414
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:46,735
I was the one to ask her

415
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,929
to take on Miguel’s case.

416
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:50,931
Why would you do that?

417
00:27:51,306 --> 00:27:53,392
I asked Amy to play dirty.

418
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,602
Since the people that she was going to defend

419
00:27:55,602 --> 00:27:57,980
were already playing dirty in the first place.

420
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,691
She was making Miguel’s camp believe that

421
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:02,359
she was preparing to win the case

422
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:05,926
when actually she was just digging his grave.

423
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:09,496
I’m surprised that Amy accepted the case.

424
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:17,075
She asked for my forgiveness.

425
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,661
Those were my condition.

426
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:23,665
She had to accept the case and lose it.

427
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:25,841
But—

428
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:28,096
How could she do that?

429
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:30,248
Wasn’t that against your oath?

430
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:32,108
Amy did her job.

431
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:34,467
She defended Miguel in court.

432
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:37,311
She just didn’t do it well on purpose

433
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:41,440
and trust me it takes a lot of skills for a lawyer to intentionally lose a case.

434
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,926
Besides, Miguel’s family wanted Amy to pin the crime

435
00:28:43,926 --> 00:28:46,059
on someone else just to win the case.

436
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,199
An innocent person, Luna.

437
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,067
They’ve even tried to pay the first prosecutor.

438
00:28:52,117 --> 00:28:54,494
They tried to play with the justice system.

439
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:58,246
Amy never played dirty before but I told her that if she’s going to,

440
00:28:58,587 --> 00:29:00,618
to do it with someone like Miguel.

441
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:03,538
He deserved it.

442
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:08,884
I can be professional with Attorney Martinez.

443
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:10,677
But I don’t wanna work with him.

444
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:13,305
I’ve heard he protected an abuser, Dad.

445
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:16,510
I did my research and I didn’t really see Kalix's name

446
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:19,645
in the list of the Villaflors’ legal representatives.

447
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:22,718
I did see Amethyst’s name, though.

448
00:29:22,873 --> 00:29:24,541
Kalix asked her to take it.

449
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,777
That was also Amy’s first loss.

450
00:29:26,777 --> 00:29:29,043
If I had taken that case,

451
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:31,402
you would have hated me forever.

452
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,232
You would have never talked to me again.

453
00:29:34,257 --> 00:29:36,551
I can't ever live with that.

454
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:43,637
I’m really sorry if I disappointed you.

455
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,918
I just—

456
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:51,047
didn’t know that things would turn out the way they did.

457
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:56,281
Kalix,

458
00:29:56,306 --> 00:29:58,600
don’t be too hard on yourself.

459
00:29:59,768 --> 00:30:04,189
At the end of the day, the intention was to send a bad guy to jail.

460
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:08,693
Amy will be okay.

461
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:11,738
She’s a strong person.

462
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:18,995
How are you feeling?

463
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:21,289
I’m fine. It’s not severe.

464
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:23,834
I told you to tighten your security.

465
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:26,977
Kalix, I’ve been a criminal lawyer for years now.

466
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:30,130
I get death threats all the time. It’s just—

467
00:30:30,155 --> 00:30:32,491
Just so happens that this pushed through.

468
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:35,519
He’s a crazy, damn politician.

469
00:30:35,554 --> 00:30:37,097
You should have known better.

470
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:39,307
What? So it’s my fault now?

471
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:41,852
Kalix.

472
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:45,272
Maybe you should go out and buy our food.

473
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:47,482
I’ll stay here with Amy.

474
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:55,198
Fine.

475
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:09,963
Are you gonna scold me too?

476
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:11,756
Why would I?

477
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:13,258
I’m glad you’re alive.

478
00:31:13,258 --> 00:31:15,510
I won’t die that easily.

479
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:19,890
Luna?

480
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:25,437
I almost died today.

481
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:30,817
And that changes a person’s perspective.

482
00:31:31,397 --> 00:31:32,866
So let me be direct.

483
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:37,199
I’m so sorry.

484
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,371
I’m so sorry for everything that I’ve done to you and Kalix.

485
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:45,707
I’ve ruined your relationship.

486
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:48,335
I fucked up.

487
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:50,962
I know that the damage has been done

488
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:53,965
and this apology is years too late but—

489
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:56,593
Still, I’m sorry.

490
00:31:57,636 --> 00:31:59,930
I guess I was scared to talk to you?

491
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,725
Because Kalix was so ruthless with me and I just couldn’t

492
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,644
handle another tirade,

493
00:32:05,644 --> 00:32:08,355
even if I knew I deserved it.

494
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:11,316
To be honest,

495
00:32:12,984 --> 00:32:15,153
I was really upset with you.

496
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:19,533
My life changed because of what you did.

497
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:22,244
I lost years with Kalix.

498
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:25,622
I even questioned my own worth.

499
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:30,502
That’s the kind of pain I wish you would never experience.

500
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:34,631
It’s so hard to build yourself up again.

501
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:38,843
I’m not gonna make excuses for my behavior.

502
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:45,475
And I begged Kalix for forgiveness years ago so now I just—

503
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:47,936
I just wanna beg for yours.

504
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:52,607
You don’t have to beg.

505
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:57,153
If Kalix forgave you, why wouldn’t I?

506
00:32:57,862 --> 00:33:00,365
Besides, it’s not good to hold on to grudges.

507
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:05,245
I forgive you, Amy.

508
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,417
Thank you, Luna.

509
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:14,421
I’ve been ridden of guilt all these years

510
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:18,383
and I’m just so happy I get to do this in person.

511
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:20,885
Just promise me, you’ve changed.

512
00:33:22,262 --> 00:33:23,680
Yes.

513
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:27,225
I believe in karma.

514
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:29,352
Maybe this is my karma.

515
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:32,063
Just trying to be a better person now.

516
00:33:55,295 --> 00:33:58,715
Wow! You really prepared.

517
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:14,814
Wine?

518
00:34:38,171 --> 00:34:39,923
Cheers.

519
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:00,402
Luna…

520
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:04,864
I know I mentioned it before as a joke.

521
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:09,577
And right now I just want to be clear.

522
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:13,456
I want us to get back together

523
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:16,334
with the intention of marrying you.

524
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:21,881
I know

525
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:26,845
I had a lot of shortcomings before.

526
00:35:29,723 --> 00:35:31,766
But this time I’ll do better.

527
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,771
I wanna be braver,

528
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:40,442
more protective of us,

529
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:46,156
to the extent that I won’t let anything

530
00:35:46,865 --> 00:35:50,406
or anyone ruin our relationship again.

531
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:55,851
So many things have happened in our lives

532
00:35:58,168 --> 00:36:01,781
but my love for you only grew stronger.

533
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:10,116
It’s been almost ten years,

534
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:15,143
but it’s still you.

535
00:36:17,604 --> 00:36:21,149
And it will always be you.

536
00:36:26,613 --> 00:36:29,824
That was an amazing speech.

537
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,493
I feel a bit pressured.

538
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,292
You’re not the only one with shortcomings, Kalix.

539
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:42,212
So do I.

540
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:45,840
I want to be better too.

541
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:50,178
Let’s grow old together?

542
00:36:54,098 --> 00:36:55,809
Yes,

543
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:58,520
I want us to be together.

544
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,608
I still love you, Kalix.

545
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:32,512
I love you, Luna.

546
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:36,307
So,

547
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:40,270
let’s do the boyfriend-girlfriend thing?

548
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:50,155
Did you plan this, too?

549
00:37:55,076 --> 00:38:00,206
I guess the world also wants to celebrate us.

550
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,631
I love you.

551
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:11,175
I love you.

552
00:38:53,676 --> 00:38:54,928
Ate Luna!

553
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,889
Hi. Hi Kio.

554
00:38:58,194 --> 00:38:59,571
Hello!

555
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:03,686
Luna, this is Kelsey, my sister.

556
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:06,814
Hi Luna! It’s nice to finally meet you.

557
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,155
I feel the same way too, Doc.

558
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:11,861
Please, just Kelsey is fine.

559
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:15,657
I can’t believe I was just in med school when you guys first got together.

560
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:17,024
And now we’re here.

561
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:18,660
Where’s Mom and Dad?

562
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,745
Oh yeah, we’re just waiting for the reservation.

563
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:21,913
Come on, let’s go see them.

564
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:23,665
- Okay. - Kio, let’s go.

565
00:39:28,753 --> 00:39:30,964
Mom, Dad, look who’s here.

566
00:39:30,964 --> 00:39:32,465
Luna…

567
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:35,802
I’m glad you can join us today.

568
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:38,471
It’s nice to see you two together.

569
00:39:38,471 --> 00:39:40,264
Thank you, Doc.

570
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:41,849
Mom,

571
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,768
Luna wants to say hi.

572
00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:46,020
Hi, Doc.

573
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:48,272
Architect Valeria,

574
00:39:48,272 --> 00:39:50,316
so good to see you.

575
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:55,280
Thank you for inviting me and you can call me Luna.

576
00:39:57,115 --> 00:39:59,117
Sir Martinez, table’s ready.

577
00:39:59,117 --> 00:40:01,077
Okay, let’s go.

578
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:03,246
Kalix, can I talk to Luna privately?

579
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:04,738
- Go ahead. - Okay.

580
00:40:04,763 --> 00:40:06,014
Sure.

581
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:10,753
Luna,

582
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:14,173
I’ve never seen Kalix smile this much.

583
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:16,676
Not even when he topped the bar.

584
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,986
So,

585
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:20,064
I think you’re really making him happy.

586
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:23,271
I try my best to be there for him.

587
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,535
You know what Luna,

588
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,855
Kalix and I did not have the best relationship.

589
00:40:28,855 --> 00:40:32,721
We had issues, we still argue every now and then.

590
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:36,018
But I love my son, dearly.

591
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:38,489
And I’m glad he—

592
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:41,831
He found someone to love and care about.

593
00:40:44,537 --> 00:40:47,290
Luna, you promise me you’ll continue being there for Kalix?

594
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,916
Because you’re good for him.

595
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:52,086
Yes and thank you.

596
00:40:52,837 --> 00:40:54,922
I’ll support Kalix no matter what.

597
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,966
- Really? - Yes.

598
00:40:57,967 --> 00:40:59,677
Thank you.

599
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,203
Thank you, Luna.

600
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,015
Luna,

601
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:05,767
am I making you nervous?

602
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:07,875
Your hand’s cold.

603
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:10,329
Don’t be, okay?

604
00:41:10,354 --> 00:41:12,383
I’m just like this but I don’t bite.

605
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,390
You know how mothers are.

606
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:18,529
- Mom. - Yes?

607
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:19,547
Luna.

608
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:21,146
Everything all right?

609
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:22,770
Yes!

610
00:41:22,795 --> 00:41:24,797
We were talking about you.

611
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:27,426
Okay. Let’s go.

612
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:29,092
Let’s go.

613
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,876
Cheers everyone!

614
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:33,669
Cheers!

615
00:41:33,694 --> 00:41:34,862
Let’s party tonight!

616
00:41:36,881 --> 00:41:38,007
It’s good.

617
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:40,051
Hey, where’s Luna?

618
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:42,512
I don’t know. I’ve been texting her but she hasn’t responded.

619
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:44,055
Where could she be?

620
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:46,224
Text her again. She must’ve fallen asleep.

621
00:41:46,224 --> 00:41:47,642
Guys, try the food.

622
00:41:47,642 --> 00:41:49,018
- She’s here! - It’s delicious.

623
00:41:49,018 --> 00:41:50,022
Hey!

624
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:51,270
Are you two back together?

625
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,688
Oh my god!

626
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:58,194
I never doubted you two.

627
00:41:58,736 --> 00:42:00,530
Glad you got back together with him, Luna.

628
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,407
I’m so happy for the two of you.

629
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:05,701
So, why were you two late?

630
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,997
But what happened? Tell us everything!

631
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:11,249
Tell us!

632
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:13,584
Bro, you better take care of my best friend.

633
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:15,253
I’ve grown so tired of her.

634
00:42:15,253 --> 00:42:17,880
Wow! Seriously, Sevi.

635
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,326
No, just kidding.

636
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:21,961
Just make sure to love each other, bro.

637
00:42:22,927 --> 00:42:25,638
Hey Kalix, I know where you live.

638
00:42:25,638 --> 00:42:28,724
If you ever make Luna cry, you’ll be dealing with us.

639
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:32,311
Heard that? That was a threat so you better watch out.

640
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:33,729
Yes, ma’am.

641
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,912
Such a princess!

642
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,959
Guys, before anything else.

643
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:46,676
Drink… Here you go, Kalix.

644
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:51,330
Cheers to Luna and Kalix. LuKal forever!

645
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:53,315
Cheers!

646
00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:01,492
I saw that!

647
00:43:17,057 --> 00:43:18,391
How is it?

648
00:43:19,357 --> 00:43:21,276
Show me the pregnancy test.

649
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:25,281
Two lines.

650
00:43:26,657 --> 00:43:27,867
- Two lines! - Oh my god! Oh my god!

651
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:29,994
Luna, it’s positive! It's positive!

652
00:43:29,994 --> 00:43:31,078
OMG!

653
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:33,331
Avi finally has a playmate!

654
00:43:33,331 --> 00:43:35,291
I’m so glad I had my stay extended!

655
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:39,086
I wouldn’t miss this for anything!

656
00:43:40,504 --> 00:43:42,632
Why are you crying?

657
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,220
I’m just so happy.

658
00:43:48,484 --> 00:43:49,639
I—

659
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:53,219
I can’t believe Kalix and I are gonna have a baby.

660
00:43:55,186 --> 00:43:59,732
I’m just not sure if he’s ready to start a family.

661
00:44:00,316 --> 00:44:03,486
Come on… Seriously?

662
00:44:03,486 --> 00:44:05,351
He’s even more excited than you.

663
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:08,532
It’ll be fine, Luna.

664
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:09,700
You can do this!

665
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,203
Right, he’s going to be so happy, Luna.

666
00:44:12,203 --> 00:44:13,496
Trust us.

667
00:44:13,496 --> 00:44:16,332
Really? You really think so?

668
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:18,209
You think he’s ready to start a family?

669
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:23,130
Of course, you’re the only one he’s waiting for.

670
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:28,320
Besides, we’re sure that you two will be the best parents.

671
00:44:28,534 --> 00:44:30,995
And you guys will be the best godmothers.

672
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,560
Congratulations!

673
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,563
- Thank you! - Careful now.

674
00:44:44,627 --> 00:44:46,570
It’s a little bit cloudy right now,

675
00:44:46,736 --> 00:44:48,749
but it’s going to be a full moon tonight.

676
00:44:49,824 --> 00:44:51,026
Hope we see it.

677
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,541
Are you okay?

678
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:02,295
Yes, I’m more than okay.

679
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:11,026
I have a gift for you.

680
00:45:11,554 --> 00:45:12,573
A gift?

681
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,739
What’s the occasion?

682
00:45:16,434 --> 00:45:17,560
That’s so sweet of you.

683
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,728
Thank you, Love.

684
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:20,021
Just open it.

685
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:40,061
Luna…

686
00:45:47,715 --> 00:45:49,550
I’m going to be a dad?

687
00:45:56,724 --> 00:45:58,392
You’re not kidding me?

688
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,646
Are you happy?

689
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:04,732
Yes!

690
00:46:06,525 --> 00:46:08,110
Fuck, yes!

691
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:10,137
Of course!

692
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:19,058
Are you happy?

693
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:21,705
Of course, I’m happy.

694
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:24,668
We’re going to be a family.

695
00:46:28,062 --> 00:46:29,313
Luna,

696
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:31,465
I have a gift for you, too.

697
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:50,327
I’ve been meaning to ask you for the longest time.

698
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:57,245
Please.

699
00:46:57,616 --> 00:46:58,932
Marry me,

700
00:46:59,602 --> 00:47:01,627
Architect Luna Valeria?

701
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:04,262
Please?

702
00:47:10,714 --> 00:47:12,174
What’s wrong?

703
00:47:12,174 --> 00:47:15,386
Love, you’re crying and laughing at the same time.

704
00:47:15,386 --> 00:47:18,347
I know, I’m just— I’m just so happy.

705
00:47:19,056 --> 00:47:22,309
And it’s because of you.

706
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,054
It’s all because of you.

707
00:47:27,022 --> 00:47:29,059
I love you so much,

708
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:36,128
Attorney Kalix Jace Martinez.

709
00:47:39,535 --> 00:47:42,621
Yes, of course I’ll marry you.

710
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:01,474
Let’s do the husband-wife thing?

711
00:48:01,474 --> 00:48:03,511
Yeah.

712
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:11,011
I love you, Luna.

713
00:48:13,944 --> 00:48:16,322
I love you, Kalix.

714
00:48:18,574 --> 00:48:21,076
We love you, too, little one.

715
00:48:21,452 --> 00:48:24,079
- We love you, too. - We love you, too.

716
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:25,864
Oh my god!

717
00:48:26,393 --> 00:48:27,455
Hi.

718
00:48:29,298 --> 00:48:31,092
Oh my god!

719
00:50:47,765 --> 00:50:50,017
I can’t imagine myself enjoying this life

720
00:50:50,017 --> 00:50:52,269
with anyone else but Luna.

721
00:50:52,269 --> 00:50:54,855
With her, I have the moon… and the stars.

722
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:57,507
I couldn’t ask for more.

723
00:51:40,984 --> 00:51:42,236
Action!

724
00:51:42,236 --> 00:51:43,737
Sorry.

725
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:47,032
Marco! Cut.

726
00:51:47,032 --> 00:51:48,033
I didn't do anything.

727
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:49,521
Don't you laugh.

728
00:51:49,546 --> 00:51:51,054
Ready. Okay.

729
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:57,693
You're really not helping.

730
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:00,779
And...

731
00:52:00,804 --> 00:52:02,305
I didn't do anything.

732
00:52:02,439 --> 00:52:04,525
Ready, and action!

733
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,926
Let's feast!

734
00:52:10,305 --> 00:52:12,266
My parents are already on the way.

735
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:15,602
Come on, let's go.

736
00:52:17,508 --> 00:52:19,960
Direk, Marco is not helping.

737
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:25,088
Luna.

738
00:52:25,304 --> 00:52:26,447
What is that?

739
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:28,031
Behind Marco?

740
00:52:29,156 --> 00:52:31,075
Stop that, stop that!

741
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:33,507
It hurts.

742
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:40,470
Sorry.

743
00:52:40,495 --> 00:52:42,499
Sorry! Are you okay?

744
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:50,053
Now look at the underwears.

745
00:52:51,998 --> 00:52:53,499
Cut! Good!

746
00:52:56,182 --> 00:52:57,392
Action!

747
00:53:01,273 --> 00:53:02,274
Sorry!

748
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:03,871
Shake it off.

749
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,198
Heaven!
