1
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:13,179
Wow!

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,306
What? Boracay?

3
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,891
Boracay is so beautiful.

4
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,936
I’ve been here a couple of times, but I don’t know why–

5
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,604
It’s more beautiful now.

6
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,485
Maybe you can finish that later?

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,501
Luna?

8
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:29,902
Where are you?

9
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:32,556
- Kalix! - Luna!

10
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:35,749
I admit, I was really hurt.

11
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:39,236
But I shouldn’t have walked out on you. I should have talked to you first.

12
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:41,551
Good morning, Ke!

13
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:44,412
This is Miguel, my boyfriend.

14
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,746
I never said anything about your men, Yanna.

15
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:49,799
What did you just say?

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,925
Hey!

17
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,552
- Yanna! - Hey!

18
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,997
Are you busy? Can we talk?

19
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:33,857
Yes, Dad. Come in.

20
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,862
I heard you declined the project of Mr. Martinez.

21
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:51,563
Dad, we have other architects that can do the job.

22
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:52,964
Why does it have to be me?

23
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,604
These kind of projects

24
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,231
don’t come very often.

25
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,543
The pay is good.

26
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:00,704
Besides,

27
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:03,625
this client has very good connections.

28
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:05,884
It’s not about that.

29
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:06,947
I know.

30
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:09,923
I know you have a past with him.

31
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:14,454
But can’t you approach it professionally?

32
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:17,678
I can be professional with Attorney Martinez.

33
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:19,887
But I don’t wanna work with him.

34
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,927
I’ve heard he protected an abuser, Dad.

35
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:26,840
You know what, I know Kalix used to...

36
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:30,477
be an associate of this notorious law firm before.

37
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,097
But they’ve since parted ways.

38
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:35,271
That shouldn’t define him.

39
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:40,499
Let me give you a different perspective, dear.

40
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:42,584
Do you still remember,

41
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:45,604
the fiasco that happened in the Cavite house?

42
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:48,006
Yes, what about it?

43
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,884
It was his law firm who settled the lawsuit for us.

44
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:55,639
Huh?

45
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,833
Yes.

46
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:59,017
Why didn't you told me this?

47
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:00,644
This is my project, Dad.

48
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:01,883
I’m sorry.

49
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:04,189
I know I should have told you earlier

50
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,061
but Kalix insisted not to let you know.

51
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:10,277
We agreed so that you won’t have to worry about it.

52
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,531
It was his law firm

53
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:19,621
who identified that the contractor was ordering substandard materials

54
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:21,308
which caused the house to collapse.

55
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:26,535
If it weren’t for him, our construction company might be closed by now.

56
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:34,553
So, I owe him now?

57
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:35,711
No.

58
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,700
Of course not.

59
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:42,988
I’m just saying that you should reconsider.

60
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,897
But if you’re really decided on declining, I won’t stop you.

61
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:51,358
I know where you’re coming from.

62
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:14,927
Hey Architect, your coffee's getting cold. Your face is begging for it.

63
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:16,460
It’s all messed up.

64
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:19,389
Well, your face is effortlessly messed up, you know.

65
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,704
So is it true?

66
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,156
Kalix was the one who helped us then?

67
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:25,889
They found out that we weren’t at fault.

68
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:29,436
Kalix’s team got us solid evidence

69
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,527
that cleared us from accountability.

70
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,072
But we still compensated all of the victims even if it wasn’t our fault.

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,359
Because that’s what’s right, Sevi.

72
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:39,624
We value our principles.

73
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:41,470
Unlike someone I know.

74
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,906
Like Kalix?

75
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,515
I mean, I’m grateful for what he did.

76
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:52,614
But it doesn’t change the fact that he’s still part of the abuser’s legal team.

77
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:55,526
And for everything else he did in the past.

78
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,936
Besides, I bet he’d be so hard to work with.

79
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:05,434
He’s such a demanding perfectionist so it’ll be hard to please him.

80
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:07,948
I get that, Luna.

81
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:11,248
This is definitely a hard situation for you.

82
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:13,650
Thinking about it…

83
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:17,032
we can’t deny how great this project is.

84
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:18,537
But at the same time,

85
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:21,400
it’s going to open up the past you and Kalix had.

86
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,887
Just know that whatever your decision will be,

87
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:26,957
I’m here to support you.

88
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:48,344
Good morning, may I speak with Attorney Martinez?

89
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:50,291
Good morning. Your name please?

90
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:52,387
Architect Luna Valeria.

91
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:53,715
Wait a second.

92
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,291
Do you have an appointment?

93
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,715
I don’t see your name in his list of appointments today.

94
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:00,536
I don’t have an appointment

95
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:05,065
but we have a possible project to do. So can you set up a meeting with him?

96
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:08,694
I’m sorry, ma’am. Attorney’s schedule this week is full.

97
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:13,208
If it’s urgent, you can go ahead and call him or just send him a message.

98
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,613
Luna: Hello, this is Architect Luna Valeria.

99
00:07:31,638 --> 00:07:36,755
I’m here at the lobby of your firm. We need to talk.

100
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,451
Kalix: I can’t. I have clients. We can talk tomorrow.

101
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:06,095
Luna: It’s important. I can wait here.

102
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:12,630
Hello?

103
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,344
All right, then.

104
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:19,181
Architect Valeria?

105
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,221
Yes?

106
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:25,803
All good, now. Attorney’s secretary will be with you shortly.

107
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,479
Thanks.

108
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:31,026
Welcome, ma’am. Please come in.

109
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:34,276
So this is the office of Attorney Martinez.

110
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:36,535
Thanks.

111
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,815
Sorry, what’s your name again?

112
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:40,244
Jolly.

113
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:43,622
The cute secretary of Attorney Martinez.

114
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:45,666
The name suits you.

115
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,334
Oh, thank you, ma’am.

116
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:53,132
Is this whole floor the office of Kal– Attorney Martinez?

117
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:55,008
Yes, ma’am.

118
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:58,008
A lot of people wonder the same thing

119
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:01,808
since Attorney Martinez is quite young yet very successful.

120
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,901
He’s not just good at his work, he’s also very humble.

121
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:07,920
That’s why good karma just runs back to him.

122
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:12,084
Not a single person thinks badly of him.

123
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:20,704
Everyone you see here loves Attorney Martinez.

124
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,529
Oh ma’am, if only I was single,

125
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:25,683
I’d be hitting on him.

126
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:32,838
Do you have any idea what time he's coming?

127
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,341
I’m not sure on the exact time, ma’am.

128
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:39,219
I actually just squeezed this meeting in his schedule.

129
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:42,306
But don’t you worry, I’m sure he’ll be back anytime soon.

130
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:45,159
So, for the meantime, please wait here.

131
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:49,479
You want anything? Coffee, tea, water, chips?

132
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,606
I’ll just have water, Jolly.

133
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,482
Water. Sure, no problem.

134
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:54,902
Please have a seat, ma’am. I’ll get your water.

135
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:55,944
- Okay, thank you. - Okay?

136
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:58,238
Okay, I’ll be right back. Have a jolly morning.

137
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:35,768
Is this the one?

138
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:39,979
Impossible.

139
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:44,361
Really?

140
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,119
We’ll be together for Christmas–

141
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,678
in New York?

142
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,308
I can’t believe it!

143
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,657
Me too.

144
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:55,170
This is amazing.

145
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,856
Our families are both going to the U.S.

146
00:10:58,006 --> 00:11:02,261
New York and New Jersey are pretty close to each other, right?

147
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:05,271
Yes! We can easily meet up there.

148
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:11,144
I’m so excited since it’s just going to be my second time going there.

149
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:13,318
I have a lot I wanna go to.

150
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:16,074
We can do everything you want there.

151
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:19,056
And we’ll do everything you want, too.

152
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,613
Everything?

153
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,158
Are you sure?

154
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,708
Don’t be silly!

155
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:32,124
But before that,

156
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,467
there’s something I want to do.

157
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:39,795
If it’s okay with you, I’d like to finally introduce you to my parents.

158
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,561
That way, we can ask permission from them personally.

159
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,026
Sure.

160
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:49,636
I’d love to.

161
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,630
I’ll show them that you’re safe with me.

162
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:06,854
Mom, Dad!

163
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,191
- Luna! - Hello.

164
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:11,287
Hello.

165
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,176
Mom, Dad…

166
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,861
This is Kalix, my boyfriend.

167
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:21,262
Hello, nice to meet you.

168
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,035
Nice to meet you too.

169
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:26,553
Perfect timing, we just ordered appetizers.

170
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:27,924
No, no. It’s okay.

171
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:29,813
Just sit down.

172
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,257
That’s fine.

173
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:34,825
Have a seat.

174
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:38,023
Order what you want.

175
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,984
Okay then. You want anything, Kalix?

176
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:42,050
You choose.

177
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:50,065
Thank you.

178
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,902
Just keep eating, Kalix. No need to be shy.

179
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:54,090
All right then.

180
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:56,943
So Luna, what’s your plan after here?

181
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:58,710
Nothing.

182
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,630
We had set this day just for this.

183
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,841
I actually wanted to introduce myself to you.

184
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,729
Oh, that’s nice.

185
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:10,466
So, I heard you’re taking Legal Management?

186
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:14,478
Yes, I’m planning to take Law school, too.

187
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,637
Law school.

188
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,959
Future lawyer. I see.

189
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,063
What are your plans after law school?

190
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:25,103
I’m planning to work as a defense attorney in a law firm.

191
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,514
After gaining experience and trust from the clients,

192
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,193
I’m planning to open my law firm too.

193
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:37,313
So, you’ll be focusing on criminal law, I assume.

194
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,583
Why so?

195
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,318
Why not, let’s say, corporate law?

196
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:44,478
I like a good challenge, sir.

197
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:46,212
A good challenge.

198
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:48,072
You like a good challenge.

199
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,987
What if a murderer wants to hire you, would you accept it?

200
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,027
D-Dad! What's with all the questions?

201
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:01,532
Innocent until proven guilty, sir.

202
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:04,702
Everyone has the right to be represented in court.

203
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,613
But whatever happens, whatever decision I make,

204
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:12,210
I’ll always choose my moral principles above anything else.

205
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:22,669
I like that.

206
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,713
I really like your answer.

207
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:27,591
It’s quite rare for someone to have set plans for the future.

208
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:29,384
Especially with kids these days.

209
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:32,801
You have a very thorough plan for your future.

210
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:34,782
So, good job.

211
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:36,722
Thank you.

212
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,244
Actually, your daughter helped me to dream bigger.

213
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:50,244
Are you saying that our daughter is part of your future?

214
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,236
Yes, sir.

215
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,551
I can assure you that I only date to marry.

216
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,555
And the only goal of dating your daughter is

217
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,639
to marry her, one day.

218
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:12,437
Of course, if that’s okay with you and Luna.

219
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:15,472
Oh, w-wait. Wait a minute, Kalix.

220
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:19,935
Let’s not talk about marriage. You're both still young.

221
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,190
Besides, my Louisse Natasha is still a baby.

222
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:23,758
Mom!

223
00:15:24,645 --> 00:15:26,167
Just kidding, dear.

224
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,994
But Kalix, jokes are half-meant.

225
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:31,539
So, don’t worry about that yet.

226
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:34,036
Let’s just enjoy our meals for now.

227
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:35,734
- Let’s eat. - Here, Dad.

228
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,581
- Luna, want some soup? - Okay.

229
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,526
It was really good.

230
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,026
Here.

231
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:49,022
Thank you for the meal.

232
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:50,966
It was really nice meeting you.

233
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,327
Thank you for joining us, Kalix.

234
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:55,387
So, Luna…

235
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,716
He’s gonna take you home to the condo later?

236
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,421
Actually before leaving,

237
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,707
I wanted to ask for your permission.

238
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:11,260
If– is it okay if me and Luna meet up in New York?

239
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:14,990
Oh, you’re going to New York, too?

240
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,787
Yes ma’am, my family will spend the holidays there.

241
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:20,745
Don’t worry.

242
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,617
I’ll pick up and take Luna home.

243
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,910
I’ll take care of your daughter.

244
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:29,768
Wait, when are you planning to go to New York?

245
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:31,771
26th and the 27th.

246
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,926
We’re thinking of an overnight stay.

247
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:40,181
Just so we have time to roam around and rest after.

248
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:43,895
Yes and I’ll bring her back on the night of the 27th.

249
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,274
What do you think, Dad?

250
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:51,671
Kalix–

251
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:53,796
Just make sure…

252
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,242
that you have a Christmas present for us.

253
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,310
Okay?

254
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:01,674
And take good care of my daughter.

255
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:02,871
- I will. - All right?

256
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,164
Yes, of course.

257
00:17:04,164 --> 00:17:05,540
So, it’s okay?

258
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,629
Yes.

259
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,669
Thanks, Dad.

260
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:11,463
Just behave yourselves.

261
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,281
Thank you so much!

262
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,434
What a mess!

263
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,477
What’s all this trash?

264
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,604
That’s why I called you to come over.

265
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:30,190
What for? Just seeing you is already a mess.

266
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,026
You talk too much, Sevi. You asshole.

267
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:34,736
Go start packing.

268
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:38,198
You asked me to come over just to pack your things?

269
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:39,741
Of course! What else could it be?

270
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,117
You could’ve just…

271
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:45,747
You could just call Kalix to do this so that I can also apologize to him.

272
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:46,779
Huh?

273
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,204
Apologize for what?

274
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:52,112
Well, we just beat his school the other day.

275
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:54,577
Camero!

276
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:56,045
What the heck.

277
00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:00,053
I asked you to come here ‘cause I haven't been seeing you lately.

278
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,955
You seem to be quite busy.

279
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,056
Merry Christmas!

280
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:04,207
Wow!

281
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:05,649
Is this a bribe?

282
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:08,433
Thanks.

283
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,715
Where’s Ke?

284
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,966
She went home.

285
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,695
That’s why you’re the only one that could help me with this.

286
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:21,032
I’ll just give my Christmas gift to you when you get back.

287
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,283
When will you be home?

288
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,078
By the second week of January.

289
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:27,077
I’m extending my stay since

290
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,115
I’m meeting up with Kalix.

291
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:35,630
So, he’ll be in New York too?

292
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,658
Yes.

293
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:40,131
That’s why he’s not here, he’s already there.

294
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,680
By the way, I’ve already introduced him to Dad.

295
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,315
Wow!

296
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,226
I never realized you were that serious.

297
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,105
Of course, this is for long-term.

298
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,629
What did they say?

299
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:59,446
He liked him.

300
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:02,226
That’s why he agreed for us to meet in New York.

301
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:03,923
I’m so excited.

302
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,743
You know how strict Dad is.

303
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:10,206
That’s nice.

304
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:12,208
Well…

305
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,814
What’s gonna happen to all your other suitors now?

306
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:18,006
What?

307
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:20,600
I mean if I do have suitors, too bad for them! I’m taken.

308
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,002
You should find someone too, Sevi.

309
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:27,055
Wait, I forgot something.

310
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:29,726
Luna.

311
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:33,830
I’m really happy for you.

312
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:38,318
You’re so sweet, Sevi.

313
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:40,278
But you still make me cringe.

314
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:45,090
Hey! Stop.

315
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:46,558
This brat–

316
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:48,912
Take care in New York.

317
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:52,123
- Of course! - Don’t forget my shoe size, 11.5!

318
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:41,622
Yes, Ma! We went to a lot of places.

319
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,277
We just got home.

320
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:45,983
All right then.

321
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:48,029
Kalix!

322
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,747
Hi Aunty.

323
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:58,931
Yes.

324
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:00,108
I’ll take care of her.

325
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,894
Don’t worry about it. I have your gift right here.

326
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,950
All right. I’ll talk to you soon.

327
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:12,439
Bye, Aunty! Merry Christmas.

328
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:15,812
Luna.

329
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,295
Hello, Ma? All right, take care.

330
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,119
Bye! Love you.

331
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:26,644
I told you they’ll like you.

332
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:34,017
It’s amazing how it feels to actually see the paintings in person.

333
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:36,603
It really resonates,

334
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:37,851
I could feel it.

335
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:40,685
We’ll visit more museums soon.

336
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:42,387
Really?

337
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:43,413
Yes.

338
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:45,106
Give me a kiss.

339
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:51,530
We look so cute here.

340
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:54,435
You look cute there.

341
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:05,891
You know, it’s not my first time seeing the Statue of Liberty.

342
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:09,534
And everytime I do see it, it’s like, gives me hope.

343
00:22:11,137 --> 00:22:13,199
It’s as if it’s telling you that

344
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:18,646
there is freedom and boundless opportunities for everyone.

345
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:23,504
I just hope,

346
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:27,482
that those boundless opportunities are actually for everyone.

347
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,017
I hope so, too.

348
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:33,242
But unless we learn from the past,

349
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,400
we’ll never be able to achieve that.

350
00:22:37,153 --> 00:22:39,114
This is why I fell for you.

351
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:42,041
You're not only handsome, you also have great values.

352
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:51,189
Close your eyes.

353
00:22:52,261 --> 00:22:54,662
- Why? - Just close your eyes.

354
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:04,960
Open your eyes.

355
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:10,530
What’s this?

356
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,448
‘Cause I know Christmas is all about giving

357
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,002
so this is my gift to you.

358
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,502
I know it’s just a mug,

359
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:26,254
but this will be a remembrance for us

360
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:29,016
‘cause I will never forget the memories that we will make here.

361
00:23:29,632 --> 00:23:32,737
I’ll just make it up to you next time with a better gift.

362
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,236
There’s no need.

363
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:39,385
This is the best Christmas gift ever.

364
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:43,859
I’ll display this as a reminder of our first Christmas together.

365
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:46,445
A reminder of your love.

366
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:50,490
Wow, all this just with a mug as a gift?

367
00:23:51,404 --> 00:23:54,172
Of course. Close your eyes.

368
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:57,531
Come on, close your eyes.

369
00:23:59,258 --> 00:24:01,139
Think you’re the only one with a gift?

370
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:06,294
Sit down, hold on.

371
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:10,484
Open your eyes.

372
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,086
What?

373
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:17,267
Hope you like it, open it.

374
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:22,101
Wow!

375
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:25,221
Oh my god, this is beautiful, Kalix.

376
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:28,659
As soon as I saw that dress, I knew it would fit you perfectly.

377
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:31,031
Maybe you should wear it on a special occasion?

378
00:24:36,702 --> 00:24:37,756
Luna,

379
00:24:38,826 --> 00:24:40,434
I already met your parents,

380
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,311
and I think it’s time for you to meet mine.

381
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:46,982
I know I should’ve done this a long time ago but

382
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,545
but they were just too busy.

383
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:50,619
When?

384
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:54,760
Tomorrow.

385
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,928
I arranged a brunch with them

386
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,871
and it would be a really great holiday present if you’d come by.

387
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:03,518
Yes?

388
00:25:03,518 --> 00:25:04,519
Yes.

389
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,853
- Yes? - Yes.

390
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:16,542
Why don’t you try it on?

391
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:18,566
Okay.

392
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:21,968
Thank you again.

393
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:37,956
This fits me perfectly.

394
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:40,718
Is it pretty?

395
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:43,182
You look great.

396
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:49,120
I’m now ready to meet the Doc Martinezes.

397
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,107
Together with my future

398
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:54,402
attorney and husband.

399
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,579
Really? Future husband?

400
00:25:58,114 --> 00:26:00,129
Don't you like it?

401
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:01,434
Did I say that?

402
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,794
No. But,

403
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,804
would that be okay?

404
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,177
I would love to.

405
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:15,205
Try this. They say it’s really good.

406
00:26:22,096 --> 00:26:25,221
It’s really good! Try it.

407
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:33,466
Oh?

408
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:44,518
Yes.

409
00:26:45,612 --> 00:26:47,172
It tastes really good.

410
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,835
Taste it again.

411
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:56,881
Not that!

412
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,338
This one.

413
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,511
Aggressive.

414
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:03,522
Hm?

415
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:07,222
I am not, I just need a bit of human warmth.

416
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:08,664
It’s freezing, you know?

417
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:13,515
You’re craving me so much.

418
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:15,234
That’s not good.

419
00:27:16,984 --> 00:27:19,843
I told you, I just need human warmth.

420
00:27:56,503 --> 00:27:59,131
Next time, wear a skirt.

421
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:40,773
Wait, Kalix.

422
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,354
Can I handle this?

423
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:48,075
You’re silly.

424
00:28:48,622 --> 00:28:50,730
I seriously haven’t done this before.

425
00:28:53,592 --> 00:28:54,657
I know.

426
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,931
I’ll be gentle.

427
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:12,300
I love you, Luna.

428
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,083
I love you, Kalix.

429
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:56,930
Good morning.

430
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,805
Good morning.

431
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,227
How are you feeling?

432
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:04,721
I feel great.

433
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,945
Last night was wonderful.

434
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:28,521
Mom: We’re at the lobby.

435
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:29,748
Fuck.

436
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,170
Luna, fuck.

437
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:32,969
We gotta get ready.

438
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:34,012
Huh?

439
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,292
What’s wrong?

440
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:38,102
Mom and Dad are already downstairs at the lobby.

441
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,563
We can’t be late, come on. Let’s go.

442
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,079
Hey.

443
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,483
You will be fine.

444
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:52,563
Okay?

445
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:55,723
It’s my first time to meet my partner’s parents.

446
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,328
I don’t know what to do.

447
00:30:57,748 --> 00:30:58,833
Look,

448
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:02,697
just like what you told me before meeting your parents–

449
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:04,700
just be you.

450
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:06,973
You can do this.

451
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:08,891
I love you.

452
00:31:09,774 --> 00:31:10,999
I love you, too.

453
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:20,496
Mom, Dad.

454
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:23,147
How are you?

455
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,607
I’m good, how are you?

456
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:25,659
Fine.

457
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:28,989
Hi, Mom.

458
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,916
Mom, Dad,

459
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:39,629
this is Luna, my girlfriend.

460
00:31:39,654 --> 00:31:40,823
Hi, Luna.

461
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,250
I’m Doctor Martinez.

462
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,560
Hi, Doc Martinez. Glad to meet you.

463
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,449
Please sit.

464
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,597
Where is Kio and Ate?

465
00:31:57,264 --> 00:31:59,225
They stayed in the room.

466
00:31:59,225 --> 00:32:03,017
Kio was so tired from our Staten Island trip yesterday

467
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,553
so they are resting in the hotel.

468
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:08,692
Too bad. I wanted them to meet Luna.

469
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:10,587
You’re late.

470
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:14,920
Yes, I know.

471
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,176
I’m sorry.

472
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:19,584
Well, it’s not even ten minutes, Hon. It’s fine.

473
00:32:20,412 --> 00:32:21,717
I’m sorry, Mom.

474
00:32:21,949 --> 00:32:24,267
I just didn’t hear my alarm.

475
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,286
Well, why don’t you order for the lady?

476
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:33,130
Yes, sure.

477
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,009
Luna, do you have any preferences?

478
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:38,742
I’m okay with anything.

479
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,934
I think you should try the risotto.

480
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,833
It’s really good. Right?

481
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:44,942
Yes.

482
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:48,770
- Luna, right? - Yes.

483
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:50,859
Where are you from?

484
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:53,404
From Manila. I’m studying Architecture.

485
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,530
Architecture.

486
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,737
Architecture?

487
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:58,576
Do you have a family business?

488
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,412
Like what are your parents’ source of income?

489
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,418
We have a construction firm.

490
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,710
Construction firm.

491
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:13,372
Mom.

492
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,871
Yes?

493
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,558
I think we should just order.

494
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:24,101
- Yes. - Yes?

495
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,262
Okay.

496
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:27,740
Waiter?

497
00:33:42,065 --> 00:33:44,079
How are your grades, Kalix?

498
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,081
I heard about your five cuts and your 3.5 QPI.

499
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:52,307
Don’t worry.

500
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,325
I’ll pull them up this semester.

501
00:33:55,694 --> 00:33:58,279
How did you learn about my cuts anyway?

502
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:00,283
Oh, Amethyst told me.

503
00:34:02,403 --> 00:34:04,665
Why did you ask Amethyst?

504
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:07,895
Because Amethyst knows everything.

505
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:10,056
You go to the same class, remember?

506
00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:12,576
And don’t tell me you cut your classes because

507
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,411
you’re so busy with your girlfriend.

508
00:34:17,612 --> 00:34:19,071
No, Mom.

509
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:21,656
Or maybe you’re neglecting your studies

510
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:23,933
because you’re so busy flirting with her.

511
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:27,007
N-no.

512
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,508
Kalix, do you wanna be a good lawyer?

513
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,418
You think you’re gonna be a good lawyer

514
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:33,223
with your academic performance?

515
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:35,631
No offense, dear, okay?

516
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:37,925
I just think that Kalix had better grades

517
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:40,808
last year when he was with his ex-girlfriend, Amethyst.

518
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:43,389
Come on, Honey.

519
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,391
What, I’m just saying.

520
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,601
He’s gonna do better if he dates somebody

521
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:51,520
with the same goals instead of someone who’s a bad influence.

522
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,191
Oh dear, I’m not saying it’s you, okay?

523
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:56,513
It’s just a general statement.

524
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:58,147
That’s all.

525
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:02,656
I understand.

526
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,684
I’ll just go to the bathroom.

527
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:08,360
Excuse me.

528
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:10,666
Luna, wait.

529
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,884
Luna! Wait.

530
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:20,945
Luna!

531
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:27,741
Look, I’m sorry.

532
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,980
It’s not true. Amy was never my girlfriend.

533
00:35:31,302 --> 00:35:34,084
It’s always been my mom forcing us to be together.

534
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:37,820
And about the absences, it’s all on me.

535
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:40,810
You had nothing to do with it.

536
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:44,876
Just leave me alone for now.

537
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:50,022
Luna, please. Let me explain, at least.

538
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,114
Explain?

539
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:56,975
Why didn’t you explain earlier when I needed you to defend me?

540
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:03,103
- I– - Why did you neglect your studies?

541
00:36:03,677 --> 00:36:05,730
You could lose your dream because of me.

542
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:10,476
I’m not even that important.

543
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:12,478
You are important, Luna.

544
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:15,574
Not important enough to be defended from your mom, though?

545
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:20,579
I’m sorry.

546
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:23,748
I’m so sorry.

547
00:36:25,365 --> 00:36:27,002
I can’t talk to you right now.

548
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,712
Luna.

549
00:36:29,077 --> 00:36:31,006
Didn’t we promise?

550
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,844
Remember, we promised that we would talk it through whenever we have a fight.

551
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:37,637
Right?

552
00:36:41,726 --> 00:36:42,852
I’m sorry,

553
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:45,437
I was too afraid of my mom

554
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:49,149
and too cowardly to defend you earlier.

555
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:53,987
I know I should have said something

556
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:55,488
but,

557
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:57,815
I was just too scared.

558
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,804
Ever since I was a kid, I was

559
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:06,499
always fearful of her and her high expectations.

560
00:37:08,283 --> 00:37:11,630
All I did in my life is to please her.

561
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:16,449
Kalix, I understand.

562
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:20,611
I know how your mom is with you.

563
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,640
But what if she’s right?

564
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:30,468
What if you're really better with someone else?

565
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,206
That’s not true.

566
00:37:36,812 --> 00:37:38,374
You make me better.

567
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:40,874
You, Luna.

568
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,712
But your mom wants Amethyst for you, not me.

569
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,806
Hey.

570
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:06,133
No one can ever stop me from loving you.

571
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,703
Not even my parents.

572
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:22,399
I promise that I will defend you and our relationship.

573
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:26,570
I am scared of my mom.

574
00:38:27,946 --> 00:38:30,363
But I’m more scared of losing you.

575
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:32,515
Okay?

576
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,267
Can we make this work?

577
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,293
We can figure it out.

578
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:42,458
Together.

579
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:46,058
I promise I’ll make this work.

580
00:38:47,443 --> 00:38:50,262
Let’s just fix this, right now.

581
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,696
How was New York, Luna?

582
00:39:39,721 --> 00:39:41,726
Did you celebrate the New Year with a–

583
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:44,231
bang?

584
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:47,084
Yanna! You’re so perverted.

585
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:49,152
What's wrong with the word "bang"?

586
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:51,279
Why are you speechless?

587
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:52,489
Oh! No way?

588
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,450
- No way? - Oh?

589
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,328
- Hey! - The heck?!

590
00:40:01,873 --> 00:40:04,668
I miss you guys.

591
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:06,461
I miss you too, girl!

592
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:10,924
Our Christmas break was just short but I still missed you all.

593
00:40:10,924 --> 00:40:12,926
- I know. - Let’s just take a selfie.

594
00:40:12,926 --> 00:40:15,095
All right then.

595
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,264
One, two, smile!

596
00:40:17,597 --> 00:40:19,006
I missed you all, too.

597
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,269
Ke!

598
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:23,311
Ke…

599
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:24,646
I’m sorry, girls.

600
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:27,436
I was too defensive last time.

601
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:29,844
I know that you’re all just concerned about me.

602
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:34,211
I'm sorry for not telling you that I already have a boyfriend.

603
00:40:35,745 --> 00:40:37,983
I’m really sorry for what happened during Christmas.

604
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,662
Ke!

605
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,701
I’m sorry, too.

606
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:47,131
I’m sorry that I pressured you to tell us things

607
00:40:47,252 --> 00:40:49,603
even if you weren’t ready to talk about it yet.

608
00:40:49,963 --> 00:40:52,117
I should have respected your boundaries.

609
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:56,187
I’m sorry, too.

610
00:40:57,971 --> 00:40:59,806
I know I was too much.

611
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:04,695
I never doubted that we’ll patch things up.

612
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,706
I know we care for each other so much like real sisters.

613
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,893
Like real sisters?

614
00:41:11,193 --> 00:41:13,829
What? I’ve always thought that we really are real sisters.

615
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:16,281
Hey! This will be the last okay?

616
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:18,992
This shouldn't happen again.

617
00:41:19,206 --> 00:41:23,225
I got scared, I really thought that this was the end of our friendship.

618
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,956
Hey–

619
00:41:24,956 --> 00:41:28,752
Come on, Via. Aren’t we in this for the long run?

620
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:32,981
Didn’t we say that we will all reach our dreams together?

621
00:41:33,147 --> 00:41:34,966
We can do this!

622
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:36,093
Right, Ke?

623
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,969
Come here. This calls for a group hug!

624
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:39,070
Group hug!

625
00:41:39,095 --> 00:41:40,263
I love you!

626
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:42,349
We missed you, Ke.

627
00:41:43,975 --> 00:41:46,112
I love you, guys.

628
00:41:51,983 --> 00:41:54,828
Come on. Let’s have lunch before we go.

629
00:41:54,853 --> 00:41:55,904
Oh?

630
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,790
Why did you get a fruit shake?

631
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,450
Are we on an excursion?

632
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,286
I said I needed coffee and an energy drink.

633
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:04,663
Why so grumpy?

634
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:06,581
How many cups of coffee did you have?

635
00:42:06,581 --> 00:42:08,375
That’s not healthy, you know?

636
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,043
You haven’t even had lunch yet.

637
00:42:10,043 --> 00:42:12,420
It’s okay, Kalix and I are meeting up later.

638
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,658
We’ll eat at Noval.

639
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:17,586
How are you?

640
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:20,398
We’re still together.

641
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:22,934
Going strong?

642
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,346
Of course.

643
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:27,777
Happy?

644
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,723
Very happy.

645
00:42:31,354 --> 00:42:32,422
That’s good.

646
00:42:32,607 --> 00:42:34,610
You know what would make me happier?

647
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,321
I’d be happier if you’ll give me a copy of the readings I need from you.

648
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:39,906
You think you're that hot?

649
00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:41,992
I am definitely hot.

650
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,768
That’s why Kalix fell for me.

651
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:48,381
I wonder why Ke’s mom is calling.

652
00:42:49,857 --> 00:42:51,150
Hello, Aunty?

653
00:42:52,711 --> 00:42:53,779
Hello, Aunty?

654
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:55,448
Why are you crying?

655
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,780
What?

656
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,285
Okay, we’re on our way.

657
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,803
What is it, what happened?

658
00:43:01,803 --> 00:43:03,722
Ke was rushed to the hospital. Come on!

659
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:04,759
Let’s go!

660
00:43:09,898 --> 00:43:10,982
There.

661
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:12,759
There’s the emergency room!

662
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:18,528
- Excuse me, excuse me. - Nurse!

663
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:20,947
Yes? Good evening, ma’am. How can I help you?

664
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:23,408
I was told that Kierra Ynares was rushed here.

665
00:43:23,408 --> 00:43:24,801
May I have your name, ma’am?

666
00:43:24,826 --> 00:43:26,870
How are you related to the patient?

667
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,651
Luna Valeria, we’re cousins.

668
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:31,291
We were told that she’s here in the emergency room, may we go inside?

669
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,959
My apologies, ma’am.

670
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:35,003
Her mom is already inside

671
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:38,298
and only one companion per patient is allowed.

672
00:43:38,298 --> 00:43:40,467
- Please wait for a while. - But–

673
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:42,010
- Luna, it’s okay. It’s fine. - Please have a seat.

674
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:42,844
- Let’s sit. - Sevi.

675
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:44,679
Why? Why is she here?

676
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:48,691
How did Kierra end up here?

677
00:43:50,785 --> 00:43:51,870
It’s going to be okay.

678
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:52,898
Kalix!

679
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,804
Hey.

680
00:43:57,275 --> 00:44:00,128
It's okay.

681
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:04,077
I’m here.

682
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,625
I’m here.

683
00:44:09,955 --> 00:44:11,331
What are you doing?

684
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:13,124
Those are my personal things.

685
00:44:13,124 --> 00:44:15,511
Sorry. I just got curious.

686
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:18,922
I’ll just come back next time when you’re not busy.

687
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,893
Sorry!

688
00:44:20,918 --> 00:44:22,092
- Sorry, sorry. - No, no.

689
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:22,926
No, it’s okay.

690
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,052
- It’s okay. - Sorry, I didn’t mean–

691
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,805
You hate me that much, Architect Valeria.

692
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:29,378
I’m so sorry, it wasn’t on purpose.

693
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:31,559
Those are very important client files.

694
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:33,572
Some even haven’t been digitized yet.

695
00:44:33,895 --> 00:44:36,856
I’ll do anything to make it up to you. I’m really sorry.

696
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:39,167
Anything?

697
00:44:40,026 --> 00:44:41,669
Yes, anything.

698
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:44,992
Okay, then.

699
00:44:45,824 --> 00:44:47,315
Do my house in Tagaytay.

700
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:33,672
The nature of these injuries are suggestive of physical abuse.

701
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:37,375
Mr. Julian Miguel Villaflor brought the patient in.

702
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,666
This is all my fault.

703
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:43,465
Luna, don’t blame yourself.

704
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:46,051
We live in the same condo, Via.

705
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:47,761
How come I didn't notice

706
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,305
that something's going on with her?

707
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:54,059
About Kierra Ynares, she’s still in the hospital.

708
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:57,741
No medical certificate, no extension for deadlines.
