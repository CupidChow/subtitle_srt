1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,252
Is it okay if I spend the night here?

2
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:17,945
Are you picking me up?

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,805
I really came here to see you.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,469
We didn’t know you’re here.

5
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:26,139
I’m Amethyst, by the way. I don’t think we’ve met yet.

6
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:27,933
Kalix.

7
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:33,046
Do you still think about our first night together?

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,815
What am I to you, Kalix?

9
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:38,359
Luna. It means moon.

10
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,112
You’ll remember me everytime you look at the moon.

11
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:42,363
Like a curse.

12
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:44,240
More like a tattoo in my brain.

13
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:48,036
The resthouse in Tagaytay.

14
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:49,787
That’s right, Architect Valeria.

15
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:53,249
I’m not here as your Legal Counsel, but as your client.

16
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,052
Yes, Architect Valeria.

17
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:32,098
I’m not here as your Legal Counsel, but as your client.

18
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,237
We have other great architects in the firm.

19
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,448
Maybe Architect Ynares can handle–

20
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,950
Luna, I suggest you review the project first,

21
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,368
before you make a decision.

22
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:55,913
And I want you to discuss the details with Attorney Martinez.

23
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:59,959
As far as I’m concerned, this project is very profitable.

24
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,961
I’m free tomorrow at 5 PM.

25
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:05,673
What do you think, Luna?

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,970
I’ll bring my Real Estate Lawyer to the meeting.

27
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,390
We’re not gonna be alone together if that’s what you’re hesitating about.

28
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:19,312
No, that’s not the problem.

29
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:24,025
I have a meeting tomorrow until 6 PM so I can’t, I’m sorry.

30
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:27,032
Okay, let’s set a meeting at a later date.

31
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:30,364
My schedule for this month is a bit tight.

32
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:32,492
But we have other architects that can–

33
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,415
How about 7 PM tomorrow?

34
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,485
After your last meeting.

35
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:39,452
Are you gonna be free by that time, Architect?

36
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,735
Yes–

37
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:46,172
I’ll be available at 7 PM.

38
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:49,300
Great!

39
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:50,556
Great, great.

40
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:53,016
So, everything’s settled then?

41
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:55,031
- Thank you, sir. - All right, thank you!

42
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,265
Thank you, Architect!

43
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:57,767
I’ll see you tomorrow then.

44
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:41,936
I’m sorry, I’m late.

45
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:43,479
And so is your lawyer.

46
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:45,940
My time is valuable, Attorney Martinez.

47
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,024
I’m sorry.

48
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:48,776
It’s not gonna happen again.

49
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:50,778
I’ll follow up on him.

50
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:35,187
He’s here.

51
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:36,505
He’s just parking.

52
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:38,454
Okay.

53
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:40,782
So Luna–

54
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,457
I mean, uh– Architect Valeria.

55
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,509
About the project,

56
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,140
as you know this is the family property of–

57
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:49,503
Attorney Martinez,

58
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:52,340
I think it would be better if we wait for your lawyer

59
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,063
so that we won’t have to discuss it again.

60
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:58,346
Where is he, by the way?

61
00:05:58,346 --> 00:05:59,639
I thought he’s just parking?

62
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,024
If we’re going to work together, punctuality and honesty are important.

63
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:07,698
Especially in our line of work.

64
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,490
I know.

65
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:12,031
I’m sorry, again.

66
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,453
Architect!

67
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,915
Adonis, wh-what are you doing here?

68
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:27,695
Long time no see, Architect.

69
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,043
How are you?

70
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,465
Architect Valeria,

71
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:32,129
he’s my Real Estate Lawyer.

72
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:34,548
Attorney Figueroa, at your service.

73
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,256
You?

74
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:39,329
Are you kidding me?

75
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:43,265
First, you got a job in our firm out of all the firms in Manila.

76
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:45,351
Then, you proposed a project to my dad.

77
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:48,610
And, you want to hire me, as your architect?

78
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:50,727
What are you doing, Kalix?

79
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:53,401
I can’t do this.

80
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:55,152
- I shouldn’t be doing this. - Architect, wait.

81
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:56,946
Architect, please let me explain.

82
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:58,197
Explain what?

83
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:00,821
That we really want to hire you for this project.

84
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:02,843
And you even brought Adonis?

85
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:04,412
Am I a joke to you?

86
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:05,937
No. I don’t–

87
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:08,457
What are you up to, Kalix? What’s this? What are you doing?

88
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:11,204
This isn’t some joke. It’s a job offer.

89
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,600
I really want you as my architect.

90
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:16,044
Seriously,

91
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,009
why do you want me to be your architect?

92
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,050
Because you’re the most competent and innovative architect to get this job done.

93
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:25,516
I’ve seen your past works.

94
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,110
And I think your designs match my preferences.

95
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:30,985
And with that being said–

96
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,569
I’m giving you full creative freedom.

97
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:39,977
And if you look at page 6, a generous fee as well.

98
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,484
So?

99
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:45,236
Thirty percent?

100
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,342
Financing won’t be a problem.

101
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,103
We just have to iron out some details but–

102
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:51,921
I think we’re good after that.

103
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:53,223
What do you think?

104
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,849
I’ll just refer you to our other architects.

105
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:10,603
It just won’t work out with the both of us.

106
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:12,229
For this big of a project,

107
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,191
the client and the architect must be on the same page.

108
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:18,240
I think the two of us–

109
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:21,155
we won’t get along.

110
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,519
Not like that, Kalix.

111
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:36,546
Like this, see? Clink! There you go!

112
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:39,532
One, two, three, clink!

113
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,931
Cute!

114
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:43,648
So cute.

115
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:45,805
You really get along, huh?

116
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:49,183
Lucky for you, he agreed to do that couple challenge video.

117
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:50,434
Oh jeez,

118
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,259
I had to force him but I’m glad he agreed.

119
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:56,982
Damn, you guys are so cringey.

120
00:08:56,982 --> 00:08:58,943
You’re too much, Luna.

121
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:00,694
Come on.

122
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:03,251
You deserve this happiness, lovebirds.

123
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:08,077
Kalix, you better watch out if you make Luna cry.

124
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:10,798
Oh, don’t you dare.

125
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:13,712
I will not hurt Luna.

126
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:16,619
I promise.

127
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:20,589
These two are too sweet.

128
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:23,050
He’s head over heels for me.

129
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,385
So are you.

130
00:09:24,385 --> 00:09:26,922
Hey, enough about you! Let’s move on.

131
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:29,265
Let’s talk about halloween break. What are your plans?

132
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:31,433
‘Cause we’re going to our hometown.

133
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,392
I don’t know yet. How about you, Via?

134
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:35,897
Well, I have no plans yet,

135
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:40,901
maybe just stay home and study or maybe visit the cemetery.

136
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:41,986
I'm not sure.

137
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:43,821
How about you, Yanna?

138
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:44,947
Me?

139
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:46,365
I don't know.

140
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,117
Wherever the hotties are, I’ll be there!

141
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:50,703
You’re crazy.

142
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:53,706
Luna, Kalix, what about you guys?

143
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,124
- We’re going to– - We’re going to–

144
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:56,959
- Oh! - Wow!

145
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,086
They’re in sync.

146
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,609
They are really a match.

147
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:06,886
Go, tell them.

148
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:10,472
We’re going to Boracay.

149
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:11,682
What?

150
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:13,225
Boracay?

151
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,686
Show-off!

152
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:17,466
Are you two going alone?

153
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,840
Yes.

154
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,673
Our first couple trip.

155
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:25,863
But seriously,

156
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:29,195
if you two get married five to ten years from now,

157
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:36,375
I promise we’d be the sexiest and prettiest bridesmaids ever!

158
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,791
Right?

159
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:39,734
- So true, I agree. - Right!

160
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,634
No pressure at all.

161
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,007
You know what Ke, I kinda feel pressured.

162
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,759
I’m confident that Kalix and I

163
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,134
are ready for our first trip together.

164
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,312
The itinerary is prepared,

165
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:53,515
I’ve listed the restaurants we’re gonna eat at as well

166
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,001
but I don’t know, I'm worried.

167
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:57,916
I also feel nervous.

168
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,891
It can’t be helped when you’re in love, right?

169
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:04,401
There’s a ton of emotions like nervousness, fear, doubts.

170
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:08,117
But it all goes away when they make you feel loved.

171
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:11,017
I do feel that assurance from Kalix.

172
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:14,536
But what if we have something we don’t like about each other?

173
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:18,082
- What if– - What if you stop overthinking?

174
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:22,689
What if you just let your love flow its own way?

175
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:26,531
Let your relationship fly and grow naturally.

176
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,133
Damn, I’m so smart!

177
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:31,971
Just know that there is a reason why the universe brought you two together.

178
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,222
Girl, is that you?

179
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:35,015
You’re giving such good advice,

180
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,736
I think you’re ready to have a boyfriend.

181
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:40,306
Just enjoy your Boracay trip.

182
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:43,266
I know you’ll manage ‘cause you’re such a flirt.

183
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,103
You bitch!

184
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,712
Would you look at this?

185
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:51,865
Don’t you have anything better?

186
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:54,493
Don’t you have something that reveals more skin?

187
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:56,370
Well, do you?

188
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:58,747
I won’t really need more of that, you know.

189
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:02,251
I’ll just wear my bikini and watch Kalix’s jaw drop.

190
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:04,070
Oh, I like that.

191
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:06,046
Just remember, what happens in Boracay–

192
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:09,158
- stays in Boracay! - Stays in Boracay!

193
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:15,639
Please excuse me. My boyfriend is calling.

194
00:12:19,768 --> 00:12:21,166
Hi, Kalix!

195
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,754
Hey! I just called to say good night.

196
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:26,608
I’m still not used to this.

197
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:27,735
Get used to it,

198
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:30,251
you’re gonna hear it for the rest of your life anyway.

199
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:31,861
Too cheesy.

200
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:33,115
By the way,

201
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:35,993
have you prepared your toiletries and stuff?

202
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,745
Yes, look here.

203
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:42,249
I have my clothes here and my toiletries as well.

204
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:44,209
How about you, you good?

205
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:49,214
Yes. I’ve prepared it all including our boarding pass and our itinerary.

206
00:12:49,673 --> 00:12:52,551
Thanks, by the way, for paying for our flight.

207
00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:56,513
Not a problem. I still have savings from my school allowance.

208
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:57,931
Thank you for booking the hotel.

209
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:59,683
What did your dad say about it?

210
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:03,180
I told them about it since I don’t want them to be surprised

211
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:05,072
to see the credit card bill.

212
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:06,857
I also told them...

213
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,485
that I’ll be with my friends.

214
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:10,903
So he allowed me to go.

215
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,197
You naughty girl.

216
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:21,747
They won’t allow me to go if they knew that it’s just the two of us.

217
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,936
I can’t wait to have you alone.

218
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,878
Why, what are you going to do?

219
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:29,922
What lovers do when they’re alone.

220
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,048
Stop it!

221
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:34,385
We should be conservative, you know?

222
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:39,932
Don't be late. Let's go early to the airport.

223
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:41,975
Someone's really excited!

224
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:43,227
Of course.

225
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:46,642
I think this is gonna be the best trip ever!

226
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:17,381
Wow!

227
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:20,330
Our room is so beautiful and so spacious too.

228
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,518
This bed feels so comfortable.

229
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:27,312
Maybe we should just nap first and enjoy it.

230
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:28,147
Huh?

231
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:30,732
We should make the most out of the beach while it’s still sunny.

232
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:34,361
We have a lot of activities to do, so let’s go!

233
00:14:46,957 --> 00:14:48,142
Thank you.

234
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:51,462
Thank you? For what?

235
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:53,822
For being here

236
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,806
and making me happy.

237
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,806
I’m so lucky to have you.

238
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,227
Glad you know.

239
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:10,907
Just kidding.

240
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:12,618
I feel the same way.

241
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,001
So let’s go!

242
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,237
Come on!

243
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,509
Okay…

244
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:26,121
So you still don't want to get up?

245
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:28,874
Well,

246
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:31,210
are you ready now?

247
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:34,079
How’s this?

248
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,493
You look stunning.

249
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:48,727
Really?

250
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:51,438
Don’t you think it’s revealing?

251
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:52,481
No.

252
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:54,608
You can wear whatever you want

253
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,235
as long as you’re comfortable.

254
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,862
Whatever makes you happy and pretty.

255
00:15:58,862 --> 00:15:59,947
Come on!

256
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:11,583
I’m ready.

257
00:16:21,906 --> 00:16:24,451
I think I’m ready to go to the beach.

258
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:28,930
Let's just put sunblock and go sunbathing there.

259
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,483
Kalix, can you put some sunblock on me?

260
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:19,526
On my back.

261
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:21,653
Yes.

262
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:22,738
Okay.

263
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:03,025
All done?

264
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,235
Uhm–

265
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,837
Yes, yes.

266
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:11,896
Okay.

267
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:13,163
Thank you.

268
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,436
Oh, you wanna eat?

269
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,750
- Here. - Yes.

270
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:26,923
It’s good.

271
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:58,959
We look so cute here.

272
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:03,046
Hashtag LuKal in Boracay!

273
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:05,382
I’m cuter though.

274
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,551
Wow!

275
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:10,178
So you know how to brag now?

276
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:11,888
It’s true though.

277
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,014
You are cute.

278
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:18,854
You know what?

279
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:21,148
Boracay is so beautiful.

280
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:22,733
According to my research–

281
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:26,041
this is consistent as one of the top beaches in the world.

282
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:27,738
It’s true.

283
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:29,354
Actually this is my first time here

284
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:31,697
so I’m really having fun.

285
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:34,494
I’ve been here a couple of times but

286
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,086
I don’t know why.

287
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:41,001
It’s more beautiful now.

288
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:45,714
I think you’re just blinded by love.

289
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:48,633
And you’re with someone as pretty as me.

290
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,806
My research said, top one most beautiful girl in the world.

291
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:58,769
You’re really learning how to hit those pickup lines, huh?

292
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:00,787
What do you expect?

293
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:02,481
I’m learning from the best.

294
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:06,818
You want me to shower you?

295
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,696
With all my love!

296
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:12,991
Silly you.

297
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,283
You’re so hot.

298
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,113
We should just go scuba diving.

299
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:32,639
We can also try parasailing,

300
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,332
island hopping…

301
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,348
Let’s make the most of this.

302
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:38,558
We’ve still got time.

303
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:43,980
Maybe we can just chill here for a bit.

304
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,191
We can try some local coffee shops.

305
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:47,734
And…

306
00:20:48,151 --> 00:20:49,778
just enjoy the beach.

307
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:51,631
Okay.

308
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,074
I just don’t want to waste our time here.

309
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:57,334
We have plenty of time tomorrow.

310
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,456
Okay.

311
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:04,751
How about this? Let’s have dinner at the fusion restaurant.

312
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:07,504
I heard its owners are Moroccan and Italian.

313
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:08,588
They say it’s really good.

314
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:12,509
That sounds good but I’m craving seafood tonight.

315
00:21:13,593 --> 00:21:15,512
They serve the best scallops here.

316
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:17,597
Would that be okay?

317
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,312
Okay.

318
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:23,979
Let’s just eat at the fusion restaurant tomorrow, okay?

319
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:25,146
Okay.

320
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,512
Hello?

321
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,471
I’m in Boracay but–

322
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:39,829
yes, I can do it tonight.

323
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:41,312
No, it’s fine.

324
00:21:41,337 --> 00:21:44,708
I’ll just take care of it and I will email you once it’s done.

325
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,792
Okay?

326
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:46,939
All right.

327
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:50,672
Who was that?

328
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,173
My blockmate.

329
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:55,468
Luna, can we just go back to our room?

330
00:21:55,493 --> 00:21:57,077
I have to do something.

331
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:58,134
Huh?

332
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,119
I thought we're going to watch the sunset?

333
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:01,683
Yes, but–

334
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:05,145
we still have two hours and a half.

335
00:22:05,145 --> 00:22:06,396
I’ll be done by then.

336
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,023
I promise.

337
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:09,649
Okay.

338
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:10,609
- Okay? - Yes.

339
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:11,689
Yes?

340
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,236
All right.

341
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:14,947
Come on.

342
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,657
Are you done?

343
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:19,242
It’s been two hours.

344
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:21,411
We’re not in a staycation,

345
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:24,501
so I wouldn’t want to miss the sunset.

346
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:27,709
Around ten pages more.

347
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,253
Kalix?

348
00:22:30,253 --> 00:22:32,572
Maybe you can finish that later?

349
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:33,506
Please?

350
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:38,094
You know I’m all for supporting your studies and school work.

351
00:22:38,094 --> 00:22:41,947
I promise it will just only take thirty minutes more.

352
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,491
Tops!

353
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:44,726
Thirty more minutes?

354
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:46,519
Yes, is that okay?

355
00:22:47,604 --> 00:22:50,065
Okay, sure.

356
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,168
It’s been thirty minutes.

357
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:02,652
You done?

358
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:05,372
Yes!

359
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:07,830
Yay!

360
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,418
Hold on.

361
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:13,734
Yes.

362
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:16,132
I just received it right now.

363
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:18,551
Okay, I’ll revise all of it.

364
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:20,053
I’ll send it asap.

365
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,229
Luna, I’m sorry. I just need another thirty more minutes.

366
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:31,398
I thought it was just going to be quick?

367
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:32,691
Yes, but

368
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:35,626
our groupmate made a mistake

369
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:37,295
and we have to revise all of it.

370
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,114
Why are you doing it?

371
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:42,742
He can’t be reached through calls or anything else.

372
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:47,080
What about our sunset drinks later?

373
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,792
I’ve even reserved a table at the restaurant you like.

374
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,298
Well,

375
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:55,431
there’s gonna be another sunset tomorrow, right?

376
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:57,507
That’s not the point.

377
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:00,571
Come on.

378
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:04,126
I promise it will only take thirty more minutes.

379
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:07,080
And then we can go out for dinner, okay?

380
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:13,310
Are we good?

381
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:38,794
Whatever.

382
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:19,130
Miss Valeria?

383
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:20,855
Hi!

384
00:25:22,217 --> 00:25:23,218
How are you?

385
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:25,345
I can’t believe I’d see you— here in Boracay.

386
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:26,513
I know.

387
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:29,224
Last time I saw you was during your first semester.

388
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:29,974
Ah, yes ma'am.

389
00:25:29,974 --> 00:25:31,941
That was actually my favorite class.

390
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,054
Theory of Architecture 1.

391
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,289
Yes and you were killing it!

392
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:38,983
Just call me Amina.

393
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:41,152
All right then, Amina.

394
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:43,613
How’ve you been? Do you still teach?

395
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:44,791
No, I don’t.

396
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:48,034
I’m now focusing on my architecture job here in Boracay.

397
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:49,077
And–

398
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:53,010
OMG! Congratulations! Since when?

399
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:54,833
Three months ago.

400
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:57,707
How about you, how are you? Are you alone?

401
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:05,093
My companion’s busy in the hotel so I decided to go out by myself.

402
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:06,861
If you want, you can join us.

403
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:08,596
Let’s eat? My treat.

404
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:10,480
I’ll introduce you to my husband.

405
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:12,049
He’s on his way here.

406
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:13,810
Sure.

407
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:17,249
Luna!

408
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:19,314
It’s time for dinner.

409
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:28,616
Luna?

410
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:11,159
Luna, where are you?

411
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:18,666
I’m sorry if we missed the sunset. I’ll make it up to you.

412
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:29,477
Send a reply, Luna.

413
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:32,972
I’m impressed with your maturity.

414
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:37,129
Is it wrong for me to feel angry?

415
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:38,855
I mean,

416
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:42,148
it’s our first vacation together.

417
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:46,819
Can’t he just set aside his studies for just one day?

418
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,073
I’m not saying it’s not valid.

419
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:51,950
I just think that,

420
00:27:53,451 --> 00:27:56,996
you can mind how you respond or compromise for now, you know?

421
00:27:57,497 --> 00:27:58,581
Hello, ma’am!

422
00:27:58,581 --> 00:28:00,424
- Hi! - Your table’s ready, ma’am.

423
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:02,210
All right.

424
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,480
- The food’s ready. - Looks good.

425
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,878
Let’s go ahead and enjoy the food.

426
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,285
Wow! Yummy.

427
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:13,221
Hi, babe.

428
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:14,681
Hi!

429
00:28:14,681 --> 00:28:17,016
Babe, I want you to meet Luna.

430
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:20,311
She’s my former student in Architecture School.

431
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:22,355
One of the brightest, I must say.

432
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:24,023
Don't mention it.

433
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,401
Hi Luna, very nice to meet you.

434
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,027
Are you traveling solo?

435
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,042
She pretends to be.

436
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:34,777
Yes, I do have to say, this is absolutely delicious.

437
00:28:34,802 --> 00:28:37,449
Mina really knows how to put a smile on my face.

438
00:28:37,937 --> 00:28:41,190
It’s all about being attentive to details.

439
00:28:41,215 --> 00:28:42,925
I envy you.

440
00:28:43,251 --> 00:28:44,877
Come on, Luna!

441
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:46,379
You brought this to yourself.

442
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:48,089
Anyway, taste it.

443
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:51,050
You’ll seriously forget all your problems.

444
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:01,943
Are you avoiding someone?

445
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:03,928
Babe, they’re having a lover’s quarrel.

446
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:05,413
How cute!

447
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,842
Wait, I have a question.

448
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:15,408
Are you taking this guy seriously?

449
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:16,839
Do you really love him?

450
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:17,994
Yes.

451
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:21,080
If I can give you one piece of unsolicited advice,

452
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,915
he clearly wants to talk to you.

453
00:29:22,915 --> 00:29:24,334
Just talk to him.

454
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:28,699
Don’t ruin the vacation that you’re having now over your feelings.

455
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,923
But he was the one that–

456
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:32,842
Does he even know that you’re mad?

457
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,433
You know, Luna…

458
00:29:38,014 --> 00:29:42,101
buildings and relationships have a lot in common.

459
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:46,314
They both need a solid foundation to be strong.

460
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:51,027
Communication is key to building a solid relationship.

461
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:52,445
Don’t expect your partner to

462
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:55,782
know everything that goes through your mind.

463
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,408
I’ll have to agree with that.

464
00:29:57,408 --> 00:30:00,328
I mean, Mina and I have been together for fifteen years

465
00:30:00,328 --> 00:30:04,082
but I still haven’t figured out her mood swings.

466
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:05,166
Bastard!

467
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:06,897
Don’t be silly!

468
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:08,793
See? But nonetheless,

469
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,860
I always look to understand her because I love her.

470
00:30:13,273 --> 00:30:14,377
Luna

471
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,535
don’t dwell on negative feelings.

472
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:19,792
Come on, just call him.

473
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:33,699
Luna!

474
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,863
Hello, Kalix?

475
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:38,408
Luna! Thank god, where are you?

476
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:40,550
Luna, I’m so sorry.

477
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:43,199
I know I’ve been insensitive.

478
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:45,066
I apologize.

479
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:48,434
- I’ve been looking for you. - Where are you?

480
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:51,212
I walked from station one to station three.

481
00:30:51,212 --> 00:30:52,672
Looking around for you.

482
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,591
Kalix, I’m here at station three.

483
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:57,677
I’ll text you the location, okay?

484
00:30:57,677 --> 00:30:58,719
I’ll be waiting.

485
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:00,012
All right, I’ll see you there.

486
00:31:00,012 --> 00:31:01,199
Bye.

487
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:18,030
Kalix!

488
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,200
Luna!

489
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:27,331
I’m so sorry.

490
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:28,916
I’m so sorry, it’s my fault.

491
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:30,918
I should’ve been a better boyfriend.

492
00:31:30,918 --> 00:31:32,253
I’m sorry, too.

493
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:34,963
I admit, I was really hurt.

494
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:37,341
But I shouldn’t have walked out on you.

495
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:39,552
I should have talked to you first.

496
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:40,565
I’m sorry.

497
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:42,178
Oh.

498
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:43,806
Amina, I’m sorry.

499
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,391
It’s okay.

500
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:47,268
We’re just happy that you two are okay.

501
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:48,519
Yes.

502
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,493
By the way— Amina, Gil, this is Kalix my boyfriend.

503
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:52,690
Hi.

504
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,942
I was Luna’s Architecture Professor.

505
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:57,028
Hey bro, I’m Gil.

506
00:31:57,028 --> 00:31:58,237
Good evening.

507
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:01,073
I got lucky

508
00:32:01,073 --> 00:32:03,659
I bump into her and kept me company.

509
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:04,785
Yes.

510
00:32:04,785 --> 00:32:06,037
Thank you so much!

511
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:07,538
Would you like to join us for dinner?

512
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:08,623
No, it’s okay.

513
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:09,916
We already ate dinner

514
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:11,667
- and we have to go home already. - Yes.

515
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,544
It’s nice meeting you, though.

516
00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:15,046
Yes, enjoy the night.

517
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,165
- Please take care of Luna. - I will.

518
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,342
Luna, keep in touch.

519
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,928
I shall see you soon.

520
00:32:21,928 --> 00:32:23,262
You two enjoy the night, okay?

521
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:24,222
- Bye. - Thank you!
- Have a good night. - Bye.

522
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:26,018
Thank you.

523
00:32:26,682 --> 00:32:29,519
Sir, table for two please!

524
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:31,682
Luna.

525
00:32:32,747 --> 00:32:34,540
I’m so sorry, Luna—

526
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:35,942
for today.

527
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:38,903
I realized I made you feel unappreciated.

528
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:41,948
We came here to spend quality time and

529
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:45,243
I should have not prioritized things that I could have done later.

530
00:32:45,785 --> 00:32:46,909
I’m sorry.

531
00:32:48,162 --> 00:32:49,620
I’m sorry, too.

532
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:53,125
I admit, I was wrong, too.

533
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,475
I should have communicated with you first

534
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,198
instead of walking out on you.

535
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:03,261
I just felt that

536
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:07,120
I was rejected and ignored.

537
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,870
I’m sorry.

538
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:13,315
My ex-boyfriend made me feel that.

539
00:33:14,188 --> 00:33:18,067
Like my needs and opinions weren’t necessary.

540
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:19,128
I’m sorry.

541
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:27,776
I’m really sorry, I made you feel that way.

542
00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:30,776
I promise,

543
00:33:31,098 --> 00:33:33,034
I will listen to your needs more.

544
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:37,104
I don’t wanna do anything to hurt you.

545
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:38,678
Okay?

546
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,104
I think, I’m not…

547
00:33:48,848 --> 00:33:50,096
hungry anymore.

548
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:53,019
Should we go back to our room?

549
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:56,063
Should we?

550
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,315
Don’t put–

551
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,573
What?

552
00:34:45,196 --> 00:34:46,299
Nothing.

553
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,909
Is that it?

554
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:53,622
Calm down, tigress.

555
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:14,183
Cheers!

556
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,947
Cheers!

557
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:15,327
Good morning, Ke!

558
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:17,496
Good morning! You’re up early.

559
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:20,120
I was just in the mood to get up early.

560
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:22,595
You know, carpe that diem.

561
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,420
Shit! It’s good to be alive.

562
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,672
You still have jitters from your vacation with Kalix.

563
00:36:26,672 --> 00:36:28,276
You’re right.

564
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:30,176
You know what they say?

565
00:36:30,176 --> 00:36:34,430
The first couple trip makes or breaks the relationship.

566
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,389
We sealed the deal.

567
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:38,267
We were level six before, now we’re at level eight.

568
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:40,144
Just because of that trip.

569
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:42,438
You should join us next time,

570
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:43,773
it would be more fun.

571
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:44,823
Sure.

572
00:36:47,568 --> 00:36:49,945
Did you come home last night, Ke?

573
00:36:50,571 --> 00:36:51,655
Of course.

574
00:36:52,782 --> 00:36:54,385
How come I didn’t see you?

575
00:36:54,617 --> 00:36:56,869
You might have been asleep already.

576
00:36:56,869 --> 00:36:59,163
I came home around 1 AM.

577
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:01,707
But I fell asleep around 4 AM.

578
00:37:01,707 --> 00:37:03,959
I just finished some plates and–

579
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:05,961
I edited our video.

580
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:09,840
Maybe it was past 4 AM. I'm not really sure.

581
00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:11,252
I was too sleepy.

582
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:15,127
So, where were you last night anyway?

583
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:18,390
A-At home, did some laundry and got some stuff.

584
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,972
I think you’re hiding something from me.

585
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:24,313
Oh! I have something to tell you.

586
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:26,910
Christmas fest is coming. You better be there, okay?

587
00:37:27,274 --> 00:37:28,734
- Yes. - Let’s invite the others.

588
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:30,291
I’ll bring Kalix.

589
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:32,142
Sure, that would be fun.

590
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:35,619
I gotta go, I need to buy some art supplies.

591
00:37:35,866 --> 00:37:37,493
Oh, Ke!

592
00:37:38,511 --> 00:37:40,012
- Ouch. - I’m sorry! What’s wrong?

593
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:42,289
Nothing, just a cramp.

594
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:45,584
Oh… Is it okay if you buy me a tech pen?

595
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:46,669
Sure.

596
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:56,387
Damn it!

597
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:59,265
It’s still early but the concert ground's already full.

598
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:01,517
I love all the bands playing tonight!

599
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:04,198
Actually, I’m not surprised. The line-up’s really good.

600
00:38:04,812 --> 00:38:08,482
Before we go guys, I just want to congratulate all of us

601
00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:11,527
for surviving the first semester!

602
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:13,279
- I’m so proud of us! - Well…

603
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:14,822
- I'll just get my bag. - By the way, where’s Ke?

604
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:16,991
She said she’s coming.

605
00:38:16,991 --> 00:38:19,952
I noticed that she hasn’t been hanging out with us lately.

606
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:21,854
What’s up with that?

607
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:25,040
I think she has a boyfriend already, that’s why.

608
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:26,360
Boyfriend? Who?

609
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:29,174
She hasn’t said anything to us. Do you have an idea?

610
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:30,671
No idea.

611
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:34,842
But it’s weird ‘cause she’s been quite distant to me lately.

612
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:38,429
I even set up a bonding session but she ditched me.

613
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:39,846
Maybe she’s just busy.

614
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:41,599
Oh, you don't know?

615
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,690
- What? - She wasn’t able to pass her plates for finals.

616
00:38:45,244 --> 00:38:48,689
The professor was lenient but gave deductions.

617
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:52,268
Luckily, her previous grades were high so it wasn’t affected that much.

618
00:38:52,643 --> 00:38:53,736
You didn’t know?

619
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,782
Please open the door, Luna. I'll just retouch her makeup.

620
00:38:58,782 --> 00:39:00,713
Sure, I think it's Ke.

621
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:03,518
Hi!

622
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,970
Who’s that?

623
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:16,932
This is Miguel, my boyfriend.

624
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:23,767
Oh.

625
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:25,440
Since when?

626
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:27,346
Two months ago.

627
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,291
Hi Miguel, I’m Sam.

628
00:39:36,695 --> 00:39:38,026
This is everyone.

629
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,416
Everyone, say hello to Miguel.

630
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,033
What's up?

631
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,299
- Water? - Yes.

632
00:39:48,582 --> 00:39:50,830
Babe, no ice.

633
00:39:57,716 --> 00:39:59,651
What are you doing here?

634
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:01,431
Talk to your cousin-in-law!

635
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:04,127
- Crazy. - I just can’t.

636
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:06,767
I have a bad feeling about that guy.

637
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:10,477
Call me a critic, but he’s definitely a sketchy creep.

638
00:40:10,502 --> 00:40:11,963
Hey, Yanna!

639
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:14,031
- It’s true. - Come on.

640
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:15,518
Isn’t he—

641
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:17,549
Isn’t he that guy from PolSci?

642
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:20,614
- Oh, yes. - Right?

643
00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:22,741
The mayor’s son.

644
00:40:22,741 --> 00:40:27,454
That mayor has a lot of history with corruption.

645
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:28,580
Ugh!

646
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,290
Are you sure?

647
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,209
Yes, you can easily search for it.

648
00:40:32,285 --> 00:40:34,079
Why would Ke choose someone like him?

649
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:35,587
Let her be!

650
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:38,090
Let’s just talk to her later.

651
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,143
Okay?

652
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:40,968
Girls, girls!

653
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:42,721
I think he’s about to leave.

654
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:46,643
Just relax, okay?

655
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:53,510
Girls, Miguel’s leaving. He needs to be somewhere.

656
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:58,487
Yes, I’ll go ahead.

657
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,291
Ke, what was that?

658
00:41:10,914 --> 00:41:13,375
What do you mean about that, Yanna?

659
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,221
He’s my boyfriend. What the heck?

660
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:18,360
What’s up with your reactions earlier? So embarrassing.

661
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:20,526
How could you treat someone like that?

662
00:41:20,551 --> 00:41:21,636
Ke.

663
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:23,791
We were just surprised.

664
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:25,262
Right.

665
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:28,515
You guys have been together for two months but we’ve never heard of him.

666
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:30,559
Even Luna had no idea.

667
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,895
I just didn’t know how to tell you.

668
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:33,899
What?

669
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,731
What do you mean?

670
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:39,109
It’s so easy to say, “Luna, I have a boyfriend now.”

671
00:41:39,134 --> 00:41:40,696
We always talk, right?

672
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:43,155
You have no right to tell me what’s easy and what's not.

673
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:45,074
Girls, wait. We need to calm down.

674
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:46,700
Wait a minute, what’s with the attitude?

675
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,202
We’re just worried about you.

676
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:49,703
I should ask you the same thing.

677
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:52,473
What’s happening? Why are you all ganging up on me? On us?

678
00:41:52,498 --> 00:41:53,832
Look at you, all lined up.

679
00:41:53,832 --> 00:41:56,011
- What? You’ll each have a piece with me? - Ganging up–

680
00:41:56,011 --> 00:41:57,252
Ke, of course not!

681
00:41:57,252 --> 00:41:59,963
We’re not ganging up on you, we’re here for you.

682
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:02,883
Luna’s right. We’re all just worried about you.

683
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:04,384
Seriously?

684
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:06,595
It doesn’t seem like worrying if you’re all judging me.

685
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:09,494
Ke, we’re not judging anyone here.

686
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:13,894
We just want to understand why you had to hide him from us?

687
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:14,937
Is there any reason?

688
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:18,190
You should have introduced him to us earlier, Ke.

689
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,234
Then we wouldn't be reacting this way.

690
00:42:20,234 --> 00:42:22,486
Not like how it is now, we're all in shock.

691
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:23,570
Is that all?

692
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,323
Well, I just introduced Miguel. Are we good?

693
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:28,290
All good? Any more issues?

694
00:42:28,315 --> 00:42:30,705
The problem is I don’t like him.

695
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:33,729
I have a bad feeling about that guy. You better be careful.

696
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:35,089
Yanna…

697
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:36,282
Wow!

698
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:38,934
You just met him and you already have a lot of bad things to say.

699
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:39,987
So you are being judgmental.

700
00:42:39,987 --> 00:42:42,172
I never said anything about your men, Yanna.

701
00:42:42,172 --> 00:42:43,315
- What did you just say? - Hey!

702
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,251
- Yanna! - Hey!

703
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:46,401
- I said, - Calm down.

704
00:42:46,426 --> 00:42:49,224
you never heard me say anything about any of your men.

705
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:50,500
You better watch your mouth!

706
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:51,961
Ke, Ke!

707
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:52,975
- What? - Stop it!

708
00:42:52,975 --> 00:42:54,040
What the hell?!

709
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:56,728
Why are you stopping me when I say something?

710
00:42:57,479 --> 00:42:58,772
But if it’s you, it’s okay?

711
00:42:58,772 --> 00:43:01,438
Ke, it’s not like that. Come on, calm down.

712
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:03,777
You shouldn’t have let Miguel feel that he's not welcome.

713
00:43:03,777 --> 00:43:05,779
If you’re all mad at me, take it on me instead.

714
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:08,752
Girls, please. Let’s all calm down.

715
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:11,596
Am I not allowed to have a love life but you all can?

716
00:43:11,994 --> 00:43:13,662
That’s just unfair.

717
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:17,791
When Kalix was introduced, you didn’t react this way.

718
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:19,883
Don’t you dare involve Kalix in this conversation.

719
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:22,254
You know what I mean, Luna!

720
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:25,841
Ke, we’re not enemies here. We are your friends.

721
00:43:25,841 --> 00:43:27,283
Come on.

722
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:28,877
Friends?

723
00:43:29,386 --> 00:43:30,705
I don’t think so.

724
00:43:32,306 --> 00:43:33,916
I don't feel that way anymore.

725
00:43:40,887 --> 00:43:42,705
Let her be. Just let her be.

726
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:53,035
- Hey, Luna. - Kalix, how's Kio’s Christmas party?

727
00:43:53,035 --> 00:43:54,127
Well,

728
00:43:54,963 --> 00:43:56,594
I’m about to go there. Why?

729
00:43:56,619 --> 00:44:00,042
Can we meet after the Christmas party?

730
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,501
I just need a breather.

731
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:03,510
Okay. See you!

732
00:44:05,672 --> 00:44:06,840
It’s so annoying.

733
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,259
I don't understand what's happening to Ke.

734
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:11,094
It seems like she’s hiding something.

735
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:12,763
I can feel it, she’s my bestfriend.

736
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:14,604
Maybe she just needs time.

737
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:17,851
I’m sure she’ll tell you everything once she’s ready.

738
00:44:17,851 --> 00:44:20,687
I know but

739
00:44:20,687 --> 00:44:23,393
I can’t help but worry, Kalix.

740
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:25,943
I know there’s a problem.

741
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:30,166
Yes, I understand but you can’t force things out of her.

742
00:44:33,325 --> 00:44:36,244
This is all new to me and Ke.

743
00:44:36,703 --> 00:44:39,549
We rarely fight and disagree.

744
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:42,635
She even walked out on us earlier.

745
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:45,221
Everything will be fine, I’m sure of that.

746
00:44:45,545 --> 00:44:47,619
You and Kierra are like siblings.

747
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:50,580
It’s normal for siblings to fight.

748
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:52,222
At the end of the day, though,

749
00:44:52,247 --> 00:44:54,592
you guys still love and care for each other.

750
00:44:56,265 --> 00:44:57,512
You’re right.

751
00:44:58,517 --> 00:45:00,936
You’re not angry or pissed off at her.

752
00:45:00,936 --> 00:45:02,771
You’re just being protective

753
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:06,307
and you always protect the people you love, right?

754
00:45:07,943 --> 00:45:09,932
We protect the people we love.

755
00:45:11,613 --> 00:45:13,490
Everything will be fine.

756
00:45:14,074 --> 00:45:15,135
Don’t worry.

757
00:45:17,035 --> 00:45:21,401
I know we’re just starting out and we haven’t had a big fight.

758
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,901
But if we do,

759
00:45:23,926 --> 00:45:25,886
let’s talk about it, please?

760
00:45:26,878 --> 00:45:28,797
Let’s talk about the problem.

761
00:45:29,423 --> 00:45:31,198
We should always fix it.

762
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:33,093
Promise?

763
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:35,842
Of course, I promise.

764
00:45:36,096 --> 00:45:40,517
It’s for sure that we’re gonna have our own fights and arguments but,

765
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:42,723
I won’t walk away.

766
00:45:43,478 --> 00:45:45,476
I won’t give up on us.

767
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,307
I promise.

768
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:52,321
Except if you cheat on me, though.

769
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:56,682
If you do, you’re dead. I’ll never forgive you.

770
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,588
I will never do that.

771
00:45:58,952 --> 00:46:00,078
You wanna know why?

772
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:01,121
Why?

773
00:46:01,872 --> 00:46:03,611
‘Cause I never wanna lose you.

774
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:07,072
I love you, Luna.

775
00:46:08,337 --> 00:46:10,846
I love you in ways I didn’t even know I could.

776
00:46:13,175 --> 00:46:14,299
I love you.

777
00:46:15,177 --> 00:46:16,791
I love you, Kalix.

778
00:46:17,012 --> 00:46:19,471
I love you so, so, much!

779
00:46:40,202 --> 00:46:41,994
We won’t get along?

780
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:43,804
I’m already giving you full creative freedom.

781
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:45,307
That’s not the problem, Kalix.

782
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:47,459
- Then what’s the problem? - You really wanna know?

783
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,455
I don’t want to work with you.

784
00:46:49,836 --> 00:46:52,705
I can’t work with people who don’t value their principles.

785
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,133
And I just realized that…

786
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:57,416
I hate you.

787
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:44,349
Really?!

788
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:47,072
We'll be together for Christmas in New York?

789
00:47:48,562 --> 00:47:51,022
I still can't believe it!

790
00:47:51,022 --> 00:47:52,119
Ah.

791
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:54,484
So, he’ll be in New York, too?

792
00:47:54,484 --> 00:47:55,944
Kalix and I will meet there.

793
00:47:55,944 --> 00:47:58,321
By the way, I’ve already introduced him to Dad.

794
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,782
Wow! I never realized

795
00:48:00,782 --> 00:48:02,588
you were that serious.

796
00:48:03,034 --> 00:48:05,620
Of course, this is for long-term.

797
00:48:06,037 --> 00:48:07,893
I already met your parents,

798
00:48:08,123 --> 00:48:10,432
and I think it’s time for you to meet mine.

799
00:48:11,493 --> 00:48:12,786
No offense, dear, okay?

800
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:14,396
I just think that Kalix

801
00:48:14,421 --> 00:48:18,175
had better grades last year when he was with his ex-girlfriend, Amethyst.
