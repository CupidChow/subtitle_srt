1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:05,988
(Sorry Not Sorry)

2
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:06,573
(The characters, locations,
organizations, businesses, events, groups,

3
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:07,157
settings, and procedures are all
unrelated to actual persons or events.)

4
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:07,551
(Filming with child actors
took place under the

5
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:08,004
supervision of guardians
and in a safe environment.)

6
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:10,561
Yeah, Song-yi is getting
married to a nice guy

7
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:13,197
Yeah, so we're...
Song-yi, I can explain

8
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,122
You don't have to explain

9
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:15,800
She's your ex-girlfriend!

10
00:00:15,824 --> 00:00:19,394
(It's already been four months
since I've become a divorcee)

11
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:24,108
(Some say that there's nothing wrong with
being a divorce these days)

12
00:00:24,132 --> 00:00:27,635
(And console me that I'll meet
someone nice again soon)

13
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,007
Stop sticking to me!

14
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,509
Seriously!

15
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,311
Jay!

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,124
(However...)

17
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:41,292
It tickles!

18
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:44,995
(To me, who's living as
Jay's mom in a new town...)

19
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:46,354
I'm making you pretty

20
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:48,933
(The only men around me are...)

21
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:49,991
Have a great day!

22
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:51,426
Bye

23
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,903
Good morning

24
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,905
Hello, it's another good morning

25
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,899
(Kindergarten bus driver)
(Jay's kindergarten bus driver)

26
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:04,005
(The apartment security guard)

27
00:01:05,573 --> 00:01:06,974
(No)

28
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,153
(Even if my life is deprived of men)

29
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:11,045
(Cafe owner)
(He's way too young)

30
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:15,683
It's me

31
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:17,852
Jin-ho?

32
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:19,029
Umm...

33
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:21,456
I was...

34
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:23,925
wondering if...

35
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,561
we could meet up in private

36
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,030
Why would I?

37
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:33,968
I'm actually... My wife and I are

38
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:36,237
sexless

39
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:38,306
Wh, what?

40
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,051
So, I really need you

41
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:43,511
Can you please meet up with me once?

42
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,824
(But still...
A married man hitting on me?)

43
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:48,850
(Isn't that ridiculous?)

44
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:09,537
(I hadn't known before)

45
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:10,839
(that in a new town...)

46
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,974
(Large waste disposal receipt)

47
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:16,782
(...there are no men to marry)

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,879
[Sorry Not Sorry]

49
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:28,890
Crazy, that's crazy

50
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,892
Right? It's strange, isn't it?

51
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:32,861
Hey, but it's pretty common

52
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,939
for couples to go sexless
after getting married

53
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:37,298
But why would he tell me such things?

54
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,333
I agree that's weird

55
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,814
But that's apparently how married men
seduce women these days

56
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:46,174
They start by saying,
"My wife and I are at odds"

57
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:48,242
And hint that they have room
for someone else

58
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:54,815
But he's not that intelligent

59
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,997
You're talking about the
21-year-old you dated

60
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,590
But now he's 35 years old
He wouldn't be the same

61
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:04,392
You never know

62
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:09,797
During the decade you haven't seen him,
he could've evolved into a sly fox

63
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:11,132
You think so?

64
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,436
He might be tactless, but he isn't trashy

65
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:20,041
Hey, even at my office,
people are having an affair

66
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,078
There are a lot of married people
acting normal but actually aren't

67
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:25,213
Really?

68
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:26,547
Yes

69
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:40,661
Hey

70
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:43,965
How many times do you do it?

71
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:50,147
Seldom since I got pregnant

72
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:54,242
But before that, in a week...

73
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,048
Hey, hey!

74
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:02,026
Are you sure you were busy with work?

75
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,852
That's that, and this is this

76
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:13,127
Hey, but that house might be the one
with bizarre vibes

77
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:18,032
You know, you're smart,
but you're into superstitions

78
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:21,278
I mean, all of this happened
after you moved in

79
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,070
Even Eun-gyu has returned

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,583
Yeah?

81
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:30,120
Whenever our chairman has to
make big decisions,

82
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,456
he visits a renowned life consultant

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,181
Life consultant?

84
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:35,816
Insurance?

85
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:38,062
A fortune teller!

86
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:39,820
He gets his fortune read

87
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:42,623
Forget it

88
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,859
I don't even have the money
to read my fortune

89
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,907
(This is the last warning, remove the car
by midnight, or I'll call the police)

90
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,575
Oh? What are you doing?

91
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:11,185
Do you live here in unit 1605?

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,854
Yes

93
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:16,424
You kept sticking notes on our door,

94
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:18,592
so I did a bit of online research

95
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,661
I'm an attorney

96
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:23,664
This isn't blocking the evacuation route

97
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,701
And if it is immediately moveable,
it doesn't violate fire regulations

98
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,514
The judgment of whether it's blocking the
evacuation route is subjective

99
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,615
Look here

100
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,341
This tiny baby car...

101
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,610
No, you'll say that it's tiny
and cute because it's your child's

102
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,078
But I find this bothersome

103
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:39,280
He's not my child!

104
00:05:44,252 --> 00:05:45,929
I mean, what I'm saying is...

105
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:46,788
Huh?

106
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:50,324
He's my nephew...

107
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,093
Forget it

108
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:54,395
You're not the only law firm available

109
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:56,831
I quit
I'm not entrusting this case to you

110
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,466
I'm so sorry to hear that

111
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:01,035
I really want to help you,

112
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,670
but I guess there's nothing
I can do about it!

113
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:05,306
If you don't mean it, don't say it

114
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:09,420
That, that...

115
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:12,380
What a temper

116
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:18,986
Did you divorce soundly?

117
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,122
You really think that's
an appropriate question?

118
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:24,225
I didn't mean to offend you

119
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:28,162
Since I wasn't in charge of it,
I wondered if you got it sorted nicely,

120
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,464
Yes!

121
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,710
I met a very kind and competent attorney
and got it sorted nicely

122
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:34,969
and I'm doing very well!

123
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:36,504
Oh, is that so?

124
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:38,672
Good for you

125
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:41,342
Anyway, I made myself clear

126
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:42,576
Move this

127
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:45,179
Oh, and

128
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:50,818
you'd be wrong to believe everything
on the Internet is correct, okay?

129
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,664
As you already know,
and let me point out once more,

130
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:55,389
my occupational expertise is in law

131
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:58,225
What I read was an answer
written by an attorney!

132
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:04,632
Yes, well done!

133
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,649
Maybe this house really does
have bizarre vibes

134
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:24,518
You're home

135
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:29,824
Yeah

136
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:32,960
It has bizarre vibes, all right

137
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,337
Yes, Hana

138
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:47,274
That life consultant you mentioned earlier
Where can I meet one?

139
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:58,118
Next sister!

140
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,528
May I take a seat?

141
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:23,144
You're pretending
to be chill and okay

142
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:26,213
but you're in a stew

143
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:29,383
You're actually soft-hearted

144
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,919
and feel lonely easily

145
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,188
That's right

146
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,790
You were in one hell of a fire this year

147
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,091
That's right!

148
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:40,828
You're here because of a man

149
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:45,032
And marriage...

150
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:46,734
Oh, well...

151
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:51,605
Why did you pick such a guy?

152
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,884
No way! That's right!

153
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,519
That's why I parted with him

154
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:58,045
Good job
Breakups are better than divorce

155
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:00,281
Yes, after getting a divorce...

156
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:04,885
What?

157
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,165
My words are getting muddled up

158
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:10,758
You did a great job in getting a divorce

159
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:14,094
He's a big no-no
I'm not getting the vibes from him

160
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:16,297
You did a great job parting with him
He's a no-no

161
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:22,436
But then, you're the style to have
men around you all the time

162
00:09:23,537 --> 00:09:26,206
but right now, that energy

163
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,575
can't be found

164
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,611
None

165
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:35,082
What will happen to me from now on?

166
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:38,786
Or is it because I moved recently
and there's something wrong...

167
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,387
Hey, you!

168
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:45,192
How dare you in front of the princess!

169
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,895
Hurry and apologize!

170
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:49,830
I'm sorry

171
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,599
You really startled me

172
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:59,006
Princess, can you please check

173
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:04,345
if this lady is lucky or not?

174
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:06,614
Take a pick

175
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:18,959
Here you go, princess

176
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:23,330
Don't worry

177
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:26,033
You have another man

178
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:26,667
Really?

179
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,602
And he's...

180
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,214
A prince

181
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:44,218
Prince charming

182
00:10:45,553 --> 00:10:46,854
Really?

183
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:50,057
He's a prince?

184
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:51,525
Take a good look

185
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:54,037
He's nearby

186
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:56,096
Around you

187
00:10:58,332 --> 00:10:59,733
Dress

188
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:02,870
It's a princess dress

189
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:06,840
You'll get married

190
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,442
next year

191
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:10,844
Next year is too soon

192
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:13,681
Oh, what's going on?

193
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,249
She must've come and left

194
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:18,686
Hang in there for now!

195
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,430
You have good energy right now!

196
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,590
And don't move out of that house

197
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,627
That house has good energy,
but it's just a little intense

198
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,029
But then...

199
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,197
Yes?

200
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:34,835
You must get him this time

201
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:36,770
Sister

202
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:39,173
There is no next time

203
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,743
If you miss this opportunity,
your luck for men

204
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:45,145
will be over!

205
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:51,685
The next time you'll get married
will be when you're around 78

206
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,320
Huh?

207
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:55,456
What?

208
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,658
Oh, dear

209
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:04,665
Wait, 78?

210
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,543
Hey, just live with me

211
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,937
I'll let you live in a super luxurious
retirement home

212
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:11,605
I'm serious

213
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,375
Why would you get married again?
Once is enough

214
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:17,554
Who got married?

215
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:20,247
I wouldn't be this upset if I had
really gotten married

216
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,826
Don't get married

217
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,919
Right?
Aunt Song should live with us

218
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:29,256
But then, why aren't you sleeping, Jay?

219
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,628
Don't say that,
he'll refuse to sleep even more

220
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:37,731
Anyway, don't stop me

221
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,643
Okay

222
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,402
I can't stay sad forever

223
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,840
Even if I don't remarry,
I want to have a boyfriend

224
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,307
Really?

225
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:49,910
You're so different from me

226
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:55,349
I feel sorry for you who don't know
the beauty of love

227
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,485
I feel sorry for you

228
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,119
Oh, my goodness

229
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:05,025
Wait, aren't you going to sleep?
You'll be late for kindergarten!

230
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,237
Okay, let's try reading this together

231
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:09,630
(Trash)
You need to learn Hangeul now

232
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:12,800
Who is it?

233
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:15,202
Nobody

234
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,778
(Is your bathroom okay now?)

235
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,281
(Is there anything else we
should compensate for?)

236
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:42,739
(Trash)
(A gift has arrived from "Jin-ho")

237
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:44,331
(Trash: You read my message)

238
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:45,933
Ugh, is he nuts?

239
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:54,408
What are you looking at?

240
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:55,576
Huh?

241
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,111
Nothing

242
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:06,920
Where are you going?

243
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:08,488
Huh?

244
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,934
I'm going to throw out the trash

245
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,035
Now?

246
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,995
Yeah, we received a lot of parcels today

247
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,364
I'll be back

248
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,377
You've really lost it, haven't you?

249
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,382
Keep it down!

250
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:37,327
I mean!

251
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:39,019
You scared me, for crying out loud

252
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,131
Oh, my heart...

253
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:43,323
That's for me to say

254
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,794
I mean...

255
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:52,766
I'm sorry about calling abruptly
without any explanation

256
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,836
But I was that frustrated!

257
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:58,439
Even if you're stupid and annoying,

258
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,641
I doubted you'd be a piece of trash

259
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:03,110
Wake up, you idiot

260
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,348
I know that men can't forget
their first love

261
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:11,084
but how can you do this to me when you're
with a woman like Chan-yang?

262
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:12,519
Huh?

263
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:14,488
And I'm

264
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:18,735
also married now

265
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,137
If you keep doing this,
it'll make you a total jerk

266
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:22,405
I told you

267
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:24,240
Pretend you don't know me
I'm going home

268
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:26,466
Wait, hey, hey, Song-yi

269
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:27,968
Song-yi

270
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,038
I think you're mistaken

271
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:31,982
Mistaken?

272
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,984
You dialed my number and called me

273
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:36,376
No, no, that's not what I meant

274
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:40,214
I realized after meeting you again

275
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:41,315
The answer is...

276
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,817
So cliché for a married guy

277
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,285
No!

278
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,133
My first love is Chan-yang

279
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,259
And she's the only love of my life

280
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:55,696
Huh?

281
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,933
Then, why did you...

282
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,341
Song-yi, Song-yi

283
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,509
please help me

284
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:13,047
I can't go on like this
I must change

285
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,382
At this rate, Chan-yang will leave me

286
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:17,784
What?

287
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:21,131
"All women think like this"
This is what you taught me

288
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:23,523
when we were dating

289
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:27,470
Please, Song-yi
Please help me just once

290
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:31,631
No matter how hard I think about it,
I can't figure out what to do

291
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,204
What if I get divorced?

292
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,917
Wait a minute

293
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:52,719
Let me bring my trash, too

294
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:54,721
See you there

295
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,670
(I do my best to stay
in Chan-yang's favor)

296
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:14,775
(Romantic indirect lighting
and the intensity of candles)

297
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,187
(For a subtle scent, a single spray)

298
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:21,815
(on our pillow covers, the edges
of our duvet, and the air)

299
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,455
(The ideal temperature and humidity
to relax the body)

300
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:30,791
(And most importantly)

301
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:34,594
(Tight abs to touch)

302
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:42,245
What?

303
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,180
You sound like a pervert

304
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:45,839
No

305
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,243
Chan-yang liked it

306
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:01,331
Honey, what's all this?

307
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,790
How romantic

308
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:10,997
(I always maintained
the best setting and frequency)

309
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:14,701
(Tuesdays, since Chan-yang has
fewer classes the next day...)

310
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:16,103
That's enough

311
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,071
Hey, that's too much information

312
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,340
You don't have to go that far

313
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,142
Okay

314
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,878
But then,

315
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,515
since a few months ago, she kind of...

316
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:30,450
changed

317
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,493
Let's go to sleep

318
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:41,862
Did you attach a sticker
for today as well?

319
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:43,029
Yes

320
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,410
Are you sure you haven't
done anything wrong?

321
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:59,045
Of course, I'm sure

322
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,883
Everyone else takes hair loss pills,
but I don't because I'm saving my stamina

323
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,284
for the sake of my wife

324
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:06,987
Whoa, you have hair loss?

325
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,422
That's not the point

326
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,825
Sorry

327
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,131
Shall we...

328
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:55,869
do it today?
It's been a while

329
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,806
Um...

330
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,142
Aren't you tired?

331
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,710
You worked overtime today

332
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:09,182
I'm okay

333
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:13,086
Now?

334
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:06,072
Oh, this...

335
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:08,642
H, honey?

336
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:12,245
It's nothing

337
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,982
I must've been a little tired today

338
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:31,458
(It was locked?)

339
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:33,727
(Yes)

340
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:36,896
(I couldn't even figure out the passcode)

341
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,303
(It's not my birthday, our wedding
anniversary, or Chan-yang's birthday)

342
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:47,974
(I swear there's something going on)

343
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,479
(There's something she hasn't told me)

344
00:22:56,516 --> 00:23:00,587
It's 99% positive if she has a passcode...

345
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:03,823
What should I do?

346
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,759
Wait, what if...

347
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:09,095
What if she's having an affair?

348
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:31,718
Here

349
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,555
Thanks

350
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:41,594
Hey, you didn't cry when you
broke up with me

351
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:48,067
I mean, come to think of it,

352
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:50,980
that wasn't love

353
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:54,317
It was more like how ducklings recognize
the first entity after hatching as a...

354
00:23:54,341 --> 00:23:55,575
Stop, stop!

355
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:57,343
I know
I feel the same way, too

356
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:03,016
I'll try whatever I can

357
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,987
But first, let's find out what has happened

358
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:09,656
Okay?

359
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:16,129
Don't cry, okay?

360
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:22,335
Goodness me

361
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:36,416
Even if there's no one at this hour,

362
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,762
she must be seeing lots of men
after her divorce

363
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:04,177
Hello

364
00:25:04,477 --> 00:25:05,855
Hello

365
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,980
Hello

366
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,914
Hi

367
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:09,215
Yes

368
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:14,787
You must be going to work

369
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:17,357
No, most of my classes are in the afternoon

370
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,592
- I see
- Yes

371
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:28,568
Then, where are you going now?

372
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:30,970
I'm going to work out

373
00:25:35,642 --> 00:25:38,444
Is it a PT session?

374
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:40,547
Yes, that's right

375
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,122
Is the trainer a man?

376
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:52,525
It's a woman, but why do you ask?

377
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,229
Song, let's hurry

378
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,932
I'll be late for kindergarten at this rate!

379
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,500
Oh, okay

380
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:25,325
Wow, what's that?

381
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:29,629
It looks like a talisman

382
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:35,511
Song-yi, did you

383
00:26:35,535 --> 00:26:37,704
see a fortune teller on your day off?

384
00:26:37,737 --> 00:26:39,205
Oh, well...

385
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:42,509
My friend recommended this
famous fortune teller...

386
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,711
That's fascinating

387
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,179
How was it?

388
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:50,450
Well, it was pretty spot-on

389
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,019
Sister
There is no next time

390
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:55,688
If you miss this opportunity,
your luck for men

391
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:57,724
will be over!

392
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:03,296
Your subsequent marriage luck will come
when you're around 78

393
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:11,638
Wh, what is it?

394
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:17,143
I was told some bad things, too

395
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,485
He's a prince

396
00:27:25,952 --> 00:27:27,620
Take a good look

397
00:27:27,787 --> 00:27:29,498
He's nearby

398
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,624
Around you

399
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:45,638
Why are you so interested in me?

400
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:49,909
Well...

401
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,813
You're interesting

402
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:55,491
and funny

403
00:27:55,515 --> 00:27:58,651
And someone like you is hard
to find in Cheonpo

404
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:05,525
I went there because I was curious
about my future

405
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,762
Song-yi, let's eat

406
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,340
Should I order delivery food?

407
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:12,632
No

408
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:15,768
Let's go and eat out

409
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:20,340
Why?

410
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,708
The two of us?

411
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,743
How should I put it?

412
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,878
It's like a team dinner

413
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:28,448
Do you have to babysit Jay again today?

414
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,653
No, my sister is coming home early today

415
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:34,788
Perfect

416
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:36,189
Then, today it is

417
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:39,325
Welcome

418
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:41,561
- Hello
- Hello

419
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:43,229
What would you like to order?

420
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:52,839
Excuse me

421
00:28:58,077 --> 00:28:59,579
We'll have Set A

422
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:00,780
Yes

423
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:02,949
(Eun-gyu: See?)

424
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,861
(I told you you shouldn't go out
dressed like that)

425
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:08,063
(But still, meet him once)

426
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:09,865
We'll have Set A

427
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:12,892
And the steak...

428
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:15,704
Song-yi?

429
00:29:15,728 --> 00:29:17,730
Your steak

430
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:23,369
Medium well-done

431
00:29:23,937 --> 00:29:25,304
Yes

432
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,674
And as for the wine...

433
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,844
Can you recommend a French one?

434
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,314
This one
Oh, two

435
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:37,993
- Can we get this one?
- Sure

436
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:39,452
Thank you

437
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:47,193
It seems more expensive than I thought

438
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:49,128
Oh, uh...

439
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,076
I have my mom's credit card

440
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,668
Oh, lucky you!

441
00:29:55,702 --> 00:29:57,036
I'm kidding

442
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:01,350
I mean, well...

443
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:04,477
I just wanted to be with you
somewhere other than the cafe

444
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:05,912
With me?

445
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:07,079
Yes

446
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:20,626
He's a prince

447
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:22,505
(He's nearby)

448
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,330
(Around you!)

449
00:30:57,664 --> 00:30:59,365
I'm sorry

450
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:07,206
Oh, what the...

451
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,548
"Tsk"?

452
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:17,760
What?

453
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:20,486
Did he just go "tsk" at me?

454
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,573
Someone like him goes on a date?

455
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:46,979
Who is it?

456
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,457
Is it a friend?

457
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:50,683
No, he's not a friend

458
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:54,897
Oh! Uh...

459
00:31:54,921 --> 00:31:58,524
I just think that looks good

460
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:02,595
Excuse me!

461
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:03,639
Yes

462
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:06,499
Can we have the same menu
as them over there?

463
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:08,510
- Sure
- Thank you

464
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:09,469
No, it's okay

465
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,448
Come on, eat up
You should eat when you have the chance

466
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,840
There's too much already

467
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,241
I'll have the leftovers

468
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:17,186
Is it good? What do you think?

469
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,177
It's good

470
00:32:18,177 --> 00:32:19,745
That's a relief

471
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,816
I'll take you to a nicer place next time

472
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,751
You should have some, too

473
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:33,225
Now, when I see lovey-dovey couples,
they all look like they're having an affair

474
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,536
Pardon?

475
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,262
Really?

476
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:38,664
Wow, that's awesome

477
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:42,001
I see

478
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:45,271
Seeing that there's an age difference,

479
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:46,805
I must be right

480
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:54,347
To think that my husband is sitting around
like that somewhere,

481
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,383
my blood boils

482
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,095
I see

483
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,054
But you must stay cool

484
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:05,491
A divorce lawsuit is a battle with yourself

485
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,427
Of course, of course

486
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:14,943
This is why I like you

487
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:17,980
Suppressing this anger of mine,

488
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:20,439
you're like cold ice

489
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:25,688
I'll listen to you and win this suit

490
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,581
I'll find all the bank accounts he's hidden

491
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:31,317
and strip him bare

492
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:33,519
Of course

493
00:33:34,187 --> 00:33:35,621
Cheers

494
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:48,077
But why aren't you drinking?

495
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:50,279
You ordered such an expensive
glass of wine

496
00:33:50,303 --> 00:33:52,715
I don't drink
It doesn't taste good

497
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,650
Then, why did you order it?

498
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:57,276
I thought you'd like it

499
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,752
Sometimes in the morning,

500
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:09,331
you give a whiff of alcohol, as if you
drank a lot the night before...

501
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:13,692
That's when I was having a hard time

502
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:20,499
Then, what do you like?

503
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:28,240
I like coffee and dessert

504
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:33,178
Bread, ice cream, and...

505
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:34,790
And...

506
00:34:34,814 --> 00:34:36,315
Um

507
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:41,053
I have something to ask

508
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:43,799
How old are you?

509
00:34:43,823 --> 00:34:46,325
You didn't tell me during
my job interview, either

510
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:48,403
That's right

511
00:34:48,427 --> 00:34:50,295
Tell me

512
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:52,965
Then...

513
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,468
I will if you talk to me casually

514
00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:58,437
(He's nearby)

515
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:00,573
(Around you)

516
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:05,811
If you miss this opportunity,
your luck for men

517
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,847
will be over

518
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,015
(Right)

519
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:14,687
(This might be my new opportunity)

520
00:35:15,588 --> 00:35:17,389
(So what if he's younger than me?)

521
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:19,792
(Others are dying to date younger men)

522
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,763
(And he's also good-looking)

523
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:31,570
(I, Ji Song-yi, will start using my skills)

524
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:36,842
Oh, seriously

525
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:46,819
Oh, come on

526
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:50,890
How old do I look?

527
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:53,993
That kind of question is boring

528
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:58,407
But you're over 30, right?

529
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:00,132
I don't think you're in your 20s

530
00:36:05,972 --> 00:36:07,840
Thirty...

531
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:08,908
Up?

532
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:11,977
I'm...

533
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:16,282
Twenty-eight

534
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,450
Are you okay?

535
00:36:20,353 --> 00:36:21,420
Excuse me

536
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,888
Are you okay?

537
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,592
Excuse me, can we get some napkins?

538
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:27,703
Are you okay?

539
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,395
I'm fine

540
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:35,968
(He was a lot younger
than I thought)

541
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:39,872
(Shame on you, Ji Song-yi)

542
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,175
(He's younger than Eun-gyu
What was I thinking?)

543
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,449
Did you enjoy dinner?

544
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:51,817
Yes

545
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:58,991
I'll take you to another nice
restaurant next time

546
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:01,026
That sounds great

547
00:37:06,232 --> 00:37:07,233
Song-yi

548
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:10,736
(What? Is he asking me
to hold his arm right now?)

549
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:19,345
Then, I'll see you tomorrow
I had fun today

550
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,813
Okay

551
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,749
Huh?

552
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:33,092
Don't tell me

553
00:37:33,993 --> 00:37:35,861
that's his charms...

554
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,537
Um...

555
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:48,574
You've gotten your papers sorted, right?

556
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:50,886
What?

557
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,446
I mean, some of my clients

558
00:37:53,446 --> 00:37:56,315
easily and swiftly move on
to someone new, thinking it's okay

559
00:37:56,315 --> 00:38:00,252
because they're in the middle
of a divorce suit

560
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:03,489
Regardless, why do you care?

561
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:08,627
It's just my expertise jumping in

562
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:12,007
Having a relationship before
a validated divorce

563
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:13,666
is an illicit act

564
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,201
And it'll be very disadvantageous to you
in the lawsuit

565
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,244
Excuse me

566
00:38:16,268 --> 00:38:17,303
Yes?

567
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:19,872
I'm completely divorced

568
00:38:19,872 --> 00:38:21,183
It's all over

569
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:23,809
Thanks to a competent attorney
who is much better, kinder,

570
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,078
and warm-hearted than you

571
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,814
My goodness

572
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,885
I mean, all you did was throw a fit
during the consultation

573
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:35,788
This edgy attitude of a client
who didn't even sign the contract...

574
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:36,989
Shhh

575
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:38,958
Your short-mindedness
and impulsive behavior...

576
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:39,634
That's enough

577
00:38:39,658 --> 00:38:42,762
Made me worried, so I was
only trying to remind you once again...

578
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:45,064
Your nosiness is declined

579
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:50,235
I guess I was being too kind

580
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:56,408
Good bye

581
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:42,654
(She doesn't seem to be
texting anyone in particular)

582
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:52,931
Song-yi, do you like women?

583
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,634
Pardon?

584
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,037
No
It's not like that

585
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:01,273
What a relief

586
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:04,576
(Why is it a relief?)

587
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,750
Do you have a charger?

588
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,253
I'm sorry, but we don't
charge your devices for you

589
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:15,897
We do! We have a charger

590
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,389
Everything is possible

591
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:19,391
Of course

592
00:40:23,762 --> 00:40:25,831
We don't allow this

593
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:26,999
We do

594
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:32,171
Goodbye

595
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,978
(Face Not Recognized)

596
00:41:07,907 --> 00:41:09,775
Were you trying to find this out?

597
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:11,143
Yes

598
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,281
I mean, well...
I'm not some stalker

599
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:16,615
Give it to me

600
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:05,831
So she wasn't having an affair
but was reading X-rated web novels?

601
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:11,803
They're super X-rated,
and she spent a fortune on them

602
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:16,108
But I guess it's a relief, right?

603
00:42:18,344 --> 00:42:19,711
But then, why?

604
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:22,814
She has me

605
00:42:36,662 --> 00:42:37,996
I think I know why

606
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:40,032
What is it?

607
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:43,635
You're too nice

608
00:42:45,304 --> 00:42:46,581
What's wrong with that?

609
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,806
What did you say last time?

610
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:50,218
Spraying perfume and adjusting
the temperature and humidity?

611
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:52,420
That's not what matters

612
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,246
Look at the male characters here

613
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,648
Do they look like they'd care
about such things?

614
00:42:56,882 --> 00:42:58,183
But I also have abs

615
00:42:58,317 --> 00:43:00,152
No, no

616
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,322
Yes, think of the past

617
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:07,068
You'd ask things like,
"Can I hold your hand? I'll hold your hand"

618
00:43:07,092 --> 00:43:08,827
And I told you not to ask for consent
on everything

619
00:43:08,827 --> 00:43:11,129
Why are you bringing up the bygones?

620
00:43:12,498 --> 00:43:15,277
She might be up for trying something new

621
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,169
because you're always the same

622
00:43:17,403 --> 00:43:21,540
Hey, even from a glance, they all look
the opposite to you

623
00:43:22,775 --> 00:43:26,111
You should try them out one at a time

624
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:28,547
Me?

625
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:29,781
Yes

626
00:43:31,183 --> 00:43:32,961
How about this one? This one
Lightly

627
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,586
Try starting with this one

628
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:51,103
"I must have you tonight"

629
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,086
"I must have you tonight"

630
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,578
"I must"

631
00:44:02,815 --> 00:44:04,149
"Stay put"

632
00:44:04,817 --> 00:44:06,184
"Put your hands up"

633
00:44:08,487 --> 00:44:09,788
"Hands!"

634
00:44:11,123 --> 00:44:12,391
"Put your hands up!"

635
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,394
"I must have you tonight"

636
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,296
"Stay put"

637
00:44:17,296 --> 00:44:18,563
"Put your hands up"

638
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,832
"H, hands up"

639
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,780
I failed again

640
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,652
Song-yi!

641
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:53,965
You must be Jay

642
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,439
Jay, you should say hello

643
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:03,952
I'm sorry, he must've had a bad day

644
00:45:03,976 --> 00:45:05,610
A bad day?

645
00:45:07,946 --> 00:45:10,716
What is it? Are you really
going to keep it to yourself?

646
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,787
Did you argue with Sia?

647
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:18,290
No, it's not like that

648
00:45:18,957 --> 00:45:21,093
Then, what is it?

649
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:24,129
Beep, beep, beep

650
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:26,198
Did you fail your Taekwondo
level promotion test?

651
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:27,409
Beep, beep

652
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,801
Did you break your toy?

653
00:45:30,502 --> 00:45:32,037
Hold on a sec

654
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:38,777
Dad

655
00:45:43,048 --> 00:45:44,382
Dad?

656
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,120
We will have Father's Day at school

657
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,090
But then, who will come for me?

658
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:54,693
I don't have a dad

659
00:45:54,693 --> 00:45:57,262
So who will come for me?

660
00:45:58,764 --> 00:46:01,843
Jay, why would you be upset
about something like that?

661
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:03,244
I don't like it!

662
00:46:03,268 --> 00:46:06,238
All the other kids will have their dads!

663
00:46:06,238 --> 00:46:09,241
But I'm the only one without one!

664
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:20,619
Jay

665
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,355
How about I do it for you?

666
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:29,003
I am your father

667
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:31,830
No, you're not my dad

668
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,600
Come on, I will be your father
No problem!

669
00:46:37,102 --> 00:46:38,870
I'll be there for you

670
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:40,248
Really?

671
00:46:40,272 --> 00:46:42,040
Yes, for real

672
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:49,681
You really don't have to...

673
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:52,327
No, I think it'll be lots of fun

674
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,496
Yes, we'll be playing games, too

675
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,464
Wow, really? That sounds like fun!

676
00:46:56,488 --> 00:46:58,290
I'm really good at playing games

677
00:46:59,658 --> 00:47:00,826
Jay, come over here

678
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,740
You like that, don't you?

679
00:47:16,642 --> 00:47:18,386
Do you want another glass of tomato juice?

680
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:19,644
Okay

681
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:12,898
Darn!

682
00:48:12,898 --> 00:48:14,065
This feels freaking good!

683
00:48:17,002 --> 00:48:18,012
Huh?

684
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:19,671
Huh? Oh

685
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:23,141
Sorry, it just felt too good

686
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:24,843
That scared you, didn't it?
I won't do it

687
00:48:27,346 --> 00:48:28,580
No

688
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,184
Honey, I want more

689
00:48:34,052 --> 00:48:35,253
Huh?

690
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:37,355
Was, was it okay?

691
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,094
Darn! This feels freaking good!

692
00:48:43,528 --> 00:48:44,839
Did I do a good job?

693
00:48:44,863 --> 00:48:46,874
Hush, keep going

694
00:48:46,898 --> 00:48:48,333
Stay put!

695
00:48:48,934 --> 00:48:50,335
You better be punished!

696
00:48:50,335 --> 00:48:51,803
Like this? Like this? Should I continue?

697
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:52,814
Yes, go on

698
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:55,173
So good! It feels so good!

699
00:49:01,246 --> 00:49:02,214
Hi, Jay

700
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:03,391
- Good morning
- Good morning

701
00:49:03,415 --> 00:49:04,449
Have fun, Jay

702
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:05,984
Bye!

703
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:15,870
You guys ready?

704
00:49:15,894 --> 00:49:16,604
Yeah!

705
00:49:16,628 --> 00:49:18,063
Let's go

706
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,383
He was so upset yesterday

707
00:49:28,407 --> 00:49:30,342
But look at him all happy again

708
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,645
I better thank Mr. Kim

709
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,261
Oh! Come on...

710
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:41,944
("Trash" sent a gift and a message)

711
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:45,123
(Trash: Thank you, Ms. Ji Eun-young)

712
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:48,493
(You are my savior, indeed)

713
00:49:53,065 --> 00:49:54,666
Is this right?

714
00:50:10,698 --> 00:50:12,559
(His long fingers slowly traced
the back of Ha-yoon's hand)

715
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:14,483
(Her skin grew sensitive at the hand
touching her like a piano)

716
00:50:31,303 --> 00:50:34,672
Why did he change so suddenly?

717
00:50:39,044 --> 00:50:41,012
I do like it, but...

718
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:46,017
He's isn't capable of coming up
with such ideas on his own

719
00:50:48,954 --> 00:50:50,655
Has he tried it with someone?

720
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:04,803
(Yi-an: I'm fine, I mean it)

721
00:51:04,803 --> 00:51:07,715
(I'll close the cafe on that day)

722
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:09,541
(Woohoo!)

723
00:51:12,077 --> 00:51:15,113
If he's going to such an extent,
could it be that he really likes me?

724
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:27,099
(Trash)

725
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,395
Hey, are you nuts?

726
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:31,739
Why are you calling me?

727
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:34,933
You're not even hesitant about reaching out
to me anymore, are you?

728
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,835
Song-yi

729
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,871
Please help me...

730
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:42,907
Why do you always ask me for help?

731
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,809
Please?

732
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:48,313
Once, just once

733
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,747
Oh, I...

734
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:52,817
I left the keys behind

735
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,594
Darling?

736
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,732
Now you're even asking me to

737
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,468
bring keys to the mo... motel?

738
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:12,937
You must be nuts!

739
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,240
Please?

740
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,009
Hey, I beg you

741
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,378
No one else knows

742
00:52:24,249 --> 00:52:25,550
That's true

743
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:27,252
No one else knows

744
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:31,789
Where did you put them?

745
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,437
Hey, where are you going?

746
00:52:36,461 --> 00:52:37,729
Just a minute

747
00:52:44,336 --> 00:52:46,137
What's gotten into her again?

748
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,812
My goodness, you've found
one decent place, haven't you?

749
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:57,182
I'm in front of the motel
What's your room number?

750
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,850
Okay

751
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,037
Stop calling me, you idiot

752
00:53:20,171 --> 00:53:22,707
I'm waiting for the elevator,
I'll be there soon

753
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,224
Thank you

754
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,183
Hey!

755
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:35,120
What's wrong with you?

756
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,488
"What's wrong with you?"

757
00:53:36,488 --> 00:53:40,525
You want to test my patience, don't you?

758
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:44,839
You're doing this again
after ruining my family?

759
00:53:44,863 --> 00:53:47,098
Can you call yourself human?

760
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:49,810
I don't even know who that man is!

761
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:52,504
How can you come to such a place
with a man you don't know?

762
00:53:52,504 --> 00:53:54,682
Follow me out! Follow me out!

763
00:53:54,706 --> 00:53:58,052
You and me, we're ending this today!

764
00:53:58,076 --> 00:53:59,487
- Oh? Oh? Oh?
- Out!

765
00:53:59,511 --> 00:54:01,946
What are you talking about?

766
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,190
Wait!

767
00:54:03,214 --> 00:54:04,316
Wait! Come on

768
00:54:04,316 --> 00:54:07,118
The one caught in the act, oh, wait
Let go, let go of her, and talk through it

769
00:54:08,653 --> 00:54:10,331
Wait, ma'am, please calm down

770
00:54:10,355 --> 00:54:11,065
Get over here

771
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:12,857
Did you just attack me first?

772
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:14,168
Forget the compensation

773
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:14,859
Don't do this

774
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:16,637
Let's go with a mutual settlement!

775
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:17,795
Here I come!

776
00:54:53,096 --> 00:54:54,931
Hey! Hey!

777
00:54:58,601 --> 00:54:59,912
Wait!

778
00:54:59,936 --> 00:55:01,738
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on!

779
00:55:02,205 --> 00:55:04,307
[Sorry Not Sorry]

780
00:55:31,668 --> 00:55:33,670
(Special thanks to Nam Hyun-seung
for his cameo appearance)

781
00:55:34,604 --> 00:55:36,649
But then, that boss of yours...
He's weird

782
00:55:36,673 --> 00:55:39,209
I mean, why does he step in
to go as Jay's dad?

783
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:41,253
Wait, are you telling me to apologize?

784
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:43,146
Technically, it's not my fault

785
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:45,815
Right, okay
Yeah, it's not your fault, all right

786
00:55:45,815 --> 00:55:48,160
Sia hit me

787
00:55:48,184 --> 00:55:50,520
I guess violence runs in the family

788
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,155
And just how old are you?

789
00:55:52,188 --> 00:55:54,590
Why is he doing his best?

790
00:55:54,824 --> 00:55:55,859
Watch out, Song-yi!

791
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:57,703
What do you think about when you see

792
00:55:57,727 --> 00:55:59,004
the woman your husband is
having an affair with?

793
00:55:59,028 --> 00:56:01,697
I start to get curious about her
