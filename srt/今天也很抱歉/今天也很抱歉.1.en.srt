1
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,647
(Sorry Not Sorry)

2
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,708
(The characters, locations,
organizations, businesses, events, groups)

3
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:51,290
(settings, and procedures are all
unrelated to actual persons or events)

4
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:51,606
(Filming with child actors took place

5
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,119
under the supervision of
guardians and in a safe environment)

6
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,875
I want to...

7
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,684
kill him

8
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:53,574
He ruined my life
What could possibly stop me?

9
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,383
Well, there are many options

10
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:02,222
I want it to be as painful as possible

11
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:05,759
But you seem to be mistaken

12
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:07,361
Pardon?

13
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:09,563
Are you aware of what we do here?

14
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:12,540
You're an errand service center, right?

15
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:14,127
Well...

16
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,204
We're a start-up that just started
our business

17
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,989
(Errand Service Center)
(Based on trust and faith)

18
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:25,851
We named ourselves "Errand Service"
to be witty

19
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,904
but we're in charge of

20
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:30,023
arranging housekeepers,

21
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,868
cleaning, and childcare services

22
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:38,560
Wait, then by "errand," you mean...

23
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:41,681
But listening to your story...

24
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:43,745
Wow, that wretched bastard

25
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:48,355
I fully understand why you want to kill him

26
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,536
But then...

27
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,211
That request will cost
several Crores of won

28
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,466
Several Crore?

29
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:59,037
I'm flat broke after my divorce

30
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:02,573
With the loans I've taken out because
of him and our house, I'm already...

31
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:09,056
So, let's live in goodwill

32
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,176
If that's the case

33
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:21,071
we're looking for housekeepers
and cleaning staff

34
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,217
How much is the hourly wage?

35
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:36,483
(Sorry Not Sorry)

36
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,130
(Are you back on the market? Who cares?)
(I'm getting remarried!)

37
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,980
{\an8}<i>Yes, let's admit it</i>

38
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:03,080
{\an8}<i>I'm a divorcée</i>

39
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:08,378
{\an8}<i>An ambiguous divorcée, that is
I'm legally single but not socially</i>

40
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:12,956
<i>My life has always been like this</i>

41
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,246
<i>I can't believe it</i>

42
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,807
{\an8}<i>It's not your fault</i>

43
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:24,844
{\an8}<i>Be confident</i>

44
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:26,978
{\an8}<i>That's not even a flaw these days</i>

45
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,683
{\an8}<i>I know</i>

46
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:35,266
<i>But honestly, they can only say such
things because it's none of their business</i>

47
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,309
<i>Where did it all go wrong?</i>

48
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,883
<i>Marriage is reality</i>

49
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:43,902
<i>But I was too innocent</i>

50
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,176
<i>And only thought of love...</i>

51
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:44,089
<i>This was once my newlywed house</i>

52
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,616
<i>I currently live here alone</i>

53
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,617
You startled me!

54
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,095
What the...

55
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:03,714
What's going on?

56
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,703
You startled me!

57
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,999
Why is it so hard to reach you?

58
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,184
Huh?

59
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,320
(Ji Eun-gyu: Are you
coming home late today?)

60
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:17,320
Hey, this is a question you'd ask a
family member who lives with you

61
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:20,316
You can't send me this message when we're
seeing each other in three or four years!

62
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,949
I was in a bit of a hurry

63
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:25,693
Wait, but why are you here in Korea
instead of America right now?

64
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:26,453
What about work?

65
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:29,289
And what's all this luggage?

66
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,791
I'll explain inside

67
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,660
Let's go home, Jay

68
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,997
<i>This is my younger sister Eun-gyu</i>

69
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,299
<i>She's a single mother</i>

70
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:42,292
<i>We're not both divorcées</i>

71
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,531
<i>Because Eun-gyu was never married</i>

72
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,924
(5 years ago)

73
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,592
That's how it turned out
It's a son

74
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:52,419
I named him Jay

75
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:53,729
Sperm...

76
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:56,354
Wait, do you want to hear about
the dad's profile?

77
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:58,262
- Why, you! Hey!
- The one I chose from the cryobank...

78
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,517
Hey, you crazy girl!

79
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:01,966
What? Son?

80
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,411
Return to Korea immediately!

81
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,186
- Calm down! Calm down, dad
- Did you know about it?

82
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,443
Mom, I had no idea!

83
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,045
No, I'll go there, Song-yi!

84
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,743
Ji Eun-gyu, stay right there!
I'm coming!

85
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:12,714
Hey, you crazy girl!

86
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:13,559
Honey!

87
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:17,010
<i>Unlike me, who is ambiguous, my sister
is a wacko, without a doubt</i>

88
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,688
<i>And she made me a nephew via a cryobank</i>

89
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:26,625
Hi

90
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,014
You should say hello to your aunt

91
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,074
Please let us stay with you for a while

92
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,706
Shoes over here

93
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:09,987
This is nice

94
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:10,924
It's a lovely house

95
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:15,028
The two of you can use the main room
It's over there

96
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:17,266
All right, then

97
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:18,923
Thank you

98
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,741
Mommy!

99
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,041
You must be nuts

100
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:46,011
Why do you still have this?

101
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:48,428
Do you regret it?
Why aren't you discarding this?

102
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:53,044
You've yet to learn about
the recycling culture in Korea

103
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,152
Just imagine placing that box in a plaza

104
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:58,104
where all of your neighbors walk past

105
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,676
People even glimpse at fliers piled up
at a supermarket

106
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:05,612
And this is clearly a wedding invitation
with a fancy ribbon

107
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:07,546
and it even has mom and dad's names
and my name on it!

108
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,443
At least, like...

109
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,677
Give the envelopes out for free

110
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:12,727
I mean...

111
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,046
That frame?

112
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,841
Large-size waste needs to be placed
outside with a sticker on it

113
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,800
That means it has to sit outside
for a few days

114
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,794
That's pretty much like announcing
to the neighborhood that I'm divorced

115
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,751
Who cares?

116
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:30,728
What?

117
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:38,860
Right, I get it
Let's get him to bed first

118
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:41,079
Come on Time for bed, Jay

119
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,378
Okay

120
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:47,215
Well done

121
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:54,391
Is Jay sleeping?

122
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:55,412
Yes

123
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,448
Wait, so what happened to you?

124
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:01,537
There was a bit of an accident

125
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,678
I won't be here for too long
I'll also pay for the living expenses

126
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:09,224
But it's a secret from mom and dad for now

127
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,864
You crazy, crazy girl

128
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:14,593
What have you done again?

129
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,715
Mom will go ballistic if she finds out

130
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,462
And I'm working from tomorrow

131
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:21,187
Huh?

132
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,779
Shush!

133
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,772
You'll wake Jay up

134
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,420
Have you returned to Korea for good?

135
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:27,918
Who knows?

136
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,482
Anyway, I've got everything sorted

137
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,007
so can you just take Jay
to kindergarten tomorrow?

138
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:38,135
You're driving me nuts

139
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,999
This is so frustrating

140
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,970
Until when?

141
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,773
New York?

142
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:29,583
Yes

143
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,947
As in the actual "New York"?
Not the bakery?

144
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:35,234
Yes, that's what I heard

145
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,228
You know it yourself

146
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:40,421
It isn't easy to join Noble Kindergarten
between semesters

147
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:45,296
But then, he's from New York,
so he's totally... How should I put it?

148
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:47,650
Yeah, he's an original

149
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,492
An American-born who was raised in America

150
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:52,347
That's why the principal accepted him

151
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,031
- Oh my goodness
- Huh?

152
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:55,242
"Native"

153
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,911
Your kid attends an English kindergarten,
so you should know some English, too

154
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:01,033
Is it not "Original?"

155
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:02,805
Negative, negative

156
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,207
The bus is here

157
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:12,204
Good morning How are you?

158
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,361
Have a good day

159
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,807
All right, let's get on the bus

160
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:17,750
- Bye
- Bye

161
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:21,940
I love you, Shannon
Have a good day

162
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:22,951
Shannon!

163
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,691
I love you

164
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,153
Mom will be cheering for you

165
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:29,862
See you later

166
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:30,804
Yes, goodbye

167
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,135
Shannon!

168
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:43,233
I'm craving beer

169
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:53,724
Oh my, hello! Jay's mother

170
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,628
I'm Jay's aunt

171
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:57,008
I see

172
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:58,409
Okay, then, please come this way

173
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,126
You couldn't attend the orientation

174
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:06,049
so let me give you a brief guide

175
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:07,998
The children must arrive by 9 o'clock

176
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:11,699
and activities start at half past nine

177
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:15,695
After morning snacks, reading, and
writing classes will begin at 10 o'clock

178
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,830
We also have physical education sessions

179
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:21,503
starting at 11 o'clock
to stimulate children's growth

180
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:26,394
Kids' English Yoga has a significant impact
on improving concentration

181
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,488
and stimulating the growth plates

182
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:38,610
Do you want to see?

00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:26,718
How did you get injured? Huh?

362
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:29,639
You're old enough to know better!

363
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:31,776
Get inside
Let's go inside and get ointment on that

364
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:33,038
It hurts

365
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:34,158
Go inside

366
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:38,711
You'll get injured if you're clumsy
Do you understand, Jay?

367
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:44,220
Ugh, you idiot, moron, fool

368
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,320
Are you nuts?

369
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:49,404
I know

370
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:52,208
What's the point of receiving this house
as alimony?

371
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:54,037
With all that mortgage loan...

372
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:57,708
Didn't you do the calculations?

373
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:59,187
Even from a mathematical approach...

374
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:01,193
I know!

375
00:27:01,952 --> 00:27:04,780
But once this house is sold,
I'll repay the loan

376
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:06,368
move out, and then...

377
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:13,414
Hey, go and sleep

378
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:15,397
Seoul is pretty far, isn't it?

379
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,950
You should live in Seoul
if you're that competent...

380
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:19,059
That's enough

381
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:21,451
So, how much did you earn today?

382
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,557
Forget it! I'll deal with it

383
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:30,486
Song-yi

384
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:37,251
Living expenses plus half of the
monthly loan interest

385
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,368
I'll pay you that

386
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:44,887
Huh?

387
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,698
What do you say? Are you in?

388
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,072
No

389
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,401
It's too big a sum

390
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,132
Who said I'll give it to you for free?

391
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:02,040
In return, reduce your part-time job
and look after Jay

392
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,347
Just say the word, boss

393
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:19,978
Shall I organize the bedding for you?

394
00:28:21,487 --> 00:28:23,330
You need to go to work tomorrow

395
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:01,869
Hey, get ready for work

396
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,253
Okay

397
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:37,865
<i>Like so, I started living
like a Cheonpo Mom</i>

398
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,193
<i>That I had never lived before,
thanks to Eun-gyu and Jay</i>

399
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,061
Jay, tidy up your toys

400
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:53,036
Jay, let's eat

401
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:54,200
Okay

402
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:04,107
<i>Although, it was never peaceful</i>

403
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:07,816
Oh my!

404
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:09,609
What the

405
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:12,972
Does this even make sense?

406
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,244
Darn it, it was like this last time as well
Which house is doing this?

407
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:19,015
Jay, that's dirty!
It's toilet water, it's dirty

408
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,900
Hey, prevent Jay from going inside

409
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:22,293
I'll call the management office

410
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,737
This is driving me nuts! Song-yi!

411
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:27,592
Our toilet is foaming, and it's going wild

412
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:29,047
- We need to wash up
- Do you know how much this is...

413
00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:30,575
- We can't do anything or go to work
- Get out! Song-yi!

414
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,102
Because the toilet is foaming

415
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:33,924
- The toilet is a downright mess
- This is crazy, Song-yi!

416
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,442
- We can't tidy this up ourselves, sir
- No, no

417
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,242
Look at this

418
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:42,113
Can you please check which house
is responsible for this?

419
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:44,358
(NOBLE KIDS)

420
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,443
<i>I'm here at last</i>

421
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:56,903
<i>The most flustering moment these days</i>

422
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:57,963
<i>is when I must meet new people</i>

423
00:30:57,968 --> 00:30:58,665
Excuse me...

424
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,197
<i>And introduce myself</i>

425
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,055
<i>I have no plans to
get to know that person</i>

426
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,063
<i>and I don't even know if I'll
see them frequently or not</i>

427
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,452
Hello

428
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:12,337
I'm Jay's aunt
I'm just here to pick him up

429
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:14,238
I see!

430
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:16,717
(End of conversation)
(This would be perfect)

431
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,708
<i>But unlike myself, conversations
with mothers must go as follows</i>

432
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:21,858
You must be Jay's aunt!

433
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:23,080
You're so sweet

434
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:23,961
Which class is he in?

435
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,018
Oh, really?

436
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:29,237
But then, are you married?

437
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:31,662
<i>Just because I can't be bothered</i>

438
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:32,975
(Q. Are you married?)

439
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,648
Yes!

440
00:31:35,374 --> 00:31:37,177
- <i>If I answer so</i>
- Then, you must be similar to us

441
00:31:37,182 --> 00:31:39,885
- <i>I'm likely to see her frequently</i>
- We should get along

442
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,256
<i>Then, from my husband to childcare, etc.</i>

443
00:31:42,261 --> 00:31:44,919
<i>I don't want to go that far lying</i>

444
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:46,765
(Q. Are you married?)

445
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,991
No

446
00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:50,212
<i>But this, too, is a lie</i>

447
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:52,913
I was married

448
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:54,047
(Divorce)
but I got divorced

449
00:31:57,511 --> 00:31:58,753
<i>But to say this</i>

450
00:31:58,758 --> 00:31:59,972
<i>Do I have to?</i>

451
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:01,742
<i>How would I deal with this?</i>

452
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:02,939
It's okay

453
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:04,335
<i>Was it too much information?</i>

454
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:06,338
<i>I need to consider Jay's position</i>

455
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:08,123
Excuse me...

456
00:32:08,686 --> 00:32:11,567
You're the newcomer, Jay's mother, right?

457
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:12,350
Hello

458
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:14,140
Hello, Seung-hee's mother

459
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:18,387
<i>Yeah, let's not over
think it and be honest</i>

460
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,757
Actually, I'm...

461
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:24,896
Song-yi?

462
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:28,253
You're Song-yi, right?

463
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,283
Oh my!

464
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:34,628
It's me, Hana, Choi Hana!

465
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:35,984
Yeah...

466
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:38,173
Does your child also attend here?

467
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,182
<i>Okay, let's say it with confidence!</i>

468
00:32:43,822 --> 00:32:47,740
<i>No! I'm here to pick up
my nephew, and I'm...</i>

469
00:32:48,438 --> 00:32:50,230
<i>Am I a divorcée or single?</i>

470
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:53,541
Mommy!

471
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:01,065
You must be Song-yi's son

472
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,985
You're so good-looking

473
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,722
- How fascinating!
- Wait, that's...

474
00:33:05,727 --> 00:33:07,253
Mommy!

475
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,619
Sia, Teo!

476
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:13,975
Goodness me, how beautiful

477
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,654
Goodness me

478
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,681
Wait, were they in the same class?

479
00:33:17,686 --> 00:33:19,284
What a coincidence!

480
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,734
Goodness me
Did you have fun today?

481
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:23,487
Are you happy mommy is here?

482
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:24,875
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

483
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:28,767
Are the two of you acquainted
with each other?

484
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:30,525
Sia's mom and Jay's mom?

485
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:36,253
Yes, we're from the same
middle and high schools

486
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:37,535
Alums!

487
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,914
What? Alums?

488
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,449
Oh my! I see!

489
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,792
What's the point of being an alumnus?

490
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:45,490
Not all alums are close

491
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:50,317
We were super close

492
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,700
We were best friends

493
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:54,286
Right, Jay's mom?

494
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,905
<i>Me...</i>

495
00:33:57,227 --> 00:33:58,237
<i>Jay's mom?</i>

496
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:14,660
<i>Confident? As if</i>

497
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:18,902
<i>Living in the leading apartment with
children in an expensive kindergarten</i>

498
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,951
<i>And she even has three children</i>

499
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:22,956
<i>She must be so happy</i>

500
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:26,576
<i>And to spill my current
situation before her...</i>

501
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:28,432
<i>I couldn't possibly say it</i>

502
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:31,148
<i>If I come across her</i>

503
00:34:31,844 --> 00:34:34,580
<i>I wanted to show her I was doing well</i>

504
00:34:35,645 --> 00:34:37,804
<i>Just like running into an ex-boyfriend</i>

505
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,662
<i>Dressed up nicely</i>

506
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:44,579
<i>And holding hands with a fine man</i>

507
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:55,834
{\an8}(Choi Hana)

508
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,364
"Best friends?" That rolled off her tongue
when we'd ghosted each other for ten years

509
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:03,903
Choi Hana, you just amaze me

510
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:07,919
But then, what should I do?

511
00:35:07,924 --> 00:35:09,528
What if everyone thinks I'm a mother?

512
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:14,660
What's the matter?

513
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,125
Jay, let's go home now

514
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:25,087
No

515
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:27,620
Let's go Let's go home!

516
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:30,985
No! I want to go

517
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:34,357
Okay

518
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:36,720
But we're going after two rounds, okay?

519
00:35:50,514 --> 00:35:51,533
Jay

520
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,255
But why did you say such a thing earlier?

521
00:35:54,473 --> 00:35:55,888
What do you mean?

522
00:35:57,107 --> 00:36:00,125
Why did you call me "Mommy" earlier?

523
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:02,627
I don't know

524
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,932
Do you think I'll cut you slack
if you're that adorable?

525
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:10,742
Your lie put me in a sticky situation

526
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:16,127
You shouldn't lie

527
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,037
Why?

528
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:24,582
Because it might hurt others later

529
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:29,105
Did it hurt?

530
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,329
Excuse me...

531
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:37,528
I'm sorry but by any chance...

532
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,581
Aren't I right?

533
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,485
What do you mean?

534
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,665
Kindergarten!

535
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:45,704
Noble Kids!

536
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:50,045
- Yes
- Oh my goodness! Oh my!

537
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:54,669
I also wanted to send my child there

538
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:56,093
but couldn't make it

539
00:36:57,107 --> 00:36:59,651
Seung-jun, look Isn't he cool?

540
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:02,517
Hi, I'm Jay

541
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:06,357
Oh my! Why is he so fluent?

542
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,981
Hey, Jay How old are you?

543
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:15,627
I'm older!

544
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:18,279
My goodness
Does he get private lessons?

545
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:20,530
Why is he so good at English?

546
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:24,057
I heard kids take after their mothers

547
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:25,343
so you must be intelligent

548
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:30,943
That's not it
He doesn't take classes...

549
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:34,285
Jay grew up in New York

550
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,661
New York?

551
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:39,586
As in, "New York, dduru dduru..."

552
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,065
That New York?

553
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:43,444
Oh my goodness! That's incredible!

554
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:45,649
That's insane! Oh my!

555
00:37:45,904 --> 00:37:47,121
That's...

556
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:48,339
I startled you, didn't I?

557
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:51,418
I only just moved here

558
00:37:51,423 --> 00:37:53,901
so I needed someone to talk to
Goodness me

559
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,110
Wait, how old are you?

560
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,682
9...

561
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:02,080
Oh, my!

562
00:38:04,022 --> 00:38:05,721
I was born in the 80s!

563
00:38:05,726 --> 00:38:08,947
Oh my goodness!
That's seriously amazing!

564
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:15,326
Jay must be good-looking
because he takes after your looks

565
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:17,228
She isn't my...

566
00:38:18,322 --> 00:38:21,445
We have something to do, so we'll get going

567
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,369
Jay's mom, wait...
Let's exchange numbers while we're at it

568
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:26,790
Tell me your number

569
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:28,207
- I'll see you next time
- Wait, your number...

570
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,008
I was almost there

571
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:35,929
It's so hard to make friends

572
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:46,720
What?

573
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,734
Why did you lie?

574
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:52,124
When did I? That's not true

575
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:56,181
I didn't lie
I just didn't clarify myself

576
00:38:58,158 --> 00:39:00,330
<i>I should know better
what to teach a child</i>

577
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,026
No

578
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:06,637
Don't remember what I said just now
Forget it all

579
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,777
You said it'll hurt others

580
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,903
No, she smiled

581
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,128
No

582
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:15,225
You shouldn't lie

583
00:39:17,444 --> 00:39:18,858
Okay, I won't

584
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:20,720
Promise

585
00:39:22,283 --> 00:39:25,494
Let's never lie again, promise

586
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:26,681
Okay

587
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:34,379
Jay, what do you want for dinner tonight?

588
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:36,992
Fried chicken?

589
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:39,242
Then, I'll treat you to fried chicken today

590
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:40,749
Okay

591
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:43,892
Sia

592
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:47,703
Do you remember saying you wanted
to marry daddy as a baby?

593
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:48,832
No

594
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:49,684
Huh?

595
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,684
Are you not going to marry daddy?

596
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,278
Oh, I don't know!

597
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:57,941
Bae Sia

598
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:01,779
Bae Sia

599
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:06,074
Sia, what about daddy?

600
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:12,608
Honey

601
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,709
I went to pick up the kids
and ran into an old friend today

602
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:20,427
She'll grow up and bring her boyfriend
at this rate, right?

603
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:22,392
We used to be really close

604
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:24,406
I think it's been around ten years

605
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,301
- Are you listening to me?
- Huh?

606
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:34,105
Did you have a friend here?

607
00:40:34,644 --> 00:40:36,834
You always said you hated
the other mothers...

608
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:43,298
I mean, last time, Ethan's mom pitied you
for being a working mother

609
00:40:43,303 --> 00:40:44,709
and whatever, so I...

610
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:47,852
She's such a joke!

611
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:52,280
There's a friend whom I was
really close to since middle school

612
00:40:53,142 --> 00:40:56,500
but we suddenly drifted apart
Do you remember?

613
00:40:58,875 --> 00:40:59,762
Yeah

614
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:02,919
I remember hearing about her

615
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:05,042
But then, it's a little iffy

616
00:41:07,554 --> 00:41:09,733
I swear it's unlikely

617
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,535
Why? What is it?

618
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,971
The other mothers are frantically trying
to befriend her

619
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:17,891
I mean, her child is fluent in English

620
00:41:17,896 --> 00:41:21,103
Apparently, they lived in New York
or something...

621
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:23,893
Why did she come to Cheonpo
instead of Seoul?

622
00:41:24,872 --> 00:41:25,717
But then...

623
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:29,303
Song-yi is terrible at English!

624
00:41:29,308 --> 00:41:31,887
She must've found herself a great husband

625
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,258
just like you

626
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:34,305
A husband!

627
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,241
What is going on?

628
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:39,663
She met a great husband...

629
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:43,678
But would I look too shallow if I suddenly
start contacting her?

630
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:47,684
Hey...

631
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:48,925
Ji Song-yi...

632
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,014
Do you not hear me?

633
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:54,158
Sia

634
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,000
Seriously, I'm so lonely

635
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:16,236
What kind of game is this?

636
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:19,354
This is...

637
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:23,081
"Close your eyes and stay still" game

638
00:42:26,183 --> 00:42:28,675
Liar! This isn't a game!

639
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,047
Wait, just a little bit...
Try staying in bed for a bit more

640
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,761
Okay, let's sleep...

641
00:42:38,203 --> 00:42:39,745
This is boring!

642
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,153
I'm so bored!

643
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:55,308
(Song-yi, do you still use
the same number?)

644
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,762
(It's been ages)

645
00:43:02,034 --> 00:43:04,994
(It's good to see you again, it was so
hectic earlier, so I couldn't say hello...)

646
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:14,647
Okay

647
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:16,622
What do you want to play?

648
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:22,500
But who is that man?

649
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:23,853
What's wrong with him?

650
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:30,499
<i>Everyone said</i>

651
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:32,671
<i>It was a good marriage</i>

652
00:43:33,815 --> 00:43:38,576
(Song-yi's Wedding D-58)

653
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,297
Congratulations, Song-yi

654
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,871
Wow, you look so beautiful

655
00:43:48,444 --> 00:43:50,012
Song-yi is getting married to a nice guy

656
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:53,944
We'd never find a man like this

657
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:55,987
Why? What's wrong with us?

658
00:43:56,316 --> 00:43:58,798
Exactly, what's wrong with me?

659
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:05,394
I mean, it's not like you're a competent
woman with professional expertise

660
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:07,314
working for a conglomerate

661
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:09,978
You're working for chicken feed anyway

662
00:44:11,757 --> 00:44:13,777
and you've found someone to rely on

663
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:16,014
Look at her She's resigning

664
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,783
Excuse me

665
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:20,291
I'm sorry, but I'm offended

666
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:22,846
I'm going to work again once I move

667
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:25,801
I'm resigning because our house is in
Cheonpo because of my husband's work

668
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:28,277
Of course, you should be the one to move

669
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:31,134
Because your conglomerate-working husband
will make 100 times more than you

670
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,289
Wait, but then...

671
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:35,791
Your husband is so handsome

672
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:37,877
Look

673
00:44:38,684 --> 00:44:41,288
Yeah, Song-yi is getting married
to a nice guy

674
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:44,443
And they even bought their newlywed house

675
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,815
- Not on rent?
- Not on rent! Yes!

676
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:48,578
I heard you're already living with him

677
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:51,097
They're all loans

678
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:54,757
My boyfriend has moved in already,
and I'll move in after the wedding

679
00:44:55,852 --> 00:44:59,822
What gave you the certainty
to get married, Song-yi?

680
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:04,255
I felt I'd be happy living
a trivial everyday life

681
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:09,015
if I were with him

682
00:45:12,706 --> 00:45:14,960
You'd look gorgeous in your wedding dress

683
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:18,268
<i>Although I was never better
than anyone in my life</i>

684
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:22,799
<i>I believed I'd be happy like
everyone else if we were together</i>

685
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,596
Do you want to receive it?
Okay, okay!

686
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:26,466
I should receive it

687
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:46,357
I miss you

688
00:45:46,362 --> 00:45:48,080
How's the wedding invitation
gathering going?

689
00:45:48,085 --> 00:45:49,299
I'm getting off work soon

690
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:52,401
It must be tough since he's been
working overtime lately

691
00:45:53,048 --> 00:45:55,633
He'd be surprised to see me here

692
00:45:58,123 --> 00:45:59,904
Why is he living like this?

693
00:46:02,936 --> 00:46:04,078
Goodness me

694
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,948
Song-yi!

695
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:48,461
Well, that's...

696
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:50,437
Song, Song-yi

697
00:46:50,442 --> 00:46:52,610
Yeah, so we're...
Song-yi, I can explain

698
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:53,953
This, this is...

699
00:46:55,545 --> 00:46:58,269
You crazy bastard!
I can tell even if you don't explain

700
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:02,218
She's your ex-girlfriend!

701
00:47:02,223 --> 00:47:03,384
That's true, but...

702
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:05,768
You crazy bastard!

703
00:47:05,773 --> 00:47:07,629
- Wait, that's not it!
- How can you do this to me?

704
00:47:07,634 --> 00:47:08,540
Hey!

705
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:10,685
- Hey!
- I swear that's not it

706
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,341
No, no

707
00:47:12,346 --> 00:47:13,999
What do you think you're doing?

708
00:47:14,004 --> 00:47:15,280
Song-yi, that's not it

709
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:16,441
I... I swear that's not it

710
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,100
How dare you!

711
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:20,138
Hey, that's not it

712
00:47:30,454 --> 00:47:33,725
I mean, tell me what's going on

713
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,078
Why are you suddenly getting a divorce?

714
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,484
Do you think marriage is a joke?

715
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,684
You said you'd get married,
and now you want a divorce!

716
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:41,958
I mean...

717
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:45,669
I wasn't trying to get married as a joke

718
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:48,304
Hey, Song-yi

719
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,330
That's how it is

720
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,335
Everyone lives like that

721
00:47:54,016 --> 00:47:55,451
You had an argument, didn't you?

722
00:47:57,006 --> 00:48:01,427
But if he isn't a bastard
who cheated on you, live with him

723
00:48:03,455 --> 00:48:06,271
<i>But mom, he cheated on me</i>

724
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:07,967
<i>And I witnessed it</i>

725
00:48:09,422 --> 00:48:13,013
<i>Strangely enough,
I couldn't spill the beans</i>

726
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:17,420
<i>I'd choose to look crazy to mom and dad</i>

727
00:48:17,766 --> 00:48:19,163
<i>Than look pitiful</i>

728
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:21,708
No, we didn't argue

729
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:27,423
I just wanted to start over
before it's too late

730
00:48:27,428 --> 00:48:29,806
Then, you should've decided

731
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:33,685
before I handed out the wedding invitations
to my friends!

732
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,546
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?
You must've lost it!

733
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:39,511
You even registered your marriage
to get a mortgage loan!

734
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,677
If you call off the wedding now,
that's a divorce!

735
00:48:42,682 --> 00:48:44,845
Wake up!

736
00:48:45,653 --> 00:48:49,011
No! I looked into it

737
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:53,414
We've yet to get married
and haven't even lived with each other

738
00:48:54,534 --> 00:48:57,821
We just registered our marriage
to get a house, so it can be annulled!

739
00:48:57,826 --> 00:49:01,279
I told everyone about your wedding
What are you going to do about this?

740
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:02,518
- If you call off the wedding now...
- Let go, let go of me

741
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,485
Ugh! Wake up, girl!

742
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:05,665
Have you also gone insane like Eun-gyu?

743
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:09,512
<i>The decision I made as an
adult wasn't easy to change</i>

744
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:11,905
Pardon?

745
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:15,557
Am I still a married woman, then?

746
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:19,135
Yes, regardless of the situation,
you are married

747
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,538
You registered for your marriage because
you had such intentions

748
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,126
You also got a low-interest loan

749
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:25,896
for newlywed couples

750
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:29,868
We didn't even have our wedding
We only registered our marriage!

751
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,460
And I wasn't the one who suggested it

752
00:49:32,465 --> 00:49:33,808
It was to buy the house, so that bastard...

753
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:37,443
I mean, that person...

754
00:49:37,448 --> 00:49:42,077
Yes, but at that point,
you intended to marry him

755
00:49:42,687 --> 00:49:43,280
Yes

756
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:46,917
But he cheated on me!

757
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:49,509
And that will be very advantageous

758
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:51,364
to you in the lawsuit

759
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:52,971
Because he's significantly liable

760
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:59,871
Okay, so you have clear evidence
that the two were having an affair, right?

761
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:02,116
You know, like a video or a photo

762
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:05,402
Or a voice recording with the consent
of the other party

763
00:50:06,848 --> 00:50:07,615
No

764
00:50:08,357 --> 00:50:09,306
Pardon?

765
00:50:11,397 --> 00:50:13,230
I couldn't...

766
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:18,016
When I unprecedentedly witnessed
them before my eyes

767
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:21,252
I couldn't believe it

768
00:50:22,864 --> 00:50:26,497
And at first, I hid like a fool
when I saw them

769
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:32,160
Evidence or whatever!
None of that came to mind

770
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:35,633
But then, miss?

771
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,101
You can't approach the law
emotionally like that...

772
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:41,835
I know, but what I'm saying is...

773
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:45,289
Wait, but then

774
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,701
Regardless of everything

775
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:51,530
you could at least give a word of comfort,

776
00:50:51,535 --> 00:50:53,170
"It must've been tough," no?

777
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,996
The thing is, I'm someone who gives
realistic help

778
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:02,707
rather than useless emotional consolation

779
00:51:03,195 --> 00:51:05,643
For example, swift and neat divorce

780
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:06,548
But then...

781
00:51:06,553 --> 00:51:09,347
A reasonable alimony
equivalent to the client's pain

782
00:51:09,352 --> 00:51:10,349
You're right, but!

783
00:51:10,354 --> 00:51:12,921
Okay, then, let me summarize for you

784
00:51:12,926 --> 00:51:13,680
The annulment of marriage...

785
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:14,819
Mr. Cha

786
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:19,823
You've never been betrayed by someone
you love, have you?

787
00:51:22,223 --> 00:51:24,459
Have you ever been hurt?

788
00:51:26,845 --> 00:51:28,065
I don't know

789
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,101
See?

790
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:30,979
You don't understand me

791
00:51:30,984 --> 00:51:32,866
so how can I talk about myself?

792
00:51:34,977 --> 00:51:36,789
Wait, there's no logical connection

793
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,964
between this and that

794
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:40,594
How do you plan to take my side

795
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,819
when you don't even understand me?

796
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:44,933
Come on, filing for a divorce
isn't some kid's joke!

797
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,720
There's no such thing as your side
or my side in this

798
00:51:46,725 --> 00:51:47,982
There are sides to it!

799
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:49,277
No?

800
00:51:51,288 --> 00:51:52,735
Goodness me

801
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,241
F... Forget it

802
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:04,061
You're not the only law firm available

803
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:06,568
I quit
I'm not entrusting this case to you

804
00:52:09,364 --> 00:52:10,474
Gosh, this tastes disgusting!

805
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:12,633
Okay, I understand

806
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,118
I'm so sorry to hear that

807
00:52:14,517 --> 00:52:17,050
I really want to help you

808
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:18,102
but I guess there's nothing
I can do about it!

809
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:21,298
If you don't mean it, don't say it

810
00:52:26,364 --> 00:52:27,540
That, that...

811
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,818
What a temper

812
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,429
<i>So I'm</i>

813
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:49,865
<i>Guilty of registering my marriage
58 days ahead of my wedding</i>

814
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:52,972
<i>And therefore, legally divorced</i>

815
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:56,454
<i>And socially ambiguously back
on the market as a single woman</i>

816
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:08,876
(Interest Payment Guide)

817
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:11,819
(KG Savings Bank interest
loans due for payment: $2,580)

818
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:15,510
(Ms. Ji, your interest on $5,000,000
in financial loans is 4.28%...)

819
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:43,247
What a relief the screen is intact

820
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:44,510
I don't even have money

821
00:53:46,615 --> 00:53:49,480
<i>But if I must find one
good thing about this</i>

822
00:53:50,949 --> 00:53:52,869
<i>I've grown up a little</i>

823
00:53:55,422 --> 00:53:57,292
<i>No one can substitute for me</i>

824
00:53:58,089 --> 00:53:59,376
<i>I must be responsible</i>

825
00:54:01,397 --> 00:54:02,793
<i>For what I've done</i>

826
00:54:12,703 --> 00:54:16,188
He's a nasty person,
so I'll teach him a lesson

827
00:54:17,538 --> 00:54:19,743
How amazing

828
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,858
It's you, isn't it?

829
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:28,556
Jay, auntie needs to poo-poo

830
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:30,085
Can you play alone for a minute?

831
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,446
Goodness me

832
00:54:44,603 --> 00:54:45,721
It's not me

833
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:50,163
What is this sound?

834
00:54:56,773 --> 00:54:58,554
Have they seriously gone nuts?

835
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,320
Just who on earth is doing this
at this hour...

836
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:10,974
No, no, no, no!

837
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:12,415
Oh, wait, wait

838
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,590
When am I going to clean this up?

839
00:55:17,676 --> 00:55:19,106
Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!

840
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:19,764
No, no!

841
00:55:21,024 --> 00:55:22,837
Yeah, you're busted today

842
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:23,541
Where are you going?

843
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:25,044
To the nuisance upstairs!

844
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:27,404
We've had enough in the morning!
They're really asking for it!

845
00:55:46,948 --> 00:55:48,046
Excuse me!

846
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:50,673
I'm from unit 1604 downstairs

847
00:55:50,678 --> 00:55:52,195
Can you come out for a second?

848
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:56,537
Excuse me?

849
00:55:59,118 --> 00:56:02,108
I mean, our toilet right now...

850
00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:17,511
It's you, right?

851
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:19,971
Song-yi!

852
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,269
- It's me
- <i>Tell me I'm dreaming</i>

853
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,599
<i>It's Jin-ho, the rock</i>

854
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,329
<i>The person I shared
my dark history with at 21</i>

855
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,737
<i>My ex-boyfriend</i>

856
00:56:33,344 --> 00:56:34,479
Song-yi

857
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,670
<i>From an ex-best friend
to an ex-boyfriend</i>

858
00:57:01,506 --> 00:57:04,534
<i>(Why are they all in Cheonpo?)</i>

859
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,693
(Sorry Not Sorry)

860
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:39,192
{\an8}<i>Wait, how did Seok-jun marry
such a beautiful woman?</i>

861
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:40,909
{\an8}This is my mommy

862
00:57:40,914 --> 00:57:42,710
{\an8}<i>Just why on earth is he doing that?</i>

863
00:57:42,715 --> 00:57:43,613
{\an8}Please!

864
00:57:43,618 --> 00:57:44,967
{\an8}<i>I said stop parking your
baby car in the public space</i>

865
00:57:44,991 --> 00:57:45,710
{\an8}Even his handwriting is edgy

866
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:47,619
{\an8}<i>I ought to move out quickly or something</i>

867
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:49,657
{\an8}Hey, but why are you avoiding me?

868
00:57:49,662 --> 00:57:51,369
{\an8}Why do you always talk like that?

869
00:57:51,374 --> 00:57:54,203
{\an8}Why do you always pretend you care
and make me unfortunate?

870
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:56,830
{\an8}Last time, she didn't talk about herself
at all

871
00:57:56,835 --> 00:57:57,709
{\an8}Is she hiding something?

872
00:57:57,714 --> 00:57:58,711
{\an8}Hello

873
00:57:58,716 --> 00:58:02,826
{\an8}I was wondering if we could
meet up separately
