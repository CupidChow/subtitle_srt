1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:05,956
(Sorry Not Sorry)

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,541
(The characters, locations,
organizations, businesses, events, groups,

3
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:07,125
settings, and procedures are all
unrelated to actual persons or events.)

4
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:07,519
(Filming with child actors
took place under the

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:07,975
supervision of guardians
and in a safe environment.)

6
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:11,443
Hey, wait

7
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,103
Come upstairs after five minutes

8
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:14,456
Why?

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,698
I want to hurry inside and kiss you

10
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:20,327
My wife has been on the lookout these days

11
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:22,496
And being careful won't do any harm

12
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,873
Is it me or her?

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,417
Of course, it's you, honey

14
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:29,262
Come on!

15
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:32,381
This is why I'm crazy about you

16
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:47,104
My goodness, you've found
one decent place, haven't you?

17
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:49,731
I'm in front of the motel
What's your room number?

18
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:51,316
Okay

19
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,824
Hey!

20
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:23,557
Hey!

21
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:27,177
Let go! Let go of me!

22
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:28,572
You let go first!

23
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:31,056
What are you doing? Let go of each other!

24
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,617
Oh, let go of each other!

25
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:35,853
Let go on the count of three, okay?

26
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:37,988
Okay
One, two, three!

27
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:40,482
Oh, come on! I knew this!

28
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:41,984
Why aren't you letting go of me?

29
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:44,119
Then, why didn't you let go of me?

30
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:45,787
Let go, let go, let go, let go

31
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:51,043
Both of you, please let go!

32
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:58,226
How can you be so shameless
when you've had an affair?

33
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,879
Hey, if you had apologized on your knees,

34
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,089
I wouldn't have come this far

35
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:05,174
Wait

36
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:06,175
Excuse me! Excuse...

37
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:07,551
Wait, an affair?

38
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:09,394
Says who?

39
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:14,892
Then, you must've come to this motel to
hold hands with my husband to bed!

40
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:16,735
I see!

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,990
What?

42
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:24,243
That was the one?

43
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:25,420
Hey!

44
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:28,580
Why are you wearing my necklace?

45
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,126
You, come over here!

46
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,453
Umm...

47
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:39,508
My client must've been mistaken because she
saw you coming with her husband

48
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,469
How can she be mistaken for such a thing?

49
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:44,304
Darn it!

50
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:49,476
Wait, so her husband had an affair, right?

51
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:50,862
Yes

52
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:52,554
My client is incredibly hot-tempered...

53
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:54,574
Hey! Hey, what do you think you're doing?
Hey!

54
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:56,483
Where are you going?

55
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:02,239
Please talk it through!

56
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,244
Excuse me!

57
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:12,791
Wait

58
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:20,040
Oh, honey
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,676
Does it hurt?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

60
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:27,840
(S)

61
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:42,455
Honey, I'll try to find a way

62
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,439
Hang in there a minute

63
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,624
Okay, hurry

64
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:45,699
Okay

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,454
I'm going to sue you for assault!

66
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,457
Do you see my face?

67
00:03:53,657 --> 00:03:55,927
Fine! Go and sue me

68
00:03:55,951 --> 00:04:01,182
Then let's break even with my settlement
and your alimony for having an affair

69
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:05,103
Ma'am, you promised me
that you'd control your temper

70
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,253
Being angry doesn't solve anything

71
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:09,014
You can win this fight
only if you hold yourself back

72
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:17,598
If I hold myself back now, I'd be too
upset and won't even be able to go to sleep

73
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:20,893
How can your husband possibly live with you
when you have such a terrible temper?

74
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,620
What did you just say?

75
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,529
Please keep it down

76
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:27,407
But where on earth is your husband?

77
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,461
(Missed Call: Trash)
Oh, right

78
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,380
Jin-ho

79
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:52,057
What should I do?

80
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:05,312
Did he abandon his faithful wife
and have an affair?

81
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:08,657
No, that woman in a fancy outfit
is his wife

82
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:10,567
And that's the woman he had an affair with

83
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,653
Oh, my goodness

84
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:15,322
This is why I quit watching TV

85
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:16,873
Seriously...

86
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,284
Excuse me...

87
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,294
- My goodness
- Whoa

88
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:27,217
Do you have a hammer or something sharp?

89
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,240
Police officer! Look over here!

90
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:42,099
There's a strange man over here!

91
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,316
Pardon?

92
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:46,228
Are you talking about me?
I'm not a strange man!

93
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:47,688
Police officer! Police officer!

94
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:49,439
Hey, it's a total mess here

95
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,108
There's a pervert and...

96
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:52,901
- You should come and see this
- I'm not a pervert!

97
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:54,828
Hey, come and watch this

98
00:05:58,323 --> 00:05:59,458
Darling?

99
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:01,251
Darling, are you back?

100
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:10,127
Wait, it's not like what you think

101
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:11,771
Yeah, right!

102
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:14,890
What kind of person goes around
dressed like this?

103
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:18,218
Sir, I'm sorry, but can you answer

104
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:21,229
a few questions
so that I can confirm your identity?

105
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:26,443
That'll be a little difficult
for me to answer right now

106
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:29,821
By any chance...

107
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:33,283
Can I borrow your handcuff keys?

108
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:36,786
Are keys for handcuffs all compatible?

109
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:38,631
Handcuffs?

110
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:39,915
Yes, yes, yes

111
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,180
Never mind...

112
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:56,890
Umm...

113
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:59,434
I'm an innocent citizen

114
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:03,647
I'm really sorry, but may I go?

115
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,327
Please?

116
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,397
[Sorry Not Sorry]

117
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:52,070
Hello

118
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:53,863
Yes

119
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:55,208
What do you want?

120
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:56,366
Pardon?

121
00:07:58,151 --> 00:07:59,444
Oh, I was just...

122
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:02,080
I was on my way to work

123
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,125
Okay

124
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:37,073
What is it? If you have something
to say, go ahead and say it

125
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,494
Umm...

126
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:42,696
What is it?

127
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:43,747
Huh?

128
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:50,045
My client says she's really sorry

129
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,422
and I apologize on her behalf

130
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:57,010
Of course, you're an attorney, so you're
really good at talking on someone's behalf

131
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:03,026
I also apologize

132
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,019
I didn't mean to grab you by your hair

133
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:10,690
No, it's okay

134
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:18,732
Is that it?

135
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:19,908
Pardon?

136
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,879
If you've taken something from me,
you should give something back

137
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:24,071
You haven't given me anything, though

138
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:25,572
An apology

139
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:27,999
I apologized to you
What about you?

140
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,002
Wait, are you telling me to apologize?

141
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:33,306
Strictly speaking,
it isn't my fault, is it?

142
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,040
I have no reason to apologize to you

143
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,393
Yes, that's right, yes

144
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,260
It isn't your fault, I guess

145
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,774
You shouldn't fight

146
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,591
Are you fighting?

147
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:45,975
No, right?

148
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:49,513
No, no
Why would we fight?

149
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:52,033
It's just a conversation between grownups

150
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:53,400
Right?

151
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:56,361
Yes

152
00:09:57,187 --> 00:09:58,188
That's right

153
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:03,868
I'm on good terms with this auntie

154
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,872
Who are you calling "auntie"?

155
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,500
Then, what should I call you?

156
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:12,919
You said he isn't your child

157
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,551
Let's go

158
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:29,018
Have a great day

159
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:30,804
Oh, okay

160
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,272
Goodbye

161
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,785
Song, let's go

162
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:36,860
Okay

163
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,535
I forgot to bring my bag

164
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,580
It's all because she rushed outside

165
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,503
Man, it went up...

166
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:03,128
- Father's Day?
- Yes

167
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:04,846
Oh, where dads show up?

168
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:10,101
It's just an annual P.E. class where dads
come to watch

169
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,645
It's like a mini sports day

170
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:17,650
My husband owned everyone last year

171
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,903
Oh, I see

172
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,498
Jay is really looking forward to it

173
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:23,815
Rather than having no one there,

174
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:26,493
it'll be better for my boss
to be there for him, right?

175
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:28,870
What did Eun-gyu say?

176
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,614
Eun-gyu...

177
00:11:30,614 --> 00:11:33,082
What? Father's Day?

178
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:35,376
You'll wake Jay up
Be quiet

179
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:39,297
Wait, why do people take this for granted?

180
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:41,082
A child might not have a father

181
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:44,761
And a mother could be divorced like you
In this era...

182
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:48,014
But wouldn't it be a little tough for him
not to have a dad there?

183
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,809
That's true

184
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:55,688
A Father's Day without a father
is like a cake without icing

185
00:11:56,223 --> 00:12:00,568
I can't stand it if Jay feels
discouraged by such things

186
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:05,156
What if...

187
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:09,953
I dress up as a man?

188
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:12,997
Come on!

189
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:17,001
Speaking of which,

190
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:19,096
my boss, the cafe owner,

191
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,965
says he'll go there as Jay's dad
What do you think?

192
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,186
He's playing the role of Jay's dad

193
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,138
Even if he's a substitute,
I can't accept anybody

194
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,145
Is it the guy you had
dinner with last time?

195
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:39,023
Let me see his picture

196
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:44,863
Not sure if I have one

197
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:55,456
What?

198
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:58,626
It'll be kind of weird, right?

199
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,880
Wait, this makes it a different story

200
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,518
He's fine

201
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:08,253
He looks athletic

202
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:10,940
If he's in, he might as well
come in first place

203
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:13,308
Okay, I give him a pass!

204
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,893
Really?

205
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:23,101
Hey, but that boss of yours is funny

206
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:25,454
I mean, who does he think he is
to play the role of Jay's father?

207
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:26,688
I don't know

208
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:29,699
I have no idea what he has in mind

209
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:36,080
Don't tell me...

210
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:40,293
Do you think he has a crush on me?

211
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:43,796
Oh, seriously...

212
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:45,965
You're laughing so hard

213
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:49,844
How old was he?

214
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,305
Twenty-eight

215
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:55,026
But he's really weird

216
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,561
He smiles at me and asks me out for a meal

217
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:02,148
Some people are just all smiles

218
00:14:02,182 --> 00:14:05,068
And he must've been hungry
because it was time to eat

219
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,355
But it was clearly at a date spot

220
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:10,940
It was a place where everyone else
would come on a blind date

221
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,209
except for us

222
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,868
Yes, well...

223
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:15,945
Fine, let's say that
he has feelings for you

224
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,381
What are you going to do about it?

225
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:18,748
Are you going to marry him?

226
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:20,926
What?

227
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,543
Or are you just going to date him?

228
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,588
If he's twenty-eight, he must've
finished his military duties already

229
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:28,517
Does he own the store?
Or is it on rent?

230
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,760
What about his house?
Does he live in Cheonpo?

231
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,096
You're getting ahead of yourself again...

232
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:35,974
Why don't you just ask me to issue
his family certificate?

233
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:38,267
No, it's just that...

234
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:43,439
I'm saying this because I'm worried
you'll get hurt again

235
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:46,935
I mean, if you're seriously considering
dating someone,

236
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:50,655
you should think about your future
and worry about everything else

237
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:53,157
We've grown past the age
of just being in love

238
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,119
Age doesn't matter when you're in love

239
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:59,372
Of course, it does

240
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,791
We're past the age of just being in love

241
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:04,595
You should seriously wake up, okay?

242
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,964
You can't still be a hopeless romantic

243
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,928
(Boss: It's my first time dressing up
in a father's style...)

244
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,646
(Which one do you think is better?)

245
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,190
(Number one, a typical dad)

246
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:28,143
(Number two, a hipster dad)

247
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:29,328
What?

248
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:33,364
- He gets cuter the more I see him
- (Number three, a dad on a roll)

249
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,741
Why are you smiling like that?

250
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:37,869
You're acting suspicious

251
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:39,662
It's nothing

252
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:43,249
I was getting ready for tomorrow
because I have a feeling it'll be fun

253
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,626
I guess I'm all set, right?

254
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,413
It'll take about three hours from morning

255
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:50,339
So, I'll just need to bring stuff like
gummies, right?

256
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:51,924
I want to go, too

257
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,877
Oh, I want to go, too

258
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:55,813
Take me with you

259
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:57,930
I want to go

260
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:10,286
Mark, good job

261
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,904
He doesn't need a chair
because he's so tall

262
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:16,074
Ma'am, will this be okay?

263
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:18,367
Very good!

264
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,365
Nice, nice, this is great

265
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:26,209
Perfect!

266
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,831
- Louis' mother, welcome
- Hello

267
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:33,750
- Hello, Louis
- Hello

268
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,436
Okay, please go this way, Louis

269
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,386
And please come this way

270
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:41,966
Oh, my!
Shannon's mother, hello

271
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,102
Hello

272
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:47,897
Shannon, your grandfather is here today

273
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,432
You must be so happy

274
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:52,401
Ma'am, I'm Shannon's dad

275
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,281
D, daddy...

276
00:16:58,024 --> 00:16:59,575
I'm sorry

277
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:01,921
I'm so sorry

278
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:04,247
Shannon, come this way

279
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,760
Shannon, see you later
I love you!

280
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:09,377
Let's go, let's go

281
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:12,932
Ethan's mother, welcome

282
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:13,599
Hello

283
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:15,041
Hi, Ethan

284
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,835
Welcome, please come this way

285
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,553
Over here

286
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,774
Your lips look dead

287
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:23,224
And they're chapped!

288
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:25,152
Guys don't need that...

289
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,602
Let's hurry and go

290
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,870
Ethan's mom, how do you have
such a great complexion?

291
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:36,445
Come on!

292
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,308
Oh, my!

293
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,365
Excuse me!

294
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,274
What brings you here?

295
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,726
Come on

296
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,996
There you go again

297
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,779
I'm the twin's father

298
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:20,273
The twins?

299
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:21,524
- Dad!
- Daddy!

300
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:24,193
Oh, my sweet babies

301
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:25,194
Twins...

302
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:27,747
I guess you didn't recognize me
because I gained weight

303
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:29,466
I guess so

304
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,802
Hello
I'm not too late, am I?

305
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:35,004
No, ma'am
Please come inside

306
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,789
Honey, isn't it heavy?

307
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:37,957
It's okay

308
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:40,509
Kids, let's go see your friends

309
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,939
Your dad has grown very big

310
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:45,681
Hello

311
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,228
I bought some bagels
You should all have some

312
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:52,480
Their bagels are really good

313
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:57,036
This is our regular restaurant,
but people line up for these now

314
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,480
Isn't this Gangnam Bagel that's
really famous on social media?

315
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,773
Yes, that's right

316
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,284
I got them in a hurry after work
because the line was short

317
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,371
You know what it is

318
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,040
I must be a TSG, indeed

319
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,541
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

320
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,211
TSG

321
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:18,714
Trend-sensitive guy

322
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,597
T, what?

323
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:29,225
I don't know
Just eat this

324
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:31,445
Come on, I don't eat such things

325
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,813
They live in the leading apartment

326
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:38,025
He's the father of the twins
and is expecting their third child

327
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,486
They must be wealthy

328
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,781
They were wearing expensive clothes, too

329
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,567
Oh? This is really good!

330
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,952
- Is it good?
- Try it

331
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:49,912
- It's good, it's good
- It's good, right?

332
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,914
So-so

333
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:54,667
Aren't there good enough places
in Cheonpo as well?

334
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:56,919
This seems to be overrated

335
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,162
You're right

336
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,581
Have you been to the bakery
on the first floor of Lepol Mall?

337
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:01,457
Yes

338
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:04,176
I think that suits my palate better

339
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:06,512
You should be grateful

340
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:09,307
She's working perfectly fine,
even if she's pregnant

341
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,269
All you do is spend what I earn

342
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,910
It's good, isn't it?

343
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:21,495
Oh, it's good

344
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,280
Bagels are just bagels

345
00:20:29,777 --> 00:20:34,165
But they're always sold out
when I go there after work

346
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:47,345
Will you be able to do it by 11 o'clock?

347
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:51,758
I heard the twin's father
is the CEO of some company

348
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:53,392
Is it true?

349
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,738
My husband said

350
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:58,056
he's the CEO of some kind of corn company

351
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,558
Oh, unicorn, unicorn

352
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,360
That's right
Unicorn, a unicorn

353
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:05,914
Despite his looks,

354
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:08,616
he must earn a fortune

355
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,003
A unicorn, as if

356
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:13,871
I'd be more convinced to be told
that he runs a private loan business

357
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:18,751
Is it possible?

358
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:24,874
Then, fifteen Cute Teddy Corn Dogs and
Unstoppable Octopus Sotteok each

359
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:29,178
They're children's snacks,
so please deliver them safely

360
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:30,805
Yes

361
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,140
Okay

362
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:34,934
Oh, Jay's mom!

363
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,445
Is Jay's mom not here yet?

364
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,470
You're right

365
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,199
Will we be able to see her husband today?

366
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:41,816
You're right, you're right

367
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,459
Good morning

368
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:09,836
Hello

369
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:10,795
Hi, Jay

370
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,972
Hello
Let's go

371
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:14,265
See you later

372
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:16,860
Jay's mom, Jay's mom

373
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:20,114
He's the part-timer at your cafe

374
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,481
Yes, I'm here to part-time today

375
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:28,831
Jay's dad seems to be highly
uninterested in his child's education

376
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:33,159
He should've afforded time
on a day like this, like the other dads

377
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:36,579
What did you say your husband did?

378
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:40,708
Just how preoccupied is he...

379
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:44,721
Ethan's mom, I guess you didn't know

380
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:48,716
Jay's dad is working in New York

381
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:53,679
I heard he's the head of some securities
company's New York branch

382
00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:55,631
Oh, is that so?

383
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:59,018
I think I've heard of it
That must've been true

384
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:02,680
How much is the private equity fund
he runs in New York?

385
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,690
Did you say it was hundreds of billions?

386
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:07,035
Hundreds of billions?

387
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:09,612
He's an Ivy League graduate

388
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:11,947
Oh, my goodness

389
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,068
You must have many good sources

390
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:19,131
We should get together
when he comes to Korea someday

391
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,258
Yes, yes, we should

392
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:26,545
And he's drop-dead gorgeous

393
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:28,915
Oh! Uh...

394
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:32,352
That's right
He's got broad shoulders

395
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,929
And he's really tall

396
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:39,099
He has the aura of an actor

397
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:40,944
Really?

398
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:45,105
No wonder Jay is so good-looking

399
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,611
You should know when to stop!

400
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:00,371
What are you both doing?

401
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:03,950
And you know I'm trying to clarify
myself to the mothers...

402
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,286
Wait, it's not a total lie

403
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,097
It's not groundless

404
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:11,332
Eun-gyu graduated from
an Ivy League college

405
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,477
She works in the financial sector
and makes a fortune

406
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:15,854
They all make sense

407
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:17,596
That's ridiculous

408
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,766
And why are you playing along with her?

409
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:24,395
I mean, this lady was hinting at me

410
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:26,397
Lady?

411
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:33,938
Oh, I'm sorry

412
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,906
I must've lost it for a second

413
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,879
But Ethan's mom, who always slurs
her pronunciation and behaves obnoxiously,

414
00:24:40,903 --> 00:24:42,580
can't say anything to you

415
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:48,752
It felt so good to see her
struggle in front of you

416
00:24:57,211 --> 00:24:58,637
Let's go

417
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:06,729
Rock, paper, scissors!
Rock, paper, scissors!

418
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:09,398
Just trust me

419
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,986
Jay, look at me

420
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:22,786
Your mom will nag if your face goes dry

421
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:29,668
There we go

422
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:36,810
Okay, everyone
We'll play the ball-passing game now

423
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,011
Everyone, please come forth

424
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,611
Everyone, we're going to have a
ball-passing game with our parents

425
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,148
Red team, ready?

426
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:00,316
- Yes!
- Yes!

427
00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:01,275
Blue team, ready?

428
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:03,337
- Yes!
- Yes!

429
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,838
On your marks,

430
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,288
get set...

431
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:27,385
This is a game where we must toss
this ball to that side

432
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,236
Quickly

433
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,222
This is Sia's
It's cute

434
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,640
I'm not going to throw it

435
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,225
No, come on...

436
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:35,559
We'll only win if we throw this...

437
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:37,277
Oh, I don't want to!

438
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,322
Then, we'll lose

439
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,043
Ethan, you can't kick it
You can't kick it

440
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,410
Use your hands, use your hands

441
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:08,434
Wow, that's so cool!

442
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:20,738
(What?)

443
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:22,364
(Why is he doing his best?)

444
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,456
Hurry!

445
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,383
Sia

446
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,355
Wow, you're so cool!

447
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:02,362
What about Daddy? Huh?

448
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:03,989
Sia

449
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:05,616
What about Daddy?

450
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,831
Watch out, Song-yi!

451
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,417
Are you okay?

452
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:25,385
You almost got hit

453
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,892
Make sure not to hit anyone

454
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:45,489
And the game ends in three, two, one!

455
00:28:49,276 --> 00:28:51,203
And blue team wins!

456
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:56,500
Song-yi! Song-yi!

457
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:04,842
Well done, well done

458
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:09,847
We lost because of you, Daddy!

459
00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:13,934
I'll win the n, next one...

460
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:19,682
Now, it is time for the amazing dad's race

461
00:29:19,682 --> 00:29:20,899
Please come forward

462
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,037
I'm still hungover from last night

463
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:35,549
Just take it easy

464
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,584
It's not like there's a prize at stake

465
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:41,086
We should warm up first

466
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:48,635
Ji-hyeok, you look so motivated

467
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:51,505
I was a former athlete,

468
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:53,507
so it'll hurt my pride if I lose

469
00:29:53,507 --> 00:29:56,236
A former athlete? In which sport?

470
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,645
This and that until high school

471
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:00,574
Former athlete, you wish

472
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,976
Are you talking about when you were on
"Fly Shoot Dori"

473
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,569
for a split second?

474
00:30:05,644 --> 00:30:08,322
Kang-in is a junior colleague

475
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:13,869
But then, people with a build like you
are likely to have worked out before

476
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:18,957
Oh, if you mention that,
I have no choice but to win

477
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:22,178
Why are you all trying so hard?
Let's just take it easy

478
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:24,504
Why? I'm having so much fun

479
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:29,043
Since our dads are big and powerful,

480
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:30,878
we're going to have a gorilla race

481
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:33,555
Please cheer them on
so they can do their best

482
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:35,883
- Daddy!
- Honey!

483
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:37,885
Honey! Take it easy!

484
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:40,812
Don't be hard on your joints! Okay?

485
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:42,973
Fighting, Daddy!

486
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,535
You must win, no matter what!

487
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:49,947
Yes, Shannon!
I'll cheer up!

488
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:53,450
Daddy!

489
00:30:55,736 --> 00:30:59,373
Mom, Dad's gaze is a little weird

490
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:03,835
Fighting!

491
00:31:09,124 --> 00:31:10,584
Take it easy!

492
00:31:10,584 --> 00:31:11,677
Fighting!

493
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:22,270
Ready

494
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:23,313
Set

495
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:02,344
You're one foul player

496
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:05,031
You're the one who threw
fair play down the ditch first!

497
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,181
What? Ditch? Ditch?

498
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:07,659
- Oh, my goodness
- What did you say?

499
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:09,369
Oh, my goodness

500
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:10,561
Honey!

501
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,904
Honey, are you okay?

502
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:16,283
Oh, my goodness!
Honey, honey! Are you okay?

503
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:18,952
Wait, who plays games like this?

504
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:23,550
I saw everything, and Ethan's dad
made my husband trip first

505
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:27,262
Your husband tripped because he kept
shoving my husband with his big body!

506
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:28,962
Oh, my...

507
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:31,582
Excuse...

508
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,126
The children are watching,
so please refrain from...

509
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:36,980
Wait, but then why is this...

510
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:38,839
Wait, why are you taking it out
on my husband?

511
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:41,609
It's because he has such
an excellent physique

512
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:44,344
And Ethan's dad cheated first

513
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:46,072
And fell for his own tricks!

514
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,398
What?

515
00:32:48,682 --> 00:32:52,152
What did you say to my husband?

516
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:56,573
Ethan's mom, why on earth
are you doing this to me?

517
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,201
What did I do?

518
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:00,577
What did I do?

519
00:33:09,995 --> 00:33:11,463
Honey!

520
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:14,257
- Honey!
- Oh, my goodness

521
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,428
Oh, my god!

522
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:21,389
- Are you okay?
- Oh, no!

523
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:22,966
- Excuse me, excuse me!
- Shannon's dad

524
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:24,027
- 911, 911! Someone dial it, quick!
- Wait, sir!

525
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:25,469
- Oh, my goodness
- Oh, no

526
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:27,229
911, 911!

527
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:32,327
One, two!

528
00:33:32,351 --> 00:33:34,903
I told you to take it easy

529
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:37,707
Shannon, Daddy's okay

530
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:41,326
You're not a daddy, you're a grandpa!

531
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:53,121
Everyone gave it their all today...

532
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:55,715
This has never happened before, but...

533
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,425
Let's see

534
00:33:57,793 --> 00:34:01,505
Currently, Ethan's family and Sia and Teo's
family are tied for first place

535
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:04,925
Since time is almost up,
why don't we wrap up

536
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:07,978
with both of them winning first place?

537
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,189
Let's proceed with the final round

538
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,983
A match is a match

539
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,237
Shall we?

540
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:29,541
Can you do this with your physique?

541
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:33,211
All sports are about mentality, no?

542
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:35,881
Don't try too hard

543
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:39,176
Hamstring injuries last for a long time

544
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,305
I didn't come this far to go easy on you

545
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,438
Are the two of you ready?

546
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:53,940
Ready?

547
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:01,615
Go!

548
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:37,859
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

549
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:41,396
Oh, my! We won!

550
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:44,032
- I won, I won!
- Daddy won!

551
00:35:45,817 --> 00:35:46,735
Don't touch me, don't touch me

552
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:48,787
We won!

553
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,591
Sia and Teo's father wins!

554
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:52,658
Wins!

555
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:55,202
This victory isn't mine alone

556
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:59,756
I'd like to confidently announce that this
is my family's victory!

557
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:11,843
I didn't know a kindergarten sports day
was this fierce...

558
00:36:11,843 --> 00:36:13,395
I know, right?

559
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:17,349
I mean, I also tried my best,

560
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,609
but dads are unbeatable

561
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,916
I'm sorry, Jay
I wanted to win for you

562
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,901
It's okay
I had so much fun today

563
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:28,920
You're the best

564
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:30,453
I'm the best? High-five!

565
00:36:35,283 --> 00:36:36,785
I'll make sure to win next time

566
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:38,086
Okay

567
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,853
Roar! You're a leopard

568
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:59,357
I heard a man shouldn't apply such things

569
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:01,067
Says who?

570
00:37:01,476 --> 00:37:07,399
Sir, these days, you must take care of your
skin regardless of age or gender

571
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:10,076
And Sia would prefer having a boyfriend
with perfect skin

572
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:12,954
This is organic

573
00:37:13,071 --> 00:37:14,414
Yes, it's organic

574
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:16,875
It's for Jay, so I got the one with
great quality

575
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:19,502
And the texture is really smooth

576
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,935
Jay, did you have fun without Mommy today?

577
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:29,337
Yes! Yi-an was so cool today!

578
00:37:29,337 --> 00:37:33,224
He jumped really well,
and he was super strong, too!

579
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,902
- Jay
- Yes?

580
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:37,145
Do you want Yi-an to be our family?

581
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,689
What are you on about?

582
00:37:42,017 --> 00:37:43,151
No

583
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:44,328
Huh?

584
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:46,863
I like my family as it is right now

585
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:49,608
Mommy, Song, and Jay

586
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:51,493
I'm happy

587
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:57,800
But then,

588
00:37:57,824 --> 00:38:00,919
why do you call your mom "Mommy"
and call me "Song"?

589
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,298
Why are you talking to me casually?
Why? Why?

590
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,182
Did you like that?

591
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,395
You seemed to like it
even more than last time

592
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:22,283
I mean, you seem to be getting
the hang of it

593
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:24,359
You've become more natural than before

594
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:25,777
Oh, is that so?

595
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:29,707
At first, I had a hard time
coming up with the lines

596
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:33,243
But I think I'm doing a better job
as I keep doing it

597
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:37,038
But then, did someone teach you?

598
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:42,794
Huh?

599
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,215
What are you talking about?
Who would teach me?

600
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,969
I mean, it's different from
how we used to do it,

601
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:53,179
so I was curious

602
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:55,807
I studied it

603
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:57,392
I studied by myself

604
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,689
You don't know how much I think of you

605
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,066
Is that so?

606
00:39:05,684 --> 00:39:07,026
Of course

607
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:20,198
(What do you think about when you see)

608
00:39:20,198 --> 00:39:21,958
(the woman your husband is
having an affair with?)

609
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:25,555
What is it?

610
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:26,880
Poop!

611
00:39:26,913 --> 00:39:28,623
Use the other bathroom

612
00:39:28,623 --> 00:39:30,309
I'm having a shower

613
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,802
I'm better focused here

614
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:36,055
Just go

615
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:42,729
(I start to get curious about her)

616
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:46,033
(Am I the weird one?)

617
00:39:46,057 --> 00:39:47,142
(My husband is acting strange these days
So, I secretly checked his cell phone)

618
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,422
(And he had been texting another woman,
who happens to be the neighbor downstairs)

619
00:39:51,771 --> 00:39:54,792
(Comment 1: Why would you let that slide?
You should kill them)

620
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:56,651
(Comment 2: I'd divorce him right away)

621
00:39:56,651 --> 00:40:00,121
(Comment 3: Don't just kill the woman,
but kill your husband first)

622
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:17,972
You saw that day, right?

623
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:21,051
She confronted me about why
I was treating her that way

624
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:24,280
Yes, I was taken aback that day, too

625
00:40:24,304 --> 00:40:28,058
The twin's mom clearly seems
to feel inferior to you

626
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,859
That's what I'm saying

627
00:40:29,893 --> 00:40:32,747
But then, the twin's mom
is close with Jay's mom

628
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:34,624
I heard Jay's mom picks up
Sia and Teo after kindergarten, too

629
00:40:34,648 --> 00:40:35,374
Yes

630
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:37,242
So what if she's close with Jay's mom?

631
00:40:37,317 --> 00:40:39,118
What's so good about Jay's mom?

632
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:47,678
- Hello
- Hello

633
00:40:47,702 --> 00:40:50,056
You must've been having a fun chat

634
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,875
No, we were having a boring chat

635
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:55,669
I'm seeing you often these days

636
00:40:55,669 --> 00:40:56,520
Yes

637
00:40:56,544 --> 00:41:00,181
I'm working shorter hours from today
until I take maternity leave

638
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:04,644
Big companies sure do provide
great benefits for employees

639
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:09,182
Most companies allow you to work
shorter hours these days

640
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:11,276
It's not just the big companies

641
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:15,738
I see

642
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,737
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

643
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:24,423
- See you guys
- Bye-bye

644
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,324
Goodness me
Teo, you're here

645
00:41:26,324 --> 00:41:27,718
See you guys tomorrow!

646
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:29,053
Bye-bye

647
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:30,962
- Bye-bye
- Bye-bye

648
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,141
Mommy,

649
00:41:34,165 --> 00:41:39,146
let's go to the kid's cafe with Sia and Teo

650
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,897
Huh?

651
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,556
Jay says he's coming, too

652
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:47,812
You must be hanging out today
Just the two of you

653
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:54,152
Yes, I'm working shorter hours today,
so we had time...

654
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:57,030
Let's go together

655
00:41:58,523 --> 00:41:59,782
Or maybe not?

656
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:02,243
Will it be a little uncomfortable?

657
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:06,489
No! What's there to be uncomfortable about?

658
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:07,707
Let's go

659
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,683
They even sell draft beer?
This is great

660
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:31,147
For mothers, a glass of beer
at a kid's cafe is a life-saver

661
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:34,392
They don't have something like this
in New York, right?

662
00:42:34,392 --> 00:42:37,487
This is all K-culture

663
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:48,373
Isn't it tough to work?

664
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:49,957
You're pregnant

665
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:51,668
Me?

666
00:42:52,118 --> 00:42:54,212
I'm working because I want to

667
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:56,964
I should work hard when I can

668
00:42:57,123 --> 00:43:00,259
I won't be able to stand doing nothing

669
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,596
Are you sure you weren't gaslighted?

670
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:07,008
I mean, who in the world works
because they want to?

671
00:43:07,008 --> 00:43:08,851
Everyone is working for money

672
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:15,692
The taste of money is sweet

673
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:18,403
I make a lot more than you'd imagine

674
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,956
Mommy!

675
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,418
Ethan!

676
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:37,014
Sia hit me

677
00:43:37,038 --> 00:43:38,464
What?

678
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,479
Sia, did you hit Ethan?

679
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:46,232
No, it wasn't me

680
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:50,059
Oh, my
Look at her lying with her eyes wide open

681
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,645
Then, are you saying that my son
is making this up?

682
00:43:53,138 --> 00:43:56,349
Sia, you really didn't hit him, right?

683
00:43:56,349 --> 00:43:58,810
Ethan hit me first

684
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,896
Hey, you're so shameless!

685
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:03,823
Excuse me, Ethan's mom

686
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:07,160
This happened between the kids,
so you shouldn't yell like that

687
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:10,204
And Sia says she didn't do it

688
00:44:11,364 --> 00:44:13,499
Didn't you see her use violence first?

689
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,753
And Jay's mom, mind your own business

690
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:20,173
Even if you're friends, this isn't
something to take sides

691
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:25,261
I guess violence runs in the family

692
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,512
What?

693
00:44:26,921 --> 00:44:28,631
What did you just say?

694
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:30,391
Did I say something wrong?

695
00:44:31,092 --> 00:44:36,564
I knew I should've drawn the line between
this family since sports day

696
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:39,076
Sia said she didn't do it

697
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,527
Who knows if she's lying?

698
00:44:42,395 --> 00:44:43,905
Oh, my

699
00:44:44,063 --> 00:44:46,240
Oh, you're one scary person

700
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,244
Are you saying that our Sia lied?

701
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:53,716
Excuse me, you're crossing the line

702
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,082
Ladies,

703
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:57,511
am I crossing the line? Huh?

704
00:44:57,535 --> 00:44:59,962
Isn't this an understandable situation?

705
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:03,374
- It's tricky
- It is kind of tricky

706
00:45:03,374 --> 00:45:05,259
Tr, tricky

707
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:07,136
Ethan's mom

708
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:10,598
And just how old are you?

709
00:45:10,798 --> 00:45:11,799
What?

710
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:16,137
I've been wondering how old you are

711
00:45:16,137 --> 00:45:19,982
We look about the same age, but why am I
the only one talking politely all the time?

712
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:22,652
Yeah!

713
00:45:22,977 --> 00:45:24,729
You were always so rude to Hana

714
00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:26,040
Yeah!

715
00:45:26,064 --> 00:45:28,417
If you can't stand it,
you should do the same

716
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:29,867
Then it'll be sorted

717
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:31,945
Go ahead, why don't you?

718
00:45:31,945 --> 00:45:34,622
Do you think I can't?

719
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:39,502
Everyone!

720
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:43,422
The pottery teacher?

721
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,644
Chan-yang?

722
00:45:46,668 --> 00:45:48,386
How did you get up there?

723
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:52,348
Do you need a VAR?

724
00:46:00,848 --> 00:46:04,060
But what were you trying to film?

725
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,395
Oh, it's not like that

726
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:09,740
I'm filming a Vlog these days,
and this was recorded

727
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:11,359
Oh, this part

728
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,444
- Give it to me
- No

729
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:15,872
- Give it!
- Oh, I said no!

730
00:46:19,325 --> 00:46:20,543
See?

731
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:22,503
Ethan hit her first

732
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,093
Wait

733
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,346
What are you doing?

734
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,892
Apologize

735
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:38,019
What?

736
00:46:38,511 --> 00:46:42,056
You said we were violent and insulted us
just because of a children's fight

737
00:46:42,056 --> 00:46:45,026
and blamed Sia for everything

738
00:46:48,688 --> 00:46:49,906
Ethan!

739
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:52,084
Why did you do such a thing?

740
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:53,743
Be honest with Mommy

741
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:59,206
I was trying to give the yellow ball to Sia

742
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:01,375
What?

743
00:47:01,743 --> 00:47:05,848
I wanted to play ball with Sia

744
00:47:05,872 --> 00:47:11,010
I wanted to play with the yellow ball
instead of the ball she had

745
00:47:11,169 --> 00:47:16,140
But Sia wouldn't let go
and tried to give it to Jay

746
00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:20,227
It's okay

747
00:47:23,348 --> 00:47:25,816
The kids have such a beautiful heart

748
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:27,568
You kids are good friends

749
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:39,372
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you

750
00:47:40,406 --> 00:47:43,793
My child is in a mess from crying,
so I'll get going first

751
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:48,891
We better leave, too

752
00:47:48,915 --> 00:47:50,726
I have something to do

753
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,968
Ethan's mom,

754
00:47:55,713 --> 00:47:58,015
I'm sorry for raising my voice, too

755
00:48:23,783 --> 00:48:25,751
Don't run, don't run

756
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:32,893
You might end up becoming in-laws
with Ethan's family

757
00:48:32,917 --> 00:48:33,977
Hey!

758
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:36,929
Why would you say such a horrendous thing?

759
00:48:39,674 --> 00:48:43,310
Hey, but then, that woman from earlier...

760
00:48:43,886 --> 00:48:45,438
Who was it?

761
00:48:46,472 --> 00:48:47,640
Oh! She's!

762
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,944
She's the wife of Jin-ho, the rock
The one who runs a pottery workshop

763
00:49:00,862 --> 00:49:02,747
May I join you?

764
00:49:03,197 --> 00:49:04,582
Yes

765
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:09,754
I'm seeing you often these days

766
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,049
Yes

767
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:17,303
The two of your children don't take
classes at my academy, do they?

768
00:49:17,378 --> 00:49:20,765
I run a pottery class for kids
at Cheonpo Mall

769
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:23,801
I'm Chan-yang, Ahn Chan-yang

770
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:26,562
Oh, yes, Chan-yang

771
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,265
Thank you so much for earlier

772
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:33,746
Thanks to you, it was proved
that Sia wasn't wrong

773
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,904
It was nothing

774
00:49:34,979 --> 00:49:37,656
But then, Ethan isn't a bad kid, either

775
00:49:40,234 --> 00:49:43,704
You seem to love children

776
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:45,331
Me?

777
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,833
I don't like children

778
00:49:48,576 --> 00:49:49,835
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

779
00:49:53,581 --> 00:49:55,674
Oh, umm...

780
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:59,929
What were you doing here, Chan-yang?

781
00:50:00,421 --> 00:50:02,431
Oh, umm...

782
00:50:05,426 --> 00:50:07,853
Can I call you by your names?

783
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:10,314
I think I'm younger than both of you

784
00:50:13,726 --> 00:50:15,120
How old are you?

785
00:50:15,144 --> 00:50:16,862
I was born in 1991

786
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,448
- Yes
- Yes

787
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:22,535
Can I ask you something?

788
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,956
And then, I'll tell you

789
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:28,833
- Me?
- Yes

790
00:50:31,577 --> 00:50:33,337
Yes, well...

791
00:50:34,997 --> 00:50:36,298
Song-yi

792
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:40,928
Are you having fun
cheating with my husband?

793
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:00,272
[Sorry Not Sorry]

794
00:51:36,477 --> 00:51:37,704
That's a wrap for today

795
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,498
I'm thinking of going on a trip with Jay

796
00:51:39,522 --> 00:51:40,415
I'm so happy!

797
00:51:40,439 --> 00:51:42,584
If you're here to find a guy again,
you should give up

798
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:44,151
Why are you wearing glasses

799
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:46,213
if you're going to look at everything
from a twisted perspective?

800
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:49,281
- (Escaped after a month and still on the run,)
- Ten million won?

801
00:51:49,281 --> 00:51:51,200
(stirring up controversy)

802
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,428
(Even if it's out of concern,
this would be rude, right?)

803
00:51:53,452 --> 00:51:55,597
But there's an escaped convict
on the run these days!

804
00:51:55,621 --> 00:51:57,498
I like you, Song-yi

805
00:51:57,498 --> 00:51:59,667
Can I have your number?

806
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:01,126
What? Where did she go?

807
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:03,595
Please help me!
