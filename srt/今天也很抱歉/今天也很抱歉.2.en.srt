1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:05,925
(Sorry Not Sorry)

2
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:06,510
(The characters, locations,
organizations, businesses, events, groups,

3
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:07,094
settings, and procedures are all
unrelated to actual persons or events.)

4
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:07,488
(Filming with child actors
took place under the

5
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:07,941
supervision of guardians
and in a safe environment.)

6
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:12,374
[Jin-ho] It's you, right?

7
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:14,276
Song-yi!

8
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:16,979
([Song-yi] Tell me I'm dreaming)

9
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:18,156
[Jin-ho] Song-yi

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,748
([Song-yi] It's Jin-ho, the rock)

11
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:23,185
(The person I shared my dark history
with at 21)

12
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:26,021
(My ex-boyfriend)

13
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:32,094
Honey, who is it?

14
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:33,395
[Jin-ho] I got it!

15
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:36,131
Why is there a fly...

16
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:37,532
Huh?

17
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:39,034
Oh!

18
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:41,737
I mean, when I was in college...

19
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,071
Excuse me!

20
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:49,688
I'm here because I'm furious!

21
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:51,347
Do you know what has happened to my house?

22
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:52,181
Pardon?

23
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:53,649
Wh, what...

24
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:55,451
What happened to your house?

25
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:56,285
The toilet!

26
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:57,419
The t, toilet!

27
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,121
Oh! The foam!

28
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,899
Oh! Goodness me, I'm sorry
We...

29
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:02,534
We were cleaning up...

30
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:03,268
Don't cause any problems, okay?

31
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:05,260
Oh, yes, yes
Of course, of course

32
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:07,229
[Song-yi] I mean it!

33
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:11,867
No!

34
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:12,978
Eat it

35
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:14,269
Good boy

36
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:18,173
I'm so annoyed

37
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,143
What's wrong with her again?

38
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:25,113
I knew you had crazy mood swings,
but after the divorce, it's just...

39
00:01:27,683 --> 00:01:30,218
Korea is so vast

40
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,855
[Eun-gyu] It isn't quite vast

41
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:39,494
I mean, why does everyone come here
after getting married?

42
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:44,132
I mean! Why are they all happy
after getting married?

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,910
Am I the only weird one?

44
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,736
Why do things like this only happen to me?

45
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:49,447
Huh?

46
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:53,284
Everyone else is doing perfectly fine!

47
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:54,452
Get up

48
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:56,512
Jay's going to pick up your craziness

49
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:59,915
That's why I warned you not to marry
a random somebody

50
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,386
I loved him, though

51
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:10,492
Get up

52
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:17,699
This is so annoying

53
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:23,372
[Sorry Not Sorry]

54
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:29,945
What, Song-yi?
Is she ignoring my text?

55
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,890
- She's read it, though
- Hello, Ms. Choi

56
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:33,115
Hi

57
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:38,053
Mr. Yun, why isn't he approving?

58
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:39,464
Is he doing this on purpose?

59
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,633
Why isn't he answering
after reading my message?

60
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:43,735
It's because he's conscious of you

61
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,061
I knew it
He's such a jerk

62
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:48,130
He must've betrayed this country
in his past life

63
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:51,199
We need his approval to work
What are we supposed to do?

64
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,369
Use nice words with the right mind...

65
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,249
There are no medical grounds for
prenatal education

66
00:02:58,273 --> 00:02:59,741
But still

67
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:01,686
Anyway, Mr. Yun...

68
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,078
Please give me a moment

69
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:04,546
Oh, hello

70
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:06,424
Yes

71
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:09,718
I'm on my way to work, but I'm not busy

72
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,052
Yes

73
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,090
Of course, I don't skip meals

74
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:18,260
Yes, fighting to you, too!

75
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,430
Huh?

76
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:24,533
To Kim?

77
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:27,903
They're leaving
it to this stupid and useless person?

78
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:30,081
They're doing this to credit him
for all the work, aren't they?

79
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,206
Ms. Choi...

80
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:31,974
Wait

81
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:33,418
Hello?

82
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:37,155
Aww, my sweet Sia and Teo

83
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:38,423
Did you arrive safely?

84
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,115
Be good to Auntie

85
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:43,294
Yes, enjoy your meal
and brush your teeth, yes

86
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:45,387
Yes, Mommy will go home early today

87
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:46,655
Yes

88
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:50,759
Goodness me, yes
Mommy loves you, too, yes

89
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:58,767
Ms. Choi

90
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:00,802
You're creeping me out

91
00:04:01,336 --> 00:04:02,780
Are you?

92
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:05,974
You should get married and have kids
to find out what happens

93
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:09,377
You must always live life
in the multi-tasking mode

94
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:12,781
Third child...

95
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:16,184
I must be nuts

96
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:19,731
But then, I heard Mr. Yun, that jerk,
left me out and played golf with

97
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:22,691
other team leaders and executives
on the weekend

98
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:24,726
Don't be too angry

99
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,208
That fence-sitter

100
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:31,533
Oh, it's here

101
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:49,951
Jay, we really need to get changed now
and head out

102
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,095
You'll miss the bus

103
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,697
You can't go to kindergarten
dressed like that

104
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,631
[Jay] Why?

105
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:57,125
You're also dressed like this, Song
This looks cool

106
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,827
I like it!

107
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,375
It's my wish
Please make my wish come true

108
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,244
Your friends will make fun of you, Jay

109
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:08,103
Let's get changed into this

110
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:11,840
We're late

111
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:15,611
Okay

112
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,754
Let's go!

113
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:18,280
But then, Song!

114
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:21,383
Then, make my wish come true, too

115
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,584
What is it?

116
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:25,663
Song, you'll be my mommy from now on

117
00:05:25,687 --> 00:05:26,988
Okay?

118
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,028
Huh?

119
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:37,332
What's he saying?

120
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:39,935
Jay!

121
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:41,469
Jay

122
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:45,383
We missed the bus today because of you, Jay

123
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:46,718
So, we need to walk

124
00:05:46,742 --> 00:05:48,510
Sorry!

125
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,913
Oh, right

126
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:55,917
Nah, I won't come across him
at the kindergarten, will I?

127
00:05:58,053 --> 00:05:59,130
Wait, give me a moment

128
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:00,655
Stay here, okay? Just a moment!

129
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:05,460
Okay! Let's go

130
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:14,169
Hello

131
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:16,471
Oh, hello

132
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:24,045
I'm sorry about last night

133
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:26,548
It's okay

134
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:36,157
[Song-yi] Wait, how did that loser...

135
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:41,830
I mean, how in the world did Seok Jin-ho
get married to such beauty?

136
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:50,615
Goodbye

137
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,841
Bye, have a nice trip to the kindergarten
with your mommy

138
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:54,042
[Jay] Okay

139
00:06:58,013 --> 00:06:59,447
Oh, my
Let's get off, let's get off

140
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:04,929
[Teacher] Good morning, guys

141
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:05,930
Hello

142
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:07,989
Hi, good morning

143
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:09,267
Goodbye

144
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,293
Good morning, Jay
Good morning

145
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:13,461
Good morning, I'll get going now...

146
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,130
Good morning, Mark

147
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,698
This is my mommy

148
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:21,069
Hey, buddy, this is my mom

149
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:23,271
Alright, say bye to Mom

150
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:25,474
- [Kids] Bye, Mommy
- No, no

151
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:26,941
[Song-yi] That's not true

152
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:29,120
That's not true, what's wrong with you?

153
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,512
Oh, no

154
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:33,948
No, no

155
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:39,154
[Song-yi] What's gotten into Jay?

156
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:44,125
Wait, but why does everyone think
I'm a mother?

157
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:46,428
Am I at that age?

158
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:49,664
But there's no such thing these days

159
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:55,070
Oh?

160
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:56,504
Over there...

161
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:58,473
Isn't that Jay's mom?

162
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:01,609
You're right

163
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,646
She must be headed somewhere
after sending Jay to kindergarten

164
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,483
My goodness, why is she wearing sunglasses?

165
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:10,452
Does she think she's a Hollywood star
or something?

166
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:13,388
I guess it's because she's a New Yorker

167
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,191
Shall I invite her to have coffee with us?

168
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,860
- Yes, yes, that sounds great!
- Yes, yes, let's do that

169
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:35,944
What are you looking at?

170
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:39,547
It's nothing

171
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:42,960
When I used to work,

172
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:46,554
I was so jealous of people
who were at coffee shops at this hour

173
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:48,423
They looked so laid back

174
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,126
Come on, you wouldn't know that

175
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,905
In reverse, I was jealous of office workers

176
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:57,308
wearing lanyards and buying coffee to go
during lunchtime

177
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:58,800
because I'm unemployed

178
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:01,145
Unemployed? But you have your own cafe

179
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,371
Back then, I was also part-timing

180
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:07,208
And what I wanted to do
didn't quite work out

181
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:14,182
[Ethan's Mom] Oh, my

182
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:16,684
Isn't that Jay's mom over there?

183
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:18,720
- [Shannon's Mom] It is Jay's mom
- [Louis' Mom] You're right!

184
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,555
- [Shannon's Mom] Jay's mom!
- [Ethan's Mom] Oh, my

185
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:22,657
- Talk about coincidence
- [Yi-an] Welcome

186
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:24,726
[Shannon's Mom] Jay's mom

187
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:29,407
Hello

188
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:32,667
Wait, but then, what are you doing here?

189
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:36,338
I'm, uh...

190
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:37,648
Umm...

191
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,340
Err...

192
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:41,176
[Yi-an] Ma'am!

193
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:43,211
Where else should I wipe?

194
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,347
- Ma'am?
- Ma'am?

195
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:48,917
She's my boss

196
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:52,020
B, boss?

197
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:56,801
Were you the owner of this coffee shop?

198
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:58,293
- I didn't know
- [Louis' Mom] We better come often

199
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,629
- [Ethan's Mom] Yeah, we didn't know
- We should become regulars here

200
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,573
[Ethan's Mom] We should, we should

201
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:05,834
[Ethan's Mom] We should chat
It's such a pleasant coincidence

202
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,603
This is nice

203
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,143
[Yi-an] Here are your drinks

204
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:18,613
[Louis' Mom] This cafe
has excellent service

205
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:21,382
I brought them to you because you're
the boss's acquaintances

206
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:24,896
Enjoy

207
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,221
[Louis' Mom] Okay

208
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,170
The part-timer must work out a lot

209
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:35,263
His got great shoulders

210
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:41,746
We couldn't even say hello last time
because it was so hectic after kindergarten

211
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,338
but we meet again

212
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:47,242
I'm Ethan's mom

213
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:49,554
This is Louis' mom

214
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:51,646
And over here is Shannon's mom

215
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,349
Our...

216
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:59,954
Our group is called "Elousha"

217
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:04,235
It's a perfect name

218
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:06,327
- I love it
- We did such a great job

219
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:07,572
I love it

220
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:08,430
We did such a great job

221
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,365
- E, Lou, Sha!
- E, Lou, Sha!

222
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:25,880
Oh, uh... I see

223
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:43,531
We've increased by 2% in the second quarter
compared to last year,

224
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:47,102
and 3.8% in the third quarter

225
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:49,971
However, concerning the current
market conditions and exchange rates,

226
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:54,008
the increment will be noted as 5%
in the press release

227
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:56,487
No

228
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:59,748
What goes on the press release,
in particular, must be strictly factual

229
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:02,350
Don't you know that consumers will feel
more repelled when they find out

230
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,586
what they had clicked on wasn't the news
but a promotion?

231
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:09,757
Don't you have any statistics or
thesis to refer to?

232
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:14,162
Yes, I'll find those
and make the modifications

233
00:12:14,295 --> 00:12:18,066
Once the data is supplemented, revise
and share the press release material, okay?

234
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,200
Yes

235
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,235
Let's at least stick to the basics

236
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:23,237
- Yes, I understand
- Yes, I understand

237
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,724
May I go to the bathroom...

238
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:34,882
Yes

239
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:37,819
Go and pee

240
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:44,459
Let's refresh and get back to it
in half an hour

241
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:46,194
- Yes, okay
- Yes, okay

242
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:56,537
Who is it, seriously?

243
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:00,942
(Shannon's Mom)
(Louis' Mom)

244
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:04,622
They've got so much time, don't they?

245
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:05,947
Time to chat...

246
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:07,958
[Ethan's Mom] We had brunch today

247
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:08,559
What?

248
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,195
[Ethan's Mom] Jay's mom, the owner,
treated us to brunch, awesome!

249
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:13,431
Wait, is Song-yi already in this group?

250
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:15,323
[Ethan's Mom] As conversation lengthen,
our relationship deepen

251
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:16,867
A cafe owner?

252
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:20,328
[Ethan's Mom] The rest of you
should join us next time

253
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:26,201
[Louis' Mom] Do you meet Jay's mom
from time to time?

254
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,679
I bumped into her at a cafe
in our neighborhood today

255
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,506
and I thought it'd be nice for us
to meet up with her, too

256
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,108
[Shannon's Mom] Sweetheart,
are you at work?

257
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,578
When are you free on the weekend?

258
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:39,256
Fancy going to a kid's cafe with our kids?

259
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,919
It'll be nice if your friend, Song-yi,
can also join us

260
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:48,756
Wait, why are they suddenly pretending
to be so close?

261
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:53,528
Song-yi, what are you up to?

262
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,197
You didn't even reply to my messages

263
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:04,005
(Song-yi)

264
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:07,308
([Hana] Did she set up a multi-profile
so I can't see?)

265
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:10,078
Wait, but when did she get married?

266
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:13,815
Go ahead and try with all your might

267
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:16,851
Yet I'll be the first one
to befriend her again

268
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,002
I'm sorry

269
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:27,695
I eventually failed to deal with
the customers on my own

270
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:34,445
It's okay

271
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,637
You actually helped me out

272
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:39,040
Pardon?

273
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:42,710
Then, does Jay not speak English at home?

274
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:44,255
Umm...

275
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,881
He does speak in English at home

276
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:49,226
That's so nice

277
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,030
When you're busy in the future,
I'll take care of Jay for you

278
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:56,834
It'll be nice if the kids hang out
and also study together

279
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:59,136
Can I also send Louis, too?

280
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,529
The English homework is too much
for me to handle

281
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:08,269
Ma'am!

282
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:10,371
Please help me

283
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:13,975
I better get up since we have
so many customers

284
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:16,244
I'll get going now

285
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,915
Then, it's a relief

286
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:27,054
Why can't I do anything right alone?

287
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:31,459
Mr. Kim

288
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:34,495
Why did you do such a thing today?

289
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,740
Pardon?

290
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:40,334
Why did you tell the customers
that I'm the boss?

291
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:42,613
Oh...

292
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:46,040
It didn't mean much

293
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:47,575
Huh?

294
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:51,546
Um... Uh...

295
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,185
I'm aware of your situation
from your job interview

296
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:00,054
I'm sorry for doing things without asking,

297
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:03,724
but I wanted to give you confidence

298
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:05,836
I mean, well...

299
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,807
When I had a hard time, I felt very
discouraged when I bumped into people

300
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:11,766
I felt depressed all day

301
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:16,704
I apologize if I caused trouble

302
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:18,539
Thank you

303
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,386
Oh, right! Umm...

304
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,844
This...

305
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:26,247
This is for the coffee the ladies had

306
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:30,618
They bragged so much about their wealth
yet didn't pay for their coffee

307
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:32,787
It's really okay

308
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:34,789
Please take this

309
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:41,262
Alright

310
00:16:42,196 --> 00:16:45,633
Besides, anyone would think
you're the boss anyway

311
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:47,244
From your charisma

312
00:16:47,268 --> 00:16:48,670
to your coffee-making skills

313
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,548
That's why you should hurry and master
how to brew coffee...

314
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:52,750
Yes, that's right!

315
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:54,151
Since I'm not good enough,

316
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:56,744
there are strange rumors that some wealthy
girl opened the coffee shop for me

317
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:57,955
Seriously...

318
00:16:57,979 --> 00:16:59,213
But it's true

319
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,548
What?

320
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,585
She's not just any girl but my sister!

321
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:05,954
And that's...

322
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:10,658
I've always suffered from strange rumors
because of my looks

323
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:16,364
I see

324
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,969
Anyway, thank you

325
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:28,276
Okay

326
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:31,279
Let me help out

327
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,613
Where should I wipe?

328
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:34,224
Please wipe that area down

329
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:35,449
Okay

330
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:42,857
Oh!

331
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,401
Carrots, carrots!

332
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:45,460
Do we have them?

333
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,236
[Eun-gyu] We don't!

334
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,071
And what else?

335
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:48,029
[Eun-gyu] Oh, rice puffs!

336
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:49,573
Oh, rice puffs? Okay, I'll make it quick

337
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:51,265
- [Eun-gyu] Take your time
- Okay

338
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:55,436
(Warning 2. I said stop parking your baby
car here, it's a violation of the fire law)

339
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:57,271
Come on, not again

340
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:04,488
I can tell by this handwriting that
it's someone super cranky

341
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:06,080
What a personality

342
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:09,417
What? Huh?

343
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:12,186
It doesn't get in the way that much

344
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:15,990
I better move out quickly or something

345
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:33,641
Ugh!

346
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,319
Did she still leave it here
after reading my note?

347
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:50,124
The ladies in this neighborhood are so...

348
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:57,565
No, I better move out quickly
or something...

349
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:20,654
This is over 10,000 won?

350
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,891
The price of vegetables is absurd

351
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:46,747
I'm sorry

352
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:51,685
Oh, Song-yi!

353
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,330
Oh, my
Excuse me

354
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:54,755
Oh, my
I'm sorry

355
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:56,157
Yes, I'm sorry

356
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:06,868
[Promotion Staff] You should try one

357
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:08,602
I'm sorry

358
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:10,871
Song-yi!

359
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:45,506
Man...

360
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,742
I knew I'd come across her again, seriously

361
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:52,146
I think I've gotten everything now

362
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,452
Oh, right! Jay's rice puffs!

363
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:26,981
[Hana] Ji Song-yi!

364
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:29,750
Why are you avoiding me?

365
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,697
Are you okay?

366
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:49,904
What's the matter? Huh?

367
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:53,183
Yeah...

368
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:54,775
Oh, I'm okay, I'm okay

369
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:03,584
But then, why are you avoiding me?

370
00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:07,888
I wasn't avoiding you
I was just in a hurry

371
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:14,929
We need to talk

372
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:39,053
It's been almost ten years, right?

373
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:41,889
How have you been?

374
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:45,259
I was so surprised

375
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:48,696
I didn't even know you were married

376
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:51,966
You should've invited me

377
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,044
Forget it

378
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:55,869
You didn't invite me, either

379
00:22:57,738 --> 00:22:59,607
That's true

380
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:05,980
Are you coming home from work?

381
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:07,915
Yeah

382
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,517
I work

383
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:16,090
I just can't get used to being pregnant,
even if this is my third time

384
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:19,259
Having to commute is really killing me

385
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:24,308
But you're pulling it off because it's you

386
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:26,634
An average person wouldn't even dare
to imagine living like you

387
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:29,704
I knew you'd live an amazing life

388
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:31,271
You're truly amazing

389
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,074
I'm not

390
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:37,411
You and I are just...

391
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:39,413
mothers now

392
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:48,889
- You were in New York...
- You see...

393
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:55,462
You were in New York,
so why did you return to Korea?

394
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,099
It's much better to live there than send
your kid to an English kindergarten here

395
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,002
I would've given it my all to stay there

396
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,515
Wait, have you looked up
schools and everything?

397
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:08,285
Or were there any welfare perks
from your husband's company?

398
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:10,544
You know, things like
international schools and whatnot

399
00:24:20,988 --> 00:24:22,456
I just remembered

400
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:26,026
why I drifted apart from you

401
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:29,063
Huh?

402
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,568
Why do you always talk like that?

403
00:24:36,137 --> 00:24:37,404
What do you mean?

404
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:40,574
You think you're the smartest
and most remarkable, don't you?

405
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:43,711
Why do you always pretend you care
and make me unfortunate?

406
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:45,389
Wait, what do you mean?
I was just saying...

407
00:24:45,413 --> 00:24:48,249
Whether I moved here or not,

408
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:50,827
you could just listen to me
and say, "I see"

409
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:53,721
Who are you to evaluate
if I've done good or bad?

410
00:25:01,028 --> 00:25:04,941
I was happy, aside from your nagging

411
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:07,401
You never once complimented me

412
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:10,180
"You're wrong because of this, and it's
your fault because of that, blah, blah"

413
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:11,372
Of course!

414
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:13,283
It is your fault!

415
00:25:13,307 --> 00:25:15,419
Hey, you should've told me earlier

416
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:18,212
You're the one who ghosted me
without saying anything!

417
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:20,257
Fine, let's be a little honest

418
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:23,451
The men you dated in the past
were all weird, no?

419
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,686
Be it a loser or a piece of trash,
you only brought weird men...

420
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:26,696
So, how could I possibly stay put?

421
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,223
Yeah! That's why I got divorced! Happy?

422
00:25:30,391 --> 00:25:33,227
A wedding invitation?
Hey, I didn't even have a wedding

423
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:35,229
That's why I didn't tell you! So what?

424
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:51,078
[Song-yi] Be it marriage or husband,
I don't know about them,

425
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:54,882
but I thought our friendship would last
forever till we became grandmothers

426
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:58,886
We promised to hang out in a
senior community together

427
00:26:02,223 --> 00:26:06,026
Have all those times passed,

428
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,732
and were we only tied to those times?

429
00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:17,938
Your feet are so swollen

430
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:21,141
- Ugh!
- Why? Did it hurt?

431
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:23,710
I mean, I tried to be gentle

432
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:25,946
That's not it

433
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:29,759
Why is she suddenly taking it out on me?

434
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:31,518
This is ridiculous

435
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:33,563
Who? Who did such a thing?

436
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:35,866
You touched my feet with those hands!

437
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,192
You're not dirty at all

438
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:40,127
You just took a shower

439
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:41,905
I mean

440
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:45,399
It's the friend I mentioned before, Song-yi

441
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,477
That friend?
Yes, I remember

442
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:51,004
I was only trying to get along with her

443
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:53,941
She seems to be on good terms
with the other mothers

444
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:58,622
But you are pretty scary to approach

445
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:01,715
You intimidate people...

446
00:27:03,851 --> 00:27:05,252
However!

447
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:09,857
That's why I do my best in everything

448
00:27:09,924 --> 00:27:12,793
Aren't I lucky much?

449
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:18,866
You're talking like the youngest members
of our team, where did you learn that?

450
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,701
So, what's the plan?

451
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:23,203
Well...

452
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:26,383
I should get off work early this week,

453
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:30,253
and have dinner with her while bringing
the kids back home from kindergarten

454
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:31,946
Even if it means I need to hurt my pride

455
00:27:31,946 --> 00:27:33,356
You said the office is super busy

456
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,515
Can you manage the schedule?

457
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:38,728
Why are you trying so hard
to befriend her again?

458
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:39,887
Honey

459
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:43,123
You're saying that because you don't know
the world of mothers

460
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:45,259
Ethan's mom hates me already

461
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:49,105
And she's trying so hard to flatter
Song-yi, the new face

462
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:50,497
Ugh, seriously

463
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:52,699
And

464
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,701
Geez!

465
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:56,637
What does she take me for?

466
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:58,572
So mean...

467
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:01,809
I mean, are we not close enough

468
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:03,610
for her to tell me such things?

469
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:06,947
It's not easy to raise a kid alone!

470
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:09,082
I'm so upset

471
00:28:11,518 --> 00:28:14,388
Honey, are you crying?

472
00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:16,456
No

473
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,528
Oh, seriously...

474
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:32,072
Jay, hurry and stay put

475
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:33,650
You won't be able to fall asleep
if you keep doing this

476
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:36,910
No, Aunt Song, I don't want to

477
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:40,180
No, no, I can't sleep, Song

478
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,549
I told you I'm not sleepy

479
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:47,321
You!

480
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:49,823
You call me "Song" or "Aunt" at home,

481
00:28:49,823 --> 00:28:52,159
but why do you call me "Mommy" whenever
you go to kindergarten?

482
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,362
Because of you, I'm in a sticky situation!

483
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:57,431
I'm also going to cry!

484
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:26,326
What?

485
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:30,263
I can only go home if Mommy comes

486
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:35,002
I don't want to be the only one
at the school

487
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:37,871
I want to go home

488
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:41,308
But then, Mommy has to work

489
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:44,511
And it's not like I want Mommy to come

490
00:29:44,511 --> 00:29:49,616
Then, you can be my mommy
for a while, Aunt Song

491
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,952
Please?

492
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:58,058
Jay

493
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:03,697
Sia and Teo are
always at the kindergarten,

494
00:30:05,165 --> 00:30:08,769
but they're together,
so they're not the last ones

495
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:13,206
Is that so?

496
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:48,618
Poop! It's poop!

497
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:51,845
Right? Even the color is just like your
poop, Ethan

498
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:53,757
No

499
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:56,183
Yes, you're a pooper, aren't you?

500
00:30:56,183 --> 00:30:57,951
That's why you called it poop
as soon as you saw it

501
00:30:57,951 --> 00:31:00,854
No, it isn't my poop!

502
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:03,457
Ethan, you even farted, didn't you?

503
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:05,235
It's so smelly

504
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:06,860
No

505
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:08,729
I didn't fart

506
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:09,973
You did

507
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:11,508
I didn't

508
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:12,933
Mr. Fart

509
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:13,901
I didn't

510
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:15,335
You did

511
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:17,638
- I didn't
- You did

512
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:20,007
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

513
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:21,584
- How was everything?
- Did you have fun today?

514
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:24,554
Hang out with your friends for a moment
Mommy will have a word with your teacher

515
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:27,180
Oh, yes, go and play
Go and play

516
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:29,959
Ms. Ahn, thank you for your hard work today

517
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:32,586
The kids are so good

518
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,264
Oh, yes

519
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:35,956
Ms. Ahn, by the way...

520
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:40,861
Can we add one more student
to our children's session?

521
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:44,841
But this is a class for a few elites

522
00:31:44,865 --> 00:31:45,809
Who are you planning to add?

523
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,535
Who do you think?
I'm talking about Jay

524
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:51,381
I was just thinking of asking

525
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:55,843
It'll be nice if the kids hang out together
after kindergarten

526
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:57,845
And they'll be exposed to English
even longer

527
00:31:57,845 --> 00:31:59,579
That sounds great

528
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:01,414
Who? Jay?

529
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:03,750
Please give me a moment

530
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:06,319
This mother

531
00:32:07,254 --> 00:32:10,133
[Shannon's Mom] There's a new child
who came from the U.S.

532
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:12,226
Oh...

533
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:14,737
But last time, Jay's mom

534
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:17,564
barely participated in our conversation

535
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:21,535
She doesn't seem to enjoy exchanging
information between mothers

536
00:32:21,535 --> 00:32:25,181
You're right, last time, she didn't talk
about herself at all

537
00:32:25,205 --> 00:32:26,540
Is she hiding something?

538
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:34,424
What are you all going to do about this
tomorrow?

539
00:32:34,448 --> 00:32:35,358
Huh?

540
00:32:35,382 --> 00:32:39,186
The twin's mom suggested going to
a kid's cafe tomorrow

541
00:32:39,186 --> 00:32:41,388
Don't you think Jay's mom will join us?

542
00:32:41,388 --> 00:32:42,823
The two of them are friends

543
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:46,402
The twin's mom always tries to
solve her lack of time

544
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:48,495
with money

545
00:32:48,495 --> 00:32:51,831
It's not like we're incompetent

546
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:55,168
Or we haven't worked before

547
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:33,006
Unit 1604!

548
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:38,778
([Song-yi] I had completely forgotten
about him because of Hana)

549
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:41,681
(Jin-ho, the rock)

550
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:47,120
Don't pretend you know me

551
00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:54,604
Did we, living upstairs,

552
00:33:54,628 --> 00:33:58,198
cause you any further inconveniences?

553
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:00,000
No

554
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,968
Don't worry

555
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:04,437
Do you usually work out here?

556
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:06,473
Oh, I work out

557
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:08,675
I even took body profile pics last year

558
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,787
Wow, that's amazing

559
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:12,178
You don't have to show me

560
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:17,751
Umm, by any chance,

561
00:34:19,486 --> 00:34:21,755
do you have time to spare later?

562
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:26,092
What?

563
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:29,162
30 seconds are up

564
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:32,232
My break is over, so let me do
one more set, just a moment

565
00:34:46,947 --> 00:34:48,882
What's wrong with him?

566
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,351
No way

567
00:34:52,452 --> 00:34:54,587
I've watched too much TV lately

568
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:04,798
Ms. Choi, it's lunchtime...

569
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:05,832
Huh?

570
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:09,636
You'll be skipping lunch, right?
Shall I get you something?

571
00:35:09,636 --> 00:35:10,404
Huh?

572
00:35:10,404 --> 00:35:12,372
It's okay, go and have lunch

573
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:15,651
I'm taking the afternoon off today,
so I can eat later

574
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:17,010
It's okay, it's okay

575
00:35:18,478 --> 00:35:21,782
No matter how busy we are, we're all
working to make ends meet

576
00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:23,650
You should all eat

577
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:26,129
Yes, what did you have for lunch, sir?

578
00:35:26,153 --> 00:35:29,989
We had cod soup to relieve our
hangover from yesterday

579
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:35,671
Ms. Choi, are you the only one
working for this company?

580
00:35:35,695 --> 00:35:37,040
Why are you so busy?

581
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:38,031
The thing is...

582
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:40,166
I'm taking the afternoon off later

583
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:43,903
Didn't you take the afternoon off
last week?

584
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:46,406
It was last, last week

585
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,541
Is that so?

586
00:35:50,043 --> 00:35:51,778
Is it because of your kids?

587
00:35:52,446 --> 00:35:54,748
Anyway, go and have lunch

588
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:58,918
Goodness

589
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,225
Yes, go and have lunch

590
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:20,407
I didn't know this when I used to work

591
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:26,012
That even those who seemed relaxed
during the midday

592
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:30,049
were facing a much narrower,
deeper, and tougher social life

593
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,888
- Jay's mom!
- Jay's mom!

594
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,289
We're here again

595
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:37,757
Jay's mom!

596
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:40,703
[Ethan's Mom] Hi

597
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:42,262
Hello

598
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:44,764
[Ethan's Mom] Let's sit over here

599
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:50,213
I warned the new teacher and gave feedback

600
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:51,848
to be more careful...

601
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:55,208
[Song-yi] Ethan's mom plays the role
of my former Team Leader

602
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:59,646
She puts her opinion forward first,
walks the walk,

603
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:04,451
and the other mothers follow her
accordingly

604
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:09,889
[Ethan's Mom] Did you buy it?

605
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:11,400
Did you buy it, too?

606
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:14,394
I strongly recommend this item

607
00:37:14,494 --> 00:37:16,663
It'll be cheap only if you buy it
during the upcoming group purchase

608
00:37:16,963 --> 00:37:20,967
This influencer and I are close, so I heard
about the production cost

609
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:21,768
and it's not bad

610
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:23,703
I'm impulsively buying again because of you

611
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:25,672
I trust your pick, though

612
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:29,342
Thank you
I've made my payment as well

613
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:36,649
What about you, Jay's mom?

614
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:38,017
Don't you need one?

615
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:41,188
I'm good

616
00:37:41,188 --> 00:37:43,289
I'm on a tight budget this month

617
00:37:44,925 --> 00:37:46,226
Is that so?

618
00:37:48,528 --> 00:37:51,598
I guess you are a rational consumer

619
00:37:51,898 --> 00:37:54,067
After all, birds of a feather
flock together

620
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:57,871
The twin's mom works and makes
a lot of money,

621
00:37:57,871 --> 00:37:59,539
but she doesn't buy much

622
00:38:00,507 --> 00:38:02,042
Oh, Hana?

623
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:02,785
Yes

624
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:07,890
Exactly, she even owns Park View,
the leading apartment,

625
00:38:07,914 --> 00:38:10,183
and hardly has any mortgage

626
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,052
But I think she's too relentless

627
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:16,699
I mean, exchanging information among
mothers is super important,

628
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:18,925
yet she hardly ever shows up

629
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,296
Jay's mom, you'll join us
after kindergarten, right?

630
00:38:23,296 --> 00:38:24,774
The kid's cafe?

631
00:38:24,798 --> 00:38:25,965
Pardon?

632
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:31,280
Oh, my

633
00:38:31,304 --> 00:38:34,307
You're making it sound like
we're leaving out the twin's mom

634
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:38,011
That's not it

635
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:40,547
As you know,

636
00:38:40,547 --> 00:38:44,126
the twins are in the all-day class

637
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,619
So, their schedules don't match ours

638
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:50,156
And it's not like we can take
the kids with us

639
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:55,137
But sometimes, I feel sad to think the kids
will be staying there for such long hours

640
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:56,262
That's true

641
00:38:58,431 --> 00:38:59,899
Jay's mom

642
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,235
Where did you say you lived in?

643
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:06,172
Umm, I live in "CenFoHill"

644
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:07,740
Which block?

645
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:12,111
But how do you know that?

646
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,713
Huh?

647
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:16,650
How do you know if that house
belongs to them?

648
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,017
I find it fascinating

649
00:39:20,954 --> 00:39:22,188
Oh!

650
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:28,227
When you talk with mothers, you get to know
all sorts of things

651
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:38,338
But were the two of you very close?

652
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:48,715
Done? Are we done?

653
00:39:48,715 --> 00:39:50,516
I'm leaving, okay?

654
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,419
I'll call you if something happens

655
00:39:52,419 --> 00:39:54,788
I mean, I call you even if you
tell me not to

656
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:56,189
Okay

657
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:58,958
Oh, my, I'll miss the shuttle bus
at this rate, I'm off!

658
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:03,496
What?

659
00:40:03,763 --> 00:40:05,932
What is this company saying?

660
00:40:06,766 --> 00:40:08,010
Wait, what is this out of the blue?

661
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:11,847
The discussions ended but changed last
minute, so we might not get the permit?

662
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:14,240
We'll look into this first

663
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,543
We don't know if they're just
saying this or not

664
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:18,821
No, stay put
I'll deal with it

665
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:20,180
This is driving me up the wall

666
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,782
Why are they doing this out of the blue?

667
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,589
I don't know
What should I do?

668
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:31,334
Can't you get off work early today?

669
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:32,835
[Seong-tae] I can't

670
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:35,171
I have dinner with the investors

671
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:37,463
I can't call off the dinner on the day

672
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,332
Can't you call the helper to come again?

673
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:41,567
She already has plans

674
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:45,305
The kids were so excited this morning
What should I do?

675
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:47,707
I'll be late even if I head out now

676
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:51,310
[Seong-tae] Shall I ask Mom to go?

677
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:54,381
Your mother is still traveling!

678
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:56,549
Don't you even know your mom's schedule?

679
00:40:56,649 --> 00:40:58,227
[Seong-tae] I didn't know

680
00:40:58,251 --> 00:41:01,587
But then, must you go on the
business trip yourself?

681
00:41:01,654 --> 00:41:03,165
You can ask someone else to do it

682
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:04,324
That's crazy

683
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:07,994
These people are just dying to see me flop

684
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:09,763
How can I possibly do that?

685
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:11,764
And I can't trust them, no

686
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:14,534
[Seong-tae] What should we do?

687
00:41:14,868 --> 00:41:16,412
What do we do?

688
00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:17,537
Oh, I don't know

689
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:20,216
I'll try asking the kindergarten
for a favor again

690
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,450
No, I'll call...

691
00:41:21,474 --> 00:41:22,474
Hang up!

692
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:24,610
Never helpful

693
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:29,649
Ms. Choi!

694
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:37,266
I'm sorry

695
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,235
I've been thinking about ways to fix this

696
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:41,027
What are you planning to do?

697
00:41:41,227 --> 00:41:42,471
Can you take responsibility for this?

698
00:41:42,495 --> 00:41:43,229
Yes!

699
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:45,231
I'll take responsibility for this

700
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:46,566
No

701
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,668
We're going to send Kim there...

702
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:49,903
I'll go

703
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:52,438
It's my job, and I can handle everything

704
00:41:53,306 --> 00:41:55,174
Go where?

705
00:41:55,642 --> 00:41:58,144
You can't even deal with your two kids,

706
00:41:58,144 --> 00:42:00,146
and you're pregnant with another one

707
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,248
Do you even have a conscience?

708
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:04,717
Are you planning to take another leave
and make others suffer?

709
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:08,521
Why are you being so stubborn
when you can just quit?

710
00:42:18,898 --> 00:42:21,768
Sir, I'm more than okay

711
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:23,837
And I'll book the flight

712
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:25,548
A flight? You're pregnant

713
00:42:25,572 --> 00:42:27,373
I'm pregnant, but I can do everything!

714
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:30,286
There's nothing I can't do,
and I'm in my second trimester

715
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,312
No, I'm saying this because
that place isn't important

716
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:38,918
You're smart, so you should accompany me
to grill the higher-ups there

717
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,854
Pardon?

718
00:42:40,854 --> 00:42:43,656
Things like having to persuade
the employees...

719
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:47,736
Go and ask your subordinates,
like Kim, to do it

720
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,830
Why are you thinking of taking a flight
with a belly?

721
00:42:51,998 --> 00:42:53,232
And you,

722
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,802
don't trust your physical strength too much

723
00:42:57,704 --> 00:43:00,216
My wife is super fit,

724
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,876
but she insisted on working out a bit more
because her body felt sore,

725
00:43:04,777 --> 00:43:06,946
and ended up giving birth prematurely

726
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,192
I still regret

727
00:43:10,216 --> 00:43:13,052
not stopping her then

728
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:16,923
I didn't know

729
00:43:18,224 --> 00:43:19,492
Huh?

730
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:21,327
No

731
00:43:21,327 --> 00:43:22,996
My kid is super fit now

732
00:43:22,996 --> 00:43:25,031
and in a ssireum club!

733
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:27,567
I mean, the point is...

734
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:31,871
Take it easy and let the people around you
deal with the demanding work

735
00:43:32,238 --> 00:43:34,183
Everyone knows you're competent anyway

736
00:43:34,207 --> 00:43:38,010
I'm doing this because you're trying
to bear everything yourself!

737
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:41,647
Kang seems brainy

738
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,351
Sir

739
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:50,323
Don't worry, and ask for help

740
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:53,926
This is something we must
all go through in life

741
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,862
It's the same as parenting

742
00:43:56,062 --> 00:43:58,431
You need to keep trying with your husband

743
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:01,234
and ask him to do things
for him to learn

744
00:44:01,568 --> 00:44:04,203
You must keep asking for help
so that your teammates

745
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:08,374
will know what to do even if someone
goes on parental leave

746
00:44:12,912 --> 00:44:14,123
Fighting

747
00:44:14,147 --> 00:44:15,291
Yes, sir

748
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:16,515
Keep up the good work

749
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:33,733
What's wrong with him?

750
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:44,477
I'll get going first

751
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,247
Ms. Choi

752
00:44:48,414 --> 00:44:49,548
Yes?

753
00:44:50,817 --> 00:44:54,854
You know I really look up to you, right?

754
00:44:55,088 --> 00:44:57,356
What are you talking about
out of the blue?

755
00:44:58,725 --> 00:45:01,928
When I see you, I think to myself

756
00:45:01,928 --> 00:45:04,297
that I should work passionately
like you even if I get married

757
00:45:04,297 --> 00:45:05,965
and have kids

758
00:45:07,033 --> 00:45:11,104
I know you're more than competent,

759
00:45:11,104 --> 00:45:13,506
so please share your work with us

760
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,641
Okay?

761
00:45:20,113 --> 00:45:22,415
My goodness, seriously...

762
00:45:27,153 --> 00:45:28,788
Good luck

763
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:29,922
I'm leaving

764
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:31,157
Take care

765
00:45:31,157 --> 00:45:32,525
Okay

766
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:37,563
Yes, I'm leaving now

767
00:45:38,264 --> 00:45:40,366
I need to go to the kindergarten, right?

768
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:42,468
Did you talk with the teacher?

769
00:45:44,537 --> 00:45:45,638
What?

770
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:02,767
Hey, this is nothing

771
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,148
Okay!

772
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:19,611
Come on, don't laugh over
something like this

773
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:21,070
One more time!

774
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:26,518
- One more time! One more time!
- One more time! One more time!

775
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:28,677
One more time!

776
00:46:43,025 --> 00:46:45,094
Is it fun? You want me to do it again?

777
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:00,209
Here

778
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:03,546
Thank you for today

779
00:47:03,913 --> 00:47:05,281
And I'm sorry

780
00:47:06,215 --> 00:47:08,250
Why are you doing this? Don't

781
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:10,653
You're making me feel like
I did it to get something in return

782
00:47:11,587 --> 00:47:12,831
Take it

783
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:14,633
Take it for my sake

784
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:16,692
I'm really okay

785
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,229
But still, take it

786
00:47:21,063 --> 00:47:24,266
I couldn't do anything for you
when you gave birth to Jay

787
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:29,905
Stop

788
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:34,477
Let me clarify before we go on

789
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,882
So, this is what happened

790
00:47:40,216 --> 00:47:43,419
I registered my marriage in advance
because of the mortgage

791
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:46,121
But that jerk had an affair
before the wedding

792
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:47,890
What?

793
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,159
What kind of a bastard is he?

794
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:53,262
Hey, is that how you ended up alone...

795
00:47:56,465 --> 00:47:57,133
Play, play

796
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:58,367
- Oh, it's nothing, it's nothing
- Goodness me, how adorable

797
00:47:58,367 --> 00:47:59,568
Play, you guys

798
00:48:02,138 --> 00:48:04,307
It's not a premarital pregnancy,
and he's not my son

799
00:48:04,307 --> 00:48:05,641
Jay is my nephew

800
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:08,410
You remember my sister, Eun-gyu, right?
He's her son

801
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,814
Is Eun-gyu already married?

802
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,716
Yes

803
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,584
Well, it's a long story,

804
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,553
but anyway...

805
00:48:18,254 --> 00:48:20,098
And I'm not a cafe owner, either

806
00:48:20,122 --> 00:48:21,223
I'm part-timing

807
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:23,035
Well...

808
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:25,461
I didn't mean to lie

809
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,931
I couldn't clarify a few of them, but...

810
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,667
I don't know what rumors I have
and where they've started,

811
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,502
but they're driving me nuts

812
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:38,474
Hey, that's what this neighborhood is like

813
00:48:38,574 --> 00:48:43,188
Especially among kindergarten mothers,
rumors spread like wildfire

814
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:47,116
Even if they look like good friends,
they're calculative and picky

815
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:53,756
Hey,

816
00:48:55,191 --> 00:48:56,859
that's why I was happy

817
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:01,330
Huh?

818
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:06,168
That you showed up before me

819
00:49:30,293 --> 00:49:31,560
My goodness

820
00:49:31,861 --> 00:49:34,172
You said you wouldn't get married
or have kids

821
00:49:34,196 --> 00:49:36,098
and live as an Alpha Girl

822
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,170
People change as life goes on

823
00:49:41,871 --> 00:49:43,872
Look at you now
Three children

824
00:49:44,507 --> 00:49:47,109
I initially planned to have two

825
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,412
because I need to take a break twice
if I get pregnant twice

826
00:49:49,412 --> 00:49:51,280
I didn't want to take a long hiatus

827
00:49:51,347 --> 00:49:55,150
So, I got pregnant via IVF on purpose
to get it done and dusted in one go

828
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:58,087
And I got twins, just as I hoped

829
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:04,893
But life doesn't go as planned

830
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,729
Oh? Wait, wait

831
00:50:08,864 --> 00:50:11,767
Isn't that Louis' mom?

832
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:13,569
- Is it okay?
- Yes

833
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:14,646
- Then, I'll give it to you
- Yes

834
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:15,670
I'll put it in here for you

835
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,520
What? She only pretended to buy it

836
00:50:21,544 --> 00:50:24,280
I was wondering how everyone was
buying such expensive things so easily

837
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,549
This is a weird neighborhood

838
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:28,851
You can't tell from the outside

839
00:50:29,952 --> 00:50:31,596
When I came to Cheonpo,

840
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,090
I felt like an oddball that couldn't fit in

841
00:50:36,926 --> 00:50:39,662
Everyone is living in a decent apartment,

842
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,473
driving expensive cars,

843
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:44,767
and living like fine adults
with a husband and a child

844
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:47,536
And I felt like the odd one out

845
00:50:49,638 --> 00:50:50,739
Hey

846
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:55,711
No one mentions it, but they're all
bound to have their stories

847
00:50:55,945 --> 00:50:58,981
That's what they seem like,
and they're pretending to do so

848
00:50:59,382 --> 00:51:01,393
Everyone is living with their faces
covered under a mask

849
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:03,055
(Access/Issue Registration)

850
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,183
(Certificate of All Registered Matters)

851
00:51:21,737 --> 00:51:23,839
[Song-yi] I'm using what you gave me

852
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,778
[Hana] It's the most effective
in boosting saggy skin

853
00:51:28,778 --> 00:51:32,347
Honestly, my pick is better
than Ethan's mom's

854
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:37,052
[Song-yi] I want that envelope back

855
00:51:38,954 --> 00:51:40,156
[Hana] What are you on about?

856
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:42,467
You said you didn't get married
or give birth to Jay

857
00:51:42,491 --> 00:51:44,259
No, I refuse

858
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:52,301
[Song-yi] I'll take Sia and Teo to
kindergarten and pick them up

859
00:51:52,668 --> 00:51:54,813
But I won't do it for free

860
00:51:54,837 --> 00:51:56,805
You wouldn't tolerate it

861
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:01,243
Oh, Ji Song-yi

862
00:52:01,444 --> 00:52:03,512
She's always like this

863
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:18,393
It's nice and tight

864
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:23,132
But I always look best
when I'm at home like this

865
00:52:26,035 --> 00:52:27,402
Gorgeous

866
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,185
Hello?

867
00:52:43,686 --> 00:52:45,120
[Jin-ho] Is this Song-yi?

868
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:48,323
Who is this?

869
00:52:49,325 --> 00:52:50,692
[Jin-ho] It is you

870
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:52,861
Wow, no way

871
00:52:53,162 --> 00:52:56,308
You only changed the first digits to 010

872
00:52:56,332 --> 00:52:57,966
That's so you, Ji Song-yi

873
00:52:59,268 --> 00:53:00,946
I asked, who are you?

874
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,337
[Jin-ho] It's me

875
00:53:03,205 --> 00:53:04,573
Pardon?

876
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:07,476
We've already bumped into each other
a few times

877
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,812
Don't you remember?

878
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,456
Jin-ho?

879
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,848
Yeah!

880
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:17,019
Yes, it's me

881
00:53:18,888 --> 00:53:20,522
Why are you calling at this hour?

882
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,391
[Jin-ho] Umm...

883
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:24,660
I was...

884
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,262
wondering if...

885
00:53:27,796 --> 00:53:29,765
we could meet up in private

886
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,634
Why would I?

887
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:35,504
[Jin-ho] I'm...

888
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,540
actually...

889
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:42,177
My wife and I are sexless

890
00:53:42,745 --> 00:53:44,313
What?

891
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,548
([Song-yi] Hang on)

892
00:53:46,782 --> 00:53:50,085
- (I'm not mistaken, am I?)
- [Jin-ho] Song-yi

893
00:53:50,085 --> 00:53:51,120
Are you listening?

894
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,864
- Is this...
- [Jin-ho] My wife and I are sexless!

895
00:53:52,888 --> 00:53:56,758
([Song-yi] The PG 39 flirting skill
married men use?)

896
00:53:56,825 --> 00:53:58,360
(I'm right, aren't I?)

897
00:54:03,065 --> 00:54:04,533
Oh! Right!

898
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,901
Did you know?

899
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:08,270
The... Seok Jin-ho!

900
00:54:08,437 --> 00:54:09,872
Jin-ho, the rock

901
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:13,042
The... My, my ex-boyfriend
The Hanguk University graduate!

902
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,509
Don't you know him?

903
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,178
Hey, he lives here!

904
00:54:17,179 --> 00:54:19,214
In the past, you said he was
the better option

905
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,916
That's right!

906
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:22,827
Hey, I know who he is

907
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:23,953
But he lives here?

908
00:54:23,953 --> 00:54:25,254
Yeah!

909
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:27,990
He lives upstairs,
and his wife is a stunner!

910
00:54:29,525 --> 00:54:32,370
I heard she runs some pottery workshop

911
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,330
Ethan's mom asked me to send Jay there

912
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,965
Hey! I know who she is!

913
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,111
Wait, that's his wife?

914
00:54:40,135 --> 00:54:42,414
- Yeah, it's wild, right?
- That's crazy

915
00:54:42,438 --> 00:54:45,050
Like you said, this is a super
weird neighborhood

916
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:46,909
- He lives upstairs?
- Yes!

917
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:50,088
- Then, you'll keep running into him
- Oh, I don't know!

918
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:52,881
That's ridiculous! Awful, that's awful!
What are you going to do?

919
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,584
Goodness me, goodness me

920
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:58,787
Sweetheart, you're so beautiful!

921
00:54:58,787 --> 00:55:00,556
Let's go, let's go
Let's go home

922
00:55:00,556 --> 00:55:01,957
Let's go! Let's go!

923
00:55:01,957 --> 00:55:03,168
Oh, oh, oh
Come here, come here

924
00:55:03,192 --> 00:55:05,827
Let's go, let's go

925
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:07,029
What should I do now?

926
00:55:07,029 --> 00:55:10,041
Hey, what are you seriously going to do?

927
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:11,576
I don't know if I should laugh or cry

928
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,703
- Try getting along with him again
- How can I? I can't!

929
00:55:14,703 --> 00:55:15,904
Why not?
