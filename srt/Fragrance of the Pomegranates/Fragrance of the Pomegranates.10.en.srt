1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,519
Splash you

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,960
Yueyue

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,320
What are you guys doing?

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,519
Mom's here

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,279
Mom's here

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,320
Stop playing, let's go

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,160
Look how dirty you two are

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,280
Girls should act like girls

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,960
You'll never get married when you grow up

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,280
When we grow up, Nana will marry me

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
I'm not marrying anyone

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,679
Then I'll marry

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,960
Then big brother can always play with me

14
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,639
Dad

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,879
Let me do it

16
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,560
Well done

17
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,080
Not bad at all

18
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,080
Ankar's issue is settled

19
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,800
What's this?

20
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,439
Don't worry about it

21
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,759
Worry about yourself first

22
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,879
Nana has a day off today

23
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,759
She's going birdwatching at Yamalik Mountain

24
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,639
Xu Lai is going too

25
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,759
I've passed on the message

26
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,680
Think about it yourself

27
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,919
Murat's Dad

28
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,639
Guangtian's parents sent seafood

29
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,280
Can you teach me to make sea intestine rice?

30
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,400
I want to surprise him

31
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,479
W-what rice?

32
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,639
Sea intestine rice

33
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,919
I really can't make it

34
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,560
You should ask Ankar instead

35
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,439
He loves

36
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,840
Loves to experiment with new things

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The beautiful lady is back

38
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,919
What do you want to make?

39
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,319
Sea intestine rice

40
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,400
Sure

41
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,479
Beg me

42
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,720
Why do you always

43
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
hit me when you see me?

44
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,759
Because you only act tough at home

45
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,160
Just like Murat's Dad, so capable

46
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:22,959
Don't touch me

47
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,399
Stop staring at me

48
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:23,839
Don't touch me

49
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,279
If you

50
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:24,800
Don't touch me

51
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,959
Enough, enough, enough

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,639
Stop chasing me

53
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
You two siblings

54
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,519
Are going to tear down the kitchen

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,279
What are you laughing at?

56
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,720
Turns out

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,199
Birdwatching is best with you

58
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,439
If you go with the big group

59
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,879
You can't find such a quiet spot

60
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,439
Just say you want my birdwatching map

61
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,319
No, that's not it

62
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,560
Being with you

63
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,879
is much more interesting than alone

64
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,560
The ecosystem these past years

65
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,839
has really improved

66
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
There are more and more bird species

67
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,439
Yeah

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,560
When I first came to Urumqi

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,079
I just thought it was a city

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
Not much different from other cities

71
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,319
But after birdwatching once by chance

72
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,560
my world opened up

73
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
It's like I got to know this city all over again

74
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,879
It's a city

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
and also a forest

76
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,360
You know, I've never

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,839
looked at it from this angle

78
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:15,920
Mingliang

79
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,720
What are you doing here?

80
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,120
Nana

81
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,720
Director Xu

82
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,439
What a coincidence

83
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,720
Are you guys

84
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,319
going birdwatching again?

85
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:29,879
Yes

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,279
Great artist

87
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,720
Didn't expect we're so fated to meet

88
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,399
Yes, yes, yes

89
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,800
What are you drawing?

90
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,839
Just doodling

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,680
No inspiration

92
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,399
Walked around

93
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,399
Didn't draw anything

94
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
Well, take your time finding inspiration

95
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,759
We'll head off now

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,480
Let's go

97
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,879
D-Director Xu

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,439
There's something I've wanted to say

99
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,279
but never had the chance

100
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,680
Ever since I learned from you

101
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,560
that birds have all kinds of calls

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
I felt I should

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,560
learn more about bird habits

104
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,399
All kinds of birds

105
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,720
You know, with painting

106
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,240
You can't just paint the form, not the spirit

107
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,279
And also

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,000
Nana

109
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,000
That presentation I gave you

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,160
about the Crane of Courage

111
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
I always felt something was missing

112
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,000
Then I thought about it

113
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,480
It's missing real knowledge of birds

114
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,519
Missing that spirit

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Since we're so lucky to meet today

116
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,240
and you're going birdwatching

117
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,920
I wonder if I could

118
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,000
join you two and learn a bit

119
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,319
Maybe

120
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,879
together

121
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,839
If it's not convenient, that's fine

122
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,199
I wouldn't want to disturb your work

123
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,560
It's no trouble at all

124
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,879
Then let's go together

125
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:43,759
Okay

126
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,839
But there are no Crane of Courage here

127
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,079
Just a flock of little goldcrests

128
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,720
They're all birds

129
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,680
All birds

130
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,639
Let's go

131
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,199
Alright, let's go

132
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,560
Go

133
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,720
It's a goldcrest mom feeding her babies

134
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:11,639
I

135
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,199
Let me see

136
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,079
Are you okay?

137
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,480
Thank you

138
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
It's common in the wild

139
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:46,879
It's fine, it's fine

140
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,399
Really, it's fine

141
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,120
Really, it's fine

142
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,680
Let's go, let's go

143
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,319
It's really fine

144
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:49,800
It's fine

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,160
Go

146
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,120
I finally understand now

147
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
why you never seem to notice me anymore

148
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,559
because your eyes are already set on someone else

149
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,320
We grew up together

150
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,879
The way you look at him is different

151
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,360
Your gaze is different

152
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,360
It could mean family

153
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,960
Or friends

154
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,840
But it's not the same

155
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,840
Do you remember our first meeting?

156
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,519
It was birdwatching at Yamalik Mountain

157
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,039
In the crowd

158
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,759
I spotted you right away

159
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,759
Birdwatching at Yamalik Mountain

160
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,799
A little tit had fallen

161
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,120
out of its nest

162
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,960
You noticed it by chance

163
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,120
and rushed over

164
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,279
saving it from another animal's jaws

165
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,240
That's right

166
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,519
We even returned the tit to its nest together

167
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,519
You worried its mother wouldn't accept it

168
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,320
So you kept watching

169
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,519
completely focused

170
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,080
ready to jump in and help at any moment

171
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,399
Your eyes were shining so brightly then

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,759
Like

173
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,440
sunlight on the plateau

174
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,120
glittering

175
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,639
Nana

176
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,080
Trust me

177
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,879
Your eyes never lie

178
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,120
I know we can't be together

179
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
But I still want to try

180
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,559
Some things

181
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,759
I've kept inside for so long

182
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,320
As for me

183
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,200
Xu Lai

184
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,759
Don't say it

185
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,759
If you do

186
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,559
we might not even stay friends, right?

187
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,879
Will you tell him?

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,639
You're not someone who lacks courage

189
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,399
Let it be

190
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,320
Then I'll head out

191
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Say hi to him for me

192
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,559
It's getting late

193
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,720
Let's go home

194
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,279
I thought you wouldn't come again

195
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,639
Planting trees is good for your health

196
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,720
and honors the fallen

197
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Why wouldn't I come?

198
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,559
Besides, Uncle and I are close

199
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,440
Right, Brother Sa?

200
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,159
That's right, little brother

201
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,240
You came at the perfect time

202
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,080
I have something to tell you

203
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,360
I'm going to work in the village

204
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,480
That's so sudden

205
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,279
I got the notice a while ago

206
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,919
I wanted to see you before leaving

207
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,120
to spend time with you

208
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,960
But I didn't expect

209
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,399
It's okay

210
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,360
Xu Lai

211
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,919
Sorry

212
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,120
No need to apologize

213
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,440
Liking someone

214
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,679
isn't something you can control

215
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,759
Even if we're not together

216
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,600
I still wish you happiness

217
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,360
Likewise

218
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,240
I wish you all the best too

219
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,000
Alright then

220
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
With your blessing

221
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,159
my career will soar for sure

222
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,559
Let's go

223
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,840
By the way

224
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,960
Are there any special birds in Hetian?

225
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,960
There are gray geese

226
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,320
mallards

227
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,840
and the "giant panda of birds," the black stork

228
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,600
Little Xu has left

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,720
He's going to Hetian for village work

230
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,360
So

231
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,559
he might not be able to visit for a while

232
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,039
When I first met him

233
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,440
I saw this kid

234
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,919
He wasn't here for pure reasons

235
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,679
It wasn't about my sore knee

236
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,679
helping me plant trees

237
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,080
he was after my Nana

238
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,840
No, he wasn't

239
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,960
You're overthinking, Dad

240
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,480
He really just wanted to be close to nature

241
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,639
If I'd known he had other intentions

242
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,919
I wouldn't have let him come

243
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,360
Silly girl

244
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,960
You're the only one who doesn't see it

245
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,200
I didn't want him wasting time

246
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,320
I often made things hard for him

247
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,919
hoping he'd give up

248
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,799
But I didn't expect

249
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,200
he'd keep planting for two years

250
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,440
But

251
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,240
I remember

252
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,519
you tried to set us up for a while

253
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,039
He's so outstanding

254
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,320
If you never found someone you liked

255
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,759
he'd be a good choice

256
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,720
But the choice

257
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,519
is yours

258
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,679
Dad won't interfere

259
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,799
But

260
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,879
Dad has two things to tell you

261
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,720
Living life

262
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,840
is complicated

263
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,080
but also simple

264
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,720
If you care for him

265
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,840
and he cares for you

266
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,960
you can get through anything

267
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,200
What's the second thing?

268
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,559
The second is

269
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,840
Dad

270
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,960
will always be by your side

271
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,840
Okay

272
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
How do you know Mingliang will go?

273
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,799
It's not so easy to back out

274
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,519
When you face someone you truly like

275
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,960
how many can give up so easily?

276
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,039
Aren't we living proof?

277
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
So that's how it is

278
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,679
You're not eating at the restaurant?

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm cooking myself

280
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,720
Can you cook it through?

281
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,159
Can I or can't I?

282
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,399
You'll know when you come over

283
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:12,960
Hanging up

284
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,159
Hello, Nana

285
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,519
Yueyue, are you free?

286
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,840
My water pipe burst

287
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,960
I still have work to finish

288
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,320
Can you come help me check?

289
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,320
Okay, don't worry

290
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
I'm coming over now

291
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,879
It's a minor issue

292
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,200
Just replace the hose

293
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,159
Alright, get back to work

294
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,320
I'll change it for you

295
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,759
Okay

296
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,200
Yueyue, how is she doing?

297
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,079
Mingliang.

298
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,519
You—why are you here?

299
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,960
Nana.

300
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,880
This is one.

301
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,039
It's fixed.

302
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,319
Let me see.

303
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,799
The total is one hundred twenty-eight.

304
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,960
Can one of you pay, please?

305
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,720
I'll do it, I'll do it.

306
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,680
Alright, I'm leaving.

307
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,440
Call me if you need anything.

308
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,720
Have some tea.

309
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,960
Please recommend our restaurant more.

310
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,680
Ankar.

311
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,640
Bro.

312
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,839
So many people this early?

313
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,839
They're all tourists from out of town.

314
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,440
They said a food blogger recommended us.

315
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,480
They came to check in and try it.

316
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Do you think our restaurant is getting popular?

317
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,279
Looks like we didn't buy enough ingredients today.

318
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,319
Alright.

319
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:17,960
Go get the supplies first.

320
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,319
Okay.

321
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,079
Isn't that Lao Yang?

322
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,160
Lao Yang.

323
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,480
Is he coming to our restaurant?

324
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,519
Which Lao Yang?

325
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,400
The famous food blogger.

326
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,559
The master chef.

327
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,279
Chef Yang.

328
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,920
I guess.

329
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,680
Here, give it to me.

330
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,920
Our Hong Shiliu.

331
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,759
Is about to blow up.

332
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,359
Here it comes!

333
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,720
Tiger salad is here!

334
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,200
Sorry about that.

335
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,119
Thanks for waiting.

336
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,160
Enjoy your meal.

337
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,559
Waiter, add some noodles.

338
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,039
Boss, is there a seat inside?

339
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,759
It's full.

340
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,880
You might need to wait a bit.

341
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,160
Right.

342
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,799
Please have a seat first.

343
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,880
Take a number.

344
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:16,880
Four skewers of barbecue.

345
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,440
No problem.

346
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
One order of spinach gluten.

347
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,599
Spinach gluten.

348
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:20,920
Four barbecue skewers.

349
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,599
One spinach gluten.

350
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,119
This place is really popular.

351
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,640
Finally got in.

352
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,079
Waiter, we'd like to order.

353
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,680
Coming.

354
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,039
Ladies.

355
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,799
Are you here to try our

356
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,599
free A'isha's Pilaf?

357
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,880
No.

358
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
We want to order.

359
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,240
Alright.

360
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,440
Let me explain to you.

361
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,960
This seat

362
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,160
is our restaurant's free seat.

363
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,480
It's reserved for

364
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,960
guests who need it most.

365
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,119
We need it the most right now!

366
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,880
Maybe you don't know,

367
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,079
this is Hong Shiliu's

368
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,960
tradition for decades.

369
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:04,880
Alright, alright.

370
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,480
You can walk around outside.

371
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,960
Give me your phone number.

372
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,920
When a seat opens up,

373
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,799
I'll call you right away.

374
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,880
There's a seat but you won't let us sit?

375
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,319
Is this how you do business?

376
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,440
Miss.

377
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm explaining nicely, aren't I?

378
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,640
Is this how you treat customers?

379
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,920
How am I treating customers?

380
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,640
What's your attitude?

381
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,440
What attitude?

382
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,759
My attitude is fine.

383
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:22,119
Right.

384
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:22,960
We want to complain.

385
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,720
Manager! Get the manager.

386
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,640
Manager! Manager!

387
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,519
What attitude?

388
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:25,920
Me?

389
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,720
My attitude is fine.

390
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,240
I'll do it.

391
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,640
No, those two are just too—

392
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,240
Go over there.

393
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:30,880
I'll handle it.

394
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,039
They're so unreasonable.

395
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:32,400
Sorry.

396
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,000
Are you the manager?

397
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,680
I'm the manager.

398
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,799
So, here's what we'll do.

399
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,279
Let's go to the backyard.

400
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,599
I'll help you solve the problem.

401
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:37,960
Alright?

402
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,359
Please, please.

403
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,680
Sorry.

404
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,720
Sorry, sorry.

405
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,680
Enjoy your meal, sorry.

406
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,799
I'll handle it, it's fine.

407
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,680
Come, this way.

408
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,799
Mingliang

409
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,880
Well,

410
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't forget about the lamb.

411
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,279
We bought too little today.

412
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,039
Can't keep up.

413
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:02,559
Okay.

414
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,400
I just asked Old Ding at the market.

415
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,359
He said

416
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,000
their supply

417
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,359
can only give us that much.

418
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,200
I don't know the quality at other places.

419
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,279
So I'm thinking

420
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,039
I'll check the market again later.

421
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,799
But overall,

422
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,240
our business has been great lately.

423
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,880
But the problems we face

424
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,960
we have to address them.

425
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,440
For example,

426
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,599
when we have more customers,

427
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,519
there's the waiting issue.

428
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,440
Waiting for seats.

429
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,519
If they wait too long,

430
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,480
they get impatient, easily upset.

431
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
About this,

432
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,680
I didn't handle it well.

433
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,680
But it's really not my fault.

434
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,400
You know?

435
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,519
No matter how I explain to her,

436
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,440
she won't listen.

437
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,799
She just keeps arguing with me.

438
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,680
Back and forth,

439
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,200
it turned into a big fight.

440
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,279
I wasn't talking about you.

441
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,480
I meant the customers.

442
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,519
When they wait too long,

443
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,680
they get irritated.

444
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,079
That's a problem.

445
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,319
Actually, I have an idea.

446
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,880
Why not strike while the iron's hot?

447
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,240
Let's open a new branch.

448
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,279
What do you think?

449
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,680
Or take over the Elixir shop.

450
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,400
Connect the spaces.

451
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,559
Expand the restaurant.

452
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,160
Can we do that?

453
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,440
Just learned to walk, already want to fly.

454
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,720
Kid,

455
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,920
your legs are still wobbly.

456
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,960
Mingliang,

457
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,920
I have a suggestion.

458
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,559
I think

459
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,480
could we maybe let go of

460
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,400
the free seats in our restaurant?

461
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Business is booming now.

462
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,440
We can't even fit regular customers.

463
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,160
Leaving them empty is a waste.

464
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,279
Even if someone wants A'isha's Pilaf for free,

465
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,319
who would feel comfortable sitting there?

466
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,599
Think about it.

467
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,599
How should I put it...

468
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,640
Just freeing up that table

469
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,000
might not help much.

470
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,559
Let's see if there's

471
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,480
another solution.

472
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,599
The free seats stay.

473
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:04,960
Travelers

474
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,599
need a place to rest.

475
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:09,359
A good meal helps them move on.

476
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,880
Our restaurant is the same.

477
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,880
If we want to go far,

478
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,079
we can't just rush ahead blindly.

479
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,559
Stay grounded.

480
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,519
Don't forget our roots.

481
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,680
That's how we stay steady.

482
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,359
Right.

483
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,799
That's what I mean too.

484
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,359
Warmth

485
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,480
is what I think is our

486
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,839
unseen signature.

487
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,440
Isn't it?

488
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,000
As the saying goes,

489
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,359
Plant a sycamore tree,

490
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,680
and the phoenix will come.

491
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,160
Maybe it's the free seats

492
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,799
that bring us more customers.

493
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:38,920
About the waiting issue,

494
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,160
Dong and I will think of something.

495
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,559
Thanks for your hard work.

496
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,319
Take a break.

497
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,720
I'll go check the lamb.

498
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,839
Pipa.

499
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,960
Pipa, pipa.

500
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,039
I'll head out then.

501
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,039
A beaver's tail is like a Swiss Army knife.

502
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,680
It paddles when swimming.

503
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,519
It balances when standing.

504
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,279
When alarmed, it slaps the water loudly.

505
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,400
Nana,

506
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,519
what are you writing?

507
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,160
Aren't the kindergarten kids

508
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,440
coming for a field trip next week?

509
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,440
I'm preparing a new presentation.

510
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,440
So it's easier for them to understand.

511
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,440
Leave it to me.

512
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,480
You've worked overtime three days straight.

513
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,640
Shut down your computer and come with me.

514
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,519
Isn't Li Guangtian coming today?

515
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,960
I'm not going to be a third wheel.

516
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,160
He said he has to work overtime again.

517
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,559
If you don't go with me,

518
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,279
the ticket will go to waste.

519
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,359
Let's go.

520
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,680
Come on.

521
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Alright, let's go.

522
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,599
Go.

523
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,519
Go.

524
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:27,960
Nana,

525
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,279
My phone's dead.

526
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,160
I'll rent a power bank.

527
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,759
I'll wait for you.

528
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,160
No need.

529
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,920
You go in first.

530
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:54,799
Nana,

531
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,079
Mingliang,

532
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:10,519
How about this—

533
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,400
Go to the music hall at the culture center

534
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,440
and give Yuèyuè her ticket.

535
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,359
Yuèyuè wants to attend the concert.

536
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,720
Okay.

537
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,599
You're not handling it?

538
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,519
I'll contact Yuèyuè.

539
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,559
I'll order a courier for her.

540
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,839
Why a courier?

541
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,799
Deliver it yourself.

542
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,880
A courier is fast.

543
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,839
I'm not done here yet.

544
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:27,880
Trust me.

545
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,640
Deliver it yourself.

546
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,000
Change into clean clothes.

547
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,359
Go, go, go!

548
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,559
Why change for delivering a ticket?

549
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,960
Why so many questions?

550
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,599
If they ask you to switch, just do it.

551
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,000
Seriously.

552
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,720
Let me grab the car keys.

553
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,279
Hu Yue.

554
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,880
Take it, take it.

555
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,880
Hurry, go inside.

556
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:52,720
I'm going in.

557
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:54,960
What does that mean?

558
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,200
Nana is waiting for you inside.

559
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,039
Nana.

560
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,240
You all really went to a lot of effort.

561
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
But I'm still asking Guangtian for help.

562
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,920
Don't worry about it.

563
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,359
Just treat it as a chance to relax.

564
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,480
We all know you've been stressed lately.

565
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,839
Go on, get inside.

566
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:14,960
Don't keep Nana waiting too long.

567
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,519
Go, go, go.

568
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,119
Go on!

569
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,480
Guangtian.

570
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,279
Um...

571
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,960
You go first.

572
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,359
Is the restaurant still manageable lately?

573
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,279
It's alright.

574
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,240
Uh...

575
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
I actually wanted to ask you for a favor.

576
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,359
I want to make some wildlife puzzles.

577
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,640
Can you explain in the simplest

578
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
and most straightforward

579
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,759
but also fun way

580
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,960
to tell me about the related facts?

581
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,960
You want to use them for waiting guests

582
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,200
as a game, right?

583
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,200
Smart.

584
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,559
Guests can pass the time.

585
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,079
And once they finish the puzzle,

586
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,759
they can exchange it for a dish.

587
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:12,960
Most importantly,

588
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,440
it helps promote wildlife protection.

589
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,759
It's a win-win.

590
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,279
That's a great idea.

591
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,279
Leave it to me.

592
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,920
Alright.

593
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,119
But this only eases things for now.

594
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,000
It can't solve the root problem.

595
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,039
That's true.

596
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,720
I've already contacted Li Guangtian.

597
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,359
He's helping me with technical support.

598
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,880
We're upgrading the ordering app.

599
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:32,720
Problems

600
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:33,480
will always come up.

601
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,160
We'll solve them one by one.

602
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,200
Sounds good.

603
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,400
You're getting more and more versatile.

604
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
I just talk.

605
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,279
It's you professionals who do the real work.

606
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,680
Do you come here often?

607
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,720
I haven't come with anyone.

608
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:46,720
Right.

609
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,039
I, uh...

610
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,720
No, not...

611
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:49,839
It's my first time here.

612
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,759
First time at this place.

613
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,480
It's done.

614
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,160
Someone scan it and try.

615
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,680
I'll do it.

616
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,200
Let me.

617
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,440
Two Qitai noodles left.

618
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,440
One small Big Plate Chicken left.

619
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,960
Can't make spicy pepper chicken.

620
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,160
Is that right, Murat's Dad?

621
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,480
Yes, yes.

622
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,039
That's all correct.

623
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,960
Our restaurant shows up in nearby eats.

624
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,720
That's awesome!

625
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,279
Exactly.

626
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,960
So just scan it

627
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,680
and you'll know the restaurant

628
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,519
what dishes are available or not.

629
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:37,920
Right.

630
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,200
That's really impressive.

631
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,519
Mainly because Mingliang did the prep work well.

632
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,440
My job

633
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
is actually pretty easy.

634
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,359
See?

635
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,960
You need young people for this.

636
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:47,759
Yeah.

637
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:48,640
They've got skills.

638
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,960
So you don't dislike him now?

639
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,920
Who said I did?

640
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,200
You brat.

641
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:56,920
Aunt Bayar.

642
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,920
You try scanning it too.

643
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,359
Okay.

644
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,039
I'll give it a try.

645
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,119
Do you know how to scan?

646
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,440
I'll learn.

647
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,079
Let me tell you.

648
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,640
It's up, it's up!

649
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:07,160
Look.

650
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,279
Here.

651
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,279
A treat for you.

652
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,039
Sea intestine rice bowl.

653
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,000
You made this?

654
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
You have no idea.

655
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,400
Our Yueyue

656
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,920
went to great lengths so you could eat this hometown dish.

657
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,759
She worked super hard for it.

658
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,279
I washed the sea intestines.

659
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,200
I fried the rice.

660
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,400
I mixed the chives and seasoning.

661
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,240
Yueyue, what did you do?

662
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,480
She just plated it.

663
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,079
You go first.

664
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,200
Is Mama A'isha doing well?

665
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,440
She's alright.

666
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,680
She just likes to act tough.

667
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,759
Doesn't want us to worry.

668
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:59,039
I'm heading to Bulgan Reserve in a couple days.

669
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,000
When I get back,

670
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,960
I'll go see her.

671
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,799
Bulgan.

672
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,680
How many days?

673
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,920
Hard to say.

674
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,640
What's wrong?

675
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,279
It's nothing.

676
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,039
Isn't Mom's birthday in a few days?

677
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,160
I'll adjust my schedule then.

678
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,720
It's fine.

679
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,480
You do your thing.

680
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,559
It's just a birthday.

681
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,799
We'll skip it this year.

682
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,200
There's always next year.

683
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,119
And the year after.

684
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,960
And many more years to come.

685
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,279
Right.

686
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:34,920
Many more years.

687
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,960
We celebrate every year.

688
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:48,880
Okay.

689
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:49,960
Thank you.

690
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,160
My name is Lu Wenchang.

691
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:55,920
I'm also in the restaurant business.

692
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,759
My place is over on Yashan North Road.

693
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,400
Hello, Boss Lu.

694
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:00,960
Ming Liang.

695
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,440
You came here today—

696
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,480
Is there something I can help with?

697
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,720
I'll get straight to the point.

698
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,079
Alright.

699
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,279
I want to join your restaurant as a partner.

700
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,200
I've been in this business for over ten years.

701
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,160
This year, I've been thinking about expanding.

702
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,880
I've considered many ways.

703
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,960
None of them really worked.

704
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,319
I know about your place too.

705
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,440
You just turned things around these past months.

706
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,440
Yes, that's right.

707
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:25,000
So, my friend—

708
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,400
I'll invest the money.

709
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,440
You bring the reputation.

710
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,680
Let's make the Hong Shiliu brand

711
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:31,960
bigger and stronger.

712
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,599
Don't worry.

713
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,640
I can pay extra for the partnership fee.

714
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,759
I promise I won't ruin your reputation.

715
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,039
Boss Lu, just like you said—

716
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,400
Our Hong Shiliu restaurant

717
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,880
only turned things around recently.

718
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,279
So personally, I think

719
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,400
our foundation isn't solid yet.

720
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,359
We're not ready to open franchise stores.

721
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:52,440
If I were to

722
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,160
just chase short-term gains,

723
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,400
and agreed to you today,

724
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,680
I might let you down.

725
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:00,079
And your money could go to waste.

726
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,000
So, Boss Lu—

727
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,480
About the partnership,

728
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,680
I can't agree to it.

729
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,199
Then I was a bit abrupt today.

730
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,920
Sorry about that.

731
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,239
I'll let you get back to work.

732
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,239
I'm heading out.

733
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:14,559
Boss Lu—

734
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,760
I can

735
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,360
share with you

736
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,679
what I've learned these past months.

737
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,000
Maybe

738
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,960
it could help you.

739
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,480
Sure.

740
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,280
So you're really not considering the partnership?

741
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,960
I thought it over before refusing.

742
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,400
Our restaurant suddenly got popular.

743
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,599
It's already shown our weaknesses.

744
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,280
We've known each other for a while now.

745
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,360
You know what kind of person I am.

746
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,599
I'm someone who prefers stability.

747
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,719
I like steady progress.

748
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,119
But I really think this is an opportunity.

749
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,960
If you turn it down now,

750
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,920
it'll be hard to rely on brand power

751
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,199
to open chain stores in the future.

752
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,800
It'll be tough.

753
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,960
I never planned on going chain.

754
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,920
Dong Ge—

755
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,440
When I first took over the restaurant,

756
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,400
it was to keep this family together.

757
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,639
Now,

758
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,440
what worries me most

759
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,440
is my mom's health.

760
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,880
Business is important,

761
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,639
but I don't want to lose sight of what matters.

762
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:38,679
My mom,

763
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,000
Mama Bayar,

764
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,880
Murat's Dad—

765
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,159
I'm sure they all feel the same.

766
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,519
When it comes to management,

767
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,639
you're the real expert.

768
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,719
Once things settle down here,

769
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,000
it'll need someone like you

770
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,599
to run it professionally.

771
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,039
I'll just take my mom out to have fun.

772
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,440
Go wherever she wants.

773
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,960
Be with her every day.

774
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,239
Make sure she's happy every day.

775
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,199
What about your own life?

776
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,960
This is the life I want most right now.

777
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,639
Didn't expect someone your age

778
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,119
to see things so clearly.

779
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,239
Let me tell you

780
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,719
the story of me and my ex-wife.

781
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,639
I'm all ears.

782
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:45,800
The two of us,

783
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,519
from dating to marriage,

784
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,079
for so many years.

785
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,519
I was poor all those years.

786
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,199
Had nothing.

787
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,559
I remember one time—

788
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,159
We owed rent.

789
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,599
The landlord kicked us out in the middle of the night.

790
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,719
We didn't want to spend money on a hotel.

791
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,639
So we dragged our luggage

792
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,400
and stayed under a bridge.

793
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,320
Just toughed it out.

794
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,519
She never complained.

795
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,039
She even joked with me.

796
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,559
She said, "Anton,

797
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,320
look, this place isn't bad.

798
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,079
There's a breeze."

799
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:31,800
It's cool.

800
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,719
And it saves money.

801
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Let's just live here from now on."

802
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,320
At that moment,

803
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,760
I felt terrible inside.

804
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,079
I swore to myself

805
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,559
I'd make something of myself.

806
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,400
How could I let

807
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,559
the person I love

808
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,719
suffer like this with me?

809
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:55,840
Later,

810
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,159
I made it.

811
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,119
Got rich.

812
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,119
I bought my wife bags,

813
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,559
gold jewelry,

814
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,440
all the expensive things.

815
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,679
But she chose to leave me.

816
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,119
I didn't understand.

817
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,599
I chased after her and asked,

818
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,320
Why?

819
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,239
Why would you?

820
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,400
I gave you everything good.

821
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,679
But guess what she said?

822
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,840
She said, "None of this is what I want.

823
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,599
I just want a home.

824
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,679
A home with

825
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,559
you

826
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,000
and me

827
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,559
is enough."

828
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:42,760
But now,

829
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,599
I've lost everything.

830
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,519
Are you free tomorrow?

831
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:12,920
I'll come see you.

832
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,159
I have something to tell you.

833
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,599
Are you free tomorrow?

834
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,280
Want to go hiking together?

835
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:11,719
Okay.

836
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,880
Okay.

837
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,199
Okay.

838
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:29,840
There was a time

839
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,719
I loved coming here to watch the sunrise

840
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,159
The sun peeked out from behind Bogda Peak

841
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,679
The whole city was bathed in golden light

842
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,000
Even if it lasted just a moment

843
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,840
But in that instant

844
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,480
I wished time could freeze

845
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,360
Is it only that moment you want to freeze?

846
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,000
There are others too

847
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,239
Life has many beautiful moments

848
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,559
Once, on the grasslands

849
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,719
The moon was huge that night

850
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,400
So bright

851
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,360
Suddenly, a red fox appeared

852
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,480
When it met my gaze under the moonlight

853
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,679
It was truly beyond words

854
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,239
Didn't you want to take a picture?

855
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,639
There was no time at all

856
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,599
Even my breathing was soft

857
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,199
Afraid I'd startle it

858
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:11,639
Nana

859
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,639
I have a gift for you

860
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:34,800
Thank you

861
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,199
I really like it

862
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,320
I like it too

863
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,000
It's not just the painting

864
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,000
Gulinaar

865
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,480
I like you

866
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,039
Not the way we liked each other

867
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,320
When we played together as kids

868
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,280
Not the feeling after we reunited

869
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,760
Or met again

870
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,320
Nor the fondness from spending time

871
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,960
And growing close

872
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,719
It's a love I've thought through

873
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,639
You are the one I want to protect

874
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,320
And be with for my whole life

875
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:22,760
Only then could I say I love you

876
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,199
You know

877
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,360
I've come this far

878
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,280
Because behind me

879
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,079
There's a big family loving me

880
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:30,880
Raising me

881
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,119
They're always standing behind me

882
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:34,639
I have to carry them with me

883
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,360
And keep moving forward with them

884
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:37,760
Before

885
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,320
I never dared to follow my heart

886
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:44,760
Afraid I'd let them down

887
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,840
Or hold you back

888
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,320
But now I've figured it out

889
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,400
Today I want to try

890
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
I want to invite you

891
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,519
Into my life

892
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,280
I'd love

893
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,800
To enter your world too

894
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,480
I finally said it

895
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,320
You don't have to answer right away

896
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:13,239
Anyway

897
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,480
If you can think about it

898
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,320
That already makes me happy

899
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:33,719
I will think about it carefully
