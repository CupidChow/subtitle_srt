1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,040
Ming Liang

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,679
There are rivers in the desert too.

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,000
Of course.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,240
Watch me.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,519
Ming Liang, you're amazing!

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,000
Ankar is too scared to jump.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,399
Ankar is a coward.

8
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,320
That's awesome!

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,120
Ming Liang

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,559
I want to jump in too.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,640
You can jump off my shoulders.

12
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,280
Say something, what's going on?

13
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:14,960
You.

14
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,240
Go ahead, say it.

15
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Murat

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,879
Speak.

17
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,080
Murat, Murat.

18
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,080
Murat

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,800
An Dong

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,879
You need to make yourself clear.

21
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,400
Only then can we help you.

22
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,240
Do you understand what I mean?

23
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,240
Let me say this.

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,360
I'll tell you everything from the start.

25
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,560
When I first started out,

26
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,439
when I started my business,

27
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,840
I began with a small restaurant too.

28
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,520
That restaurant

29
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
wasn't even half the size of Hong Shiliu.

30
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,800
Driven by my love for food,

31
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,039
bit by bit,

32
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,719
I built it up slowly.

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,719
Finally, I turned a small restaurant

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
into a big restaurant.

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
Then, within a year,

36
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,319
I opened dozens of branches at once.

37
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,280
I made a lot of money.

38
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,319
I'd never seen so much money before.

39
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,120
I thought I'd made it, I was An Dong.

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
I could do anything.

41
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,000
So I started playing with capital.

42
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,879
Overnight,

43
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,439
all those branches went bankrupt.

44
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,400
I ended up deep in debt.

45
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:39,840
Yes.

46
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,479
That's right.

47
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,759
When I came to Hong Shiliu,

48
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,120
I had other motives.

49
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,680
I wanted to use the restaurant

50
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,560
to make a big profit.

51
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,560
To pay off my own debts.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,199
An Dong

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,759
You told us

54
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,479
you'd help make Hong Shiliu

55
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,599
the top restaurant in Urumqi.

56
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,400
You kept stirring things up here every day.

57
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,639
Training Ankar,

58
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,840
training Murat,

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,279
it was all for yourself, wasn't it?

60
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:17,959
Yes.

61
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,480
I did it for myself.

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,800
An Dong

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,959
The day you first came to our restaurant,

64
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,120
sat in that seat,

65
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,720
eating A'isha's Pilaf,

66
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,120
I didn't like you from the start.

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
Everyone in our restaurant

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
gave you their heart,

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,120
treated you with total sincerity.

70
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
We all treated you this way.

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,600
Why did you treat us like that?

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,959
What kind of person are you?

73
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm just a selfish person.

74
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,079
But in the end,

75
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
you won.

76
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,360
I thought I was so smart,

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,759
but you bunch of

78
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,199
naive fools

79
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,879
completely moved me.

80
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,639
Your sincerity,

81
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,199
your honesty,

82
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,079
truly touched me.

83
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,800
I, An Dong, really

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,920
I want to be one of you.

85
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,160
I want to be family at Hong Shiliu.

86
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,199
An Dong

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,480
You don't know what family means.

88
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,639
An Dong,

89
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,360
You're playing the emotion card well.

90
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,639
Even I'm moved.

91
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,480
So, tell us,

92
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,199
how do we handle this?

93
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,040
I still...

94
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,199
It has nothing to do with them.

95
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,680
I'll use my dividends to pay.

96
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,920
From now on, every month,

97
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,040
as soon as the dividends arrive,

98
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,759
I'll send you every cent, no delay.

99
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,920
I guarantee it with my character.

100
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,319
Do you even have any character left?

101
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,439
He wants to guarantee it with his character?

102
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,319
And with dividends?

103
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,519
You're just making empty promises.

104
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,639
How can I trust you again?

105
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm not stupid.

106
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,480
We're all businesspeople here.

107
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,519
The contract

108
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,360
still needs to be honored, right?

109
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,600
We should at least respect the spirit of the contract.

110
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,759
Integrity is the foundation of being human.

111
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,800
Isn't that right, Ming Liang?

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,240
Fang Tao

113
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,560
Whether you're after the restaurant

114
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,399
or after An Dong,

115
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,759
it's all for profit.

116
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,360
Since it's about profit,

117
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,879
let's talk business.

118
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,199
An Dong is part of Hong Shiliu.

119
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,959
We'll discuss it internally.

120
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
and then give you an answer.

121
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,120
Ming Liang,

122
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,959
you all are just too kind.

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,560
Sometimes you're so kind and naive

124
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,279
it makes me want to laugh.

125
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,959
You're making this way too simple.

126
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,680
This issue involves

127
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,959
more than just An Dong.

128
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,439
I have another contract here.

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,920
Ankar Murat

130
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,439
forged a shareholder authorization.

131
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,240
Used the company seal to sign contracts.

132
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,439
This is no small matter.

133
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,279
His actions amount to fraud.

134
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,959
That's illegal.

135
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,040
I will call the police.

136
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,480
No.

137
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,399
No, no, that's not it.

138
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,879
Fang Tao, I... I didn't know.

139
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:05,959
Dong-ge

140
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,720
Did I really break the law?

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,879
Is this really illegal?

142
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,519
Of course.

143
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,879
This could mean jail time.

144
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,439
This

145
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,879
Did you hear that?

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,319
Murat

147
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,399
Sit down

148
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,120
Murat

149
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,480
Murat's dad

150
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,879
Fang Tao

151
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,600
I know about this

152
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,879
Our people did it

153
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
We'll take responsibility

154
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,639
Don't worry, Fang Tao

155
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,200
Hong Shiliu, thirty years

156
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
Never owed a single cent

157
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,039
Alright

158
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,799
That's great

159
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,879
An Dong

160
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,799
Look at them

161
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,120
They're loyal and true

162
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,240
Now look at you

163
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm completely disappointed in you

164
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,519
We'll pay the money back

165
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,879
Ming Liang

166
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,440
Fang Tao

167
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,759
Please leave

168
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,440
Okay

169
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,519
Either the money

170
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,200
Or the restaurant

171
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,159
Don't forget

172
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,320
You only have ten days

173
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,720
Fang Tao

174
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,159
No

175
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,600
Something's fishy here

176
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
You contacted Liu Jianping long ago, didn't you?

177
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,240
You two are in cahoots

178
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,919
You forced him

179
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,840
You made him demand I pay up, right?

180
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,039
An Dong

181
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,080
People

182
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,440
Should know themselves

183
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,279
You could've just run the restaurant

184
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,879
Fame and fortune, isn't that good?

185
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,639
But you had to mess with shady tricks

186
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,799
Trying to play the capital game

187
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,799
Can you handle it?

188
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,440
You failed once and still didn't learn

189
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,159
This time

190
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
Remember it

191
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,679
Within ten days

192
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:40,519
Bro

193
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,480
It's okay

194
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,960
We'll find a way

195
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,799
Mom

196
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,279
Mom

197
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,799
Should we go to the hospital?

198
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,559
Why go to the hospital?

199
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,320
No need

200
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,200
I was just anxious

201
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,919
I'm fine now

202
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,840
My mind is clear

203
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,440
You noticed something was wrong before, didn't you?

204
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,440
I saw An Dong earlier

205
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,840
Talking to Liu Jianping

206
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,279
I thought it was odd then

207
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,919
But I didn't ask much

208
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,279
It's a pity

209
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,799
Still a step too late

210
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,679
This is all my fault

211
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,240
A few times I noticed An Dong

212
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,960
Seemed to be hiding something

213
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,159
I didn't think much of it

214
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,919
If I'd told you earlier

215
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,639
You could've been prepared

216
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,519
Maybe we could've avoided this

217
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,320
Mom

218
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,039
It's not that you didn't think

219
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,240
You just didn't want to think deeper

220
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,240
If you really found out about An Dong

221
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,200
He'd leave

222
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,360
And I couldn't leave

223
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,519
Three million

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
That's not a small amount

225
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,159
Mom

226
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,679
Don't worry too much

227
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,200
I'll find a lawyer to check the contract

228
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,440
It's not that simple

229
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,519
It's not just whatever they say

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,879
But Fang Tao is clever because

231
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,919
He dragged Ankar into this too

232
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,360
That makes things more complicated

233
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,080
Ming Liang

234
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,799
Worst case, we give the restaurant to Fang Tao

235
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,240
Life goes on

236
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,679
No, Mom

237
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,600
We can't give in on this

238
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,200
After all that's happened

239
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I kept the restaurant going

240
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,799
I just wanted a way to earn money

241
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,200
I thought I

242
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,279
Could make a bit more

243
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,279
So my son could go further

244
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,519
And steadier

245
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,960
After all that's happened today

246
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,240
You're not worried at all

247
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,399
Even if we lose the restaurant

248
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,399
Or lose me

249
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,360
Mom

250
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,000
You still have to live well

251
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,120
Mom

252
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,440
Our family

253
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,639
This restaurant

254
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,840
Will always be here

255
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,080
Stand tall

256
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,120
The sky won't fall

257
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,919
Your back

258
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,200
Mustn't bend either

259
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,399
I was wrong, Dad

260
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,840
Yes, you were wrong

261
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,039
You were wrong because

262
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,080
You didn't trust Dad

263
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,279
Didn't trust your brother

264
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,559
What you fear most

265
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,039
Dad

266
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,679
Is Dad not understanding you

267
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,399
But

268
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,000
You can always talk to your brother

269
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,440
It's not like that, Dad

270
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,159
I just wanted

271
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,559
To do something worthwhile

272
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,759
Then tell you all

273
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,600
I'm grown up now

274
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,519
I can't always be under your protection

275
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,480
I did think about opening a branch

276
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,120
Wanted to be a boss

277
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,519
But I'm not that vain

278
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,919
I really want to share your burden

279
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,240
And my brother's too

280
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,519
What I want most

281
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,080
Is to make you proud

282
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,240
What you just said

283
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,039
this loss

284
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,080
let's say

285
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,919
wasn't for nothing

286
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,320
I've worked in the kitchen my whole life

287
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,720
tasted all the ups and downs

288
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,399
I've swallowed every flavor

289
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,399
But this time

290
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,960
it's a big deal

291
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,039
but

292
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,679
it's not the end of the world

293
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,039
Besides

294
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,559
even if the sky falls

295
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,480
you still have

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
your old man to hold it up

297
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,519
Dad

298
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,480
This time

299
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,960
don't let

300
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,279
your brother take it all on

301
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,320
We'll figure it out ourselves

302
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,159
Okay

303
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:55,720
Son

304
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,639
In our family

305
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
the most valuable thing

306
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,679
is that house

307
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,799
No, Dad

308
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,080
You saved your whole life for it

309
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
to buy that house

310
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,559
I can't let you at your age

311
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,559
end up with nowhere to live

312
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,600
No way, Dad

313
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,240
Son

314
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,240
You once told me

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,279
you'd buy me the biggest villa

316
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,000
So

317
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,279
did you forget

318
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,159
or give up

319
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,399
lost your confidence

320
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,320
I'm still waiting for that villa

321
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,320
Sorry, Dad

322
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,120
Son

323
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,559
I still

324
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,159
can't get used to you talking to me like this

325
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,679
I'd rather

326
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,159
you talk back to me

327
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,360
It's my fault

328
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,200
It's my fault

329
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,480
I used to

330
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,079
be too strict with you

331
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,160
too harsh

332
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:11,599
No, Dad

333
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,319
Dad, I'm sorry

334
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,079
Dad

335
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,119
There's over 133,000 yuan in here

336
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
What I mean is

337
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,680
we take out over 30,000 yuan

338
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,079
for living expenses

339
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,079
and give the remaining 100,000

340
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,559
to Ming Liang

341
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:42,559
How about that

342
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,440
What do you mean

343
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,599
Over 30,000 yuan

344
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,599
isn't enough for our living expenses

345
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,599
We don't spend much now

346
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,920
Can you give your opinion

347
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,880
No

348
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,720
What do you really mean

349
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,599
Don't rush

350
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,160
I mean

351
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,440
give all the money to Ming Liang

352
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,240
I have my salary, don't I

353
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,960
We'll be fine financially

354
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,799
I think we should give as much as we can now

355
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,559
Since when has Old Hu been so generous

356
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,559
We've been married over twenty years

357
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,880
Don't you know me by now

358
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,160
The Hong Shiliu restaurant is struggling

359
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,160
How could I still be stingy

360
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,559
I wish we had three million right now

361
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,279
I'm thinking

362
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,440
about the insurance Yue Yue bought for us

363
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,799
can we cash it out

364
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,680
I'll call her and ask

365
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,400
Alright

366
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,920
Dad

367
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,519
Mom

368
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:40,960
Yue Yue

369
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,720
Guang Tian

370
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,440
Why are you here

371
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,319
Uncle, Aunt

372
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,160
Guang Tian

373
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,480
When did you get back

374
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,799
With such a big problem at home

375
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,759
I had to come back

376
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,680
These are mine and Guang Tian's salary cards

377
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,519
Take them to the restaurant together tomorrow

378
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,319
No, no

379
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,000
Uncle

380
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,640
Yue Yue and I discussed it

381
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,839
We agreed to use this money for the emergency

382
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,720
I called my parents too

383
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,640
They're gathering money as well

384
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,079
How come

385
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,200
your parents got involved too

386
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,359
No, no

387
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,960
It's not right

388
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,720
Aunt

389
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,440
Family doesn't keep things separate

390
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,039
Take it

391
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:15,920
Alright

392
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,480
If we're not family

393
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,160
we wouldn't be under one roof

394
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,839
The lawyer says it's complicated

395
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,480
There's not enough solid evidence

396
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,279
Ankar said he wanted to open a branch

397
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,759
I should've asked clearly

398
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,759
An Dong ran the restaurant for years

399
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,160
and still got tricked by Fang Tao

400
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,599
You're not Zhuge Liang

401
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,920
You can't foresee everything

402
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,960
This is the money my dad and I raised.

403
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,599
He asked me to tell you

404
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,319
the sandstorm will pass.

405
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,799
The Karez water will never run dry.

406
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,240
No matter how long the winter lasts,

407
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,559
the pomegranate flowers will bloom again.

408
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,319
No, no.

409
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,279
Nana,

410
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,079
I can't accept money from you and Sadik's dad.

411
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,599
If this money came from Murat's dad,

412
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,519
Bayar's mom,

413
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,400
Yueyue and Guangtian,

414
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,279
would you take it then?

415
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,000
We agreed before,

416
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,599
no matter what the future holds,

417
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,720
we'll face it together.

418
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,400
You even told me yourself

419
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,000
that you'd fight by my side.

420
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,839
We're companions,

421
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,000
confidants,

422
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,039
lovers,

423
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,400
able to share joy together,

424
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,359
and walk through hardships side by side.

425
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,119
Nana,

426
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:24,960
this is different.

427
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,799
How is it any different?

428
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,839
I...

429
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,720
Even if we were just friends,

430
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,279
I still wouldn't leave you alone.

431
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,839
Let alone being your girlfriend.

432
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,000
It's exactly because you're my girlfriend

433
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,359
that I can't take this money.

434
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,200
Nana,

435
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,759
having you by my side

436
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,279
is more than enough for me.

437
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,440
All I've brought you is trouble,

438
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,839
a mess everywhere.

439
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,799
Now I'm buried in debt.

440
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,559
I don't want to drag you into this swamp,

441
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,759
let you get stuck in it.

442
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,359
Do you understand what I mean?

443
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,240
Ming Liang,

444
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,279
the most important thing now is saving the restaurant.

445
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,519
Only if you keep the restaurant

446
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,599
can you protect the people you care about.

447
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,440
And the only way to save it

448
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,880
is to raise these three million.

449
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,559
Nana, I won't give up.

450
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,279
I know

451
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,480
you're worried this will affect my life.

452
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,880
But you need my help now.

453
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
I have to be here.

454
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,640
Because I know

455
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,960
no matter what I face in the future,

456
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,880
you'll be there too.

457
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,559
If you can't even accept my help,

458
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,720
how can we walk side by side?

459
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,359
How can I keep walking with you?

460
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Think it over carefully.

461
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,599
Nana,

462
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,480
she put that bank card in my hand.

463
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,079
Right in my hand.

464
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,200
Just a moment before,

465
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,079
I hadn't even

466
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,440
really thought about my own situation.

467
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,640
But in that instant,

468
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,079
I suddenly realized

469
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
I'm someone with no future,

470
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,799
no prospects.

471
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:37,559
No.

472
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,039
Why do you say you have no future?

473
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,440
You can pay back the penalty money.

474
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,680
Your art will shine.

475
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:48,119
Why worry so much?

476
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,559
I reached out to a classmate from art school.

477
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,000
He

478
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,759
is the most successful among us

479
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,079
in our group right now.

480
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,000
What are you planning?

481
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,079
He just landed a big project.

482
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,359
A huge villa.

483
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,400
He's painting decorative art for the villa.

484
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,480
Are you crazy?

485
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,119
What was all those years of persistence for?

486
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,559
Ming Liang,

487
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,039
let's think of another way, okay?

488
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,359
If you paint a decorative piece,

489
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,039
your art will never sell in your life.

490
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,880
My classmate is a good guy.

491
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,960
He takes a very small commission.

492
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,960
The deposit is generous too.

493
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,279
From now on,

494
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,359
whether it's the restaurant

495
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,759
or at home,

496
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,599
there's always a need for money.

497
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,200
A painting is a painting, isn't it?

498
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,519
You don't know,

499
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,559
Van Gogh tried to sell his art for money.

500
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,000
He couldn't sell any of his paintings.

501
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,720
He wasn't even as successful as me.

502
00:24:59,119 --> 00:24:59,759
Bro,

503
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,559
since you've made up your mind,

504
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,599
then go for it.

505
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,279
Worst case, start over.

506
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,960
We're still young.

507
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,400
You... you know I don't drink.

508
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,759
Fang Tao,

509
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,359
I'm begging you.

510
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,799
Please spare Hong Shiliu.

511
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,720
It has nothing to do with them.

512
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,079
I'm the one who dragged them down.

513
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,000
Okay?

514
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,160
Punish me however you want.

515
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,839
Sue me,

516
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,079
send me to jail if you must.

517
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:58,720
I'll accept it.

518
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,559
Just don't drag them into this.

519
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,799
An Dong,

520
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,960
do you really think I want to ruin you?

521
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,000
You're mistaken.

522
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,000
Back when you had trouble,

523
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,559
many people kicked you when you were down.

524
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:23,559
In front of others and behind your back,

525
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,559
I never said

526
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,079
a single bad word about you, An Dong.

527
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,319
Later, I heard

528
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,839
you made another restaurant a hit in Urumqi.

529
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,839
I was really happy for you.

530
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:32,799
Really.

531
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,960
I'm truly proud of you.

532
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,799
You're not an ordinary guy.

533
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,480
You're a real talent.

534
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,759
I didn't misjudge you.

535
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,559
No, Fang Tao,

536
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,799
if you put it that way,

537
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,160
I really don't understand.

538
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,079
What do you mean?

539
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,759
Let me be honest with you.

540
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,240
My goal isn't just Hong Shiliu.

541
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,960
It includes you, too.

542
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,039
Me.

543
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,559
Right now, except for me,

544
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,240
no one else would trust you.

545
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,559
But I'm willing to give you a platform.

546
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,079
You can fully show your talent.

547
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:11,960
Do you know why?

548
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,640
I value talent.

549
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,680
I cherish it.

550
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,880
And also,

551
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,039
I could give you Hong Shiliu.

552
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,880
We could invest and open branches.

553
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,640
All these places

554
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,559
would be managed by you.

555
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,799
No.

556
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:32,680
Fang... Fang Tao.

557
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,319
Hong Shiliu isn't mine.

558
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,839
It's theirs.

559
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,480
If you give it to me,

560
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,559
what about them?

561
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,279
Winning hearts is hardest.

562
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,759
You won their hearts,

563
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,359
but stabbed them right in it.

564
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,279
You think by doing this,

565
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,599
they'll forgive you?

566
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,880
An Dong,

567
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,200
you chose this path yourself.

568
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,519
How about this:

569
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,480
If you want to keep them, fine.

570
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,960
Just pay them a salary.

571
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,000
But remember this:

572
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,519
I only care about profit.

573
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,119
I'm off to get the money.

574
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,119
Be back before the deadline.

575
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,880
Are you okay?

576
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:12,720
Sorry.

577
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,640
Move your foot.

578
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Get out of the way.

579
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,839
Can't you see I'm mopping?

580
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,599
Filthy thing.

581
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,240
Let me tell you something.

582
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,720
We welcome friends here.

583
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,359
Not wolves like you.

584
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,519
I'm telling you,

585
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,000
you're supposed to run a business.

586
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,640
Is this how you treat guests?

587
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,279
Who are you filming?

588
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm filming you.

589
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:13,599
Who are you filming, huh?

590
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,279
I'm filming you.

591
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:14,839
Is this how you treat customers?

592
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,720
What are you doing?

593
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,960
Who are you filming, huh?

594
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,079
How could I just let it go?

595
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:18,960
Bayar's mom.

596
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,319
No, he...

597
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,640
Don't let the wolf bite back.

598
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,119
Look at him,

599
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,240
smearing our restaurant.

600
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,759
See that?

601
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,680
This place of theirs,

602
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,160
it's a shady business.

603
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,319
What are you doing?

604
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:25,880
Murat.

605
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,119
Come on, come on.

606
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,839
Come, look.

607
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,640
He's got a weapon!

608
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,160
Come on, fight!

609
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,440
Friends,

610
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,880
go

611
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,200
and get An Dong down here.

612
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,000
He brought this guy.

613
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,039
He caused this mess.

614
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:36,960
Let him fix it.

615
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,400
An Dong.

616
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,799
An Dong, come down.

617
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,519
An Dong, come down.

618
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,519
An Dong.

619
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,319
I know where An Dong is.

620
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,680
An Dong ran off.

621
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:49,759
What?

622
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,400
I'll talk to him alone.

623
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,400
What the heck?

624
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,559
What is this?

625
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,559
Look at your staff here.

626
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,599
What kind of manners are these?

627
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,799
It's the age of social media now.

628
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,119
I could post her attitude online.

629
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,039
What will Hong Shiliu do then?

630
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,160
An Dong.

631
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,119
He'll definitely say he went out
to borrow money.

632
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,559
Don't believe a word he says.

633
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,359
He's a master at lying.

634
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,799
I know him all too well.

635
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,960
You all...

636
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,480
picked the wrong person to trust.

637
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:58,319
So, Ming Liang,

638
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,480
I suggest you all

639
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,960
go and sue him right away.

640
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,599
I'm willing to be a witness.

641
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,000
This is an internal matter
of our restaurant.

642
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,639
No need for you to worry about it.

643
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,960
Since your goal is money,

644
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,800
stop bothering us
while we run our business.

645
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
If our business does well,

646
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,599
we can pay you back sooner.

647
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,880
Ming Liang.

648
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,119
With a place like yours,

649
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,400
your turnover...

650
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
can you really pay back my three million?

651
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,519
Let me be honest with you.

652
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,199
The ten days I mentioned

653
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,159
is just time for you to pack up.

654
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,840
You all...

655
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,599
don't need to struggle pointlessly.

656
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,199
In ten days,

657
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,840
this Hong Shiliu restaurant

658
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,480
will definitely belong to me, Fang Tao.

659
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,480
I know.

660
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,119
Ten days.

661
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,039
Thanks for the reminder.

662
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,400
Fine.

663
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,519
This place is actually pretty nice.

664
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,159
When I first came here,

665
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,519
I thought the feng shui was good.

666
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,239
Look,

667
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,199
it's open and airy front and back.

668
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,239
Once this is mine,

669
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,480
I'll have to renovate it.

670
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,039
If you ask me,

671
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:19,800
this...

672
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,119
backyard...

673
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,519
add a few more tables.

674
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,039
Turn all the upstairs rooms
into private dining rooms.

675
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,159
By the way,

676
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,239
you painted this, right?

677
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,800
It looks almost real.

678
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,360
Yes.

679
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,800
They say these paintings

680
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,880
document your journey
as an artist.

681
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,360
Your growth, right?

682
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,559
Save this one for me.

683
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,760
Name your price.

684
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,639
Probably not worth much, right?

685
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,599
Two plates of chicken should cover it.

686
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,239
Oh, and...

687
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,719
your free meal table.

688
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:53,519
That's a clever move.

689
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,360
You're a smart kid.

690
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,159
No,

691
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,400
you're a sly one.

692
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,800
A serving of A'isha's Pilaf
costs so little.

693
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,639
This gimmick of yours is pretty good.

694
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,960
You play the emotional card,

695
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:06,079
and attract customers.

696
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:06,559
Right?

697
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,119
I plan to use this idea too.

698
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,960
And also...

699
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,000
this pomegranate tree in the yard.

700
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,599
It's such an eyesore.

701
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,679
Takes up too much space.

702
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,920
It needs to be chopped down.

703
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,519
Dig a pool right there.

704
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Soaking in the bath,

705
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,840
eating naan,

706
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,360
and scrubbing away.

707
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,920
This is my home.

708
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,639
It's not your place to boss me around.

709
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,519
In ten days,

710
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,039
this will belong to me, Fang Tao.

711
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,679
I'll do whatever I want with it.

712
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,119
What?

713
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:33,639
What's wrong?

714
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:34,719
What are you trying to do?

715
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:35,400
Dad.

716
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,239
Murat, Dad.

717
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:45,039
He's just trying to provoke us.

718
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,360
Let's not stoop to his level.

719
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,599
If he ruins us,

720
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,639
the restaurant will really be his.

721
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,400
The deadbeat is hitting people!

722
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,360
What are you doing?

723
00:36:59,480 --> 00:36:59,960
Fang Tao!

724
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,639
I'm warning you.

725
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,559
If you want mutual destruction,

726
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,400
I'll go down with you.

727
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,519
Mutual destruction?

728
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,239
Keep dreaming.

729
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,880
Let me tell you,

730
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,920
the net won't break even if the fish dies.

731
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,440
You... you...

732
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,960
If you won't let me be comfortable,

733
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,159
I won't let you have it easy either.

734
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,519
What kind of place is this?

735
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,079
You...

736
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,599
Closing up!

737
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,400
Crooked restaurant!

738
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,760
Don't come here anymore!

739
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,559
It's closed!

740
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,800
Crooked restaurant, hitting people!

741
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,360
I'll pay An Dong's money.

742
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:34,880
If I can't pay you on time,

743
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,639
the restaurant is yours.

744
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,519
Alright.

745
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,280
Well said.

746
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,760
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

747
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,400
I've recorded the whole thing.

748
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,199
Okay.

749
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,000
My back...

750
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,440
Let's close for a few days and rest.

751
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,679
Everyone's been tired lately.

752
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,079
Come on.

753
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,239
This...

754
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,760
is what our family pooled together.

755
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,360
This is from me and Ming Liang.

756
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,400
Bro.

757
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,199
I've transferred the recent dividends

758
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,360
and some cash I had on me

759
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,679
all to you.

760
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,679
At critical moments,

761
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,400
we still rely on the old hands.

762
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,039
Here...

763
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,599
is eight hundred sixty thousand.

764
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,639
Take it.

765
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,599
Old Murat,

766
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,920
when did you ever have so much money?

767
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,119
I didn't want to reveal it,

768
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,280
but I had no choice.

769
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,119
Today, I'm coming clean.

770
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,639
I've always been a secret rich man.

771
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,559
This money

772
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,840
for this street's

773
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,079
first ladle

774
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,199
is nothing.

775
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:10,840
Thank you.

776
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,000
Thank you all.

777
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,559
I'll take it all.

778
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,599
Guys,

779
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,079
keep your heads up.

780
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
This is just a small thing.

781
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,159
It can't bring down us old folks.

782
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,400
Cheer up.

783
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:31,840
Alright?

784
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,280
Right.

785
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,159
Everyone, lift your heads.

786
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,239
It's fine.

787
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,199
We're family.

788
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,719
Nothing can defeat us.

789
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,559
A'isha,

790
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,679
We've lived half our lives already.

791
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,360
This restaurant—

792
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,960
thirty years of ups and downs.

793
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,519
All kinds of people, all kinds of things—

794
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,719
we've seen it all.

795
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,639
As long as we're together,

796
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,079
and our hearts stay close,

797
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,920
no hardship can defeat us.

798
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:02,079
Yes.

799
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,800
Did you hear that?

800
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,239
That's too much.

801
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,559
We're still short a little over one million.

802
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,360
I bet Murat and Bayar

803
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,000
even chipped in the last bit.

804
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,880
You should leave some for them.

805
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,840
Everyone still needs to live.

806
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,199
Mom,

807
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,079
Nana gave me a card too.

808
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,599
But unless I have no choice,

809
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,039
I don't want to use it.

810
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,079
I understand.

811
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,960
There will always be a way.

812
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:51,840
But you—

813
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,559
how did you save so much?

814
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,199
Your son used to be

815
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:59,400
a top teacher at the training school.

816
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,800
The hourly pay was high.

817
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,079
I was afraid you'd be wronged.

818
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:07,960
I won't, Mom.

819
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:09,960
I'm just curious—

820
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,639
Murat's dad,

821
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:14,400
where did he get all that money?

822
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,119
Yeah.

823
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:18,480
He's the kind of person

824
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,679
who doesn't spend much.

825
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,960
But—

826
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,679
he paid the down payment for his eldest son.

827
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
He shouldn't have much left.

828
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,280
Murat's dad—

829
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,639
over eight hundred thousand.

830
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,199
And Bayar's mom—

831
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,199
Honestly, holding this money

832
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,719
makes me uneasy.

833
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,280
If you don't take it,

834
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,639
Bayar and Murat will feel worse.

835
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,000
Especially Murat.

836
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,800
A hero all his life—

837
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,719
he's not just helping you,

838
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,679
he's also helping Ankar.

839
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,559
If you don't let him pay,

840
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,519
he'll regret it forever.

841
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,920
So many people drift apart

842
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,599
because of money.

843
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,079
But our family,

844
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:04,960
because we have none,

845
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,800
we've grown even closer.

846
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,639
As the old saying goes,

847
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,480
life is made by people,

848
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,559
not by money.

849
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,079
A family—

850
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,000
hearts united,

851
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,840
strength together—

852
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,440
that's stronger than anything.

853
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,159
Darn it, I'll go check.
