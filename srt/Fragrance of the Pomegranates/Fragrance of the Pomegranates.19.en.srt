1
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,280
So many paintings

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:05,919
There's no room for them at home

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,560
If there's no space, hold an exhibition

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,480
Right, we can do it now

5
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,879
Then, Secretary, let's begin

6
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,199
Alright

7
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:15,599
Come on

8
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,240
Stop, stop, stop

9
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,039
Everyone, stop right now

10
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,039
No filming allowed

11
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,719
Secretary Xu

12
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,599
Why did you ask him to film?

13
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,120
Is he even worthy to promote our Etles

14
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
silk?

15
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,039
Grandma Parida

16
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,520
This Secretary has worked in our village

17
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,680
for so many years

18
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,360
and contributed so much to the Green Barrier

19
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:35,840
I think

20
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,439
I don't care what he's done

21
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,080
He's just an old liar

22
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,520
Sister, you can't say that

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,879
Besides

24
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,560
in front of these young people

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,560
you should speak responsibly

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,319
Responsibly?

27
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,439
Fine

28
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,879
Let me ask you

29
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,159
Have you ever worn Etles silk before?

30
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,800
You've never worn it

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
How can you promote it?

32
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,879
Isn't that being a fraud?

33
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,199
Who says I haven't worn it?

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,919
I have worn it

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,879
You, you all, look

36
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,879
Look, look, look

37
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,439
See? See?

38
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,080
Did you see?

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,159
Did you see the patch?

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,280
My sock was torn

41
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,080
I picked up some fabric scraps at our workshop

42
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,000
and sewed them on

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,400
Isn't this Etles I'm wearing?

44
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,360
You used our beautiful Etles

45
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
as a patch?

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Secretary Xu

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,520
This cooperative

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,080
was started by me and everyone

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,759
I don't agree to him filming

50
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,680
If you insist on letting him film

51
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:35,879
from now on

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
I won't handle

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,360
cooperative matters anymore

54
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,280
Three-Egg Delight

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,000
is made from goose eggs, pigeon eggs

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
and free-range chicken yolks, baked together

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,560
Then add honey, spices

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,439
and saffron inside

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,199
Thank you, thank you, thank you

60
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,079
Try it quickly

61
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,920
Careful, it's hot

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,079
It's soft

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,639
It's sweet

64
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,519
The taste is quite unique

65
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,759
Liu

66
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,319
Mr. Fang, you wanted to see me

67
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,920
Liu, hurry up

68
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,079
Come, have a seat

69
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,360
About investing in new branches

70
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,079
Have you thought it over?

71
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,759
Let me tell you some good news

72
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,600
As long as we keep investing in branches

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,240
business will keep getting better

74
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,079
Once franchise fees come in from all channels

75
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,800
Liu, you'll just be counting money every day

76
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,959
But I heard Anton is back

77
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,920
I'm still worried about legal risks

78
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,920
Liu, you know

79
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,199
it's just a small matter

80
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,759
I've explained it over and over

81
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,079
how many times have I told you?

82
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,319
Why can't you understand?

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,680
Let me put it this way

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,759
Even if we don't invest or open branches

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Anton and Mingliang

86
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,480
won't compete with us

87
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,040
and won't sue us

88
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,639
So

89
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
if we keep investing in branches now

90
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,600
that's the best strategy

91
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,240
Before they take action

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,759
we can quickly squeeze out

93
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,639
Hong Shiliu's brand value

94
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,480
and maximize our profits

95
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:03,639
Of course

96
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,079
we must act fast

97
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,519
and invest heavily

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,199
Before they react

99
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,480
we'll completely defeat Hong Shiliu

100
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,040
We can fully take

101
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,519
all the benefits from the brand

102
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,199
Once their store closes

103
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,040
what will they sue for?

104
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,519
So

105
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,759
continuing to invest in branches now

106
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,759
is the safest bet

107
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,000
Liu

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,079
your habit of avoiding problems

109
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,879
you really need to change it

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,439
Alright

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
I'll follow your lead

112
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,759
Mulati's dad

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,439
Mulati's dad

114
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,319
Stop for a moment

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,000
There's something only you can help with

116
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:57,759
Okay

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,759
Let's go, alright

118
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,920
This is the furnished apartment bought by Guangtian's family

119
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
He was supposed to come back these days

120
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,879
so we added some furniture

121
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,319
But his parents weren't happy

122
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,240
They said

123
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,879
What do you mean?

124
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,120
His parents weren't happy

125
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,240
Give me his parents' contact info

126
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,079
I'll talk to them myself

127
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,680
No, no

128
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,759
That's not it, Mulati's dad

129
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,360
It's because over there

130
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,519
they have customs

131
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,000
When moving into a new home

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,120
you must warm the house first

133
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
Their way of warming the house is special

134
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
You have to light the stove first

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,079
After the house is fully warmed

136
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,439
life will be prosperous

137
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,199
I see, I understand

138
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,240
Don't worry

139
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,560
My dad and I will light the stove

140
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,000
No one is more professional than us

141
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,560
But

142
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,800
It takes at least three months

143
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,920
Guang Tian is always busy with work.

144
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,879
You all know that.

145
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
I can't cook at all.

146
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,680
If I start cooking,

147
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,680
I'll probably set the house on fire.

148
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,680
I was thinking,

149
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,199
maybe my parents could help.

150
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,560
But my dad has a new task at the factory.

151
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,519
And my mom needs to look after him.

152
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,759
So...

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
only you guys can help me out.

154
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,879
Ankar,

155
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,680
it's just a small favor.

156
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,879
You won't say no to your big sis, right?

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Mulati Dad,

158
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,919
I'll take that as a yes from you.

159
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,799
I knew you care about me the most.

160
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,679
With all you kids around,

161
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,679
Mulati Dad is truly

162
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
the happiest person.

163
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,799
I'm heading to work now.

164
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,519
You guys tidy up first.

165
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,879
Sis,

166
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,759
don't worry.

167
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,440
With my dad and me here,

168
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,360
everything will be cheerful.

169
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,000
We'll make your home lively and thriving.

170
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,879
Did you send the big sis away on purpose

171
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,240
just to bring me here?

172
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,759
Secretary, we know how much you care about the co-op.

173
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,240
We've all seen it.

174
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,960
We've always wanted

175
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,840
to invite you to visit.

176
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,240
Wait, something's off.

177
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,559
Why are these all old machines?

178
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,080
Where's the new loom?

179
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,639
Over here.

180
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,120
Listen.

181
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,679
Just listen.

182
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,279
The sound of new and old looms

183
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,879
weaving together like this—

184
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,799
isn't it better than Beethoven's symphony?

185
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,200
Wonderful.

186
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,759
When it comes to management,

187
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,480
you're more professional than me.

188
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,600
In design,

189
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,200
you're better than me.

190
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,399
For promotion,

191
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,799
our little Secretary Xu

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,399
is a real expert.

193
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,360
And when it comes to

194
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,480
selling products,

195
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,399
selling online,

196
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,919
in this area,

197
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,279
you're the one—

198
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,600
everything I couldn't finish,

199
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,840
you all got it done.

200
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,519
Secretary, you're too kind.

201
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,360
Secretary,

202
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,519
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

203
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Since I came back,

204
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,320
my mom's been dyeing this

205
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,799
for two years now.

206
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,519
But she hasn't finished a single piece.

207
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,879
Back when our co-op's business

208
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,759
wasn't so good,

209
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,240
she had plenty of time.

210
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,720
But now,

211
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,799
the co-op is busy again.

212
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,360
And she's the master artisan.

213
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:32,759
I'm worried

214
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,440
she's putting all her energy into this.

215
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,679
She might get overwhelmed.

216
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,759
Secretary,

217
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,440
I remember since you started working,

218
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,399
you've always kept logs.

219
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,080
Especially of the patterns our co-op made.

220
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,039
You should have samples saved.

221
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,480
Take a good look.

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,960
This silk thread—

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
have you seen it anywhere before?

224
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,840
Are you all really curious?

225
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,360
We're all neighbors here.

226
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,360
Big sis,

227
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,759
why aren't you talking to me?

228
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,399
Parida Mom,

229
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,000
just keep weaving with this color.

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Maybe it'll turn out right as you go.

231
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,639
Will it?

232
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,279
When I was learning from you,

233
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,399
once,

234
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,080
I wove a piece of silk I really loved.

235
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
It was just a small piece.

236
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,600
Later,

237
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,799
I tried to make the same one,

238
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,039
but I just couldn't.

239
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,159
You said

240
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,840
there are no two identical leaves in the world.

241
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,720
And no two Etles silks are the same.

242
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,600
So why do you

243
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,840
insist on recreating that one in your heart?

244
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,559
Maybe I'm not restoring the pattern,

245
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,759
but the time itself.

246
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,919
If I could go back,

247
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,240
I would

248
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,279
talk to her properly.

249
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,919
She had to be out there alone—

250
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,639
how much hardship did she endure?

251
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,279
Even something as big as divorce,

252
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,240
she never told me about it.

253
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
During that time,

254
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,080
how did she get through it?

255
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,360
Aisha,

256
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,759
I haven't been a good mother.

257
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,279
Back then, your mom

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,120
wanted you to carry on her craft.

259
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,879
As a mother, I understand that.

260
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,279
She just cares deeply for her child.

261
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,879
Going so far away for school—

262
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:48,879
As for me,

263
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,720
I thought at the time,

264
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,519
since you got into such a good college,

265
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,120
and your major

266
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,159
was related to silk,

267
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,879
after graduation,

268
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,759
you could come back and help our cooperative.

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,639
So,

270
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,480
I convinced your mom.

271
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,639
She agreed.

272
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,679
It's all my fault.

273
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,279
I shouldn't have

274
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,639
hurt her feelings.

275
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,519
I insisted on staying in Jiangsu.

276
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,960
Alright, let's not talk about this.

277
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,639
It's in the past.

278
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,120
Let's move on.

279
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
So Hatiman came back after her divorce.

280
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,559
Grandma Parida

281
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,519
saw her daughter unhappy,

282
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,120
and that's why she broke ties with you.

283
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,399
Secretary,

284
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,279
I'm sorry to you.

285
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,600
You took the blame for me.

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,120
No, no, no.

287
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,240
About this matter,

288
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,399
I feel guilty too.

289
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,759
Back then,

290
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,600
I should've gone to Jiangsu to see.

291
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,000
I should've checked things for you.

292
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,639
I should've met that person.

293
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,240
That person, his name is—

294
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,279
Anton.

295
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,720
Anton, yes.

296
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,759
Honestly,

297
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,960
it's not Hatiman's fault.

298
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,840
My mom and I

299
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,600
were moved by him too.

300
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,600
Hatiman,

301
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,919
as long as Mom is here,

302
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
it's never too late.

303
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,759
That's well said.

304
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,320
Let's go to the village committee.

305
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,559
I have some old logs there.

306
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,120
I'll get them for you.

307
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:28,679
Okay.

308
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:30,320
By the way,

309
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,240
the silk your mom wove for you—

310
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,759
Etles silk.

311
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,279
It's called The Rainbow's Promise.

312
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,759
Come, Secretary.

313
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,639
There are so many here.

314
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,440
Since I was in my twenties as group leader,

315
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,639
I kept records until I retired.

316
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,559
It's been forty years.

317
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,840
I'll have Xiao Ai

318
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,120
call the committee members over.

319
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,039
No need, no need.

320
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,679
Everyone's busy.

321
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,799
Let's just handle this ourselves.

322
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:14,600
Alright.

323
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,759
Let's go inside and take a look.

324
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,840
January 7

325
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,519
Kaiser’s eldest son, Taji, studies well.

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,840
He ranked first in the school this term.

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,720
Kaiser always hopes

328
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,120
Taji will come home to help with beekeeping.

329
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,039
He worries it’ll affect their income.

330
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,360
We need to talk to Kaiser again.

331
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,960
Secretary,

332
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,559
Secretary,

333
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,360
Is this Taji the township’s

334
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,000
senior middle school teacher, Mr. Taji?

335
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,120
The one you’re looking at

336
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,240
is from 1993.

337
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,480
You need to look for

338
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,880
the ones from 2004 and 2005.

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,480
Okay.

340
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,880
February 13

341
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,440
Daniel’s family lost thirty-seven sheep

342
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,839
to a sandstorm.

343
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,079
His family was already struggling.

344
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,599
This loss is huge for them.

345
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,640
We need to find a way to help.

346
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,240
The Rainbow's Promise

347
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
September 7

348
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:01,799
Parida

349
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,599
is weaving a peacock blue silk lately.

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,079
It’s threaded with many colors.

351
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,119
It’s incredibly beautiful.

352
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,519
It’s the best Etles silk I’ve seen.

353
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,440
Sadly, some parts are hard to see.

354
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:17,240
Maybe ask Mingliang for help.

355
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,839
I keep thinking

356
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,680
even if Grandma Parida wanted to weave a rainbow,

357
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,279
she wouldn’t make it look like a rainbow.

358
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,720
Think about it—

359
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,359
rainbows come after storms.

360
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,960
It’s her wish for her daughter.

361
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,359
That’s why she wanted

362
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,599
to finish weaving it so quickly.

363
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,720
For Hatiman.

364
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,039
Maybe she saw something

365
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,119
that reminded her of a rainbow.

366
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,519
Or maybe

367
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,839
something

368
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,000
with colors and lines like a rainbow.

369
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,039
Glossy Ibis

370
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,960
Glossy Ibis

371
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,279
is a very rare bird.

372
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,319
The birdwatching group saw it at Hetian Reservoir.

373
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,920
Grandma Parida has seen it.

374
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,240
But it’s not common.

375
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,519
So she forgot about it.

376
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,519
Let me show you a picture.

377
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:16,920
Okay.

378
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,240
Glossy Ibis

379
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:23,519
Look—

380
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,039
when the Glossy Ibis is still,

381
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,920
its feathers are deep chestnut.

382
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,880
But when it flies,

383
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,319
in the sunlight,

384
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,519
it shines with a peacock blue sheen

385
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,039
and many other colors too.

386
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,279
Come in.

387
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,279
Old Secretary.

388
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,240
This...

389
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,200
Busy right now.

390
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,759
I happen to have time now.

391
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,240
I archived your notes.

392
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,440
Did you need something?

393
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,480
There’s no one else here.

394
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,240
I wanted to chat with you.

395
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,400
Sure, of course.

396
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,039
Come, have a seat.

397
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,039
Come on, please sit.

398
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,720
Well...

399
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,240
Secretary Xu,

400
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,519
You’ve been in our village

401
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,400
for quite some time now, right?

402
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,319
Yes.

403
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,279
Over two months.

404
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,720
When your team first arrived,

405
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,680
back then,

406
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,559
First of all,

407
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,839
I welcomed you warmly.

408
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,480
But,

409
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,839
in my heart,

410
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,039
I had some doubts.

411
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,039
I kept wondering,

412
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,599
how long you’d stay,

413
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,559
what you could do,

414
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,599
what impact you’d have.

415
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,960
Take you, for example—

416
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,640
You came in all fired up,

417
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,400
wanting to expand our cooperative

418
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,759
right away.

419
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,559
That made me worry.

420
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,759
Would this work?

421
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,240
I just want our village

422
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,799
to truly...

423
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,240
You care about our villagers.

424
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,839
I’ve really seen that.

425
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,839
And I remember it.

426
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,039
Secretary Xu,

427
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,599
in a couple of days,

428
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,720
I’ll be heading to the Green Barrier.

429
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,240
This village

430
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,480
is in your hands now.

431
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,160
I’m leaving it to you.

432
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,000
I trust you completely.

433
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,000
Me, I’m the type

434
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,359
who’s a bit shy.

435
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,200
Sometimes,

436
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,240
if you ask me to thank you

437
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,599
in front of everyone,

438
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:53,960
I...

439
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,000
I just can’t say it.

440
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,759
No need to.

441
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,319
Today,

442
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:00,960
with no one else around,

443
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,200
just the two of us,

444
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,480
I want to thank you.

445
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,680
I...

446
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,599
on behalf of our village,

447
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,519
four hundred and five families,

448
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,039
one thousand eight hundred seventy-nine people,

449
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,599
thank you.

450
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,160
Thank you.

451
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,440
Secretary Xu.

452
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,400
Old Secretary.

453
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,319
No, no, please.

454
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,839
I really can’t accept this.

455
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,000
Old Secretary,

456
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:41,160
don’t worry.

457
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,960
This is my village too.

458
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,519
Thank you.

459
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,400
Is this the right one?

460
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,440
Yes.

461
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,759
That’s it.

462
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,160
I thought before I died,

463
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,799
I’d never find it again.

464
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,200
How did you manage it?

465
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,839
Yes.

466
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,039
Old Secretary told me.

467
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,000
He...

468
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:30,680
Mom.

469
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,039
I know what you mean.

470
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,279
Please don’t worry about me.

471
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:37,359
Actually,

472
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,319
I’ve wanted to come back for a long time.

473
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,720
I want to return to our cooperative.

474
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,440
After divorcing Anton,

475
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,680
I figured out a lot.

476
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
And let go of many things.

477
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,559
Mom, don’t worry about me.

478
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,720
I’m really happy.

479
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,400
Good morning, Old Secretary.

480
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,599
Elder Sister.

481
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,279
You wanted to see me?

482
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,759
Don’t you love looking pretty?

483
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,519
Here, take this.

484
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,599
The Rainbow’s Promise.

485
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,000
Yes.

486
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,720
Old Secretary led the villagers

487
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,559
to plant trees at the desert’s edge for thirty years.

488
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,160
Many others did the same.

489
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,559
Together, they wove a green scarf.

490
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,200
Encircling the edge of the Taklamakan Desert.

491
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,079
They held it back.

492
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,279
Old Secretary and the others wove a scarf for the desert.

493
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,079
Grandma Parida.

494
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,960
She also made a scarf for Old Secretary.

495
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,160
The Green Barrier project was completed last winter.

496
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,000
Next is expanding the green in the desert.

497
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,519
This green scarf will keep getting thicker.

498
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,480
So the “Sea of Death” will never spread.

499
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,799
I brought you some cookies, bread, and beef jerky.

500
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,200
And some naan and other things.

501
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,000
Eat when you get hungry.

502
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,519
Remember to drink plenty of water.

503
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,839
It’s very dry there.

504
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,519
Don’t get dehydrated.

505
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,599
And the altitude is high.

506
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,680
Okay.

507
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,480
And this—

508
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,000
I used my own Etles design

509
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,319
to make you a headband.

510
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,000
Tie it on me.

511
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,000
Alright.

512
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
When you’re near the Kunlun Mountains,

513
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,000
call me to let me know you’re safe.

514
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:27,839
Be careful on the road.

515
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,359
It’s just a species survey.

516
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,359
It’s not far from here.

517
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,319
Same place we rescued the Legend last time.

518
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
There’s no signal in the mountains.

519
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,680
Just be careful anyway.

520
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,960
Don’t push yourself, okay?

521
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,440
Okay.

522
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:52,839
It’s beautiful.

523
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,319
Mingliang.

524
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,799
I think I kind of like

525
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,160
being fussed over and cared for now.

526
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,960
I’ve already

527
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,400
gotten used to not being alone.

528
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,519
Last time, I was wrong.

529
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,880
I made you sad.

530
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,160
Next time...

531
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,960
There won’t be a next time.

532
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,200
No more.

533
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,079
It definitely won’t happen again.

534
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,559
I'm heading out now.

535
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,160
Once Xu Lai and I ship the first batch,

536
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,680
I'll come pick you up.

537
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,519
Then I'll wait for you.

538
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,599
What are you up to?

539
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,279
You've done

540
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,839
quite a few bad things lately, right?

541
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,799
Well,

542
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,559
Paying your debts is only fair.

543
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,519
It's not wrong for me to ask you to pay up, is it?

544
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,680
No, it's not.

545
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,039
Didn't we already settle our accounts?

546
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:35,720
Yeah.

547
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,039
You know what kind of person Fang Tao is.

548
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,559
You should be clear about that.

549
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,079
Aren't you afraid

550
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,599
he'll sell you out?

551
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,119
And you'll still help him count the money?

552
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,400
Look at how far you've fallen.

553
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,000
What right do you have to judge me?

554
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:49,839
What right do I have?

555
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,559
I have Hong Shiliu restaurant.

556
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:55,359
All my friends support and trust me.

557
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,000
I have my ex-wife.

558
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,480
She can help me pay off my debts.

559
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,440
What about you?

560
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,160
We met at a dinner party.

561
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,200
You sat at the very end.

562
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,759
All timid and nervous.

563
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,079
You didn't dare say a word.

564
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,519
Not until the dinner ended

565
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,519
and I was already leaving,

566
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,039
did you chase after me.

567
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,240
You asked if you could

568
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,559
invest two hundred thousand with me.

569
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,079
Two hundred thousand.

570
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,799
I know

571
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,200
you've always looked down on me.

572
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,480
I didn't care about that money.

573
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,799
But you said something

574
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,240
that moved me.

575
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,000
You said that two hundred thousand

576
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
was all you had.

577
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,160
But hear me out,

578
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,240
I wanted to take a chance.

579
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,640
To bet on my daughter's future.

580
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,440
My daughter, Yaya,

581
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,519
has always wanted to study law.

582
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,079
She wants to be a top prosecutor.

583
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,759
What are you trying to say?

584
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,920
If she has a father like you,

585
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,839
one with a stain on his record,

586
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,920
all her years of hard work

587
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,519
would be wasted.

588
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,519
Are you threatening me?

589
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,400
That's all I can say.

590
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,599
What you do next

591
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,799
is up to you.

592
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,839
Erni's new phone number.

593
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,519
Erni.

594
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,160
Come on.

595
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,559
Alright.

596
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,960
Hello, Mr. Qian.

597
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,720
Yes.

598
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,599
We're loading the truck now.

599
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,400
That's right.

600
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Both orders are ready.

601
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
We'll ship them as soon as we're done.

602
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,039
Alright.

603
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Our cooperative

604
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,400
is shipping this much at once for the first time.

605
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,480
Okay.

606
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,319
Go, next one.

607
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,319
That's fine, that's fine.

608
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:37,200
Alright, alright.

609
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,960
Get that one, get that one.

610
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:46,440
Come on.

611
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,400
Xiao Ai, send a bit more from here.

612
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,039
Send a bit over there.

613
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:48,559
Alright.

614
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:48,960
Come on.

615
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,759
Send a bit, come on.

616
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:56,759
Li Zhe.

617
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,680
Are you alright, Secretary?

618
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,480
I'm fine, I'm fine.

619
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,240
Sorry, I didn't see it.

620
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,039
Nana.

621
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,599
Hold on tight.

622
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,119
Nana.

623
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,440
Hold on.

624
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,079
Hold on to me.

625
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,920
Hope we get to work together again.

626
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,199
Wishing you both happiness.

627
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,280
I mean it.

628
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,239
Hope you get what you truly want.

629
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,599
I'm leaving.

630
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,119
Take care.

631
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,400
Nana.

632
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,000
Are you okay?

633
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,119
I'm fine.

634
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,199
How about you?

635
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:20,679
Are you alright?

636
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,519
Just a few scrapes.

637
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:22,639
It's nothing.

638
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,480
I'm fine, really.

639
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,519
And you?

640
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,519
I'm fine too.

641
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,199
Did you hurt your leg?

642
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,039
Oh my gosh.

643
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,960
Let me take care of it quickly.

644
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,719
It might hurt a little.

645
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,599
Alright, alright, come here.

646
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,280
Wait a second.

647
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,880
Darn it.

648
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,000
The satellite phone is broken.

649
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,920
How do we get up there?

650
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,880
There's another way we can go.

651
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,519
About

652
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,679
four hours and we'll get there.

653
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:41,880
Can you make it?

654
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:42,719
No problem.

655
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,320
The sandstorm is too strong.

656
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,400
Let's take cover for now.

657
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,000
Lawyer Tian.

658
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,440
None of these will work?

659
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,199
Young man,

660
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,000
don't rush.

661
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,199
I promise

662
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,400
I'll do my best.

663
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,000
So, Lawyer Tian,

664
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,000
um,

665
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,800
what do you need us to do?

666
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,280
Just tell us.

667
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,679
We'll fully cooperate.

668
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,079
Now, as for physical evidence,

669
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,400
it's all complete.

670
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,079
If we can find more witnesses,

671
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,159
the judge

672
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,079
will better understand our restaurant.

673
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,320
It'll help the case.

674
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,119
Witnesses.

675
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:45,800
Right.

676
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,159
Ankar.

677
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,480
Some things next

678
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,840
will depend on you.

679
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,159
Nana, I'm heading out.

680
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,159
Nana, where are you now?

681
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,039
Nana, I still haven't heard back from you.

682
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,679
Are you okay?

683
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,280
The mountain weather is harsh, with sudden incidents.

684
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,280
We can't enter the mountain right now.

685
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,840
Captain Han.

686
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,599
Two missing staff from the species survey team

687
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:39,159
have not been found yet.

688
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,199
You can't go in.

689
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,519
Stop right there.

690
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,119
Emergency Command Center.

691
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,159
This is Kunlun Mountain.

692
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,920
Frontline Rescue Temporary Command Post.

693
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,440
Current situation update.

694
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,559
Received. Go ahead.

695
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,119
The pass where the missing fell

696
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,920
Wind speed has reached level nine.

697
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,639
To ensure everyone's safety,

698
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,400
all team members have been withdrawn.

699
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,440
Due to strong winds and heavy dust,

700
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,880
drones cannot take off.

701
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:15,519
The search and rescue mission is suspended.

702
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,840
Suspended.

703
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:24,679
Hello.

704
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,320
I'm Captain Han Xu.

705
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,639
Are you Gulinare's family?

706
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,280
Where is Nana?

707
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,599
I need to find her.

708
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,880
I need to find her.

709
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,519
No.

710
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:36,079
I told you,

711
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,360
you can't go over there.

712
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,559
Let me go!

713
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,400
Comrade.

714
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:40,800
Comrade.

715
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:41,800
Calm down.

716
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,960
I understand how you feel,

717
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,440
but the weather won't allow entry now.

718
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,519
How can I calm down?

719
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,440
If you go into the mountain now,

720
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,480
not only can't you save her,

721
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,840
you'll put yourself in danger too.

722
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,079
You're not saving her,

723
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,440
you're putting her at risk.

724
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,679
Wait until we bring her back,

725
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,039
and if something happens to you,

726
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,920
how will she live the rest of her life?

727
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,400
Ming Liang.

728
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,119
Ming Liang.

729
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,599
You're awake so soon.

730
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,880
You barely slept a few minutes.

731
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:11,480
Come.

732
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,360
Have some water.

733
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,719
The wind has eased.

734
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,280
Yes.

735
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,800
We're preparing to go in for rescue.

736
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,880
I'll go with you.

737
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,400
No.

738
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,559
The wind is still very strong.

739
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,239
Drones can't take off for positioning.

740
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,280
I'll have someone take you to a nearby village to rest.

741
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,920
Wait for news.

742
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:29,679
Captain! Captain!

743
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,360
There's a snow leopard!

744
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,440
All team members,

745
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,960
return to the camp area immediately.

746
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,599
Logistics team,

747
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,000
light campfires near the camp.

748
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:35,960
To keep the snow leopard away.

749
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,639
Wild animals rarely come down to the entrance.

750
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,960
That's Nana's hairband.

751
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:02,960
It's

752
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,360
Legend.

753
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,920
Legend.

754
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:15,039
Leg—

755
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,480
You can't go. It's too dangerous.

756
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,679
It's the snow leopard Nana saved.

757
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,239
It knows where Nana is.

758
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,400
It seems to want to lead me to her.

759
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,639
I said you can't go. It's too dangerous.

760
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,280
Captain.

761
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,079
Please let me go with you.

762
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,920
I'll follow all your orders.

763
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,480
I usually sketch outdoors.

764
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,880
I have some outdoor experience.

765
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,119
And if I don't go,

766
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,719
it might not recognize anyone else.

767
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,400
Mom, where are you going?

768
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,440
Mom is going to Kunlun Mountain to be a fairy.

769
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,559
Can I come find you then?

770
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,000
Wait until you grow up.

771
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,159
It'll be fine when you grow up.

772
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,119
Nana.
