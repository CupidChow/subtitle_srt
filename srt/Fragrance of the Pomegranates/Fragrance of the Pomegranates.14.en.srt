1
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,160
Ming Liang

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,480
Mom

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,879
Mom, look.

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,399
Does my drawing look real?

5
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,640
It does.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,200
My little magic artist.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,840
Mom, look.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
I drew Dad.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,479
This way, Dad can be with us.

10
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,439
This soup is pretty good.

11
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,560
The lamb Ming Liang bought

12
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,360
is really nice.

13
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,479
The stewed lamb soup is fresh too.

14
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,759
Not greasy at all.

15
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,639
Exactly.

16
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,199
It's good.

17
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,599
Ankar

18
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,080
Where did he run off to again?

19
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,960
That young and ambitious lad in his twenties—

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,919
who doesn't have a wild heart?

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
Weren't you young once?

22
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,240
Ankar's doing well.

23
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,879
He works hard in the kitchen.

24
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,960
Never slacks off.

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,439
So young,

26
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,039
already made it to sous chef with you.

27
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,319
Anyway,

28
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,159
he's better than you were at his age.

29
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,039
He was much better a few days ago.

30
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,199
But look at him now.

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,960
He's a young and ambitious lad.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,000
You should let him go out and explore.

33
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,280
Let him see the world.

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Get some life experience.

35
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,280
It'll help him find a wife later.

36
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,599
He's not that young anymore.

37
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,960
I've been thinking about this too.

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,800
Our old house

39
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,000
is getting a renovation.

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,159
Then,

41
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,639
it'll be his wedding home.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
My previous savings

43
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,520
went to his brother's down payment.

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,159
From now on,

45
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,039
he's on his own.

46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,840
You see,

47
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
our restaurant business is getting better.

48
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,599
At this rate, in less than two years

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,400
we'll save up for another house.

50
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,560
And get Ankar a wife.

51
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,840
He—

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
will never understand our efforts.

53
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,759
You know,

54
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,759
parents build ladders for their kids

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,879
so they can climb higher

56
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,759
and climb steady.

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,439
If kids always look back at their parents,

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,400
it's not always good.

59
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,840
Aisha

60
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,319
If Ankar were half as good as Ming Liang—

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,479
You, you—

62
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,800
There you go again, see?

63
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,680
Ankar didn't just run off.

64
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,000
He went out with An Dong.

65
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,479
He told me before he left.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,800
He should be back soon.

67
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm back.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,839
Mom, I'm back.

69
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,560
You're back, Ming Liang.

70
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,360
Ming Liang, you must be tired from driving.

71
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Take a break.

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,279
I'm fine.

73
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,079
I thought you'd be back this afternoon.

74
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,279
I told Ankar.

75
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,240
Didn't he tell you?

76
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,000
No, he didn't.

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,600
The lamb's good, right?

78
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,279
Good? It's

79
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,399
excellent.

80
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,920
That soup is delicious.

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,560
It's still hot.

82
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,160
Come on, come on, you worked hard.

83
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,639
Come, come.

84
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,199
Let me, let me.

85
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:46,680
Come on, give it to me.

86
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,959
Go, go.

87
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,839
When will the money be transferred?

88
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,959
I really need the money now.

89
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,959
I've thought of a way

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
to pay you back in full

91
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,040
and

92
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,519
even give you a bit extra.

93
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,240
Can we stop beating around the bush?

94
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,800
Just say your terms.

95
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:21,959
Alright.

96
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,079
The condition is—

97
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,639
we adjust the repayment method.

98
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,360
Okay?

99
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,399
I won't pay you all at once.

100
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,600
I'll pay in installments.

101
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,360
A portion each month.

102
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,680
Paid off within a year.

103
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,240
How's that?

104
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,920
Can you stop stalling like this?

105
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,399
You lost everything yourself,

106
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,439
and want to ruin my family too?

107
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,079
Is that it?

108
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,240
No.

109
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,399
How do I explain this to you?

110
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,560
Let me be honest with you.

111
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,399
I'm opening a new branch.

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,680
I need working capital.

113
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
So I can't

114
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
pay you all at once.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,279
So I'll pay you monthly.

116
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:03,680
Alright?

117
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,439
My business will definitely do well.

118
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,800
I'll give you extra then.

119
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,279
Consider it interest.

120
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,839
Fine.

121
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,240
Name your interest rate.

122
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,720
An Dong

123
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,160
You always say we're friends.

124
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,519
When you sold your house and car to pay debts,

125
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
didn't you pay someone else first?

126
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,240
I never said a word, right?

127
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,439
I'm not a greedy person.

128
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,120
I just want what you owe me.

129
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,240
I don't want a cent more.

130
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,240
Tomorrow,

131
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,639
if I don't see the money,

132
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,639
I'll go to Hong Shiliu to collect.

133
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,759
Old Liu

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,560
What are you doing?

135
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,759
Nothing, bro.

136
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,879
You do your thing.

137
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,759
I'm just looking.

138
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,439
Learning a bit.

139
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,439
Why learn that?

140
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,759
I have to, bro.

141
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,480
Aren't we opening a new branch soon?

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,079
I want to learn more.

143
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,040
I can't just

144
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,199
worry about the kitchen

145
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,279
and my little patch, right?

146
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,079
Got ideas.

147
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,759
Can make things happen.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,560
Oh, right, bro.

149
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,079
These past few days,

150
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,439
I've checked out a few shops.

151
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,920
I took detailed notes.

152
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,240
I even weighed their pros and cons.

153
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,800
Take a look.

154
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,079
So now,

155
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,399
we're just waiting for your decision.

156
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,319
What do you think?

157
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:03,839
Looks good.

158
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,240
But,

159
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,879
a lot of things

160
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,680
can't be rushed.

161
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,879
Let me plan a bit more.

162
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,360
Got it, got it.

163
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,199
No rush.

164
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,279
Take your time planning.

165
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,079
When the time comes,

166
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,839
if you need me to run errands,

167
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,519
just let me know.

168
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,560
This one,

169
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,759
and this one,

170
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,439
and this one.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,279
Look into these closely.

172
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,199
Alright.

173
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,680
I think they're pretty suitable.

174
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:30,680
Okay, okay.

175
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't worry.

176
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,440
I'll get it done, promise.

177
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,759
Dad.

178
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,440
Why are you here?

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,559
You came out so early.

180
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,960
So you came to see the agent.

181
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,879
No.

182
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,639
You really want to sell that old house?

183
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,000
That old house

184
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,120
should've been sold ages ago.

185
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,840
Besides, there's a buyer now.

186
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
Let's just sell it quickly.

187
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,600
If you sell that old house,

188
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,360
where will you live?

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
I can't afford a new house for you.

190
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,039
You know that, right?

191
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,080
I know, don't worry.

192
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,440
I'm not the type to mooch off you.

193
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,639
I'll earn my own money.

194
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,759
Buy my own house.

195
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,639
Besides,

196
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,879
I'm sure I'll make big money.

197
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll buy you a big house.

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,879
A huge villa.

199
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,320
That's a bold claim.

200
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,759
Alright.

201
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,039
I'll wait to move into your villa.

202
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,639
Sound good?

203
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,440
Sure.

204
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,960
Son,

205
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,320
look at your big brother.

206
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,519
He's got a family and a career.

207
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,080
You should step up too, okay?

208
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,320
Work hard on your skills.

209
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,639
While these old bones can still help.

210
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,200
Alright, Dad.

211
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,759
Enough.

212
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,080
I don't need your help either.

213
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,679
You little rascal.

214
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,759
So you look down on me, huh?

215
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,879
That's not what I mean.

216
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,840
That old house is your wedding home.

217
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,960
Once you find someone,

218
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,879
I'll transfer it to you.

219
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,639
No messing around with it.

220
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,559
Wedding home?

221
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,559
I don't even have a partner.

222
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,480
Where would I get married?

223
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,600
Stop joking around.

224
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,559
How is marriage a joke?

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,440
No.

226
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,399
Look at me now.

227
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,200
I'm still so young.

228
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,559
Ankar, you're not that young anymore.

229
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,840
No.

230
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,080
Your classmates,

231
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
look, some of them

232
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,200
already have two kids.

233
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,519
That's them, not me.

234
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,480
Don't let it go in one ear

235
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,360
and out the other.

236
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,960
Let it sink into your heart.

237
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,200
That's how you build a life.

238
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,799
Understand?

239
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,120
Yeah, I get it.

240
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,759
But Dad, it's a new era now.

241
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,200
You're still pushing me to marry?

242
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,639
I'm in my prime, ready to chase dreams.

243
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,279
Can't let romance

244
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,799
get in the way of my ambitions.

245
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,759
Right, Mama Bayar?

246
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Shouldn't I focus on my career?

247
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,279
Of course.

248
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,279
Old Murat,

249
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,879
our Ankar can do it.

250
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,600
He's a good lad.

251
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,399
He's a young and ambitious lad now.

252
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,879
Study hard.

253
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,960
I'll give you the head chef spot

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,799
ahead of time.

255
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,639
What spot?

256
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,639
Dad, to be honest,

257
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,799
your position now,

258
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,159
I'm not that interested in it.

259
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,600
Aren't we opening a new branch soon?

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,200
Then I'll be more than just head chef.

261
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,519
I'll be the boss too.

262
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,279
I'll show you your son

263
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,519
getting bigger and stronger.

264
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,600
Reaching the top of life.

265
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,879
Really?

266
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,320
Yeah.

267
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,000
Ankar.

268
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,639
What new branch?

269
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,399
How come I didn't know?

270
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Isn't that for the future?

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
After we open a branch someday,

272
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,879
will I be the boss then?

273
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,639
Such ambition for someone so young.

274
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,600
In the future,

275
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,120
you'll surely do even better than your dad.

276
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:47,960
But

277
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,240
for the next two years,

278
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,279
work hard under your dad first.

279
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,840
Then we can talk about being the boss.

280
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,039
Dad,

281
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,879
did you hear that?

282
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,559
Hey, why do you keep hitting my head?

283
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,960
Can you give me some respect?

284
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,639
What are you talking about?

285
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,440
So lively here.

286
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,120
Everyone's here.

287
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,639
Nana's here.

288
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
When did you get back?

289
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,720
Just now.

290
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,000
Why didn't you tell me?

291
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,080
Wanted to surprise you.

292
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,639
Are you hungry?

293
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll have Ankar make you something to eat.

294
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:11,600
No need.

295
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,159
I've already eaten.

296
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,759
Sis-in-law,

297
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:13,879
what do you want to eat?

298
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,759
What did you say?

299
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,000
What did you call her?

300
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,279
What?

301
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,480
Who's sis-in-law?

302
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,279
Murat's Dad,

303
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,360
Mama Bayar,

304
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,759
let me formally introduce you.

305
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,799
Beautiful, kind, brave,

306
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,159
and lovely Gulinare.

307
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,519
She's my girlfriend.

308
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,120
Alright.

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,759
Haven't seen you in days, you've lost weight.

310
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,759
Ayi Xia,

311
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,799
When did this happen?

312
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,960
Why didn't you tell me?

313
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,639
Ayi Xia,

314
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,720
We need to discuss this carefully.

315
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,960
When will you talk to old Sadik

316
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
and formally propose?

317
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,879
Who rushes to marry

318
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,279
right after starting to date?

319
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't put so much pressure on the kids.

320
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,480
Old Murat,

321
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,399
what gift are you preparing?

322
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,120
What are you getting ready?

323
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,039
Think it over carefully.

324
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,080
I don't need you to teach me that.

325
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,919
My eldest's son

326
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,879
is already two years old.

327
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,759
Look at you.

328
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,399
Besides,

329
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,879
I know what Sadik likes.

330
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,039
Of course I do.

331
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,399
What do you know?

332
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,200
You don't know.

333
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:13,879
Ayi Xia,

334
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,120
I just want you to have a grandchild soon.

335
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,639
Right, Ming Liang?

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,759
You really have lost weight.

337
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,960
Eat more.

338
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,720
It's good to be chubby.

339
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,759
Chubbiness brings fortune.

340
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,720
Yes, yes.

341
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,120
Gaining weight is good.

342
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,519
Gaining weight is good.

343
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,879
You've been doing well lately.

344
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,639
Of course.

345
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,200
I can't always make you worry about me.

346
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,279
Hearing that puts me at ease.

347
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
Looks like following your Dong-ge

348
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,720
has helped you improve a lot.

349
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,039
Don't mention it.

350
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,200
I think Dong-ge

351
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,559
really has some skills.

352
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He taught me a lot.

353
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,200
He even introduced me to some friends.

354
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,480
These past few days,

355
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,360
I've been with him,

356
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,080
and I've learned a lot.

357
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,120
Who are these big shots?

358
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,399
Tell me so I can learn too.

359
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,240
He just took me to visit some restaurants.

360
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,159
It's research.

361
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,440
You have to know your competitors first.

362
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,159
That's how you stay unbeatable.

363
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,000
You mentioned opening a branch today.

364
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,600
Yes.

365
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,440
A branch.

366
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,279
Opening a branch is my dream.

367
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,279
Bro, look how old I am.

368
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,039
I can't work for others my whole life.

369
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,879
My dream now is

370
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:35,720
to be my own boss.

371
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,840
That's a problem with your thinking.

372
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,000
You're already a Hong Shiliu shareholder.

373
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,720
So you're one of the bosses.

374
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,399
Alright, alright.

375
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,039
I know, bro.

376
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,120
Don't worry.

377
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,279
I'm not a kid anymore.

378
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,360
I know what I'm doing.

379
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,519
Look at yourself.

380
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,720
If you have time,

381
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,279
why not spend it with Nana?

382
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,080
Alright, bro.

383
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,120
Go on, hurry up.

384
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,360
Don't hold up my work here.

385
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,000
Go.

386
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,639
Hurry up and go.

387
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,600
You rascal.

388
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,279
Seems I'm the one causing you trouble.

389
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,399
No way.

390
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,879
Go on.

391
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,120
Table seven, right?

392
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,039
Ninety-two.

393
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:25,919
You can just deduct it.

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,039
Boss, payment sent.

395
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:28,519
Alright.

396
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,360
Welcome back next time.

397
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,759
Um...

398
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,519
Let's talk outside.

399
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:58,720
See?

400
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,799
You actually showed up.

401
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,639
We agreed, didn't we?

402
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,080
If you didn't pay, I'd come today.

403
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,240
I can't run away.

404
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,720
The shop's right here.

405
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,120
It's because the shop's here

406
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,960
that I can find you.

407
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,879
Anyway, think it over.

408
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,279
If you don't pay me back,

409
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,440
I'll come every day.

410
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,000
Hurry up.

411
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,240
Liu Jianping,

412
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,759
one million has been transferred.

413
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,399
Your debt is paid off.

414
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,240
Dong Ge

415
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,240
You're here.

416
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,840
You've worked hard lately.

417
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,120
I'll give you a few days off.

418
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,879
The restaurant is so busy.

419
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,600
How can I take time off?

420
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,240
I've been away for so long.

421
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,720
Aren't you going home to visit?

422
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,519
I don't have a home anymore.

423
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,720
Now Hong Shiliu is my home.

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,359
That's right.

425
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,680
Today I saw

426
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,039
you chatting with someone.

427
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,319
You seemed pretty close.

428
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,319
I thought it was your family.

429
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,160
The one who came to eat?

430
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,720
No.

431
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,519
Just a friend.

432
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,960
Visiting Xinjiang as a tourist.

433
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,519
Then you should treat them well.

434
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,000
He's only staying one night.

435
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,519
He leaves for Ili tomorrow.

436
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,599
An old friend.

437
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,279
You should spend time with him.

438
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,039
It's a chance to relax.

439
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,519
Honestly,

440
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,200
I haven't been in the mood lately.

441
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,279
All I think about is

442
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,359
how to keep our restaurant busy.

443
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,039
You seem more like the boss than me.

444
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,720
I'm the manager, after all.

445
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,400
Gotta do the job if you have the title.

446
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,039
I eat here,

447
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,000
get paid here,

448
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,920
so I have to handle things here.

449
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,039
It's my responsibility.

450
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,720
Don't work too hard.

451
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,160
Auntie.

452
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:05,759
Auntie.

453
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,000
I've posted on my Moments.

454
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,240
How do I get the free coupon?

455
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,240
Sorry,

456
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,279
I'm not really sure about that.

457
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,039
Wait a moment.

458
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,160
I'll get someone who knows.

459
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,079
Foodie expert!

460
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,599
Quick!

461
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,759
Take another look.

462
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:20,759
I'll be right there.

463
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,359
How does she get the free coupon?

464
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,240
I'll do it, I'll do it.

465
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,839
Go handle your work, I'll help.

466
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,319
Alright, alright.

467
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,559
Look at this.

468
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,759
Tap it, then hold down.

469
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,720
An Dong always has so many ideas.

470
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,599
This daily mystery dish

471
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,720
Once the event started,

472
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,920
we got even more customers.

473
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,759
We need to learn from this.

474
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,319
Exactly.

475
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,160
We should learn.

476
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,880
Otherwise, when customers ask

477
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,559
how to get the free coupon,

478
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,720
I have no idea.

479
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,759
You must be exhausted lately.

480
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,599
Not tired.

481
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,680
Why would I be tired?

482
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,200
If our restaurant

483
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,119
is always like this,

484
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,079
with so many customers,

485
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,319
making money hand over fist,

486
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,279
even if the Rose of the Front Hall drops from exhaustion,

487
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,160
I'd still be happy.

488
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,200
Ayi Xia.

489
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,720
Maybe give me two wind wheels.

490
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,359
So I can spin around.

491
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,039
Then you can't be the Rose of the Front Hall anymore.

492
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,599
What should I be called?

493
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,960
You'd be Nezha of the Front Hall.

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,680
Get outta here!

495
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,920
Nezha isn't that old!

496
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,480
Table seven, add six skewers.

497
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,240
And nine—

498
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,039
Table nine, check please.

499
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:10,519
Okay.

500
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:11,920
Dong Ge.

501
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,559
Where did you learn all these tricks?

502
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,119
So many customers every day.

503
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,079
Even those waiting aren't impatient.

504
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:20,720
You call this a lot?

505
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Let me tell you,

506
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I need to think of a way

507
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:25,599
to fill the terrace with guests.

508
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,000
Here.

509
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:28,359
Okay.

510
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:28,759
Alright.

511
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,279
My colleagues

512
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,000
all saw Hong Shiliu on their Moments.

513
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,160
They said when they get time off,

514
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,319
they'll come back to Urumqi together

515
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,480
and check in at the restaurant.

516
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,240
Your colleagues can come,

517
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,720
but if you come,

518
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,759
you have to help out as a waiter first.

519
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,720
Right.

520
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,240
Now when I go with Yueyue,

521
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,680
we're just serving dishes.

522
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,119
Does Ming Liang mind?

523
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,119
He doesn't want to.

524
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,759
But he can't control Nana.

525
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,519
Mainly, the restaurant is too busy now.

526
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,240
Yueyue.

527
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,559
Remember to tell Auntie

528
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,720
and Mama Ayi Xia

529
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,799
and Uncle Murat

530
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,200
not to overwork themselves.

531
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,119
Take care of their health.

532
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,160
Why don't you call them yourself?

533
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
You know how I am.

534
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,680
I only open up

535
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,799
when I'm with you.

536
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,960
Alright, that's enough.

537
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,759
We're eating now.

538
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,519
Go get some rest.

539
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,319
Is there still food in the cafeteria now?

540
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,039
Cafeteria.

541
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,839
What did cafeteria food taste like?

542
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,319
I really miss it.

543
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,000
Yueyue.

544
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,359
Someone got a boyfriend.

545
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,680
Now a delivery guy brings her food every day.

546
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,960
As her little sister,

547
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,240
I never get that treatment.

548
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,519
It's not your lovey-dovey time.

549
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,519
It's so sweet it's sickening.

550
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,759
No way.

551
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,279
I'm done talking.

552
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:41,920
We're eating now.

553
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,599
Alright, bye.

554
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,319
I'm just lucky to have you

555
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,960
so I can eat home-cooked food.

556
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,400
Stop it.

557
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,240
That's clearly for two people.

558
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,119
Take the photo like this.

559
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,839
It looks better this way.

560
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,559
Alright.

561
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,160
My heart is truly comforted.

562
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,279
What's wrong?

563
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,680
Your social posts before

564
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,920
were all about wildlife protection.

565
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,079
Now you're sharing your daily life.

566
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,000
No,

567
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,720
it's sharing the sweetness of love.

568
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,519
What sweetness of love?

569
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,319
I'm just promoting the restaurant.

570
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
I can feel it.

571
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,319
My brother surely feels it too.

572
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,160
Let's eat.

573
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,680
Hello, Director.

574
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,759
Okay.

575
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,039
Alright, alright.

576
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
I'll leave early tomorrow.

577
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
You're going on a work trip?

578
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,599
Yes, to the Kunlun Mountains.

579
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,720
They said there's a snow leopard

580
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,079
that needs an injury assessment.

581
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,079
You treated a snow leopard last year.

582
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,119
And you released it back successfully.

583
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,200
Maybe because you went last year,

584
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,640
they want me to go again.

585
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,799
You and my brother are both in Urumqi,

586
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,599
yet you see each other less than I do,

587
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,880
even though I'm far away.

588
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,359
Just eat your food.

589
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,920
I'll check in with them again.

590
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,559
Thanks for your help.

591
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,599
Here, just put it here.

592
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,799
This spot is fine.

593
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:20,960
What did you buy?

594
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,599
So much stuff.

595
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,079
Li Guangtian sent a box.

596
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,440
The son-in-law from Fujian sent another.

597
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,519
Just now,

598
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,200
luckily I ran into Ferman.

599
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,680
Otherwise, I couldn't move it alone.

600
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,119
I happened to see it too.

601
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,839
It was no trouble.

602
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,599
Mama Bayar, your two sons-in-law

603
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,880
are showing you so much love.

604
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,000
I've said it so many times.

605
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,480
What does Urumqi lack?

606
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,400
Nothing at all.

607
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,359
Yet they insist on sending things.

608
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,480
Open the boxes later,

609
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,039
everyone can take some.

610
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,440
We can't finish all this.

611
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,279
Well,

612
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:48,960
foodie,

613
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,960
you get a share too.

614
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,519
Come, have a seat.

615
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,519
No, I won't sit down.

616
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,240
I have work at the hospital.

617
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,920
I need to get going.

618
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm leaving, Mama Aysha.

619
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,160
Alright, I'll walk you out.

620
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,599
It's fine.

621
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,039
Okay.

622
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,759
Come for pilaf when you have time.

623
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,640
Ferman,

624
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,559
I'm heading out.

625
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,440
Busy at the hospital.

626
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,279
I'll see him off.

627
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,960
Alright, alright.

628
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,279
Mom.

629
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:06,799
It's all done.

630
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,200
That's a lot.

631
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,799
What is it?

632
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,759
Why is this month's bonus so big?

633
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,960
Everyone deserves it.

634
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,720
You really don't need my help?

635
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,000
No need.

636
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,960
Go with Nana.

637
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,279
Alright, alright.

638
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,279
Thanks for your hard work.

639
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,720
You really won't eat?

640
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't feel like eating.

641
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,319
Why were you busy so late tonight?

642
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,279
I was reading about snow leopards.

643
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,279
Snow leopard.

644
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,759
People in Hotan

645
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,000
found an injured snow leopard in Kunlun.

646
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,160
They reported it to the forestry bureau.

647
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,240
Snow leopards are rare animals.

648
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,240
The leaders take it seriously.

649
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,519
So they asked me to check it out.

650
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,200
When are you going?

651
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,039
Tomorrow.

652
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,759
Tomorrow.

653
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,519
If you're going to Kunlun,

654
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,799
don't you

655
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,759
have to fly to Hotan first?

656
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,640
I'll go to Hotan with you tomorrow.

657
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,720
Which flight did you book?

658
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,359
Have some fruit.

659
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,000
Dong,

660
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,960
Thanks, Dong.

661
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,759
Stop fussing.

662
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,440
It's fine, eat.

663
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,319
I heard you.

664
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:39,880
You said you're going to Hotan tomorrow.

665
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
I didn't hear you say that.

666
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,480
It was a last-minute decision.

667
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,279
I'm going sketching.

668
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,200
You run the restaurant so well.

669
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,000
It doesn't matter if I'm here or not.

670
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,839
Nana just told me

671
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,079
she's going to Hotan tomorrow.

672
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:52,519
Yes.

673
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,160
I'm mainly going to be with Nana.

674
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,160
You should go with her.

675
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,240
Spend more time with her.

676
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,200
Eat.

677
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,079
Thank you.

678
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,759
Thanks for your hard work, Dong.

679
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,240
It's nothing.

680
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,319
You have other business in Hotan, right?

681
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,359
Nothing gets past you.

682
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,759
I've been looking into An Dong.

683
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,000
I found out his ex-wife is from Hotan.

684
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:22,960
So,

685
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,319
I want to go and learn more.

686
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,000
See if there's any useful info.

687
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,279
I always feel that An Dong

688
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,359
came to the restaurant for odd reasons.

689
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,880
You think he has hidden motives?

690
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,960
No,

691
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,319
the restaurant's success today

692
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,119
is thanks to him too.

693
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,799
He truly cares about the restaurant.

694
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,480
Yes.

695
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,279
But,

696
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,519
I've been feeling something's off lately.

697
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:53,240
So I want to look into it.

698
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,559
Just to feel at ease.

699
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,960
Mama Aysha is also from Hotan.

700
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,359
Yes.

701
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,319
Alright.

702
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,240
It's fine.

703
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,279
Then let's go and see.

704
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,440
Look, its teeth are really clean.

705
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,440
And the second incisor on its lower jaw

706
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,680
has no damage to the tip.

707
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,359
So that means it's only two years old.

708
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,880
It's still very young.

709
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,720
The two kilos of lamb we just prepared

710
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,000
have already been eaten by it.

711
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,119
That shows its appetite is great.

712
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,359
Look at its body shape.

713
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,799
It's putting on weight nicely.

714
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,519
Check out its left front paw.

715
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,240
The wound is right on the left front paw.

716
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,920
But there's hardly any blood.

717
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
So the injury isn't serious.

718
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,359
It's in pretty good condition.

719
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,000
In this situation,

720
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,680
I suggest rest and observation.

721
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,480
Make sure it eats normally.

722
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,599
Usually, no further treatment is needed.

723
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,759
That's great.

724
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,359
Glad it's not seriously hurt.

725
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,240
No need to transfer it to Urumqi for treatment.

726
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,960
If things keep going like this,

727
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,759
it'll recover in about seven to ten days.

728
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,680
No need to worry too much.

729
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,680
I'll go get more lamb then.

730
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,359
Thanks for your hard work.

731
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,559
Except for the time with Xiaoxiao,

732
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,759
this is my first time seeing you rescue wildlife.

733
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,680
But this time,

734
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,920
you were so cool.

735
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,319
When that snow leopard roared,

736
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,559
I was totally freaked out.

737
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
It's nothing like what you see in videos.

738
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,720
I told you not to come,

739
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,559
but you insisted on following me.

740
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,799
Not worried anymore, right?

741
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:11,640
Standing in front of it,

742
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,680
I should worry more about myself.

743
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,920
Things here are pretty much settled.

744
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,519
Go take care of your own stuff now.

745
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,799
Remember, no matter what happens,

746
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,799
you must tell me.

747
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,079
Okay.

748
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,240
You too.

749
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,519
Safety first.

750
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,079
Let me know if anything comes up.

751
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:29,920
Okay.

752
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,279
An Dong is the manager at your restaurant.

753
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:37,119
He hasn't caused you any trouble, has he?

754
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,599
No, not at all.

755
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,519
Sister Hatiman,

756
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,519
why do you ask?

757
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,720
An Dong and I,

758
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,440
we started from scratch.

759
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,279
He was always focused on food.

760
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,079
Sometimes, just for

761
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,200
a tiny difference in taste,

762
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,839
he'd go deep into the mountains

763
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,119
to find ingredients.

764
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,000
The same dish,

765
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:03,200
he'd make it over and over again.

766
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,400
He's still like that now.

767
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,000
But it's different.

768
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,920
He can't go back to how pure he was.

769
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,839
I remember,

770
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,640
our business kept growing.

771
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,279
He met lots of business friends.

772
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:20,519
On the surface,

773
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,640
he acted like brothers with them.

774
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,200
But actually,

775
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,559
those friends were very manipulative.

776
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,640
An Dong, you know,

777
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,759
is very arrogant and vain.

778
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,440
He gets fooled easily.

779
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,359
I warned him many times.

780
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,839
He just wouldn't listen.

781
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,000
I really didn't want to live

782
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,279
those anxious days.

783
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,839
I didn't like who he was then.

784
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,000
So we got divorced.

785
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,680
After the divorce,

786
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,799
we lost contact.

787
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,240
I only heard from mutual friends

788
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,759
that he went bankrupt.

789
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,400
Bankrupt?

790
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,680
He didn't tell you?

791
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,279
He sold off everything he owned.

792
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,559
Seems like

793
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,960
he still hasn't paid off his debts.

794
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,720
Sister Hatiman,

795
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,920
sorry to bother you.

796
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:15,920
Ming Liang,

797
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,240
An Dong,

798
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,160
isn't a bad person.

799
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,519
But he's very ambitious.

800
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,799
From what I know of him,

801
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,960
he would never

802
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,319
be satisfied just managing your restaurant.

803
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,839
Keep an eye out.

804
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:38,880
Nana,

805
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,200
I met with An Dong's ex-wife.

806
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,319
I've got the basic situation now.

807
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,279
It's pretty much what we expected.

808
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,519
See you in a bit.

809
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,400
Are you working or shopping?

810
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,319
You must've emptied the supermarket.

811
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,839
I thought shopping might be hard for you,

812
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,680
so I picked some up.

813
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,920
Here, bro.

814
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,079
This lamb is for the snow leopard.

815
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,359
Your boyfriend,

816
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,160
he's so thoughtful.

817
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:13,960
Yeah.

818
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
He's always been like that.

819
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,319
Thanks on behalf of the snow leopard.

820
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,279
You two go ahead and chat.

821
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:18,880
I'll head inside first.

822
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,279
Okay.

823
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,519
Why did you buy so much stuff?

824
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,279
Resources are limited.

825
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,720
There's only so much I can do.

826
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,599
Oh, right.

827
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:27,039
I got you a blanket.

828
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,000
The temperature swings a lot here.

829
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,279
It's not like back home.

830
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,359
Remember to use it at night.

831
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,279
Don't catch a cold.

832
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
I also got you

833
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,119
I'm done with my work here.

834
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,240
Take these things home and use them.

835
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,279
I just booked a flight for tomorrow morning.

836
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,400
Let's go.

837
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,720
Weren't you here to paint?

838
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,279
You can't go back empty-handed.

839
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,000
Let's put the stuff inside first,

840
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,680
then I'll go paint with you.

841
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,160
Okay.

842
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,039
Let's go.

843
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,039
Slow down.

844
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,920
Not bad, right?

845
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,719
It's really good.

846
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,079
Maybe it's because I'm here.

847
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,480
Today's painting is especially good.

848
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,119
Bragging, huh?

849
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,960
It's been a long time since I enjoyed

850
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,280
such a relaxing moment.

851
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,039
Yeah.

852
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:14,760
Let's sit for a while.

853
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,519
You must be tired.

854
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,079
Aren't you tired too?

855
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,079
Work keeps you so busy,

856
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,360
yet you still come paint with me.

857
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
I'm truly honored.

858
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,119
And very grateful.

859
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,519
If you keep saying things like that,

860
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,039
I'll definitely ignore you.

861
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,280
I won't say it again.

862
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:51,840
I promise.

863
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,440
Mama Ayisha once said,

864
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,920
life is like the leaves of a pomegranate tree,

865
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
layer upon layer,

866
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,320
all stacked with problems.

867
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,679
But as long as sunlight shines in,

868
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,039
problems stop being problems.

869
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,400
Such wise words—

870
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,039
why didn't my mom ever tell me that?

871
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,480
When we played in the yard as kids,

872
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,559
Mama Ayisha and Mama Bayar

873
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,440
sat under the pomegranate tree,

874
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,599
sewing dresses and talking.

875
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,079
You were too busy drawing on the ground

876
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,440
to pay any attention.

877
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:37,880
Now I've remembered it.

878
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,000
I named the snow leopard "Legend."

879
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,800
It can run free atop snowy peaks,

880
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,199
whether greeted by sun, moon, or stars,

881
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,039
or by wild winds and storms.

882
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,239
It truly is a legend.

883
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,880
Legend.

884
00:36:59,159 --> 00:36:59,920
That's a great name.

885
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:03,639
Ming Liang,

886
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,199
no matter what you face

887
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,280
when you go back this time,

888
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:11,760
just know

889
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,079
I'll be with you.

890
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,039
Just like when we were kids,

891
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,280
chasing the sunset together

892
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,760
beneath the Kunlun Mountains.

893
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,719
Mr. Fang,

894
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,599
It's rare to see you not busy.

895
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,519
Busy.

896
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,440
Busy introducing Hong Shiliu to people.

897
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:57,960
We're just a small restaurant,

898
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,599
a modest business.

899
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,800
Who would care about us?

900
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:03,039
I just had dinner with some bosses.

901
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,880
Told them I invested in a unique restaurant.

902
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,360
Said you

903
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,519
run it exceptionally well.

904
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,800
Everyone was very interested.

905
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,880
They said when your branch opens,

906
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,480
they'll come to check it out.

907
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,280
Thank you so much, Mr. Fang.

908
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,920
The branch is being prepared.

909
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,880
It should open soon.

910
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,199
With your efficiency,

911
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,880
two months.

912
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,199
Is there any trouble?

913
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,400
Not really.

914
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,800
Mr. Fang, are you saying

915
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,719
you'll come inspect in two months?

916
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,440
You call it an inspection,

917
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,239
but if we do well,

918
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,519
is an inspection even needed?

919
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,719
I'll handle things from out of town.

920
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Alright, thank you, Mr. Fang.

921
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,199
If I have any updates,

922
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,840
I'll report to you anytime.

923
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,119
Good.

924
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,880
Let's leave it at that for now.

925
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,639
Mr. Fang,

926
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,719
what brings you here?

927
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:19,639
So,

928
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:20,559
oh right—

929
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:21,760
um, um...

930
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,039
That teahouse we went to last time,

931
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:23,960
they've got new tea in.

932
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,719
Let's go try it.

933
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,679
Mr. Fang, what are you doing?

934
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,840
No, that's not it—

935
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,639
Mr. Fang, you...

936
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,920
What are you trying to do?

937
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,079
Mr. Fang,

938
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,000
What I promised,

939
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,159
I'll definitely do.

940
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,840
Can we talk outside?

941
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,719
No.

942
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:01,559
I'm back.

943
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,840
Dong-ge,

944
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,639
weren't you

945
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,480
supposed to stay in Hotan a few more days?

946
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,960
How come

947
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,199
you're back so soon?

948
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:15,400
And this is...?

949
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,920
You're Ming Liang, right?

950
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:19,880
Yes.

951
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,199
I'm Fang Tao.

952
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,320
Actually, I'm just like you—

953
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,199
we're both An Dong's partners.

954
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,440
Have a seat.

955
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:32,760
Let's talk.

956
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,280
He owes you money, doesn't he?

957
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,440
How much?

958
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,079
Ming Liang,

959
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,079
Mr. Fang,

960
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,559
this is my contract with An Dong.

961
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,960
It's all clearly written in black and white.

962
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,320
An Dong

963
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,480
signed an investment agreement with me,

964
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,320
using your Hong Shiliu restaurant as collateral.

965
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,159
I invested so he could open a branch.

966
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:40,760
But as far as I know,

967
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,400
the money I gave him

968
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,639
wasn't used to open a store at all.

969
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,119
Instead, he transferred it to someone else.

970
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,280
He changed

971
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,599
the use of the investment on his own.

972
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,039
That's a clear breach of contract.

973
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:58,400
So many options for him to choose,

974
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,000
let's see what he's still unhappy about.

975
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:00,800
Um...

976
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,280
Ming Liang, you're back!

977
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,119
And Mr. Fang is here too.

978
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,320
What are you all doing?

979
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,039
Did something happen?

980
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,360
Since everyone's here,

981
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:17,880
come on,

982
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,039
gather over here.

983
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,159
I have something to tell you all.

984
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,119
I signed a contract

985
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,800
with An Dong.

986
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,639
He broke the contract.

987
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,119
It's clearly stated in the contract—

988
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,159
principal plus penalty,

989
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
a total of three million yuan.

990
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,559
An Dong must pay me back

991
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,360
in full within ten days.

992
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,440
Otherwise,

993
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,159
Hong Shiliu restaurant

994
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,280
will belong to me, Fang Tao.

995
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,039
An Dong

996
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,599
What's going on?

997
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:55,639
Fang Tao

998
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,000
Do you really have to go this far?

999
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,599
I'm not the one pushing things too far.

1000
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,599
You're the one who went too far.

1001
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,360
An Dong

1002
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,280
You're really not playing fair.

1003
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,119
I trusted you.

1004
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:08,880
I believed in you.

1005
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,960
When no one else believed in you,

1006
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,119
I helped you.

1007
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:14,920
I invested in you.

1008
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,440
But what about you?

1009
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,719
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

1010
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,360
You lied to me.

1011
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,440
And you lied to them too.

1012
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:28,760
What's going on?

1013
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:29,719
An Dong

1014
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,119
Say something.

1015
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:32,679
I...

1016
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:33,239
Go ahead.

1017
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,880
I...

1018
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,239
Say something. What's going on?

1019
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:36,880
You...

1020
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,199
Just say it.

1021
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,000
Murat's Dad

1022
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:39,880
Go ahead.
