1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,039
The flowers in Jiangbulake are blooming.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,480
Let's wait until next time to go.

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,720
We'll have Xuehua Liang again when we go.

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,160
What is Xuehua Liang?

5
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,679
It's icy and cool, just like snowflakes.

6
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,120
Is it ice cream?

7
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,839
That must taste really good.

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,560
When we grow up,

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,880
we'll go to Jiangbulake for Xuehua Liang too.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,320
Sure, let's do it!

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,159
Mom.

12
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,159
Take this with you.

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,479
Jiangbulake gets cold at night.

14
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,159
No need, I have a jacket.

15
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,840
Your jacket isn't warm enough.

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,960
How do you know mine isn't warm?

17
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,840
Even mine isn't warm.

18
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,000
Yours is warmer than mine.

19
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:25,879
Dad.

20
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:26,560
You...

21
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,080
This...

22
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,759
Quiet.

23
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,800
Ming Liang.

24
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,400
Hu Dad.

25
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,759
You have to handle

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
the Morel business,

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,919
and also deal with our family's

28
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,560
two little troublemakers'

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,919
Who's a troublemaker?

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,319
What else can you do besides giggle?

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,879
Don't worry, Hu Dad.

32
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,919
We're all family here.

33
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,520
That's right.

34
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,120
Bayar Mom is with me and my mom.

35
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,000
Go ahead and work.

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,960
Alright, alright.

37
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,960
Then I'll...

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm off to work now.

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,000
Yueyue.

40
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,840
Give it to me, give it to me.

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,560
I just need a shawl.

42
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,639
Bayar Mom.

43
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,520
You all get in the car first.

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,159
Let me take the luggage.

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Here.

46
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,280
Here.

47
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,360
Take it slow.

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,919
So stubborn.

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,800
You're just as stubborn.

50
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,599
Aren't there three of you going?

51
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,800
Why bring four chairs?

52
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,800
Just in case we need them.

53
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,560
Or maybe for a surprise meeting?

54
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,439
Did you know Nana is going to Jiangbulake too?

55
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,520
Don't you usually travel together for work?

56
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,560
Why are you going to Altay this time?

57
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,840
It's a work assignment.

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,599
How would I know?

59
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,800
Let's go, it's rush hour.

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm leaving my mom in your care.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,199
When you reach the service area,

62
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,199
ask if she needs the restroom or anything.

63
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,520
Make sure she drinks more water.

64
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
And eats fewer sweets.

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,080
Her blood sugar is a bit high.

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,240
Why don't you come along?

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,520
Let's go.

68
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,719
Be careful.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
You brat.

70
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,759
So heartless.

71
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
Whenever she travels far,

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,040
I stand and see her off.

73
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,639
I wait until her car is out of sight.

74
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,439
Only then do I go inside.

75
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,680
Look at her.

76
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,319
We just started the car,

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
and she's gone like a rabbit.

78
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,759
Already disappeared.

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,959
Alright.

80
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,959
It's rare to get out and have fun.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,720
Don't argue with the kids.

82
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:46,959
Liangliang.

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,560
Mom.

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,399
Play a song, please.

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
Such nice weather.

86
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,480
It's a shame not to have music.

87
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,399
Okay, Mom.

88
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,720
Got it.

89
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,519
We're almost there.

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,279
See you soon.

91
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,399
We're here, Aisha.

92
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,079
It's so beautiful, Aisha.

93
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:45,920
Mom.

94
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,399
Put your hat on.

95
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,639
Let's enjoy the sunshine.

96
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,160
Enjoy the sunshine.

97
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,319
Look over there.

98
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,879
It's gorgeous.

99
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,720
You all have fun at the scenic spot.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,720
I'll go to Qitai County to check the Morels.

101
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,399
I'll arrange the lodging when I'm back.

102
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,399
Alright, take care of your work.

103
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,199
Okay, okay.

104
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,600
Take your medicine in one hour.

105
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,160
Okay.

106
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,680
Don't worry.

107
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,160
Rest assured.

108
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,879
Look over there, Aisha.

109
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,399
Brother Zhang.

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,319
Today we'll focus on monitoring this area.

111
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:33,800
Okay.

112
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,600
Look at the three o'clock direction.

113
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,720
The one with a spot on its ear.

114
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,399
Is that the young deer you just released?

115
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,240
Why is it still on the edge?

116
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,199
Hasn't the herd accepted it yet?

117
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,399
Did you complete all the rewilding training?

118
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,879
We did everything just as you instructed.

119
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,079
The checkup showed no injuries or illness.

120
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,240
We fed it plenty of milk.

121
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,639
Made sure it has enough strength.

122
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,600
We even carefully applied

123
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,600
doe's droppings on its body.

124
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,000
Logically,

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,439
the scent marking should be fine.

126
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,519
It's hard for people to fit into new places.

127
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,600
It's even harder for wild animals.

128
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,079
And young deer released again

129
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,480
already have a low survival rate.

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Did you implant the microchip in the fawn?

131
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,919
Yes, it's implanted.

132
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,759
The chip can track and locate it.

133
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,320
Let's keep a close watch later.

134
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,879
Can you handle all this?

135
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,799
With me and my dad here,

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,759
it's all good.

137
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,639
Don't worry.

138
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,080
By the way, let me tell you—

139
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
This An Dong,

140
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,879
he's really something.

141
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,240
Seriously.

142
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
I think he's more than just a foodie.

143
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,240
What happened?

144
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,039
He pays a lot of attention to plating.

145
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,960
He acts all formal when serving guests.

146
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,840
My dad is sure

147
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,320
he's run a restaurant before.

148
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
And not just a small one.

149
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,639
He turned our restaurant

150
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,039
into something like a five-star hotel.

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,720
An Dong has high standards for dishes.

152
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,840
Try to cooperate with him.

153
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,559
If anything comes up, wait till I'm back.

154
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,600
Don't make things hard for him.

155
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Did you hear me?

156
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,080
Me, make things hard for him?

157
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,840
You think too highly of me.

158
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,639
As long as he doesn't trouble me.

159
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,080
Ankar

160
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,320
Waijiang (Ouch)

161
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,000
He says my knife skills are bad.

162
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,879
It affects the dishes.

163
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,399
He keeps making me practice.

164
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,279
Alright.

165
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,200
It's rare to find someone who can handle you.

166
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,240
Just like I said before,

167
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,960
I'll send the mushrooms back first.

168
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,720
After that, you try the flavor.

169
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,320
If there's a problem, we'll settle it online.

170
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Okay, I'm hanging up.

171
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,080
Gulinar

172
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,799
There's a dinner at the station tonight.

173
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,440
Join us.

174
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,120
Sure.

175
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,960
You guys go ahead.

176
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,879
I still have some files to sort tonight.

177
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,639
You're already here anyway.

178
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,399
Morels are just in season now.

179
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,960
Stew them with free-range chicken.

180
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,000
So good!

181
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,559
Look at my belly—

182
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,759
That's how I got it!

183
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,679
Speaking of that,

184
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,759
I actually need a favor from you.

185
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,840
Tianshan wild morels.

186
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,000
How do you sell these, boss?

187
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,519
Hello.

188
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,879
These are Tianshan wild morels.

189
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,200
Six hundred yuan per kilo.

190
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,159
Give me a couple of taels of each.

191
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:31,759
Alright.

192
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,840
I've got a bag here.

193
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,399
Put it in mine.

194
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,200
Xuehua Liang, traditional handmade Xuehua Liang.

195
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,200
Xuehua Liang, traditional handmade Xuehua Liang.

196
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,720
Come, take a break here.

197
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,799
Coming, coming.

198
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,840
Mom.

199
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,399
Bayar's mom.

200
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,600
You all rest for a bit.

201
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,960
I'll go get the rest of the stuff.

202
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,440
Okay.

203
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,279
Mom.

204
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,679
It's about time for your medicine.

205
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,440
Okay.

206
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,679
So beautiful.

207
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,840
How is it?

208
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,200
In the batch you sent yesterday,

209
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,080
there's one morel that's amazing.

210
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,039
That's right.

211
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,279
It tastes almost like a wild one.

212
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,679
Totally different from the farmed kind.

213
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,200
You'll know when you try it yourself.

214
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,480
Thick and meaty.

215
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,320
Really fragrant.

216
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,879
Really.

217
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,200
Which sample number?

218
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,159
It wasn't numbered, right?

219
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,799
No.

220
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,039
The one without a number.

221
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,960
No way.

222
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,120
There were eighteen samples in total.

223
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,279
I numbered all of them.

224
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,080
No, there were nineteen.

225
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,840
Seems one was sent separately.

226
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,679
Without a number.

227
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,320
Ankar

228
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,480
Take a photo and send it to me.

229
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,240
Take a photo and send it to him.

230
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,600
I remember it.

231
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,200
It arrived yesterday afternoon.

232
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,720
Was it a young woman?

233
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,720
In her twenties.

234
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,679
Big eyes.

235
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,720
Pretty good-looking.

236
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,600
Are you looking for your crush?

237
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,360
Not a young woman.

238
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
It was a young man.

239
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,840
What does he look like?

240
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,200
Long face, bowl haircut.

241
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,639
Looks quite decent.

242
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,080
Actually, I came today

243
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,960
to discuss a partnership with you.

244
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,080
I run a restaurant in Urumqi.

245
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I want to buy morels from you long-term.

246
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,000
How big is your restaurant?

247
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
It's a family restaurant.

248
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,960
Ten tables.

249
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,720
Uh—

250
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,120
What's wrong?

251
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,799
Morels—

252
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,440
I don't even want to grow them anymore.

253
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,279
Why?

254
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,320
The cost to grow them is too high.

255
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,840
Can't find buyers.

256
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,639
We've been losing money for two years.

257
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,200
We put it up when we opened the shop.

258
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,440
Our family has a similar sign, too.

259
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,840
My mom wrote it herself.

260
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,960
That means we’re really connected.

261
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,200
You haven’t eaten yet, have you?

262
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,840
Want to try our signature noodles?

263
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,360
How is it?

264
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,360
The broth is so fresh.

265
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,039
And the noodles are nice and chewy.

266
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:31,840
Delicious.

267
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,639
This wheat is watered by Tianshan snow.

268
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,120
Even the wheat kernels are sweet as honey.

269
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,480
This is the supplier who always gives us flour.

270
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,759
The boss’s phone number.

271
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,679
You’re opening a restaurant?

272
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,080
You might need it.

273
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,600
Ma’am,

274
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,960
About your morels—

275
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,840
What’s the yearly yield?

276
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,080
Aisha, look—

277
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,720
I never understood before

278
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,440
how the same crop

279
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,039
could taste so different.

280
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,559
Until I saw this.

281
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,519
An Dong’s always searching for Xinjiang’s unique flavor.

282
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,840
This is it.

283
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,080
Growing these morels—

284
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,399
The key is caring deeply.

285
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,320
Our morels—

286
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,600
I treat them like my own children.

287
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,360
Preparing soil, picking seeds, adjusting temp and humidity—

288
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,799
Never use pesticides.

289
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,120
I catch all the bugs myself.

290
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,440
After so many years, we can’t bear to stop.

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,480
Ma’am,

292
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,440
If I help you

293
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,080
find a stable sales channel,

294
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,080
can you keep growing them?

295
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,039
Are you serious?

296
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,919
I’ll give it a try.

297
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,879
Okay.

298
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,000
The morels she grows with care

299
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,639
still can’t be sold.

300
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,559
If we don’t help her,

301
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,519
we won’t get

302
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,559
such good supplies for long.

303
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,440
Alright, ma’am.

304
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,080
You want two jin, right?

305
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:24,799
No problem.

306
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,559
I’ve noted it down for you.

307
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,320
I’ll send you our recipe later.

308
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,080
Just cook it by that.

309
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,039
I guarantee it’ll taste great.

310
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,480
If it’s not good,

311
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,360
I’ll refund you.

312
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,080
Alright.

313
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,039
Thank you, ma’am. Thank you!

314
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,639
I’m hanging up now.

315
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,600
Mulat, bro—

316
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,120
What’s all this chatter about?

317
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,080
Just say it straight.

318
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,679
I need to pick up my grandson.

319
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,200
Everything’s good at home?

320
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,600
The kids are good?

321
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,879
Grandson’s good?

322
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,720
Uh—

323
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,559
The wolfdog’s good too?

324
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,240
What?

325
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,159
All good, all good.

326
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,200
The dog’s good too.

327
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,679
So, here’s the thing—

328
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,120
Go ahead.

329
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,840
Our restaurant has those morels now.

330
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,720
Ankar called me about it already.

331
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,840
I’ve already bought some.

332
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,680
You bought them already?

333
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,839
It’s all the same, all the same.

334
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,319
That’s good, that’s good.

335
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,880
Alright.

336
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:08,480
Okay, okay.

337
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,319
We’ll talk later.

338
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,400
You took a few of my

339
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,119
friends, didn’t you?

340
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,799
No, Dad—

341
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,559
You’re too slow.

342
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,960
The business is slipping away.

343
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:22,880
Let me show you.

344
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,480
I’ve contacted all these relatives.

345
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,319
So don’t call them.

346
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,680
Then who do I sell to?

347
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,799
Old Zhao—

348
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,640
About the morels—

349
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Can you help me out?

350
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,480
Sure.

351
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,000
Don’t worry about the morels.

352
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,200
But—

353
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,200
Our boss deals in fruit.

354
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:55,960
So,

355
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,240
I’ll check with other drivers for you.

356
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,720
Alright.

357
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,079
Okay, thanks.

358
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,119
Thank you so much.

359
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,319
Thanks, thanks, thanks!

360
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,599
When you come back,

361
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,799
I’ll treat you to a meal.

362
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,799
I’ll make you morel stir-fried lamb.

363
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,559
Sound good?

364
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,079
Once your shop’s open,

365
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,960
I’ll get to eat something tasty.

366
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,920
Thank you, thank you.

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,720
Really appreciate it.

368
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,799
I’ll hang up now.

369
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,519
Okay, okay.

370
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,319
Even if Uncle Zhao gets the big boss,

371
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,799
by the time they check and buy,

372
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,079
the morel greenhouse will be gone.

373
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,319
You brat—

374
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,599
You just won’t admit I’m better than you.

375
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,839
No, no, no—

376
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,680
What are you laughing at?

377
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,759
You haven’t even posted it online.

378
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,079
My phone’s charging.

379
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,559
I’ll post it soon.

380
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:46,680
How’s it going, Ming Liang?

381
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Still not enough?

382
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,559
We’ve reached plenty of restaurants and people,

383
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,920
but they’re all small buyers.

384
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,480
So the total isn’t much.

385
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,720
We still can’t cover the growing costs.

386
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,960
I’ll ask my eldest daughter.

387
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,440
I heard people in Fujian eat mushrooms too.

388
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,640
I heard people in Fujian eat mushrooms too.

389
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,319
Let her ask if anyone needs some.

390
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,519
And Old Hu—

391
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,960
Have him ask around at the factory.

392
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,400
Sell every jin we can.

393
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,599
Is this one burnt?

394
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,319
Yeah, it’s burnt.

395
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:12,839
Come on, come on—

396
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,599
Eat this one, this one—

397
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,160
This one’s good.

398
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,119
So fragrant!

399
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:25,759
Hello, hi.

400
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,640
Hello, hello, hello.

401
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,559
I'm the purchasing manager
at Suhai International Hotel.

402
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,519
My surname is Chen.

403
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,440
Are you Mr. Ming Liang?

404
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,119
I'm Ming Liang, hello.

405
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,119
I heard

406
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,160
you have a batch of top-quality morels.

407
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm calling to ask.

408
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,799
How much do you need?

409
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,400
This batch you have,

410
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,000
we can take all of it.

411
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,559
How about this:

412
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,599
Please give me your address first.

413
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,839
I'll send you some samples first.

414
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,720
You can check the quality of the morels.

415
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,440
Alright.

416
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,720
That's not necessary.

417
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,480
If An Dong approves the ingredients,

418
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,519
there's definitely no problem.

419
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,319
An Dong.

420
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:00,799
An Dong.

421
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,559
Who else but him?

422
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,039
I'll send you the boss's contact info.

423
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,200
You can discuss details with her.

424
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,119
Okay, okay.

425
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:08,960
Alright, thank you.

426
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,480
Okay, goodbye.

427
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,640
Sure, sure, sure.

428
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,000
You've got guts, Ming Liang.

429
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,160
In today's world,

430
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,400
high walls only narrow your path.

431
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,480
Sharing is how we all rise together.

432
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:27,559
Besides,

433
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,359
ingredients matter,

434
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,359
but they're definitely not

435
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,359
Hong Shiliu's core strength.

436
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,319
Hope the restaurant won't let you down.

437
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,559
It definitely won't.

438
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,880
So, developing new morel dishes—

439
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,720
I'll leave that to you and Mulati Dad.

440
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,759
Don't worry.

441
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,359
I promise to make the freshest

442
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
morel dishes in all Urumqi.

443
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:46,640
Alright.

444
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,279
Let's leave it at that for now.

445
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,359
See you back there.

446
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,079
I'll wait for you to return.

447
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,039
Your upper lip touches the sky,

448
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,200
your lower lip touches the ground.

449
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,640
Look how cocky you are.

450
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,279
A real master hides his skills.

451
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,640
Show-offs aren't the real deal.

452
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,079
Impressive connections you've got.

453
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,079
Don't flatter me.

454
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,599
Starting today,

455
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,640
double your knife work.

456
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,000
Come on, bro!

457
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,519
You're my dearest brother.

458
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:13,960
Don't do this.

459
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,640
Go now.

460
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,759
Young man.

461
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,319
Ma'am.

462
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,400
Good thing you didn't leave.

463
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,400
Mom.

464
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,480
The lady selling morels is here.

465
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,400
You've helped me so much,

466
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,039
I don't know how to thank you.

467
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,599
So I brought some Qitai specialties.

468
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,119
Take them home and try.

469
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,640
You're too kind.

470
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,599
No need to be polite.

471
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,599
Sorry to make you come so far.

472
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,480
It's no trouble.

473
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,839
You are...

474
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,880
Aisha.

475
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,160
Yan Zi.

476
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,319
It's you!

477
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,279
You two know each other?

478
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,160
Yeah.

479
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,880
Turns out,

480
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
you didn't know?

481
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,119
My mom never mentioned it.

482
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,279
Your parents

483
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,640
met right here on this grassland.

484
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,559
Back then,

485
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,200
I followed them around every day.

486
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,640
Their romance—

487
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,319
I saw it all happen.

488
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,640
So,

489
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,680
this time, Mom

490
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,559
wanted to visit Jiangbulake grassland.

491
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,119
Yan Jie,

492
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
how did my parents meet?

493
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,279
Such a romantic story—

494
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,759
the people involved should tell it.

495
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,359
That's what makes it special, right?

496
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,319
Mom.

497
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,839
That was a long time ago.

498
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,640
I was twenty then.

499
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,839
My older sister was getting married.

500
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,559
I came for the wedding.

501
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,640
One night, wolves attacked our home.

502
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,599
We were all terrified.

503
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:12,920
At that moment,

504
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,240
I suddenly heard hoofbeats outside.

505
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,279
A young man shouted loudly,

506
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,640
telling us not to be afraid.

507
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,880
It must've been Amir, the hero.

508
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,000
It was him.

509
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,839
He held a torch

510
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,640
and drove the wolves away.

511
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,079
He made it sound easy,

512
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,640
but when I saw him,

513
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,400
his fur coat

514
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,599
was half torn by the wolves.

515
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,400
Afraid they'd return,

516
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,839
he kept watch outside all night.

517
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,359
Later, I learned

518
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,880
he was a firefighter in Urumqi.

519
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,720
A friend of my brother-in-law.

520
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,839
He was also at the wedding.

521
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,720
The next day, I went back to Hetian.

522
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,839
He chased after me on horseback.

523
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,839
He shouted loudly,

524
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,759
"Aisha!"

525
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:10,960
"I brought you

526
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,160
Qitai's famous iced sweet water."

527
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
Afraid the ice would melt,

528
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,559
he tucked it inside his clothes,

529
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,680
holding it close as he ran over.

530
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,319
Amir was so thoughtful.

531
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,319
He really was.

532
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,000
And a bit silly, too.

533
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,000
Back then, bottle caps weren't tight.

534
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,279
When he took it out,

535
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,480
all the ice had spilled.

536
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,279
Only the bottom was left.

537
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,920
His face turned bright red.

538
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,519
He said,

539
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,720
"Aisha,

540
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,720
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

541
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,319
I rode too fast,

542
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,079
and only the bottom's left."

543
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,920
That bottle bottom was, in my life,

544
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,960
the sweetest Xuehua Liang I've ever tasted.

545
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:47,799
For

546
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,519
Detailed recipe for morel noodle soup

547
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,039
You don't know

548
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,519
Our family's mixed noodles

549
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,599
That's a specialty too

550
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,000
It's a pity this time

551
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You didn't get to try it

552
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,599
I've written the recipe above

553
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,480
That's great

554
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,039
We can add two more signature dishes

555
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:04,880
Alright

556
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,000
No need for more gifts, everyone

557
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,400
We've exchanged WeChat and phone numbers

558
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,839
Our connection

559
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,279
Can't be broken, even if we try

560
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,319
Next time you're in Urumqi

561
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,400
Come visit our home

562
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,880
I'll make pilaf for you

563
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:16,680
Okay

564
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,400
Take care, Yan

565
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,880
Alright

566
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,240
By the way

567
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,680
Next morel season

568
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,599
You must come, promise me

569
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,920
I'll save the first batch of morels for you

570
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,839
It's a deal

571
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,079
That's wonderful

572
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,039
Alright, I'm leaving

573
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,759
Okay

574
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,880
Take care

575
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,240
Goodbye

576
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,279
Goodbye

577
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,960
Mom

578
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,559
I want to go to Qitai County

579
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,319
Why are you going to the county

580
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,119
Young man

581
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,079
You want Xuehua Liang, right

582
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,240
You'll have to wait a bit

583
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:13,599
Boss

584
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,480
This Xuehua Liang

585
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,559
Can you teach me

586
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,839
Come

587
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,559
Put on the shawl

588
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,400
No

589
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,599
Your daughter prepared this shawl

590
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,519
Put it on

591
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,880
Look at this girl

592
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,240
Gave me the shawl

593
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
I wonder if she packed enough clothes

594
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,640
The weather's changed in Altay

595
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,799
It's raining and snowing

596
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,400
She secretly checks

597
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,599
The weather forecast for Yueyue's trip

598
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,480
She argues so fiercely

599
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,680
But she's more worried than anyone

600
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,599
Aisha

601
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,400
Don't think I'm clueless

602
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,240
This time, coming out here

603
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:19,480
You said it's just for sightseeing

604
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,200
But actually

605
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,039
You just want

606
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,079
The two of us to

607
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,079
Find our younger selves again

608
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:27,880
Isn't that right

609
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,079
You caught me

610
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,319
But you know

611
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,319
Looking at the sky

612
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,279
Looking at the land

613
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,240
Feeling the breeze

614
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,799
In my heart

615
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,359
All my anger is gone

616
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,240
I watched Yueyue grow up

617
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,279
I trust her judgment

618
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,640
When Yueyue returns from her trip

619
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,480
We'll invite Li Guangtian for a good talk

620
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,920
Once the anger fades

621
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,359
I start missing my daughter

622
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,079
Just call her

623
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,559
Why should mother and daughter hold grudges

624
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,319
Why call

625
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,079
I've been out for so long

626
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,839
Has that girl ever called me

627
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,079
If you want to call, you call

628
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:20,880
If you want to miss her, you miss her

629
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,440
I'm not calling

630
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,400
Fine, I'll call

631
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,279
I miss her

632
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,559
Give me the phone

633
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,640
You promised

634
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,519
You miss her

635
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,000
Yes, I miss her

636
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'll call her

637
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,039
It's not you missing her

638
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,480
What you like

639
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,000
She might not like

640
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,599
Isn't love her own business

641
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,559
As long as she's happy, that's enough

642
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,000
Boss

643
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,039
One Xuehua Liang, please

644
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,200
Alright

645
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,599
Hello, Mom

646
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,160
Okay

647
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,240
Alright

648
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,559
I'm heading back soon

649
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,599
Mom

650
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,720
What exactly happened

651
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,039
Aisha Mom

652
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,279
Yueyue

653
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,240
How are you

654
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,440
Is it cold there

655
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,119
I'm not cold

656
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,599
Not cold?

657
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,599
Minus five degrees isn't cold?

658
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,839
Are you part camel

659
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,640
You've got thick skin

660
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,319
I mean I'm dressed warmly

661
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,319
I'm not cold at all

662
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,119
Why are you so close to the camera

663
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,920
Step back

664
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,039
Huh

665
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,599
Huh what

666
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,440
Step back

667
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,279
Let me see how many layers you're wearing

668
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:38,799
Back up

669
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:42,400
Hello

670
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,799
Back up

671
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:44,680
Hello

672
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,680
Mom

673
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:47,599
Hello

674
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,279
Mom

675
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,160
Yueyue

676
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,200
Yueyue

677
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,240
Can you hear me

678
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,640
Her signal is bad

679
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,880
Mine's fine here

680
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:56,839
Yueyue

681
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,839
Can you see me, Yueyue

682
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,880
Yueyue

683
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,119
Hello

684
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,759
Yueyue

685
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,599
What should we do

686
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,680
Maybe hang up first

687
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,599
Call again later

688
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,920
Naomaohu Bus Station, we've arrived

689
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,559
Everyone, get your luggage ready to get off

690
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,200
Where are you

691
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
What are you doing in Naomaohu

692
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,599
Alright, that girl...

693
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,640
She... she went to Naomaohu.

694
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,200
Li Guangtian is there.

695
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,119
Alright.

696
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:41,119
She went to meet him behind my back, didn't she?

697
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,839
She even dares to hang up on me.

698
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,799
Blocked me, too.

699
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,839
That girl...

700
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,759
So heartless.

701
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,759
Just wait and see how I deal with you!

702
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,279
I promised I wouldn't get mad.

703
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,599
How could I not be mad?

704
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,599
Aren't you angry?

705
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,279
Wouldn't you be mad with a daughter like this?

706
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,559
She went to the car to get something.

707
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,759
But didn't come back for ages.

708
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,680
After a while,

709
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,880
I got a text.

710
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,559
That's how I found out she went to Naomaohu to find Yueyue.

711
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,839
I called her.

712
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,920
She told me not to worry.

713
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,799
She drove all that way alone.

714
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:08,559
Her back isn't even good.

715
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,839
I'm really worried.

716
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,680
It's okay, Mom.

717
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,599
Don't worry.

718
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,599
I'll call Hu Yue.

719
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,279
I already called.

720
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,000
She didn't answer.

721
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,240
I called too.

722
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,799
She was going to find Li Guangtian.

723
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,000
To talk about what to do.

724
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,480
Didn't expect things to turn out like this.

725
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,039
When she heard Bayar was coming,

726
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,400
Yueyue got scared.

727
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,279
Nana.

728
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,880
Could I trouble you...

729
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,480
To take my mom back to Urumqi?

730
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,400
What about you?

731
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,119
Mom.

732
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,640
I'll rent a car and go to Naomaohu.

733
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,839
When mother and daughter meet,

734
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,559
It's bound to be a huge scene.

735
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,960
You won't be able to stop them.

736
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,640
Ming Liang, I have to go.

737
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,920
Mom, you...

738
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,400
Mom.

739
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,799
I'll go alone.

740
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,759
Let Gulinar take you back to Urumqi first.

741
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,920
You can't handle it alone.

742
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,079
I can handle it, Mom.

743
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,039
Hello, Dean Gao.

744
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,880
Let Li Zhe take the documents back first.

745
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
I need to request some leave.

746
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,119
Yes, something came up.

747
00:33:59,119 --> 00:33:59,799
Thank you.

748
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,119
Alright, thanks.

749
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,239
It's peak travel season and the weekend.

750
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,760
Even if the rental has cars,

751
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,119
By the time they prep the car and you go,

752
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,159
It'll take two hours.

753
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,280
I borrowed a car from a colleague.

754
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,199
I'll drive you there.

755
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,079
What about your work?

756
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,480
I already applied with Dean Gao.

757
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,880
Li Zhe will take the documents back.

758
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,679
Tomorrow's the weekend.

759
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,239
It won't affect anything.

760
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,039
Thanks, sorry for the trouble.

761
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,360
Everyone has emergencies sometimes.

762
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:57,280
Last time my wife went to Urumqi for treatment,

763
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,079
It was all thanks to you.

764
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,960
It's what I should do.

765
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,039
Long face, bowl haircut.

766
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,679
Looks pretty decent, too.

767
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,079
What are you thinking?

768
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:04,639
Let's go.

769
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,960
Maybe we'll run into them on the way.

770
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,639
Aisha, let's go.

771
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,920
Thanks.

772
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,840
Be careful on the road.

773
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,360
Drive slowly.

774
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,320
Take it easy on the road.

775
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Finally reached out.

776
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,400
Is Altay fun?

777
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,119
I regretted blocking you right away.

778
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,760
Now I'm stuck in a tough spot.

779
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,119
I think you should just stay on.

780
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,480
Can't you?

781
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,840
Bro, stop blaming me.

782
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,639
I really don't know what to do now.

783
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,119
I'm here for your help.

784
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,400
Now you remember I'm your brother.

785
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,199
Listen, Hu Yue.

786
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,679
You two can't handle this yourselves.

787
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,039
Li Guangtian's parents have to step in.

788
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,119
Both sides need to talk it out.

789
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:18,920
You know?

790
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,920
His parents are in Shandong now.

791
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,599
They can't get here anytime soon.

792
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,079
This is Li Guangtian's problem to solve.

793
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,000
That's it.

794
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:28,719
Figure it out.

795
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,679
Help Yueyue out.

796
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,840
Let's see how Li Guangtian handles this.

797
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,440
See if he can take it.

798
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,840
So what do we do now?

799
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,320
We're really in the hot seat now.

800
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,920
I'll book tickets for my parents right now.

801
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,599
There's no time for that.

802
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,960
Even if your parents come,

803
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,079
Who'll look after Grandpa?

804
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,800
I don't care.

805
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,719
You have to come up with an elder now.

806
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,679
An elder...

807
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,199
Then we'll have to ask Director Wang.

808
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,440
It's not his first time

809
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,840
handling something like this.

810
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,320
Director Wang is good.

811
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,000
He's your boss,

812
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,119
and easygoing.

813
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:25,400
Most importantly,

814
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,800
he looks reliable.

815
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,280
If he doesn't say,

816
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,920
who'd know he's thirty-seven?

817
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,480
Thirty-six.

818
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,800
Li Guangtian.

819
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,960
I'll contact Director Wang now.

820
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,400
He should be with his family this weekend.

821
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,760
Go find him first.

822
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,280
Explain everything to him.

823
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,760
Once I finish up here,

824
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,559
I'll come find you.

825
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:44,480
Alright.

826
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,920
Then hurry up.

827
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,599
Once you arrive,

828
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,280
I'll arrange for you to meet Ming Liang right away.

829
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,280
Whether we make it through this

830
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,119
all depends on him.

831
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,039
Alright.

832
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:21,639
Smell it.

833
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,679
This is Yanqi chili.

834
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,480
It's thick.

835
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,519
The pepper aroma is strong.

836
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,360
It's sweet, spicy, and fragrant.

837
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,800
This is my specialty dish.

838
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,760
I could cook it with my eyes closed.

839
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,079
Let's see what An Dong can criticize this time.

840
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,159
Dad, I think with this dish,

841
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,920
we're still doomed.

842
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,360
Ming Liang too—

843
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,519
He promised to come back today,

844
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,679
but now he's delayed again.

845
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,079
Does he really

846
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,280
not care about me at all?

847
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,159
Don't think that just because Ming Liang's back,

848
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,719
you can slack off.

849
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:49,440
Give it to me.

850
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,280
I'm not slacking off.

851
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,920
I'm just worried we can't handle him.

852
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,800
Alright, alright, alright.

853
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,440
Stop talking.

854
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,519
Just focus on learning to cook.

855
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:01,079
Or else,

856
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,400
should I contact him again?

857
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,840
It's fine, it's fine.

858
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,760
No need to bother him with such a small thing.

859
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,599
Alright, time to serve.

860
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,599
This time,

861
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:20,039
let that picky mouth taste it again.

862
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,400
Ming Liang.

863
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,599
This restaurant—

864
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,000
with him but not me,

865
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,239
with me but not him.

866
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,559
Dad, please stop.

867
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,559
Didn't you say small things

868
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,880
shouldn't trouble Ming Liang?

869
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,599
Is this a small thing?

870
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,159
Ming Liang.

871
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,039
Is this a small thing?

872
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,079
What's going on now?

873
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,599
Mulati Dad,

874
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,599
take your time and tell us.

875
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,679
What happened?

876
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,599
Ming Liang, here's the thing—

877
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,039
My dad wanted to show off his best skills

878
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,480
and impress An Dong.

879
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,920
But after tasting it, he said

880
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,280
it was missing something, like the right heat.

881
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,239
It made my dad so mad.

882
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,639
I've cooked all my life,

883
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,559
how could I not know about heat?

884
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,039
Do you even know what kind of chili this is?

885
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,440
Of course I do.

886
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,159
It's Yanqi chili.

887
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,559
The ingredients are excellent.

888
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,800
It's not about the ingredients.

889
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,920
You didn't use enough heat.

890
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,840
The aroma didn't come out.

891
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,679
Since I learned this dish,

892
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,760
I've always cooked it this way.

893
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,559
Just because you've always done it

894
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,480
doesn't mean your way is right.

895
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,880
You pay more for meals,

896
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,599
so you're just nitpicking.

897
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,119
Aren't you?

898
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,480
If you say so,

899
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,039
Ming Liang, be my witness.

900
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,199
Didn't we agree

901
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,239
that the more I pay for meals,

902
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,679
I get to decide how the food's cooked?

903
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,519
If the dish isn't good,

904
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,480
shouldn't it be redone?

905
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,199
You—

906
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,239
Mulati Dad,

907
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,199
please don't get upset.

908
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,000
Don't worry.

909
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,519
Your chili stir-fried meat—

910
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,599
I've eaten it since I was little.

911
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,199
I used to eat three bowls of rice with it.

912
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,159
How could it not be good?

913
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:52,599
But,

914
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:53,599
everyone's taste

915
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,880
really is different.

916
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,719
I can't come back right now,

917
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,280
so I can't taste it for you.

918
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,800
So, Mulati Dad,

919
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,440
could you please make an extra effort

920
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,599
and cook two more plates?

921
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:03,519
One plate

922
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,880
use your usual method,

923
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,800
the other as An Dong suggested—

924
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,079
with higher heat.

925
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,159
Put them in identical plates.

926
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Let An Dong taste them blind.

927
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,039
See if he can tell the difference.

928
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,039
Does that work?

929
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,679
Bro, that's a great idea.

930
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,639
Let's do it this way.

931
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:18,360
Don't worry.

932
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,920
Alright, I'll do it.

933
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,199
I'll do it.

934
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,559
Hanging up now.

935
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,400
No more calls for now.

936
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
To Naomaohu,

937
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,400
it's still over 300 kilometers.

938
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,159
Let me drive.

939
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:36,639
Okay.

940
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,119
We're almost at the rest area.

941
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,599
Let's switch at the rest area.

942
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,519
Your once-in-a-century day off

943
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,760
got snatched by me.

944
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,239
When we arrive, eat and drink whatever you want.

945
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,000
Just ask.

946
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,920
Isn't this running into Yueyue

947
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,480
and her four-year secret drama?

948
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,599
How could I miss it?

949
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,559
You're afraid I'll be harsh with her

950
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,480
so you're here to cover for her, right?

951
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:17,400
As long as you know.

952
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,400
You two are more and more like you were as kids.

953
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:32,519
If you can't taste the difference,

954
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,559
your tongue

955
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,239
is only good for bragging.

956
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,519
That's right, An Dong.

957
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,920
If you can't tell,

958
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,559
please stop giving my dad a hard time.

959
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,800
And don't make things hard for me either.

960
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,559
Don't make me do

961
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,760
those basic skills every day.

962
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:09,519
No, that's not right.

963
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,400
This is still the old method.

964
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,599
The heat isn't enough.

965
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:27,559
That's it.

966
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:28,920
Really, Lao Mu,

967
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,239
now the heat is just right.

968
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,079
The aroma is coming out.

969
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:33,000
That's it.

970
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,199
You're not just guessing, are you?
