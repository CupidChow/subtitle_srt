1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,199
This roller coaster is way too scary.

2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,000
Aisha

3
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:11,679
Mom

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,320
Aisha Mom

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,359
We're doomed.

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:14,880
Bayar

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,480
How can you teach kids to lie?

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,960
And skip class by faking sick?

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,519
All their classmates have been
to the amusement park.

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,000
Mom

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,839
Just the three of them.

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,160
Me.

13
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,440
I'm taking them for an outdoor lesson.

14
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,719
Mom, I'll write a reflection.

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,160
Yueyue will write one too.

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,079
I know I was wrong.

17
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,879
Everyone has to write a reflection.

18
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,320
Everyone must admit their mistakes.

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,600
But...

20
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,159
We have to have fun first.

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,039
That's great!

22
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,919
Rinse your mouth with clean water.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,840
So unrelated flavors won't

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,360
disturb your taste buds.

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
Flower trick.

26
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:27,919
Come.

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,560
Mom

28
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,240
What's with those faces?

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,439
Is it bad?

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,360
Or really bad?

31
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,159
How can morel mushrooms smell so good?

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,479
Dad

33
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,439
Dad

34
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,680
Boss

35
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,800
Can we talk now?

36
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,400
Coming.

37
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
This is my freshly brewed herbal milk tea.

38
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,039
Please taste it, esteemed gourmet.

39
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,039
Thank you.

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,879
I added green cardamom.

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,159
And a special rose aroma.

42
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,680
Tastes good.

43
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,039
It's valuable for its creativity.

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Oh my god.

45
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,439
Not only do you know cooking,

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,039
but you have such taste.

47
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,719
I've taught this kid for ten years,

48
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,400
but your ten minutes beat me.

49
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,120
I can tell you're extraordinary.

50
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,040
Didn't expect you to be so low-key.

51
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,040
You're too kind.

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,560
May I ask,

53
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,399
why did you choose our restaurant?

54
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,959
The reason...

55
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,240
Mainly because you're naive.

56
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,959
Are you okay?

57
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,959
You've eaten and drunk for free here
for days.

58
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,120
You're calling us naive?

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
Isn't that naive?

60
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,720
Look,

61
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,800
our restaurant is struggling now,

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,680
but we still help those in need.

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,279
This free pilaf,

64
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,240
we keep giving it out, one by one.

65
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,519
Isn't that naive?

66
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,240
Because of this.

67
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:56,839
That's right.

68
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,399
But you're adorably naive.

69
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,680
I like everyone here.

70
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,959
Just like you.

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,959
Chef

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
knows his own shortcomings,

73
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
and steps back willingly.

74
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Not every chef can do that.

75
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,519
This...

76
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,519
No need to mention it.

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,120
The carrots in pilaf,

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,959
meat and rice are all together.

79
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Our Hong Shiliu is the same.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,959
And you.

81
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,199
You know your chef is outdated,

82
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,720
but you don't fire him.

83
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,240
Where can you find a boss like that now?

84
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,959
Murat Dad's cooking is fine.

85
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,000
And you.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
Whether it's for customers

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
or for your staff,

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,279
you're very caring.

89
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,519
And you see things clearly.

90
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,120
What about me?

91
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,240
You...

92
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,240
Everyone is so tolerant of you,

93
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,240
letting you mess around.

94
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,959
Shows their generosity.

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,240
They can't be bothered with you.

96
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,680
Honestly,

97
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,279
I've truly felt

98
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,120
a sense of

99
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,399
home here.

100
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,920
A strong feeling of home.

101
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,399
Because now,

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,639
too many people

103
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,000
have their own houses,

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,360
but rarely cook at home.

105
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,720
The stove is just for show.

106
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,600
Ordering takeout every day.

107
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,279
Ordering takeout every day.

108
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,040
That home doesn't feel like home.

109
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,279
It's just a place to rest.

110
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,279
But in our restaurant,

111
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,279
I feel the warmth of real life.

112
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,600
And genuine human kindness.

113
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,839
Just for this,

114
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,040
our restaurant deserves to thrive.

115
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Aisha

116
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,959
Today at the market,

117
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,720
I heard someone came to Urumqi—

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,160
a mysterious gourmet.

119
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,399
I saw the photo,

120
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,399
and it startled me.

121
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,480
It's the guest in our restaurant

122
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,279
who ate and drank for free.

123
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,720
Hello.

124
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,360
Sorry, sorry about that.

125
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,279
Maybe I usually...

126
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,480
I haven't treated you very well.

127
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,399
But please don't take it to heart.

128
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,839
Just don't ever go outside

129
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,399
and speak badly of Hong Shiliu.

130
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,920
You're overthinking it.

131
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,040
I know you might have some bias against me.

132
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:39,680
I...

133
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,600
But every request I've made,

134
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,839
you've always met it.

135
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,160
I would never speak ill of us.

136
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,480
Thank you, thank you.

137
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,399
I appreciate it.

138
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,600
Here's the thing.

139
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,839
Our little restaurant

140
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
probably can't afford your salary.

141
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,040
I don't want a salary.

142
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,720
Plus, I pay six hundred a day for meals.

143
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,600
How about that?

144
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,279
What?

145
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,920
How much?

146
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,160
Six hundred.

147
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
Six hundred per day.

148
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,480
That's right.

149
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
Six hundred a day.

150
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,720
That's eighteen thousand a month.

151
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,399
No.

152
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,839
Naan dropped.

153
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,360
Braised Meat with Naan.

154
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,040
Of course.

155
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,680
This money I pay

156
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,040
isn't for nothing.

157
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,040
What I eat each day,

158
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,399
how the dish is made,

159
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
I get to decide.

160
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,360
We can't accommodate that.

161
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,480
Sorry.

162
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,279
I won't take up business hours.

163
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,360
Just use break time.

164
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,600
Most importantly,

165
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,399
I can let you stay as head chef.

166
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:47,720
And

167
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,919
become all of Urumqi's

168
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,159
best head chef.

169
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,360
What do you mean?

170
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,279
So, what do you think?

171
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,840
When things happen,

172
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,960
just accept them.

173
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,799
That's well said.

174
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,039
Hello.

175
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,840
My name is An Dong.

176
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,360
Ming Liang.

177
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,519
I heard the little brown bear moved to the pen.

178
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,039
Is it adjusting well?

179
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,120
Do you need me to check on it?

180
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,519
It's raining.

181
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,279
Did you bring an umbrella?

182
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,480
Why isn't Ming Liang here yet today?

183
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,279
Didn't he say he'd come less often?

184
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,039
He's not coming today.

185
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,480
Nana.

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Do you... like—

187
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,519
Yeah, I'm just used to it.

188
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,279
He brings food from the restaurant every day.

189
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,919
Says one thing, means another.

190
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,279
Fine, whatever you say.

191
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
You, the big gourmet.

192
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,240
What do you really mean?

193
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,120
This morel mushroom—

194
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,000
You eat it from noon till night.

195
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
Do you know in our restaurant

196
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,120
it sells for over eighty a plate?

197
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,840
You pay six hundred a day, you—

198
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,360
No.

199
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,720
Yeah.

200
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,840
Soaking time.

201
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,440
Seasoning.

202
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,360
Stir-fry time.

203
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,240
All adjusted to your requests.

204
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,440
Still not the taste you want?

205
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,840
Chef Murat.

206
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,559
What do you think?

207
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,360
I've held the ladle for thirty years.

208
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,240
It's my first time meeting someone

209
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,000
so hard to please.

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,720
An Dong.

211
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,240
Where do you think the problem is?

212
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,360
It's just not the flavor I imagined.

213
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,360
So, what flavor do you imagine?

214
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,480
I can't say, but anyway—

215
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,720
it's just not what I want.

216
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,600
What you want and "colorful black"—

217
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,960
what's the difference?

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,240
That's hard to achieve.

219
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,759
Ankar.

220
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,759
Alright, that's enough.

221
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,440
Murat.

222
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,840
I think we shouldn't serve him anymore.

223
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,720
Can't serve him.

224
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,120
Sis.

225
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,720
Can't afford to serve him either.

226
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,759
Let's go, let's go.

227
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,120
Bayar.

228
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,120
Wait a second.

229
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,759
What does he mean?

230
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
What kind of gourmet is that?

231
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,759
Look how much is wasted.

232
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,879
Is there a problem?

233
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,120
No problem.

234
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,600
Isn't this bullying?

235
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,840
Try it.

236
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,480
Go ahead, taste it.

237
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Is my stir-fry really that bad?

238
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,320
Ankar.

239
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,440
Eat it, eat it, don't waste it.

240
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,240
Let's not waste it.

241
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,000
Just eat it.

242
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,720
Let's talk.

243
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,559
Why did you really come to our restaurant?

244
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,600
Why not just say it directly?

245
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,639
Then I'll be direct.

246
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,840
About these morels—

247
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,720
I've tried them all over the country.

248
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,200
Each has its own flavor.

249
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
But at our restaurant,

250
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
I found the stir-fried morel with meat

251
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,240
is our specialty.

252
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,960
So I have an idea.

253
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,360
Why not make this dish

254
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,360
uniquely Xinjiang-style,

255
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,080
and only our restaurant

256
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,480
can serve it?

257
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,240
A signature dish.

258
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,879
Once this signature dish

259
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
is perfected,

260
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
our restaurant

261
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,360
is bound to be a hit.

262
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,240
But...

263
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,600
Look, after a whole day of work,

264
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,559
Chef Murat cooked so many,

265
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,600
but it's still missing something.

266
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,600
But I've already—

267
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
I really don't know

268
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,600
where the problem is.

269
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,240
We followed your instructions exactly.

270
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,440
Then I think the issue

271
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,559
isn't with Murat,

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,879
but with the morels themselves.

273
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,360
I've thought about that too.

274
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,120
But...

275
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,120
You already bought the best

276
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,120
morels available on the market.

277
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,600
We sourced

278
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,960
the best in Urumqi.

279
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,600
But Xinjiang is huge.

280
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,120
Roses grow in the desert,

281
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
seafood is raised in the Gobi.

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,600
So...

283
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:32,600
Just wait for me.

284
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,240
I will find

285
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,840
morels that satisfy you.

286
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,000
I like your determination.

287
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,240
You never complain,

288
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,360
just look for solutions.

289
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,120
Alright.

290
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,200
I promise you,

291
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,559
if you find better morels,

292
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,720
I'll help our restaurant

293
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,759
create this signature dish.

294
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,480
Hello, Nana.

295
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
I was just about to call you.

296
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,360
You asked the right person.

297
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,840
Morels are a cash crop.

298
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,240
They help prevent wind and desertification.

299
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,120
Last year, our office and the forestry bureau

300
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,440
did a special survey.

301
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,200
For professional matters,

302
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,600
you need professionals.

303
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,360
Our research focused on

304
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,879
Xinjiang fungi and herbivores,

305
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,720
their habitat correlations.

306
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,480
The most important part

307
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,600
was the study of all Xinjiang fungi.

308
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,960
These are our data and reports.

309
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,840
See if you can use them.

310
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,639
Definitely useful.

311
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,559
None of this is online.

312
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,720
Once I finish copying,

313
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,600
I'll bring them to you.

314
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,600
No rush, it's fine.

315
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,720
I'll pack them up for you.

316
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,120
I've been talking about myself.

317
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:00,840
What did you need from me?

318
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,240
Wait a second.

319
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:03,879
Okay.

320
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,880
Your jacket has been totally claimed by Xiaoxiao.

321
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
So I bought the same one online.

322
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,240
You really bought it for me?

323
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,240
Want to try it on?

324
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,359
If it doesn't fit,

325
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,119
I can exchange it.

326
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,240
Alright, I'll try it.

327
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,720
I'll get you some water.

328
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,440
Okay.

329
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,359
Just right.

330
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,720
Here, take it.

331
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,599
Thanks.

332
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:20,839
Um...

333
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,599
I've come here twice,

334
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,240
and both times heard you playing music.

335
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,880
Do you usually listen to music at home?

336
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,119
Yes.

337
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,240
My home is too quiet.

338
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,359
So other sounds seem louder.

339
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,880
So music is just right.

340
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,480
You know I prefer quiet.

341
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,359
It helps me focus.

342
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,599
It's totally different from my family.

343
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,240
Yeah.

344
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,359
Your home always feels lively.

345
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,599
Never short of people.

346
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,359
Sometimes when I paint,

347
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,480
it does get a bit noisy.

348
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,480
But most of the time,

349
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,119
the noise

350
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,359
actually makes me feel at ease.

351
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:56,839
Alright.

352
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
It's getting late.

353
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
You should rest early too.

354
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,480
Good night.

355
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,359
Take care on your way.

356
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:11,839
Bye.

357
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,200
What is this stuff?

358
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,920
This, this...

359
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,440
All this messy junk.

360
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,119
What even is this?

361
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,200
Let me, let me, let me.

362
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,160
What are you doing?

363
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Can't you two show me some sympathy?

364
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,640
I just picked up your dad's stinky socks outside,

365
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,079
now it's your messy stuff again.

366
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,839
Anyway—

367
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,599
You two,

368
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,039
get up!

369
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,359
If you don't wear me out,

370
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,599
you'll wear out this vacuum.

371
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,559
If it breaks, I'll buy you a new one.

372
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,680
A hands-free robot vacuum.

373
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,799
Why is this darn vacuum stuck again?

374
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:38,319
Yueyue!

375
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,359
Come help me check.

376
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,079
Yueyue!

377
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,039
Take a look.

378
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,200
It just broke, just like that.

379
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,200
What are you doing?

380
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,440
You're so clumsy.

381
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,119
Give it here, hand it over.

382
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,039
What's going on with you, girl?

383
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,359
Didn't you tell me

384
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,039
you broke up with that guy,

385
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,279
Li Guangtian, right?

386
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,200
Don't go.

387
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:14,920
Look at this yourself.

388
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,279
You went to Hami last month, right?

389
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:21,599
And there's more.

390
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,359
From 2023.

391
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,599
And 2024.

392
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,200
How many years has it been?

393
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,880
How many years have you kept this from me?

394
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,119
Who taught you to lie?

395
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,200
I just wanted to fulfill your wish.

396
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,400
Didn't you want me to find a boyfriend?

397
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,599
When did I ever

398
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,119
When did I ever tell you

399
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,839
to find a boyfriend so far away?

400
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,759
Yueyue.

401
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,759
Now you

402
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,160
aren't you doing well with Ming Liang?

403
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,039
This really won't do.

404
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,279
He's my brother.

405
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:47,920
Dad.

406
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,160
Your mom is right to scold you.

407
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,200
You brought up such a big issue,

408
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,839
why didn't you tell the family?

409
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,519
Calm down.

410
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,359
I think, since it's already happened,

411
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,200
you need to find a way to fix it.

412
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,799
Enough.

413
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,039
All you do is smooth things over.

414
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
How is that smoothing things over?

415
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,160
Since this has already happened,

416
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,000
To be honest,

417
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,359
you

418
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,880
you need to find a solution.

419
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:12,839
Everyone should

420
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,000
just calm down.

421
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,759
Let's solve the problem.

422
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:18,440
Hu Yinghua.

423
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:19,559
Come.

424
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,119
Come on, come on.

425
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,319
Come on, come on.

426
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,160
Sit down for me.

427
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,000
Sit down.

428
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,519
You need to handle this properly.

429
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:26,839
Come.

430
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,599
You solve this problem today.

431
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,319
All these years,

432
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,359
has the family ever relied on you for anything?

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,799
Do you think these two girls

434
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,559
just grew up overnight?

435
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,359
The elders and kids at home,

436
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,119
haven't I carried everything myself?

437
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,119
Where are you?

438
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,359
All you know is welding, welding, welding.

439
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,000
You never leave your workshop.

440
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,680
Have you welded the family issues clear?

441
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,559
Don't talk.

442
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,359
Go.

443
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,640
Just go back to your workshop.

444
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:02,799
Go weld, weld, weld.

445
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,279
Bayar.

446
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,119
Bayar.

447
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:04,759
Overcome your obstacles.

448
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,559
Conquer your difficulties.

449
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,680
Our family doesn't need you.

450
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,359
Doesn't need you.

451
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:07,920
Go, go, go.

452
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:08,599
Bayar.

453
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,279
Bayar.

454
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,359
Bayar.

455
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,359
Stop.

456
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:17,680
Mom.

457
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,359
I have to go to work too.

458
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,119
Work? What work?

459
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,279
You stay right here.

460
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,319
These are all the known

461
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,119
Morel varieties in Xinjiang.

462
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,200
Cultivation areas.

463
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,119
And a report on their distribution.

464
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,160
You can take a look.

465
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,400
You've really done your homework.

466
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,599
There's even a Morel flavor analysis report.

467
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,839
I was really surprised when I saw it.

468
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,599
So I asked my friend,

469
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,839
why is there such a thing?

470
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,359
She said it's for better cultivation.

471
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,640
The agricultural institute did a study.

472
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,880
Look, it says here,

473
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,079
Xinjiang Morel mushrooms

474
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,440
have twenty-one flavor components.

475
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,079
Including seven alcohols, six acids,

476
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:07,839
and four esters, one...

477
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,839
I... I'll read it myself.

478
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,839
I can read, I can read.

479
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,680
Liangliang.

480
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,880
Your Hu dad called.

481
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,920
Bayar and Yueyue are arguing.

482
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,079
I need to go check.

483
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,839
Why?

484
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,839
Yueyue is dating someone.

485
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:20,759
Okay.

486
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,119
I'll go with you then.

487
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,400
Let's go.

488
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,079
You keep an eye on things.

489
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:32,839
Hu dad.

490
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:35,759
Aisha.

491
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,119
Sorry to trouble you all these years.

492
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,400
This Bayar

493
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,119
is really furious.

494
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,839
She thought

495
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,880
Yueyue was with Ming Liang.

496
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,839
She was quite happy.

497
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,160
But then she found out Yueyue's boyfriend

498
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,319
is still Li Guangtian.

499
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,079
This Bayar

500
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,400
just got even angrier.

501
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,039
Bayar is really upset.

502
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,400
You being here won't help.

503
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,200
Might even make her angrier.

504
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:58,799
But...

505
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,359
Hu dad.

506
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,920
It's enough if my mom and I are here.

507
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,599
You go to work, don't worry.

508
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,599
Go ahead.

509
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,359
Alright, alright.

510
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,279
Aisha, do you know something?

511
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,119
It's that stubborn girl.

512
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,119
She kept it from me for four years.

513
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,200
You know I'm not that kind of person.

514
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,160
I'm not unreasonable, am I?

515
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,680
That Li Guangtian guy—

516
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,599
He came here for a trip.

517
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,559
And lost his heart here.

518
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,200
He didn't come for tourism.

519
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,359
He came to Urumqi for a seminar.

520
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,119
He works at a molten salt solar power plant.

521
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,519
He's a highly skilled technician.

522
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,119
He's a real professional.

523
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,440
His job is stable.

524
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,279
He's not unreliable.

525
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,119
Sounds like a capable young man.

526
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,799
Why do you only say the nice things?

527
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,839
Why don't you tell them

528
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,640
where that guy actually works?

529
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,839
What kind of place is that?

530
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,680
He spends every day on the Gobi desert.

531
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,680
You two barely see each other twice a year.

532
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,839
Do you think you can live like that?

533
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,599
That's called holding the Gobi line.

534
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,599
Bringing light to thousands of homes.

535
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,160
Anyway, I understand him.

536
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,079
No matter what you say,

537
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,920
I still won't agree.

538
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,119
Do you think it's easy for me?

539
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,359
I raised two daughters.

540
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,640
One married off to Fujian.

541
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,160
I barely see her twice a year.

542
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,400
And now this—

543
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,160
You found me someone

544
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,799
who's six hundred kilometers away.

545
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,599
At least it's closer by three thousand kilometers.

546
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,599
Aisha—

547
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,559
What do you mean by that?

548
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,039
Is this how you persuade people?

549
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,279
Darn it, I'll go talk to Yueyue.

550
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,440
Hu Yue—

551
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,160
Don't call me by my full name.

552
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,359
When you use my full name,

553
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,359
I know you're about to lecture me.

554
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,839
Because I know you side with Mom,

555
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,359
not with me.

556
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,440
That's why I didn't tell you.

557
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,920
You just don't understand.

558
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,039
When love comes, what can I do?

559
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,759
But you can't handle it like this.

560
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,880
It's too immature.

561
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,039
What counts as mature?

562
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,119
Is breaking up just because she says so mature?

563
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,839
Why is everyone blaming me?

564
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,119
Look at Yueyue—

565
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,880
She won't choose Ming Liang, who's so outstanding.

566
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,839
She insists on someone so far away.

567
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,640
Ming Liang used to study in Beijing.

568
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,599
That was even farther.

569
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,759
That's not the same.

570
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,039
Those two grew up together.

571
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,839
And we know everything about them.

572
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,920
If Yueyue marries Ming Liang,

573
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,599
I'd be so relieved.

574
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,000
Have you met that boy?

575
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:33,599
No, I haven't.

576
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,519
Then how do you know he's not good?

577
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,440
You know your mom's temper.

578
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,839
She's just like a child.

579
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,599
Quick to get angry, quick to cool off.

580
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,039
Just go along and coax her.

581
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,880
The more you argue, the more she resists.

582
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,319
I've tried coaxing—didn't work.

583
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,039
That's why it became a secret relationship.

584
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,359
You think I wanted it to be secret?

585
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,079
Four years, like a thief.

586
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,200
Always on edge every day.

587
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,839
Afraid of a day like today.

588
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,680
Kids are always rebellious.

589
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,039
The more you object, the more stubborn she gets.

590
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,400
No, Aisha—

591
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,599
That girl is just—

592
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,160
blinded by love.

593
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:04,920
Stop trying to persuade her.

594
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,559
Anyway—

595
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,319
about this matter,

596
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,119
I absolutely won't agree.

597
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,079
Hu Yue—

598
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:14,599
Hu Yue—

599
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,559
Since everyone knows now,

600
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,920
I don't want to keep hiding.

601
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,119
Let's talk everything out today.

602
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,680
Okay, go ahead.

603
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:22,440
Mom—

604
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,599
Since I was little,

605
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,160
I've always followed your plans.

606
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,039
I wanted to apply to schools elsewhere.

607
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,000
You wouldn't let me go.

608
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,119
I wanted to be a wildlife photographer.

609
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,160
You wouldn't allow that either.

610
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,359
I listened to you every time.

611
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,880
High school,

612
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:35,559
college,

613
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,079
and work—

614
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,640
I stayed in Urumqi for all of it.

615
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,559
Now you want to control my love life too.

616
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,839
Will you ever let me breathe?

617
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,759
Go, go, go—get inside.

618
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,880
It's all my fault.

619
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,359
I gave birth to you.

620
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,119
Raised you.

621
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:52,839
Controlled you.

622
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,880
It's my fault.

623
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,680
You went to study away from home.

624
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,440
Came back once a year.

625
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,559
You said you got sick there—

626
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,519
Who took care of you?

627
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:05,119
Now you want to be a wildlife photographer.

628
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,000
Do you think that job

629
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,559
is as romantic as you imagine?

630
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,359
Outdoors in winter—

631
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,680
tears and snot

632
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,200
frozen like icicles.

633
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,279
Can just anyone handle that hardship?

634
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,559
Yueyue

635
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,119
When I gave birth to you,

636
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,880
you weighed just over four jin.

637
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,359
You were like a tiny kitten.

638
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,119
You almost didn't make it.

639
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,359
We raised you

640
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,039
with all our care and love.

641
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,079
Was it easy for us?

642
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,319
All these years,

643
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,119
whenever I don't please you,

644
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,319
you always say the same things.

645
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:37,839
Yueyue

646
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,440
I just didn't want you to worry.

647
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,119
That's why I swim, run marathons,

648
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,599
and keep running even now.

649
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,880
I'm not a child anymore.

650
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,400
Can you stop treating me like one?

651
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,079
Even if you turn one hundred,

652
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,039
you'll always be my child.

653
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm a person,

654
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,599
not a sheep you keep penned in.

655
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,160
If I'd known you'd be like this,

656
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,920
I might as well have raised sheep.

657
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:58,640
Yueyue

658
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,039
What's wrong?

659
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,319
Grown up now,

660
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,680
got your own wings, huh?

661
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,359
Now you have Li Guangtian.

662
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,160
This attitude—

663
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,000
talking to your mom like this.

664
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,359
What does Li Guangtian have to do with it?

665
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,599
My sister didn't stay in Urumqi.

666
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,440
You want me to stay with you.

667
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,039
Isn't that right?

668
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,200
My sister got married four years ago.

669
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,640
You've been sad enough.

670
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,599
I just don't want you to be sadder.

671
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,319
So I lied and said I broke up.

672
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:21,920
Yueyue

673
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,559
Mom,

674
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,039
You decided everything for me before.

675
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,759
But today,

676
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,839
I want to decide for myself.

677
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:44,880
Fine.

678
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:46,799
You decide.

679
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,400
It's about Li Guangtian.

680
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,279
I don't know him.

681
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,119
I don't.

682
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,880
I've never even had a sip of his water.

683
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,920
Or a bite of his food.

684
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,079
I don't know who he is.

685
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:56,920
You don't?

686
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,599
He bought all your shawls.

687
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,599
He bought your leather shoes too.

688
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,559
Cowhide ones.

689
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:01,839
What?

690
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,119
What shawls?

691
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,039
What shoes?

692
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,319
Fine.

693
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,119
Alright, alright.

694
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,200
Stop talking.

695
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,200
From now on,

696
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,000
Is this it?

697
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,319
Take it.

698
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,279
It's yours.

699
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:16,920
I don't want it.

700
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,400
I have his card too.

701
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,839
What I buy is what he buys.

702
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,359
Yueyue

703
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,000
Move aside.

704
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,119
Card.

705
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,000
I'll give it back right now.

706
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,119
Is ten thousand yuan enough?

707
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,039
Stop making a scene.

708
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,400
Yueyue

709
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,160
Yueyue

710
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,079
You go home first.

711
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,519
The restaurant can't do without you.

712
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,039
Don't you all agree?

713
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,640
That girl makes me so mad my stomach hurts.

714
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,400
I'm burning up inside.

715
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,559
I can't hold it in at all.

716
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,599
If you care about her,

717
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,039
explain things to her clearly.

718
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,000
Don't shout.

719
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,039
I haven't even said much.

720
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:58,559
What else can I—

721
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,400
How else should I say it?

722
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,920
You're finally back.

723
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,839
That troublemaker is acting up again.

724
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,839
Go check it out.

725
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,359
Come on, come on.

726
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:04,880
What's wrong?

727
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
You, the big gourmet.

728
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,039
There's a problem with this.

729
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:11,599
There's a problem with this.

730
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,400
There's a problem with this.

731
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,559
Tell me, what's the problem?

732
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,319
What problem?

733
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,400
He doesn't know.

734
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,039
My problem is,

735
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,799
why can't you make the taste I want?

736
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,559
If you can't,

737
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,319
I asked you to try more dishes.

738
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,000
Is that wrong?

739
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,440
Does good food fall from the sky?

740
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,599
Is it wrong for chefs to cook?

741
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:32,200
Fine.

742
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,160
If you won't try, forget it.

743
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,599
Then close the restaurant.

744
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,799
Go sell naan by the roadside.

745
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,400
What's with your attitude?

746
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,119
Look, look.

747
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:38,839
See that?

748
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,559
You'd better send this big shot away.

749
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,119
Everyone's temper is about to blow.

750
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,000
Look at him.

751
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,960
Morel, morel—

752
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,920
Soaking them daily, my hands are ruined.

753
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,640
Just look.

754
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,839
Just look.

755
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,880
How to soak them?

756
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:50,839
How to soak them?

757
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,359
How to stir-fry them?

758
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,119
I've cooked a hundred dishes.

759
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,200
He's still not satisfied.

760
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:59,759
Do you know how much food you've wasted?

761
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,759
How much money that is?

762
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:01,839
Gourmet.

763
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,640
That's enough, Ming Liang.

764
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,640
Don't make it harder on yourself.

765
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,119
Forget it, no need to keep trying.

766
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:14,680
Stop doing it.

767
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,160
I guess the taste of Xinjiang's unique morel

768
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,319
can only exist in my imagination now.

769
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,599
You've searched for morels worldwide,

770
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,920
you've found them all.

771
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,160
It's my fault.

772
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,440
It can't be the morel's fault.

773
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,119
Murat.

774
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:31,759
Dad, dad, dad.

775
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,359
Bro, I'm just saying—

776
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,839
He keeps imagining things.

777
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,119
Where can you find the morel he imagines?

778
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,880
Are we supposed to grow it for him here?

779
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,599
Bro.

780
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,200
Say something.

781
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,599
The records say

782
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,359
the first morels in Xinjiang were found

783
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,599
in Changji Prefecture.

784
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:58,680
Ming Liang.

785
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,680
Now that you mention it, I remember.

786
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,039
We had this dish at the restaurant early on

787
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:06,119
because I ate it in Qitai County, Changji.

788
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,039
But that was over thirty years ago.

789
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:12,599
Alright.

790
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,360
We've tested the dish this far.

791
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,599
Everyone's done their best.

792
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,119
I'll try one last time.

793
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,639
I'll go to Qitai County.

794
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,320
Just for one dish?

795
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,119
It's not just for one dish.

796
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,159
I have a bigger idea.

797
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,360
I was about to tell you all.

798
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,360
I'm planning

799
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,360
to stop takeout service first.

800
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,840
By the way, bro—

801
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,280
I've been meaning to tell you this.

802
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,920
There are only two ways to profit from takeout.

803
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,360
One,

804
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,159
just cut the portions.

805
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,360
Reduce the serving size.

806
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,360
The other is to lower the quality.

807
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,760
Use more ordinary ingredients.

808
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,039
We can't compromise the food's quality.

809
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:56,760
What nonsense are you talking?

810
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,760
Hong Shiliu has lasted thirty years

811
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,840
because of its reputation.

812
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,119
I called everyone here today

813
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,119
to discuss this matter.

814
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,360
We can't stop, bro!

815
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:11,079
My dishes get lots of takeout orders now.

816
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,320
It brings attention to the restaurant.

817
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,199
If we stop takeout,

818
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,920
how do we compete with other restaurants?

819
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,079
Not every restaurant does takeout.

820
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,000
Except for one type.

821
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,000
You want

822
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,199
to run a quality restaurant.

823
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,800
That's right.

824
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,159
You inspired me.

825
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,599
That's why I want to find morels.

826
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,440
From what I've observed lately,

827
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,119
all quality restaurants

828
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,280
share one thing in common.

829
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,280
They have delicious food,

830
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:37,840
unique features,

831
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,760
and signature dishes with great value.

832
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,760
This is the only way I can think of

833
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,559
to change our restaurant's future.

834
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,559
Alright.

835
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,880
Anyway, bro,

836
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,360
I'll support whatever you decide.

837
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,039
Our Hong Shiliu

838
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,800
should have its own path.

839
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,000
We need to break through.

840
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,320
I'll leave early tomorrow.

841
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,639
I'll try to be back the day after.

842
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,400
Bayar and I will go to Qitai with you.

843
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,599
You can drop us at Jiangbulake in Qitai.

844
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,159
Bayar.

845
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,880
Bayar.

846
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,280
Why go to Jiangbulake?

847
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,519
Aisha.

848
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,000
I know.

849
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,760
You want me to relax.

850
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,119
But look at the timing.

851
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,119
I'm not in the mood.

852
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,440
Who'll run the restaurant if I leave?

853
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,119
Go ahead, you should go.

854
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,000
I'll take care of the restaurant.

855
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,079
We always say we'll go,

856
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,079
we planned it ten years ago.

857
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,480
But we never made it.

858
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,559
Either you couldn't get away,

859
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,800
or I couldn't leave.

860
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,079
Bayar.

861
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,320
It's not me taking you to relax,

862
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,400
it's you coming with me to see.

863
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,159
Let's go.

864
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,440
We

865
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,920
should live our own lives.

866
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,119
Forget about those little ingrates.

867
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,079
This little ingrate wants to go too.

868
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,199
Will you take me with you?

869
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,599
I don't want to serve certain people.

870
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,199
What are you saying?

871
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,599
Jiangbulake.

872
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,960
You've gone there with friends plenty.

873
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,639
Just stay in the kitchen.

874
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,519
Aisha.

875
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:09,079
Bayar.

876
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,159
You two should go on

877
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,000
what young people call

878
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,679
what is it—

879
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,639
a "spur-of-the-moment trip."

880
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,119
Yeah, that.

881
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,199
Arguing won't solve anything.

882
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,920
This is different.

883
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,960
None of us can compromise.

884
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,039
Hello, Dean Gao.

885
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,639
Okay.

886
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,880
Alright, alright, I got it.

887
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,480
Okay.

888
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,000
What's wrong?

889
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,119
Dean Gao informed me.

890
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,039
He asked Li Zhe and me to go to Jiangbulake.

891
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,079
To check the status of the deer population.

892
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:57,039
How about this?

893
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,159
You swap with Li Zhe.

894
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,239
Come on the business trip with me.

895
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,199
Maybe after two days apart,

896
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,519
Bayar misses you.

897
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,599
She won't be so mad anymore.

898
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:05,599
Jiangbulake.

899
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:09,920
I'm not going.

900
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,199
My mom's going to Jiangbulake tomorrow too.

901
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:16,599
I wanted to talk to you about Yueyue.

902
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:17,920
Yueyue...

903
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,000
I took beatings for her as a kid.

904
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,519
Grew up shielding her from trouble.

905
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,119
She doesn't even tell us when she's dating.

906
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,559
Maybe she's afraid you'll be like before,

907
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,039
scaring Li Guangtian off in your own way.

908
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,599
She was so young back then.

909
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,119
It affected her studies.

910
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,280
You have no idea.

911
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,920
Since she was little,

912
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,199
Yueyue's admirers lined up to Erdaoqiao.

913
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,320
Who would've thought she'd find a boyfriend

914
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,440
out on the Gobi Desert.

915
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,920
When I first worked with Yueyue,

916
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,119
I thought she was still

917
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,559
that fragile little princess.

918
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,400
But after working together longer,

919
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,719
I realized she has her own ideas.

920
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,760
And she's really capable.

921
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,960
Our rescue center is short-staffed.

922
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
So Yueyue often wears many hats.

923
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,760
When we leave things to her,

924
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,960
we all feel at ease.

925
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,800
She...

926
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:04,599
Hu Yue.

927
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,280
Yes.

928
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,880
She's truly capable.

929
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,079
She staged a whole drama herself.

930
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,599
Got all of us involved in it.

931
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,800
Li Guangtian really cares about her.

932
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
Even if they're in the same city,

933
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,760
not everyone is as attentive as he is.

934
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,119
We all joke that

935
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,239
the delivery station is made just for Yueyue.

936
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,960
All the female colleagues envy her.

937
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,039
I'm such a failure as her brother.

938
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,119
I don't know anything.

939
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,280
She's already an adult.

940
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,119
Love is her own choice.

941
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,079
Telling us is her choice too.

942
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,320
But family should at least check things out.

943
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,119
Isn't dating her own business?

944
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,079
As long as she's happy, that's enough.

945
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,000
Even if you've met the guy,

946
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,440
can you guarantee she'll be happy forever?

947
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,000
Everyone has their own taste.

948
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,599
What you like

949
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,119
isn't necessarily what she likes.

950
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,800
And even if she chooses wrong,

951
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,480
it's still her own business.

952
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,480
Maybe it's because my dad

953
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,880
rarely interfered with my choices.

954
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,039
I'm just projecting my own experience.

955
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,679
You're right too.

956
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,440
Maybe these are just two

957
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,519
completely different views on love.

958
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,159
By the way,

959
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,119
Did you want to talk about something else?

960
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,079
Nothing much.

961
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:36,280
Just wanted to talk about Yueyue.

962
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,239
Yue...

963
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,320
What's wrong?

964
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,639
Are you crying?

965
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,039
Did something happen?

966
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,519
My mom found out about us.

967
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,639
I'll take leave right now.

968
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,800
Buy a ticket and come see you.

969
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,199
If you come now, my mom will be angrier.

970
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,079
Just focus on your work.

971
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,199
I just want to be there for you.

972
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,719
Coming now would just make things worse.

973
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:37,960
Wait a little longer.

974
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,480
I'm hanging up.

975
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:04,960
The tank's full.

976
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,400
You can drive the car as you like.

977
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:07,480
And then?

978
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,119
Here are the notes you asked for.

979
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,480
Aisha's health has been good lately.

980
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,440
Nothing special to watch out for.

981
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,480
Just in case,

982
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,760
I've written down some first aid tips.

983
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,199
That's thorough.

984
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Making up for past mistakes.

985
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:23,159
By the way,

986
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,079
Guess who I ran into at the gas station today?

987
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:25,760
Who?

988
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:26,679
Nana.

989
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,920
She's going to Jiangbulake Grassland for work tomorrow.

990
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:30,800
You two are headed the same way.

991
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,599
You can go together.

992
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,159
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

993
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:12,239
Let's go together.

994
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,920
No need, I still have work.

995
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:28,800
It's not convenient.

996
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:35,960
Take care on the road.

997
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:37,119
Good night.
