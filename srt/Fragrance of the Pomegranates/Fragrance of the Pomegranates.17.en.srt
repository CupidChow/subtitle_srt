1
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:10,519
Mom

2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,080
What pattern is this?

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,320
It's a pomegranate.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,519
This fabric feels so smooth.

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,320
It's really comfortable.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,719
This isn't ordinary fabric.

7
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,440
It's Adilais Silk.

8
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,559
Mom's wedding dress.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,600
So beautiful.

10
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,039
Did Dad give it to you?

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,799
It was from someone else important.

12
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,680
Sister Hatiman.

13
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,599
Sister Hatiman.

14
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,759
Sister Hatiman.

15
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
Xu Lai.

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,280
No.

17
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,840
You're Secretary Xu, aren't you?

18
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,599
You two know each other?

19
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,039
Yes.

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,639
Sister Hatiman.

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,599
So you didn't invest that one million?

22
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,439
Ha, Sister Hatiman.

23
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,080
That one million.

24
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,280
Did you give it to the restaurant?

25
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,479
What about this one million?

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,560
It was when I divorced An Dong.

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,599
Splitting my assets.

28
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,039
I didn't like how he ran things.

29
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,240
I worried something would go wrong.

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,879
So I never touched that money.

31
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,719
After Secretary Xu arrived,

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
he focused on saving our cooperative.

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,319
The cooperative is the village's mainstay.

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Mom was chosen as the legal representative.

35
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,800
I truly wanted

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,599
to invest this one million in the cooperative.

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,240
But...

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,080
An Dong caused big trouble again.

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,360
Most importantly,

40
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,439
the one affected was Aisha.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,080
I really couldn't just stand by.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,639
It's okay.

43
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,639
I'll think of another way.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,639
As for me,

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,280
I happened to contact my old factory boss.

46
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,240
Boss Qian.

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,879
I briefly told him

48
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,360
about our cooperative's situation.

49
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,520
He

50
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,879
agreed to meet with us.

51
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,080
He's on a business trip in Chengdu now.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
Before returning to Jiangsu,

53
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,360
he'll fly here once.

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
He should arrive this afternoon.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,080
If we can make this deal,

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
there'll be plenty of orders.

57
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,240
Alright.

58
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,280
Let's try to secure the orders first.

59
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Then, Sister Hatiman,

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,639
please send me Boss Qian's info.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,879
I'll do some research in advance.

62
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,360
Okay.

63
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,719
Alright, you two talk.

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm leaving.

65
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,639
Hurry up.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,360
Let's go.

67
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,959
Ming Liang.

68
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,360
This has nothing to do with you.

69
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,959
Don't worry too much.

70
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,519
I...

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
I'll handle it.

72
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:28,920
Alright.

73
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:38,959
Secretary Xu.

74
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,959
The sheep's been found.

75
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,800
Come on.

76
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,800
Let's return it quickly.

77
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,079
I've checked it.

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,120
Its horn is injured.

79
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,839
It almost ran into the desert.

80
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,800
What's wrong with its leg?

81
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,680
You should check my legs instead.

82
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,040
I've run three times this month.

83
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,319
Tell the old man,

84
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,519
if it runs off again, don't look for it.

85
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,560
I'll buy him a well-behaved one.

86
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,399
Secretary Xu.

87
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,800
This guy's really pitiful.

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,959
It's about a girlfriend.

89
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,560
He can't find one.

90
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,519
He can't win fights with other rams.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,040
So he ran away in anger.

92
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,240
Alright, alright.

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,959
Return it to the old man quickly.

94
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,800
I'm off to eat.

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,519
It's midday.

96
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,240
I haven't even eaten yet.

97
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,399
Xu Lai.

98
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,680
What trouble is the cooperative facing?

99
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,839
I came to ask you

100
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,079
if I can help with anything.

101
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,959
This is an internal township matter.

102
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,639
It's not convenient to share with outsiders.

103
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,879
Ming Liang.

104
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,439
I know about you and Nana.

105
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,120
I respect Nana's choice.

106
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,079
I do have feelings.

107
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,000
But they're not directed at you.

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,439
It's not because I can't let Nana go.

109
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,319
It's because of that money.

110
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,439
It affects all of Yipoke Township.

111
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,319
And its future development.

112
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,199
I hope you understand.

113
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:43,879
I know.

114
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,800
Your company,

115
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
mainly targets

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,439
young urban consumers.

117
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,759
Adilais Silk is a traditional craft,

118
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,639
but in recent years,

119
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,959
it's been trying

120
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,000
to blend with modern fashion.

121
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:54,680
See,

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,879
these big brands

123
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,639
also use Adilais Silk elements.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,199
The traditional pattern craft,

125
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,959
is truly exquisite.

126
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,879
But,

127
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,319
it's just too outdated.

128
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,360
It's hard to promote.

129
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,319
Hatiman,

130
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,120
you've worked at our factory

131
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,439
as a mid-level manager for years.

132
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
Your professional skills

133
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,680
I know them well.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
It's because I trust you

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,879
that I came here today.

136
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
You've worked in marketing for years.

137
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,759
You know better than anyone

138
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
old things,

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,679
no matter how good they are,

140
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,559
if there's no innovation,

141
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,440
they can't match modern tastes.

142
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,240
They'll definitely be eliminated.

143
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,320
Okay, Boss Qian.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,559
I'll discuss it with my mom.

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,679
It's just the timing.

146
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,679
Yes, Boss Qian.

147
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,559
Please give us a bit more time.

148
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,320
We can improve this design plan.

149
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,200
Right now,

150
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,799
time is the one thing I can't give.

151
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,120
The market competition is fierce.

152
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,440
I don't have time

153
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,639
to wait for your redesign.

154
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,679
Secretary Xu,

155
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,759
sorry.

156
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,000
Sorry, sorry.

157
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,200
So,

158
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,000
right now,

159
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,559
I need to visit other factories.

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
I won't take up your time.

161
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,759
Boss Qian, please wait a moment.

162
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,639
We

163
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,360
have a finished design draft.

164
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
I'll go get it now.

165
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,120
Xiao Ai, come here.

166
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,879
Quickly,

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,679
let Boss Qian try our Hotan herbal tea.

168
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,120
No matter what it takes,

169
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
we must make him stay.

170
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,759
Grandma Parida,

171
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,080
can you make this pattern?

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Is it possible to make?

173
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,799
It's self-designed.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,360
Yes.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,679
We have so many Atlas silk patterns.

176
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,000
None of them appeal to you?

177
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,440
No,

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,559
I just want to make

179
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,440
one I designed myself.

180
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,120
He's trying to please his girlfriend.

181
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,879
A unique one shows sincerity.

182
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,679
Let me take a good look.

183
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,679
Hatiman,

184
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,320
what's up with this car?

185
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,879
Uh, uh...

186
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,080
Can you ask him to move it?

187
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,960
Let me out first.

188
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,440
Okay.

189
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,360
I'll talk to him.

190
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,759
Boss Qian looks so serious.

191
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,759
How did you work under him

192
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,799
for so many years?

193
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,879
What did he say?

194
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
He praised you.

195
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,559
Said you're dignified.

196
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,879
You look like a cultured businessman.

197
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,120
He also said you're my friend.

198
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,559
I'm his friend.

199
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,200
A friend's friend is a friend.

200
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,320
So he plans

201
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,080
to treat you to roast whole lamb.

202
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,320
With our unique Hotan method,

203
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,320
stuffing lamb fat in the belly,

204
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,960
piyazi (Xinjiang dialect for onion),

205
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,320
then roasting it.

206
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
The skin turns golden and crispy.

207
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,320
It's really delicious.

208
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,440
So, so tasty.

209
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,159
That's too kind.

210
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,840
So warm.

211
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,720
He said so much.

212
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,840
I just polished it a bit.

213
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,799
Xiangxiang is for tourists' photos.

214
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,799
It's not for eating.

215
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,600
What did he say?

216
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,960
He, he said

217
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,480
he specially found you

218
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,600
an unmarried lamb.

219
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,080
It's our highest honor.

220
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,960
for welcoming distinguished guests.

221
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,559
Thank you, thank you.

222
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,919
I appreciate your hospitality.

223
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,559
But I'm really in a hurry.

224
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,559
I...

225
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,320
This lamb,

226
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,159
I'll buy it.

227
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,559
I'll take it away.

228
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,960
Move your car.

229
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm leaving first.

230
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,200
I'll tell him.

231
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,919
I'll tell him.

232
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,679
If you really make him stay,

233
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,080
what if he eats Xiangxiang?

234
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,480
Don't worry, bro.

235
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,960
We won't eat your lamb.

236
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,559
Mingliang,

237
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,440
Mingliang.

238
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,679
Nana.

239
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,279
Let me borrow this painting.

240
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,279
I'll explain later.

241
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,159
Xu.

242
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,960
Hello, Ankaer.

243
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,679
Bro,

244
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,600
let me tell you,

245
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,320
Fang Tao, that jerk,

246
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,440
opened a knockoff of our restaurant.

247
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,440
I'll show you.

248
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,320
Boss Qian, Boss Qian

249
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,200
Jump, jump, jump

250
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,960
I—I'm in a hurry

251
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,320
That's how warm we are in Xinjiang

252
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,679
Th-this...

253
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,440
If I'd known you'd go this far

254
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
to get what you want

255
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,159
Back then,

256
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,559
I shouldn't have let you quit

257
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,320
Oh, come on, Boss Qian

258
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,080
If we work together this time

259
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,840
I'll work for you in Hetian too

260
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,799
Alright, alright

261
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,440
Secretary Xu

262
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,039
Sister Hatiman and I

263
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
managed to keep Boss Qian here

264
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,559
Good

265
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:35,840
Boss Qian

266
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,440
Boss Qian

267
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,960
So that's how you kept me here

268
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,279
Sister Hatiman came up with the idea

269
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,159
She invited her warmest Xinjiang friends

270
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,320
So warm, so warm

271
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,279
But I'm in a hurry

272
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,200
I have to go

273
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,320
Boss Qian, sorry to keep you waiting

274
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,200
Sorry for the wait

275
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,679
Secretary Xu

276
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
You all are just too warm

277
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,960
Yes, yes

278
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,960
Boss Qian, take a look at this

279
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,039
Take a look

280
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,480
This—this is interesting

281
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,720
Your Atlas silk before

282
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
was too bold in color

283
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,200
But this design

284
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,799
keeps the Atlas silk elements

285
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,080
and adds a lot of trendy touches

286
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,039
Young women will definitely love it

287
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,320
I've been in silk for years

288
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,200
Never thought about this direction

289
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,480
Nice, nice, very nice

290
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,679
This is good

291
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,320
Just—just this one?

292
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,080
Yes

293
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,559
To be honest, Boss Qian

294
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,200
This designer

295
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,799
is a big name

296
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
Very gifted artistically

297
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,919
And knows Xinjiang's culture

298
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,039
extremely well

299
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,919
It took me ages to get him on board

300
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,440
Our budget

301
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,799
only covers this one design

302
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,200
I understand, I do

303
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,200
But if we want to work together

304
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,320
One design isn't nearly enough

305
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,039
Yes, yes

306
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
If in the future

307
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,080
your designs can all

308
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,559
keep this style

309
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,840
and add trendy elements

310
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,080
I'll order more from you

311
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,799
It's possible

312
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,440
That's all we need to hear

313
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,080
Good

314
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,080
Goodbye, Boss Qian

315
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,159
Make more designs

316
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,320
Next time, I'll treat you to roast lamb

317
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,600
How was that, Secretary Xu?

318
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,200
Did I act well just now?

319
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,559
This is—

320
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,559
His name is Muzapati

321
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,039
He's from Hetian

322
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,200
the best travel photographer here

323
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,200
Hello, hello

324
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,960
Thank you

325
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,679
Thank you so much

326
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,960
No problem, it's my duty

327
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,440
Call me if you need anything

328
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm always available

329
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,480
Alright

330
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:29,960
Thank you, thank you

331
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,679
We're leaving, Secretary Xu

332
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,559
Goodbye, goodbye

333
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,200
Goodbye

334
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,080
Alright, let's go

335
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,960
Secretary Xu

336
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
Between you and Ming Liang

337
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,440
I feel like there's something going on

338
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,080
Mingliang, did you see that?

339
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,960
No wonder Buli was surprised.

340
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200
He even came to congratulate us.

341
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,039
He said they opened some kind of branch.

342
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,159
I was all muddle-headed about it.

343
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,080
I didn't figure it out.

344
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,159
Now I finally get it.

345
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:03,639
Come on.

346
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,120
Look at the color of that door.

347
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,480
And that signboard.

348
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,559
Hong Shiliu

349
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,240
It's exactly the same as ours.

350
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,399
What Hong Shiliu?

351
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,559
Why do they get to call it Hong Shiliu?

352
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,879
Isn't this just copying?

353
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,799
Can we sue them?

354
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,200
Is it possible to sue them?

355
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,320
It's not Hong Shiliu.

356
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,200
Look, everyone.

357
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
There's a dot in the middle.

358
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,679
A lot of knockoff shops do this.

359
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,799
It's hard to sue for this, kind of tricky.

360
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,440
Seems like it.

361
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:26,960
Yeah.

362
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,080
There really is a dot.

363
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,720
Wait, wait.

364
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,080
Let me take a closer look.

365
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,279
Ankar

366
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,679
Check out that sign.

367
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,679
Did you see it?

368
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,799
I saw it.

369
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,399
Just like the one at our place.

370
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,919
The free Aisha pilaf sign.

371
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,799
It's exactly the same.

372
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,080
Mingliang, look quickly.

373
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,679
Even the one they use

374
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,320
Our Aisha free sign

375
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,799
is just like ours.

376
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,840
They even copied this.

377
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Using Aisha's goodwill sign for business.

378
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,440
They've got no conscience at all.

379
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,200
Dad, dad.

380
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,440
Keep your voice down.

381
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,080
Mulati, Dad.

382
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,440
Please don't get worked up.

383
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,440
Everyone's watching us.

384
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,200
They're hoping we'll make a scene.

385
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,799
Can't curse.

386
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,440
Can't fight.

387
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,080
Can't sue either.

388
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,799
Isn't this just bullying?

389
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,799
Don't say anything.

390
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:04,960
They've spotted us.

391
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,559
Ankar.

392
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,799
I said, take notes.

393
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,799
Got it, I'll note it down.

394
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,559
Come on, hurry up.

395
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,679
First,

396
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,080
Take clear photos of all the evidence.

397
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,200
Signboard.

398
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,840
Menu.

399
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,320
Dishes.

400
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,960
Flyers.

401
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,200
Don't miss a single thing.

402
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,279
Second,

403
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,320
Contact Hu Dad.

404
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,679
He knows a lawyer.

405
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,200
Ask about defending our restaurant's rights.

406
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,679
Bro, wait, wait.

407
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,960
Can you explain slowly?

408
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,440
My mind is totally blank right now.

409
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,080
I can't remember all this.

410
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,559
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,799
Slow down, slow down.

412
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,960
Wait, what was the second thing?

413
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,320
We agreed you'd run the restaurant.

414
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
But here I am giving orders again.

415
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:34,440
Ankar.

416
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,840
Tell us what you think.

417
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,960
My thoughts?

418
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
As soon as I got here,

419
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,039
I saw this restaurant.

420
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:41,840
Now I'm all flustered.

421
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
I don't even know what to say.

422
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,960
I have no ideas right now.

423
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,960
Don't panic yet.

424
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,960
Just think it through.

425
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,960
No rush.

426
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,720
Bro.

427
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,559
I've realized now

428
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm really not cut out to be the boss.

429
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,840
Who says that?

430
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,960
When we renovated the restaurant,

431
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,080
your ideas were great.

432
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,679
Bro.

433
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,480
I was just pretending.

434
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,399
Just messing around.

435
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,440
Otherwise, how could

436
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
things get so messed up?

437
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,480
Let me tell you all,

438
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,599
if you ever have something really big,

439
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,960
don't ever put me in charge.

440
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,799
I'm afraid I'll mess it up for you.

441
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,799
This Fang Tao issue

442
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,559
won't be solved in a day or two.

443
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,319
Let's take it slow.

444
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,079
But right now, there's one thing

445
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,799
you need to decide.

446
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,440
An Dong went back early.

447
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,960
He guessed Fang Tao would cause trouble.

448
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
He said he wanted to help out.

449
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,799
But whether he stays or goes,

450
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,319
it's up to you.

451
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:29,839
An Dong.

452
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,559
I don't want to see him again.

453
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,319
Bro.

454
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,319
You decide this.

455
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
You're in charge now.

456
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,160
It's your call.

457
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,559
Let me think about it.

458
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,680
Take your time.

459
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,079
Stay calm, don't panic.

460
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,319
I'll be back as soon as I can.

461
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,079
Okay.

462
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,440
I've got something to handle here.

463
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:54,960
I'll hang up now.

464
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Are you Mr. Mingliang?

465
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,319
Secretary Xu asks you to come over.

466
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,319
Mr. Mingliang.

467
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,319
I heard you.

468
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,680
He should come himself.

469
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,839
Secretary Xu was worried you'd be upset.

470
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,319
He asked me to explain first.

471
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,319
He'll apologize to you in person soon.

472
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,640
Go and check it out.

473
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,279
We'll talk about the restaurant later.

474
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,160
Talk it out calmly.

475
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,160
Don't argue.

476
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,799
The specific situation

477
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,200
you already know as well.

478
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,200
Taking your painting

479
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,200
was thoughtless of me.

480
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
But it all happened so fast,

481
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,599
I didn't have time to explain.

482
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,720
Is Secretary Xu asking me for help?

483
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
If you're willing to do the series design,

484
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,559
you set the design fee.

485
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,599
Copyright stays with you.

486
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,440
We only want priority production rights.

487
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,079
Secretary Xu is really flexible.

488
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,599
But I have a lot to handle at my restaurant.

489
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,960
I have to go back early tomorrow.

490
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,319
I can't take this job.

491
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,039
If you need,

492
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,519
I can recommend a designer to you.

493
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,119
But they want your work.

494
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,359
No one else will do.

495
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:24,960
Ming Liang

496
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,279
Unless I have no other choice,

497
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,920
I wouldn't ask you.

498
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,440
The pattern design for that painting,

499
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,400
I can draw it for you separately.

500
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
But for the series design,

501
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,839
I really don't have time.

502
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,160
Or the energy.

503
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:46,920
Sketchbook

504
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,720
Alright.

505
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,279
I won't take advantage of you.

506
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
You'll get the design fee.

507
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,160
Don't worry, it's not broken.

508
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,039
What does that mean?

509
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,200
What do you mean?

510
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,960
What does this mean?

511
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,400
This is Aman’s notebook.

512
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,759
You both have the same notebook.

513
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,640
Aman was here.

514
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,599
Probably took the wrong one.

515
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Aman isn't home.

516
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,759
No one at her classmate’s house either.

517
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,480
Abu, hurry up!

518
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
This is Sister Zhang’s car.

519
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,480
She delivers to the county’s restaurants

520
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,119
with beef every day.

521
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
I know where Aman is.

522
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,160
I’ll go to the county.

523
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,680
Secretary

524
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,960
Our car was lent out.

525
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,920
I’ll drive you there.

526
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,680
Hurry up.

527
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,200
Hello.

528
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,200
Hello.

529
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,200
Hello, ma’am.

530
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,640
Your child is over one point two meters.

531
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,680
You need to buy a full ticket.

532
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,960
What child?

533
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,359
Your child.

534
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,720
She’s not my child.

535
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,640
Little one,

536
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,920
isn't this your mom?

537
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,440
Aman

538
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,119
Uncle Xu

539
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,039
How did you get here by yourself?

540
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,039
Uncle Xu

541
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,440
Can you take me to Urumqi?

542
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
I want to see my mom.

543
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,519
I have money.

544
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,039
I can buy my own ticket.

545
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,720
Aman

546
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,880
Let’s go back first.

547
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,200
Why wasn’t this child watched?

548
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,119
What if she got lost?

549
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,200
Sorry.

550
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,960
Sorry for the trouble.

551
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,680
Sorry.

552
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,839
Come on, come on.

553
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,240
Come on, let’s keep checking tickets.

554
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,000
Aman

555
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,680
I’m not leaving.

556
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,839
I want to find my mom.

557
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,640
I dealt with kids a lot in college.

558
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,440
Let me try.

559
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,960
Aman

560
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,680
You’re a brave boy.

561
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,960
You need to behave.

562
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,279
I’m a girl.

563
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,440
See, my clothes are all pink.

564
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,839
Can’t you tell?

565
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,519
It’s grandma’s fault.

566
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,000
She cut my hair.

567
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
When mom was home,

568
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,000
she always braided my hair nicely.

569
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,960
I miss my mom.

570
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,680
I want to go find my mom.

571
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
Ming Liang, I miss my mom.

572
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,160
I...

573
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
I want to go find her.

574
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,440
Nana, don’t cry.

575
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:38,680
Come here.

576
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,160
Aman, it’s okay.

577
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,279
It’s all right.

578
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:42,720
How about this—

579
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,359
Does this sound good?

580
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,160
Uncle promises you,

581
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,960
this weekend,

582
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,440
Uncle will take you to Urumqi to find your mom.

583
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,039
Okay?

584
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,279
Really?

585
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,240
Of course it’s true.

586
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,480
When has Uncle ever lied to you?

587
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:19,880
Sorry about that.

588
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,920
I didn't realize Aman was a girl.

589
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,039
She used to wear lots of little braids.

590
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,519
Then,

591
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,440
her parents left for Urumqi to work.

592
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,680
Her grandma found washing her hair troublesome.

593
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,920
She cut it while Aman was asleep.

594
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,640
Can't really blame grandma.

595
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,279
She's getting old.

596
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,400
She can barely care for herself.

597
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,200
How could she look after a child?

598
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,279
So how did you know she'd go to the station?

599
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,160
Because of her drawing.

600
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,480
Aman still looks lovely now.

601
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,680
Look, uncle's hair is even shorter than yours.

602
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Doesn't it look good too?

603
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,640
But...

604
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,039
But Secretary Xu's haircut is the ugliest.

605
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,279
Looks like a sheep chewed it.

606
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,160
Alright.

607
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,599
I had a dream last night.

608
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,160
I dreamed my mom came back.

609
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,440
I went to the bus station to meet her.

610
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,359
She brought me lots of pretty hair clips.

611
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,400
One was a glowing butterfly clip.

612
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,720
This big.

613
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,200
Pink.

614
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,279
But I don't have long hair anymore.

615
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:43,759
So Aman,

616
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,279
just draw this dream.

617
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,839
Show it to your mom when she returns.

618
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,640
How about that?

619
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,720
When mom sees the drawing,

620
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,920
she'll know I miss her every day.

621
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,880
Then she won't leave again.

622
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,920
Right?

623
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
As parents,

624
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,000
how could they not know their child is hurting?

625
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,039
But there's nothing they can do.

626
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,240
They really can't come back.

627
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,960
Even on weekends,

628
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
if Aman visits her mom,

629
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,960
it's just a temporary fix.

630
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,039
That's why you want

631
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,200
to make the cooperative succeed.

632
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,240
So they can earn money at home.

633
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:18,440
Yes.

634
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,720
Aman has a close friend.

635
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Her mom also gets patterns from the cooperative.

636
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,680
She makes Adilais Silk at home.

637
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,519
But business isn't good.

638
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:30,880
She can't make money.

639
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,000
She's mentioned it to me more than once.

640
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,880
She wants to quit.

641
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,000
Go work elsewhere.

642
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,519
If she leaves too,

643
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,640
her child

644
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,759
might become the next Aman.

645
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,200
We grew up with our parents around,

646
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,440
so it's hard to understand how Aman feels.

647
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:58,599
You know,

648
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,960
that day,

649
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,160
Aman held her hair in her hands,

650
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,400
crying,

651
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,039
begging me to put it back.

652
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,720
It broke my heart.

653
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,440
I thought,

654
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,519
no matter what,

655
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,440
I must make the cooperative work.

656
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,960
So her mom can come home.

657
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,200
That feeling you described,

658
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:28,920
I understand it.

659
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,400
Xu Lai,

660
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,039
about this,

661
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,960
I'll think it over carefully.

662
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,440
Child,

663
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,640
Mom doesn't understand art.

664
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,920
But mom knows

665
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,640
when you're upset,

666
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,160
you can't make tasty pilaf.

667
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,039
I really was too impatient.

668
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,720
Ming Liang,

669
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,039
stay in Hetian.

670
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,680
When Hong Shiliu was struggling most,

671
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,519
Sister Hatiman gave a million

672
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,440
to help us keep our home.

673
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
We should help her keep her home too.

674
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Not just Sister Hatiman.

675
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,240
If we save the cooperative,

676
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,279
we can save more

677
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,960
homes for kids like Aman.

678
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,160
You actually know deep down.

679
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:54,960
You've already made your choice.

680
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,359
But about the restaurant,

681
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,720
I'm still really worried.

682
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,440
Then you really can't go back.

683
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,160
Ankar relies on you a lot now.

684
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,759
If you go back,

685
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,200
he'll listen to you for everything.

686
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,039
He'll be even less likely to decide for himself.

687
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,960
He's a boy.

688
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,680
He can't always hide behind his brother.

689
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,440
You're right.

690
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,960
He should face things on his own.

691
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:27,680
But...

692
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,160
I can't just wash my hands of it.

693
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,440
I've already contacted

694
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,680
Hu Baba's lawyer friend.

695
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,000
Asked him to look over

696
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,359
An Dong's investment contract.

697
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,119
He got back to me saying

698
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,279
the contract does have loopholes.

699
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,480
Evidence.

700
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,480
The compensation amount in the contract is unreasonable.

701
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,200
We can start from that point.

702
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,880
This time our restaurant is opening.

703
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,759
I can't feel happy at all.

704
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,279
Originally, our restaurant's sign

705
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:02,240
should be called Hong Shiliu No. 1 Branch.

706
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,039
But in the end,

707
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,039
these tough folks

708
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,200
actually scraped together three million.

709
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,200
They really managed to hold on.

710
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,640
Our restaurant's sign

711
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,279
can only be called just Hong Shiliu.

712
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:17,680
Boss Fang,

713
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,640
the name is so similar.

714
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,480
Won't we get sued for this?

715
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,960
Jianping,

716
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
you know,

717
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,720
you're a good person,

718
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,200
but you're too timid.

719
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,200
Even if they want to sue us,

720
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,440
it's hard for them to gather evidence.

721
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,519
The process is slow, too.

722
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,400
If that kid really has evidence,

723
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,640
it'll take at least two or three years.

724
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,240
They paid us this three million,

725
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,920
no idea how they scraped it together.

726
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,920
Where did they get it from?

727
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,640
Plus, now the suppliers

728
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,440
are pushing them to settle up.

729
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,440
So tell me,

730
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,440
will they sue or protect their business?

731
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,720
Jianping,

732
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,160
even if we take a big step back,

733
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,480
what if they win the lawsuit?

734
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,200
By then, our profits

735
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,680
will have covered the compensation.

736
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,519
These country bumpkins

737
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,759
don't know business at all.

738
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,680
They just act on emotion.

739
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,200
Without An Dong,

740
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,160
they're nothing.

741
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,759
Ankar,

742
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,640
you promised your brother

743
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,440
to stay calm.

744
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,640
How can I stay calm?

745
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,240
Just looking at him annoys me.

746
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,160
Ankar,

747
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,480
Laomu,

748
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,200
don't hold him back.

749
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,759
If you want to hit me, go ahead.

750
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,680
I accept it.

751
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,440
I deserve all of this.

752
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,440
But I hope

753
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,680
after you hit me, you'll let me speak.

754
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,599
About how to solve the Fang Tao issue.

755
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,519
If you don't want me to stay,

756
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,640
I'll leave right now.

757
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,240
If you still do,

758
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,680
I'll do my best to help the restaurant.

759
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,680
You said you accept it.

760
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,640
Then remember this.

761
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
We didn't beat you this time

762
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,680
because everyone wants to give you a chance.

763
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,519
If you can't handle Fang Tao,

764
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,480
you won't escape a beating.

765
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,960
Go ahead,

766
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
how will you solve the problem?

767
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,480
If Fang Tao

768
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,960
takes the three million and leaves,

769
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,720
maybe

770
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,960
we'll just have to swallow the loss.

771
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,599
But he's greedy.

772
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,680
He opened a competing restaurant

773
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,680
to put us out of business.

774
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
But this actually gives us

775
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,480
a chance to strike back.

776
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
We can use

777
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,720
the anti-unfair competition law against him.

778
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,960
But the key is getting evidence.

779
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,240
Find where he

780
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,719
misleads customers

781
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,400
and maliciously copies us.

782
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,440
Would you

783
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,960
like to hear the details?

784
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,199
Your things are untouched.

785
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,480
You want to stay.

786
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,599
Then stay.

787
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,880
Mingliang,

788
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,960
Nana sent you a package.

789
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,199
Open it and take a look.

790
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,280
Nana—

791
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,239
How did she know about Aman?

792
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,159
You told her.

793
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,679
Nana kept asking

794
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,440
about you, in every way.

795
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,480
I need to stay here a few more days.

796
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,440
Nana,

797
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,679
I need your help.

798
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,199
What's wrong?

799
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,960
I'm helping them design

800
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,440
patterns for Adilais Silk.

801
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,440
But I feel something's missing.

802
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,519
This one

803
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,199
was inspired by Bogda Peak under pink sunset.

804
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,480
What do you think?

805
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
My mom told me a legend.

806
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,159
She said Adilais Silk's earliest inspiration

807
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,599
came from ripples on water.

808
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,880
If you imagine the pink sunset

809
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,519
as pink lake water,

810
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,639
and Bogda Peak as a stone dropped in,

811
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,320
wouldn't that be even better?

812
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,440
Cut it out.

813
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:54,719
When you come back,

814
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,960
we still need to talk.

815
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,960
You're right about everything.

816
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,000
Hetian—

817
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,760
What is he up to?

818
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,960
Their restaurant is almost crushed by me.

819
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,559
Why is Mingliang in Hetian

820
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,079
just painting so leisurely?

821
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:31,760
No, that's not right.

822
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,440
This isn't as simple as it seems.

823
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,480
What's he really planning?

824
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,079
You know, before,

825
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,119
we calculated

826
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,360
they couldn't get three million in ten days.

827
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,360
But that kid still managed to pull it off.

828
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,199
Mingliang is quite something.

829
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,559
Don't underestimate him.

830
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:02,599
Bro, look—

831
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,440
their decor here,

832
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,440
the dishes, the menu,

833
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,119
even the sign,

834
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,280
all copied from our restaurant.

835
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,159
Fang Tao is way too bold.

836
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,599
This one's pretty good.

837
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,519
The kitchen shot is clear, too.

838
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,280
This entrance—

839
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,360
Take another photo of it.

840
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,559
Alright.

841
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,360
Shoot one more, one more.

842
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,119
Film the whole thing.

843
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,039
An Dong.

844
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,440
That's enough filming, right?

845
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,440
What do you want?

846
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,079
Here's the thing, An Dong.

847
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,119
Fang Tao gave special instructions.

848
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,519
He insists you catch up with him.

849
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,159
Fang Tao.

850
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,079
We have an honored guest.

851
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,960
An Dong.

852
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,039
So many talented people from Jiangdong.

853
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,320
A comeback might be in the cards.

854
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,280
What wind

855
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,320
blew An Dong here today?

856
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,559
Fang Tao.

857
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,440
An Dong is really interested

858
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,480
in our restaurant.

859
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,239
He's been filming downstairs nonstop.

860
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,039
An Dong.

861
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,239
I always thought you were smart.

862
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,639
Why use such a dumb way

863
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,519
to film my restaurant?

864
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,880
And you drank, too.

865
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,320
I thought after talking with Fang Tao so long,

866
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,239
you'd switched sides,

867
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,400
joined forces with him.

868
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,800
Their Hong Shiliu restaurant

869
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,880
won't last much longer.

870
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,440
And you're still working for him.

871
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,440
What's the point?

872
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,840
At least he

873
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,000
helped pay off three million for me.

874
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,079
I have to work for them

875
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,519
to pay off my debt.

876
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
But me, An Dong,

877
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,119
I'm confident

878
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
if I want,

879
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,400
a second, third,

880
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,519
even a fourth Hong Shiliu,

881
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,320
I can open them all.

882
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:14,960
Alright.

883
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,800
That's what I admire about you.

884
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,760
Ming Liang still has time to paint in Hetian.

885
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,920
He's not cut out for business.

886
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,360
You and I,

887
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,280
strong together,

888
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,599
would be great.

889
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,480
If you join me,

890
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,920
I'll return those two million right away.

891
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,519
Fang Tao.

892
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:46,000
Don't set me up again.

893
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,000
Can you really pay me back?

894
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:49,920
Of course.

895
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,519
I gave you a chance before.

896
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
This is the second time.

897
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,320
Third time's the charm. It's your choice.

898
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,000
Hey, Baokun.

899
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,360
What do you mean by this?

900
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:11,920
Where's An Dong?

901
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,360
To keep his taste sharp,

902
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,079
he never touches alcohol.

903
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,440
I've known him nearly ten years.

904
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,960
Big and small dinners,

905
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,599
we've attended plenty together.

906
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,880
I've never seen him drink.

907
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,880
He never does things just to please others.

908
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,360
Alright.

909
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,920
I get it.

910
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,119
An Dong.

911
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,000
My door

912
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,440
is always open for you.

913
00:41:58,039 --> 00:41:59,320
Do you think he'll believe it?

914
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,000
Just play along.

915
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,760
Make him drop his guard.

916
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:09,440
Let's stick to the plan.

917
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,079
I've found something even bigger.

918
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,519
When the time comes,

919
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,039
I'll tell Ming Liang too.

920
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,760
Take me to get some antacid first.

921
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,280
I'm really uncomfortable.

922
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:26,920
Fang Tao.

923
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,280
Can we trust what he says?

924
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,400
Herbal tea with baked naan

925
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,599
is the classic Hetian breakfast.

926
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,000
My mom's from Hetian.

927
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,480
That's right.

928
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,719
We gathered veteran tea masters from the herbal tea factory.

929
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,360
They serve tea for free at the Grand Bazaar.

930
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,119
I'll have Aizezi pack some for you to take back.

931
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,599
Try it at your restaurant.

932
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,679
If it tastes good,

933
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,880
make it your restaurant's specialty.

934
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,000
It'll help the tea factory too.

935
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,719
Thank you.

936
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:01,119
You've changed a lot.

937
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,760
A lot.

938
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,800
What's wrong?

939
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,079
Darker.

940
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,519
Uglier.

941
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,320
More rustic.

942
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,280
No.

943
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,119
Your personality.

944
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,119
We haven't spent much time together,

945
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,719
but back in Urumqi,

946
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,400
you seemed humble,

947
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,199
but always felt above everyone.

948
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:22,840
Now,

949
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,800
you're more down-to-earth.

950
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,320
Alright.

951
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:30,760
I'll take that as a compliment.

952
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:33,920
So,

953
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,599
