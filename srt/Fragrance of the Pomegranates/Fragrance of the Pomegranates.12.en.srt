1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,720
Kid

2
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,320
What are you doing?

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:12,800
Auntie

4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,480
What is a Ferris wheel?

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,920
A Ferris wheel...

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,120
It's like this:

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,399
It has a huge wheel

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,679
with colorful cabins hanging on it.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,760
You sit inside one

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,640
and it goes round and round.

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,240
It's like walking in the sky.

12
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,039
Then when I grow up, I want to be a teacher

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,560
and take my students

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,600
to walk in the sky.

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,079
What's your name?

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,880
Mayila

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,280
Your dream will come true.

18
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
I saw the starry sky you mentioned.

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,680
It's beautiful.

20
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,280
I wish you were here.

21
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,840
Why did you come?

22
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,120
How did you get here?

23
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,960
Mayila said the lamb here is great.

24
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,000
So I came to check out the lamb

25
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,840
and see you.

26
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,599
Not bad.

27
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,960
You watch the stars alone on the grassland at night—

28
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,719
Aren't you afraid of wolves?

29
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,319
I know the wolf king.

30
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,479
Really?

31
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,360
If that really happened to you,

32
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,360
I could actually believe it.

33
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,560
I'm not as amazing as you think.

34
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,919
Back then, we were by the Southern Xinjiang highway

35
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,199
when we met again.

36
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,919
You said you were half an artist.

37
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,280
Honestly, I felt the same way then.

38
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,000
It felt like everything I wanted to do was only half done.

39
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,199
No,

40
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,160
I didn't even get halfway.

41
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,480
So what do you want to do?

42
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,639
There are so many things I want to do.

43
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,079
I want to improve my medical skills

44
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,560
so I can solve any difficult case.

45
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,399
Or maybe

46
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,839
have an ambulance

47
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,279
or a helicopter.

48
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,600
When animals need surgery,

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,279
I could operate right away.

50
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,160
Or quickly transfer them.

51
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Meteor

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,560
It's gone.

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,560
So fast.

54
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,120
Didn't even have time to make a wish.

55
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,439
What's this?

56
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,680
Meteorite.

57
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,439
It's a local specialty.

58
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,879
An eternal meteor.

59
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
You can make a wish anytime.

60
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,240
Put it on me.

61
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,120
You know,

62
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,680
when I watched the stars before,

63
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,560
I didn't feel it.

64
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,240
But today, waiting for you,

65
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,000
I suddenly felt

66
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,279
so small all of a sudden.

67
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,720
Like a speck of dust in the vast universe.

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,279
I feel the same way.

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,439
But I hope

70
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,560
even small as we are,

71
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,839
we can still shine a faint light.

72
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,439
Soulmate

73
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,800
What does that mean?

74
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,240
It's Kazakh.

75
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
It means fellow traveler.

76
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,879
And also beloved.

77
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Old Liu

78
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,279
I was just about to call you.

79
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,720
How did you know I was in Xinjiang?

80
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
I didn't—I wasn't trying to hide it.

81
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,000
I...

82
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,040
Okay.

83
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,519
Okay.

84
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,079
Definitely.

85
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:03,680
Bro

86
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,800
What are you doing?

87
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,680
Nothing.

88
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,279
Tired from checking the accounts.

89
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:10,959
Just stretching a bit.

90
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,920
What did Ming Liang say?

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,360
He already found a buyer.

92
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,759
Everything's settled.

93
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,240
Bro

94
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,319
Let me tell you,

95
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,079
my mind today

96
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,199
was full of your business plans.

97
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,639
The more I think, the more excited I get.

98
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,480
Really.

99
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,439
No matter what my family says,

100
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,679
what I want to say is—

101
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,159
I want to work with you.

102
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,639
I believe in you, bro.

103
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,080
You believe in me?

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,879
Then thank you.

105
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,960
I'm serious.

106
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,799
Just like you believe in me.

107
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,039
You need someone to support you now.

108
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,960
I want to fight alongside you.

109
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,519
Okay.

110
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,080
So how much savings do you have?

111
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,480
Sa—savings, well...

112
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,279
One thousand two hundred eighty-eight.

113
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,519
Thanks, comrade.

114
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,919
I can't really help you either.

115
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,919
But no matter what,

116
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,159
if you need me,

117
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,240
just call me anytime.

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,120
I'm off, bro.

119
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,159
Good luck.

120
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,240
How's it going?

121
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm planning in a couple days

122
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,720
to go to Urumqi for a visit.

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,679
It's all settled.

124
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
You can come anytime.

125
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,320
Let's go.

126
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,679
Let's go.

127
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,240
The morning air is so fresh.

128
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,440
Send it to A'isha Mom.

129
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,600
And to my girlfriend.

130
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,159
Alright, alright.

131
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,519
Don't you think Baheti is a bit odd?

132
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,080
What's up?

133
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,159
At first, about me buying lamb—

134
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,159
He was super enthusiastic.

135
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,799
But when I went to his place yesterday,

136
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,039
he didn't mention it at all.

137
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,399
No,

138
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,759
when you went yesterday,

139
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,679
you were a guest.

140
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,879
He had to host you.

141
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,919
But today, when you go,

142
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,039
it's business.

143
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,799
It's different.

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,879
I see.

145
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:01,799
What's wrong?

146
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,080
Is there something on my face?

147
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,919
Is he your beloved?

148
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,000
Huh?

149
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,440
Sadly, I'm not his beloved.

150
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,320
No way.

151
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,399
You can't hide the look of love.

152
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,399
It's impossible to hide.

153
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,159
He cares about you.

154
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,480
You still don't get men from the steppe.

155
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,639
If he admitted he liked me,

156
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,120
he wouldn't even let me refuse.

157
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,799
I wouldn't need to say a word.

158
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,679
Ming Liang,

159
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,360
analyze this for me.

160
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,840
If he doesn't like me,

161
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,399
I still feel

162
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,279
he treats me well.

163
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,440
Even tiny things, like a saddle coming apart—

164
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,200
I wouldn't notice,

165
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
but he does.

166
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,679
Did you ever ask why he turned you down

167
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,879
but still treats you well?

168
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,679
I did ask.

169
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,720
I asked him directly.

170
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,879
I said, "Do you like me?"

171
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,919
What did he say?

172
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,679
He said no.

173
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,440
He just said

174
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,559
he's grateful I helped with Bota.

175
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,759
That's all.

176
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,679
Do you think I'm silly too?

177
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,399
There's nothing silly about it.

178
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,399
Love is

179
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,720
always hard to explain.

180
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,799
As long as you're happy,

181
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:23,960
and

182
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,399
you don't lose yourself

183
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,240
just because you like him,

184
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,200
that's good.

185
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:27,960
Exactly.

186
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,440
I think so too.

187
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,000
I like him.

188
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,279
I also like

189
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,879
the me who likes him.

190
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,159
As long as he doesn't get married,

191
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,879
I'll keep liking him.

192
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,440
You think he can't accept you

193
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,559
because of his ex-wife?

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,399
Morning.

195
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,159
I've contacted several places for lamb.

196
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,679
After I take Bota to school,

197
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,679
I'll take you to see.

198
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,799
Great, thanks.

199
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,039
Ming Liang's business is my business.

200
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,399
You must pick the best for him.

201
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,720
I'm talking to you.

202
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:21,559
Okay.

203
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,519
Ming Liang, in a very short time,

204
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,200
turned things around.

205
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,559
He made the restaurant a hit.

206
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,279
So,

207
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,960
he's very picky about ingredients.

208
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,720
You must find him the best lamb.

209
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,679
He's also very loyal.

210
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,360
So, about money—

211
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,399
he'll be fair, right?

212
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,519
As long as the quality is good,

213
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,159
money's not a problem.

214
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,759
Mom.

215
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,879
Bota, sweetie.

216
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,919
Hello, Uncle Ming Liang.

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,480
Good morning.

218
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,159
Mom, are you taking me to school?

219
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:51,960
Yes, I'm taking you.

220
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,320
I've been taking you these days.

221
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,919
Okay?

222
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:54,679
Bota.

223
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,000
Mayila, it's fine.

224
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,679
You're busy with work.

225
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,320
Bota's fine now.

226
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,679
No need to take her anymore.

227
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,399
It's part of my job.

228
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,279
It's okay.

229
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,200
Mayila.

230
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,320
Bota's in kindergarten now.

231
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,039
Your job is done.

232
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,360
By the way,

233
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,559
How much is the drone?

234
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,799
I'll transfer it to you.

235
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,919
Isn't Bota's birthday coming up?

236
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,879
Let it be my birthday gift to her.

237
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,960
Dad, what's wrong?

238
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,519
It's nothing.

239
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,000
From today, I'll take you to school myself.

240
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,519
Say goodbye.

241
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,720
Goodbye.

242
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,639
Mr. Fang,

243
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,120
please try our milk tea first.

244
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,919
The ranch that supplies our milk

245
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,399
is right at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains.

246
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,279
So these cows grow up drinking snowmelt.

247
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,080
Here it comes!

248
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,559
Fragrant Mulati's Big Plate Chicken.

249
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,279
Fresh from the pot, piping hot.

250
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,320
It's absolutely delicious.

251
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,919
Bayar.

252
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,879
That's all for now.

253
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,399
Don't make any more.

254
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,399
Otherwise, it'll go to waste.

255
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,759
You know how we Xinjiang folks treat guests.

256
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,639
If your friend comes,

257
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,799
they're our friend too.

258
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,000
So,

259
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,600
in the future,

260
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,679
if you come again

261
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,200
to eat at our restaurant,

262
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,679
it doesn't matter if he's here.

263
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,440
Just look for me.

264
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,919
Bayar, just find me.

265
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,039
Great food and drinks, all you want.

266
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,399
Half-price for you.

267
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,799
You're still our VIP guest.

268
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,399
Sound good?

269
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,919
This lady is really too kind.

270
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,519
Bayar isn't just being polite.

271
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,320
It's our restaurant's sincerity.

272
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,360
Anton.

273
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,559
This is...

274
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,679
Let me formally introduce you.

275
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,519
This is the original founder of

276
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,519
Hong Shiliu Restaurant, A'isha.

277
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,600
Boss A'isha.

278
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,519
Hello, hello.

279
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,120
Hello, hello.

280
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,679
Please, have a seat.

281
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,960
I'm just a boss in name now.

282
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,919
Now, all the restaurant matters

283
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,639
are handled by Anton.

284
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,039
I'm just the manager.

285
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,559
Mainly helping Ming Liang

286
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,879
take care of things here.

287
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,919
Luckily, Anton was here back then.

288
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,679
That's how our restaurant survived.

289
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,679
Anton,

290
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,279
he's still so capable.

291
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,639
Mr. Fang, you flatter me.

292
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,320
A'isha, stop praising me.

293
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,200
Seriously.

294
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,279
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

295
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,320
Call us if you need anything.

296
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,759
Alright, alright.

297
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,039
Let me know if you need anything.

298
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:34,440
Alright, alright.

299
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:34,960
Enjoy your food.

300
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,000
Thank you, thank you.

301
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,399
Anton,

302
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:39,679
you're impressive.

303
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,159
Today,

304
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,759
I've seen it with my own eyes.

305
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,759
You, kid,

306
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,519
really have skills.

307
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,879
After all those ups and downs,

308
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,919
you bounced back so quickly in Urumqi.

309
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,080
You've made a comeback.

310
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,679
I wouldn't call it a comeback.

311
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,679
Just

312
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,679
making a bit for retirement.

313
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,720
Alright, enough.

314
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,200
Still being modest with me?

315
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,799
What,

316
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,200
afraid I'll take your shares

317
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,039
and leave you not even a bowl of soup?

318
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,039
Good food

319
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,880
is for everyone to share.

320
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,960
Right.

321
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,119
If Mr. Fang likes our little place.

322
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,160
Here it comes!

323
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,359
And also,

324
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,200
one more thing,

325
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,759
this is Hong Shiliu's signature dish—

326
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,559
A'isha's Pilaf.

327
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Give it a try.

328
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,799
Bro, this is...

329
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,519
Mr. Fang.

330
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,319
Mr. Fang.

331
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,880
Let me introduce you properly.

332
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,279
This is our sous chef,

333
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:36,960
Ankar.

334
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,400
His father is the head chef.

335
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,079
But this young man is smart and capable.

336
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
With good training,

337
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,799
he'll make his own way.

338
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:44,880
No problem at all.

339
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,799
Nice to meet you.

340
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,519
Hello, Ankar.

341
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,279
Nice to meet you.

342
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,920
Such a promising young man.

343
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,200
The youth are truly impressive.

344
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,039
And he's good-looking too.

345
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,640
You should learn from Mr. An too.

346
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,039
Alright.

347
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,640
Mr. An, in our food industry,

348
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,759
is really something.

349
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,079
Well, you all eat, go ahead.

350
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,839
Alright, alright.

351
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,079
Darn it, I'll go get some dessert.

352
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:01,599
Right.

353
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,279
I'll be right back.

354
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:02,640
Right away.

355
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,039
No, thanks.

356
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,960
Can't eat anymore.

357
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,799
You must try it.

358
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,920
Our homemade milk skin yogurt.

359
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,640
It's really good.

360
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,400
Really, it's great.

361
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:08,920
It's really good.

362
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,720
It's settled then.

363
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,079
Alright, alright.

364
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:10,759
Settled.

365
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,000
Goodbye.

366
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,799
Agreed.

367
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,160
Okay.

368
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,200
Let's leave it at that for now.

369
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,599
We'll prioritize your family.

370
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,920
Get it from the Kunbek family.

371
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,160
If anything special comes up,

372
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,640
then get supplies from the Baliheng family.

373
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,000
The lamb is ordered.

374
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,480
So efficient!

375
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,920
Boss is impressive.

376
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,200
It's five hours from here to Urumqi.

377
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,799
How will you transport the lamb?

378
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,680
If you come just to pick it up,

379
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,599
the cost is too high.

380
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,880
You've already solved the main issue.

381
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,119
For the rest,

382
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,200
I'll figure something out.

383
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,799
Next is sorting out logistics.

384
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,279
It'll take two or three more days.

385
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I'll let you know when it's done.

386
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,319
No rush.

387
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,400
Here, have some milk tea.

388
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,559
Thank you, thank you.

389
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,920
Alright.

390
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,400
Sis, when are you coming back?

391
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,599
What trouble did you get into now?

392
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,480
I'm on my way.

393
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,440
It wasn't me.

394
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,079
Do you know what Baheti did?

395
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:01,680
Baheti.

396
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,119
Are you going on a blind date?

397
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:09,759
You're really going?

398
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,400
I've already met her.

399
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,519
When did you meet?

400
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,400
Turan from Dalawuxia Ranch.

401
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,519
Are you marrying her after the date?

402
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,240
Yes.

403
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,480
She's very pretty.

404
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:28,640
She'll be a good wife.

405
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,279
I'm pretty good-looking too.

406
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,599
You only met once.

407
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,839
You like her after just one meeting?

408
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,319
Yes.

409
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,960
I fell in love at first sight.

410
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,720
Have you ever seen

411
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:02,359
someone holding hands with their mom?

412
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:07,359
Have you gone on a spring outing?

413
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,559
Enjoyed the beautiful lakeside views?

414
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,160
Hello.

415
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,160
Are you lost?

416
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,680
Come with me.

417
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
When I was nine,

418
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,240
the blizzard whipped snow across the grassland.

419
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,519
Everything was covered in white.

420
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,160
I saw my parents

421
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,480
walk into that endless white.

422
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,759
They never came back.

423
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,839
It was just like that day.

424
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,359
Between earth and sky,

425
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,480
only endless whiteness remained.

426
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,039
I couldn't find my way home.

427
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,960
I thought I'd end up like my parents,

428
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,319
never coming back.

429
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,720
Until you and Bota appeared before me.

430
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,680
That's when I found hope to live.

431
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:24,920
So you and Bota mean a lot to me.

432
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,200
Are you sure Bota

433
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
can accept that newcomer?

434
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,160
With time,

435
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,319
feelings will grow.

436
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,279
We've known each other a long time too.

437
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:33,759
I...

438
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
Can't we develop feelings too?

439
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,640
When Bota grows up,

440
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,759
she'll leave the ranch.

441
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,400
What if she doesn't want to go?

442
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,319
What if she doesn't want to leave?

443
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,640
I'll make her go.

444
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,680
She should see the world outside.

445
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,400
She deserves the best future.

446
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,480
She shouldn't be stuck here.

447
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,359
Just like you made me leave.

448
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,799
You have nothing to do with me.

449
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:17,920
Fine.

450
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,480
Baheti.

451
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,160
I can't wait to eat A'isha's Pilaf at your wedding.

452
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,640
Lamb, horse sausage...

453
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,000
Then I can finally let you go.

454
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,880
Happy now?

455
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,319
Are you satisfied?

456
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
You've met Baheti.

457
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,839
Did he go on a blind date?

458
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,079
I knew it.

459
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,519
That guy...

460
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,960
He's not boyfriend material.

461
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,960
He can only be a friend.

462
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,599
He's been away for years.

463
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,240
Suddenly comes back with a kid.

464
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,720
No one even knows Bota's mom's name.

465
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,200
I'm telling you,

466
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,799
he must've done something shady out there.

467
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,160
Sis.

468
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,240
Sis.

469
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,839
I get it.

470
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,440
Can you stop talking, please?

471
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,480
Can you let me be quiet for a bit?

472
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,000
No...

473
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,319
Why are you crying?

474
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,640
Samuhar.

475
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,359
Sam.

476
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,440
Stand there.

477
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,640
Calm down.

478
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:09,720
Get down here.

479
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,319
I'm fighting Baheti today, no matter what.

480
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,920
He doesn't even appreciate my sister.

481
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,519
My sister treats him so well.

482
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:30,759
Come here.

483
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,160
Do you know

484
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
when it comes to feelings,

485
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,680
no one else can interfere.

486
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,119
They have to figure it out themselves.

487
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,920
My sister's watched over me since I was little.

488
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,720
I've never seen her cry.

489
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,240
Except when our grandma passed away.

490
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,480
If Baheti makes my sister cry,

491
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,759
I'll deal with him myself.

492
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,200
Even if you beat Baheti today,

493
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,920
will he end up with Mayila?

494
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,519
Ming Liang.

495
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,000
Ming Liang.

496
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,599
I've sorted out the cold chain transport for you.

497
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
It's done.

498
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,680
I contacted several logistics companies.

499
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,839
They all said no.

500
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,920
How did you manage it?

501
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,519
I helped them out before.

502
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,680
Oh, right.

503
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,680
I have things to do tomorrow.

504
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,680
I'll pick out your sheep for you this afternoon.

505
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,440
I'll slaughter them and send them to Urumqi the day after.

506
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's meet at your place tomorrow.

507
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,160
I'll let my colleagues know.

508
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:24,960
Okay.

509
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,680
Brother-in-law.

510
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,079
I'll help you out tomorrow too.

511
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,880
Don't be shy, brother-in-law.

512
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,400
It's bound to happen sooner or later.

513
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,039
What nonsense are you talking about?

514
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,039
Baheti.

515
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,079
Let me tell you,

516
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,680
if you turn down my sister,

517
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
you'll regret it when you die.

518
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,160
I'm talking to you, Baheti.

519
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,880
Baheti.

520
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,960
Go ahead and regret it.

521
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,440
You're really obsessed with protecting your sister.

522
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,839
You don't care about me at all, do you?

523
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,039
I don't want him thinking

524
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,359
my sister can't live without him.

525
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,759
There are plenty of good men out there.

526
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,160
Right, Ming Liang?

527
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:21,720
Liang.

528
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,440
How about you and my sister...

529
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,039
Stop right there.

530
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,720
What's wrong?

531
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:28,839
Bro.

532
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,119
Say something.

533
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,119
Did I say something wrong?

534
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,160
I have a girlfriend.

535
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,440
Really?

536
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,640
Who is it?

537
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,599
Dad

538
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:03,920
Mom

539
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:08,920
Teacher Mayila

540
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,519
Will you stop taking me
to school from now on?

541
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:13,599
No, I won't.

542
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,680
Dad

543
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,440
Did you two have a fight?

544
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,160
We didn't fight.

545
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,480
Helping you

546
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,839
was her job before.

547
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,079
Now it's over.

548
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
Dad will always be here for you.

549
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,480
Let's go.

550
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,680
Teacher Alan

551
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,160
Bye, Dad.

552
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:42,799
Goodbye.

553
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,079
Okay.

554
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,759
Let's go.

555
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,039
Go.

556
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:46,640
Go forward.

557
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:47,960
Let's go.

558
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,680
You go first.

559
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,079
Look.

560
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,880
The sheep are picked out.

561
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,000
You'll get the sheep
tomorrow afternoon.

562
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,680
Okay.

563
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,920
Don't rush back.

564
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,119
Wait until the mutton arrives.

565
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:03,720
I'll check it.

566
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,079
If it's fine, we'll talk.

567
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,160
If it doesn't work out,

568
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
you'll have to find another supplier.

569
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,319
Don't worry.

570
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,640
Rest assured, really.

571
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,400
The meat will be fine.

572
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,119
I'll stop talking for now.

573
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,680
Why are you here?

574
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,079
I came to see you.

575
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,240
So,

576
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,920
you'll be staying here
a few more days?

577
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,960
Because beavers can't tell

578
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,480
what we've planted for them

579
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,640
from what the herders plant.

580
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,680
So we have to explain
to each herder.

581
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,000
And we're short on staff here.

582
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,000
Director Gao said

583
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,640
I should finish this
before going back.

584
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,240
I'll stay here with you.

585
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,440
We'll go back together
when you're done.

586
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,240
No need.

587
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,240
The restaurant needs you.

588
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,920
I hope you need me too.

589
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,680
Nana

590
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,559
That night I went to see you

591
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,759
just because I missed you.

592
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,400
As long as you feel my love,

593
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,160
and accept my love,

594
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,680
I'm already happy.

595
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,920
You don't have to pay me back
bit by bit.

596
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,720
Or come to me
the same way.

597
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,359
I came running to you

598
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,759
because I missed you too.

599
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:08,680
Baheti

600
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,799
No more mutton for you.

601
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,319
You're not welcome
at our place either.

602
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,400
Hey.

603
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,079
I just finished a home visit.

604
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,119
Heading home now.

605
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:37,599
What's wrong?

606
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,079
Are you out of your mind?

607
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,839
Why go back on your word?

608
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,480
A cowhide belt gets shinier
the more you polish.

609
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,200
True hearts get clearer
the more you know.

610
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,440
Mayila

611
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,880
His heart isn't sincere.

612
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,599
Do you know him?

613
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,799
Why do you say that about him?

614
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,680
You've only known him
a short time.

615
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,359
Do you really know him?

616
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
Does time matter here?

617
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,079
Some people open up
in just days.

618
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,160
Some people

619
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,400
never open up
even after years.

620
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,000
If someone isn't sincere
in love,

621
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,000
they won't be sincere
in anything.

622
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,160
What are you talking about?

623
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:01,519
Can you be clearer?

624
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:02,680
Mayila

625
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,480
That person isn't fit
to be a friend.

626
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,160
As a partner,

627
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,360
even less worthy
of trust.

628
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,360
Better than you, right?

629
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:13,960
Baheti

630
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,320
Your knife can cut
the toughest cowhide,

631
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,000
but not your own heart.

632
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,920
Is that useful?

633
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,679
You're not the only one
on the steppe.

634
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,719
I can find someone else.

635
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,320
From now on,

636
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,840
let's act like strangers.

637
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,159
I know him pretty well.

638
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,039
He's not someone
who breaks his word.

639
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,239
What did you say to him?

640
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,000
From when he said
the mutton was settled

641
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,360
to when he broke his word,

642
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,800
I only said three words to him.

643
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,440
Which three words?

644
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:07,880
Baheti

645
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,840
That doesn't count.

646
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,039
Can't even say his name now?

647
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,119
Weird.

648
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,199
Maybe it's a misunderstanding?

649
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,400
Early this morning,

650
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,239
Nana came to see me.

651
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,400
After she saw me,

652
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,599
I took Nana back.

653
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,159
On my way back,

654
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,679
I ran into Baheti.

655
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,199
I met him,

656
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:24,719
and he just...

657
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,320
He just what?

658
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,039
What happened?

659
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,280
He probably saw me
with Nana.

660
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,800
So what if he did?

661
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,760
What's that got to do
with mutton?

662
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:43,679
He...

663
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,519
He really misunderstood.

664
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,320
Misunderstood what?

665
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,199
Even so, he shouldn't
break his word.

666
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,239
A promise is a promise.

667
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,239
He...

668
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,480
I...

669
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:58,760
What?

670
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,199
I'll go with Grandpa
to find other herders.

671
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,159
We'll manage for sure.

672
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,119
No need to make it
so complicated.

673
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:08,800
I'll give it a try.

674
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,440
Good job, real man.

675
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,280
Good job, real man.

676
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,960
Who else can compare?

677
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,199
Let's talk.

678
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,239
Where did he come from?

679
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,800
How would I know?

680
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,000
Ignore him.

681
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,800
Baheti, you're just a coward.

682
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,360
Is he provoking you?

683
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,280
Let's have a wrestling match.

684
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,440
Whoever wins

685
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,239
gets to call the shots.

686
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,199
Well done. That's a real man.

687
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,840
You can't beat me.

688
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,199
Don't speak too soon.

689
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,119
Come on.

690
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,360
If your heart's with two women,

691
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,440
what kind of man are you?

692
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
If you make the woman you love cry,

693
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,559
what kind of man are you then?

694
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,440
If you truly can't let go of Mayila,

695
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,639
go and talk things out with her.

696
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,000
Why are you struggling here alone?

697
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,119
Stay out of my business.

698
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,239
You think I want to meddle?

699
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,920
You're the one who broke your word first.

700
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,960
Well done.

701
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,760
I'm not good enough for Mayila.

702
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,320
But I won't let someone like you deceive her.

703
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,559
Want to go again?

704
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,599
You believe everything Samuhar says.

705
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,840
Can't you speak for yourself?

706
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:10,880
Why not ask directly?

707
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,559
What is my real relationship with Mayila?

708
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,000
Then explain it.

709
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,559
Say something.

710
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,719
If you want to know,

711
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
beat me first, then I'll tell you.

712
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:24,559
Come on.

713
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,079
A real man.

714
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,440
Well done.

715
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,679
Let's talk.

716
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,960
That girl is your girlfriend.

717
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,920
You have nothing going on with Mayila.

718
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:53,800
Uh, well...

719
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:54,760
Ow, ow, ow...

720
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,079
Does Mayila know I misunderstood her?

721
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,519
She didn't know before I left.

722
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,119
But she's so smart,

723
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,199
maybe now...

724
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,119
Baheti.

725
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,320
How are you doing?

726
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:21,400
Let me see, let me see.

727
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm fine, I'm fine.

728
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,199
Are your bones okay?

729
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:23,880
They're fine, they're fine.

730
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,480
Really, I'm fine.

731
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,039
Really, I'm fine.

732
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:25,920
He just...

733
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:26,880
Stop.

734
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,159
Why are you acting tough?

735
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,119
Around here,

736
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,719
hardly anyone can beat him.

737
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,440
If something happened to you,

738
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,960
how would I explain to A'isha?

739
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:36,840
Sis.

740
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,559
Since I was little,

741
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,000
I've always protected my siblings.

742
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,599
Now having a sister protect me

743
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,440
feels pretty nice.

744
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:47,920
Since you're okay,

745
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:48,760
let's go.

746
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,559
Let's get you some medicine back home.

747
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,400
I can walk, I can walk.

748
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,719
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

749
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,440
How about your bones?

750
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,599
They're fine.

751
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,440
Really, really fine.

752
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,320
Let's go, let's go.

753
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,119
Mayila.

754
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,360
Her horse—

755
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:05,039
Is its head okay?

756
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:05,400
I can walk.

757
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,239
I'm fine, fine.

758
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:06,840
Fine, fine.

759
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,039
Should we get an X-ray?

760
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:08,760
It's all good, all good.

761
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,079
Rub it warm.

762
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,000
Ming Liang,

763
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,400
you wouldn't let me find Baheti,

764
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
but you went off to fight yourself.

765
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,360
I went wrestling,

766
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,360
not fighting.

767
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:24,800
That's not fair.

768
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,079
Take me next time.

769
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,079
We'll go together.

770
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,440
You never stop, do you?

771
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,079
No one goes again.

772
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,719
And don't mention him anymore.

773
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,199
I...

774
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,039
Hey, hey, hey.

775
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,599
Alright, alright, alright.

776
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:50,440
Okay.

777
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,320
What's up?

778
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,920
Kuenbek suddenly called me

779
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,760
and said he can supply us mutton.

780
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
And plenty of it.

781
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,639
He can handle the logistics too.

782
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,239
Baheti.

783
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,039
Baheti.

784
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,079
You said not to mention him,

785
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,000
but here you are, bringing him up.

786
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,559
Are you asking for trouble?

787
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,760
You just can't let go, can you?

788
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,599
I'm heading out.

789
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:19,840
Ming Liang.

790
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,159
Grandpa.

791
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,320
Are you going to see Baheti?

792
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,000
Baheti.

793
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,079
Want a drink?

794
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,880
Kuenbek's sheep aren't enough.

795
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:15,639
You helped out, didn't you?

796
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,360
Right?

797
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,320
What I promised Mayila—

798
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,719
I have to make it happen for her.

799
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:31,760
If you can't protect your loved ones,

800
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,599
you're not truly

801
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:35,400
a good lad of the grasslands.

802
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,599
Someone asked me to pass this on.

803
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:41,760
Was it Mayila who said that?

804
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,400
It was Grandpa Bazarbek.
