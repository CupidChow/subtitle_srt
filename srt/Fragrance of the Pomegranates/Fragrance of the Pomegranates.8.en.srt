1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,240
Mom

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,439
Little sister is here.

3
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:14,919
Yueyue

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:15,919
You're still sick.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,920
Go back inside, quickly.

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,519
I want to wait for Dad.

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,519
The snow is so heavy.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,039
Dad's factory is far away.

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,199
He can't make it today.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,199
He promised me.

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,240
Dad

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,280
Dad

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,719
Dad

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,719
Yueyue

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,520
Don't fall down.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,840
Dad, Dad

17
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,800
Nana

18
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,039
Why are you here?

19
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,520
Snowflakes are cold.

20
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,960
Did you spill it all?

21
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,199
How do you know my parents' story?

22
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,479
Mama Ayisha told me when I was little.

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,000
Why didn't you ever tell me?

24
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,439
I didn't understand it back then.

25
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,000
If I told you,

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
would you have understood?

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,360
Nana, the barbecue's ready.

28
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,120
Come eat!

29
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:06,879
Okay.

30
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,759
Come, let's have a drink together.

31
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,719
Thank you.

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,319
This is fermented.

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,800
No alcohol.

34
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,680
It won't affect driving.

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,400
His family runs a restaurant.

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,000
He knows.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,159
I just checked Xiaohongshu.

38
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,879
The Molten Salt Power Station is a tourist spot.

39
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,159
Wait until it's a bit later.

40
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,759
When the sky is full of stars.

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,159
Those heliostats,

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,520
can reflect the Milky Way and nebulae.

43
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,759
It's like a sci-fi movie.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,400
Yeah.

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,680
I've seen lots of people online

46
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,560
come here in spacesuits for photos.

47
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,960
Pretending they're on Mars.

48
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,759
Speaking of spacesuits,

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,759
I'll get a few sets.

50
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,759
Next time, let's take photos here.

51
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:52,879
By the way,

52
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,800
Beautiful Nana,

53
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,439
you've been to so many places.

54
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,479
Do you have any recommendations?

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,960
Like,

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
places with few people,

57
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,599
unique ones,

58
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,400
something off the beaten path.

59
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,759
Mengkete Ancient Trail.

60
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,599
It captures the essence of the Ili scenic area.

61
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,240
You can see forests there,

62
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,360
snowy mountains,

63
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,639
grasslands,

64
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,439
lakes, canyons,

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,800
even hot springs.

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,879
And the most spectacular

67
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,759
is its stone circle.

68
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,279
I truly think

69
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,839
it's a paradise.

70
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,120
You've been there?

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Last year, to paint a sunset rainbow,

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,240
I stayed there for almost two weeks.

73
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,800
I went the year before.

74
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,639
It was drizzling.

75
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
The sky was full of evening glow.

76
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,240
Half the sky was sunset,

77
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,120
half was rainbow.

78
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,879
You really have to experience that place yourself.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,639
With words,

80
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,519
it's impossible to describe the feeling.

81
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,319
Hello, Xu Lai.

82
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,160
Hello, Murat's Dad.

83
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:01,959
Tomorrow.

84
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,120
Okay.

85
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,879
Okay.

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,879
Okay.

87
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,720
Alright, alright.

88
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,680
I have to work overtime tomorrow.

89
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,000
I have to rush back to Urumqi tonight.

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,560
Come.

91
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,519
Let's have a drink, let's toast.

92
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,360
Come.

93
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
Welcome everyone to Urumqi.

94
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,879
Visit Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

95
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,560
Find me.

96
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,759
Alright, okay.

97
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,040
Brother Mingliang

98
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,160
My dad says things like this

99
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,319
not just once or twice.

100
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm used to it by now.

101
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,480
You don't need to comfort me.

102
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,639
Don't be so down, either.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,199
Don't you know your dad by now?

104
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,759
He only respects capable people.

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,480
Once you surpass him someday,

106
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,879
he'll be proud of you too.

107
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,160
You're right.

108
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,199
I really don't understand him.

109
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,879
Sometimes,

110
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,360
you're more like his son than I am.

111
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,360
Alright, don't worry.

112
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm hanging up.

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
My mom's fine now.

114
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,839
I'll be on time for filming tomorrow.

115
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,879
Come pick me up, okay?

116
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
Alright, wait for me.

117
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,160
Nana, see you tomorrow.

118
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,759
Okay, Xu Lai.

119
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,399
See you tomorrow.

120
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,040
Mingliang

121
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,079
Um...

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,480
Should we go check out the power station?

123
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,519
Um...

124
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,759
My friend said the power station is a tourist spot now.

125
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,480
Since we're already here,

126
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,639
if we don't go,

127
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,720
wouldn't it be a pity?

128
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,959
We're almost there.

129
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,519
It's so bright.

130
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,120
Every mirror here

131
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,519
is like a sunflower,

132
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,639
turning toward the sun.

133
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,480
They store sunlight as thermal energy.

134
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,079
Then slowly release electricity.

135
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,240
This kind of looks like

136
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,079
that sci-fi blockbuster we usually watch.

137
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,480
What Earth?

138
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,720
Wandering what?

139
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,680
"Wandering Earth."

140
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,399
Yeah, that's right.

141
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
"Wandering Earth."

142
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,839
The Molten Salt Power Station is Xinjiang's own sci-fi film.

143
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,839
In just one second as we talk,

144
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,079
this electricity

145
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
goes from here all the way to Shandong.

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,639
People online all say

147
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,519
we're planting the sun out on the Gobi.

148
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,199
We've waited four years for this.

149
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,600
A little longer won't hurt.

150
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,480
Think it over again.

151
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,199
This boy who plants the sun—

152
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,480
I'm not blind or deaf.

153
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,879
How could I not know this young man

154
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,080
is a good kid?

155
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,440
If only this person

156
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,399
could be like electricity—

157
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,879
whenever you need him,

158
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,320
he'd show up in a second,

159
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,200
just like that, it'd be perfect.

160
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,960
Aisha,

161
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,960
we've all been through this.

162
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,639
We know what marriage and life

163
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,360
really need.

164
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,639
Back when I was young,

165
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,559
at that time,

166
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,960
Old Hu was often away for work.

167
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,240
I raised two girls on my own.

168
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,639
Especially Yueyue—

169
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,639
she'd get a fever in the middle of the night.

170
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,559
Always in the middle of the night.

171
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,320
I was so scared, like a madwoman.

172
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,759
Dragging the older one,

173
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,360
carrying the little one, rushing to the hospital.

174
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,840
Not a single person to help me.

175
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,320
I...

176
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,879
I just don't want Yueyue

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,759
to live the way I did.

178
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,720
I know

179
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,320
these two kids truly love each other.

180
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,200
I don't want them to be heartbroken either.

181
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm a little regretful this time.

182
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,879
Why?

183
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
I shouldn't have come.

184
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,879
You know, people—

185
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,720
afraid to meet.

186
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,080
Trees fear being stripped.

187
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,840
But when I actually met this young man,

188
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,320
I didn't know what to do.

189
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,799
Look how tangled up Mama Bayar is.

190
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,080
Liangliang,

191
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,759
how's the arrangement going?

192
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,039
Don't worry.

193
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,559
Arrange what?

194
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,799
What are you all arranging?

195
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,639
We're having Murat's Dad cook you a nice meal.

196
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Look at our front hall's rose, so sad.

197
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,600
If she doesn't eat something tasty soon,

198
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,840
she'll be even more upset.

199
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,639
Get outta here.

200
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,440
Come on.

201
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,759
Play some cheerful music.

202
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,039
Nana.

203
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,440
Xu Lai.

204
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,440
You calling me "Director"

205
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,919
almost threw me off.

206
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,320
You're here to guide our work,

207
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,759
so I have to use your title.

208
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,279
You really are an expert.

209
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,720
Just two sentences and I'm stuck.

210
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,440
Isn't this Nana's birding friend?

211
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,440
What birding friend?

212
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,799
Friends from the birdwatching club.

213
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,399
We need your input for the promo video.

214
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,639
The meeting room is here.

215
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,279
Go ahead.

216
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,120
Oh, right.

217
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,360
Almost forgot.

218
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,039
This is for you.

219
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,440
What's this?

220
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,480
Open it and see.

221
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,720
Xu Lai,

222
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,039
I really can't accept this.

223
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,919
I know.

224
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,759
You can't accept it.

225
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,080
But it'll definitely like it.

226
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,720
A rattan ball.

227
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:02,840
It's for Little King Kong.

228
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,320
Last time birdwatching, didn't you say

229
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,559
someone was secretly keeping a macaw?

230
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,559
It got reported and sent here.

231
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,440
Isn't it happy in its new home?

232
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,679
You still remember.

233
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,360
That's thoughtful.

234
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,679
I'll give it to him for you.

235
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,279
Thank you.

236
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,039
Friend.

237
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,440
No need to be so formal.

238
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,360
Alright.

239
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,080
Let's go.

240
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,480
Go.

241
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,799
Cater to their preferences

242
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,840
Create a surprise

243
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,879
Show some care

244
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,759
Get closer

245
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,679
This guy is really something

246
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,480
What about my brother

247
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,879
Give him a jack

248
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:33,679
What's the point of that

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,159
Uh

250
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,279
What are you mumbling about

251
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,440
That guy

252
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,399
He likes Nana

253
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,799
He even chased her to work

254
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,799
No way, I have to kick him out

255
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,200
No, no

256
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,039
Wait a second

257
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,840
What guy

258
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,519
That's Director Xu from PR

259
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,480
He's in charge of this campaign

260
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,679
Nana

261
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:00,120
For our wildlife protection

262
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,200
The publicity plan

263
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,360
Still lacks a memorable touch

264
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,799
I've got an idea

265
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Want to hear it

266
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,159
Your lousy ideas

267
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,600
Haven't I heard enough already

268
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,159
People change in just three days

269
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Go ahead, let's hear it

270
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,360
Let my brother draw one for each hall

271
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,840
A simple sketch with a wildlife protection tip

272
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,759
Comrade Hu Yue

273
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,360
Let's not milk the same sheep forever

274
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,759
Can draw

275
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,600
Draws well

276
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,759
Has wildlife rescue experience

277
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,879
And cares about animals

278
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,559
Sheep

279
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,440
Very rare

280
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,039
But I think he's been worried lately

281
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,679
Better not bother him

282
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,480
Nana

283
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,320
You feel sorry for him

284
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,679
Feel sorry

285
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,720
Why would I feel sorry

286
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,480
You're in charge of publicity

287
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,799
If you've decided

288
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,799
Just follow the process

289
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,600
So that's a yes

290
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,159
The movie's about to start

291
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:05,679
Let's go

292
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,200
We're running late

293
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,720
You haven't agreed yet

294
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:12,960
What

295
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,559
We're here

296
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,039
Finally home

297
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,440
Home is always best

298
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,919
Exactly

299
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,799
Come on, Aysha

300
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,600
Tired, right

301
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,360
Not too bad

302
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
Just standing at the restaurant door

303
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,879
Makes me feel at ease

304
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,240
Yeah

305
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,679
Let's go

306
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:41,759
Sorry

307
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,519
Excuse me

308
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,480
What's going on

309
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,879
It's only been a few days

310
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,919
How did it change so much

311
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,200
It really is different

312
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,919
If it's convenient for you

313
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,960
Please leave us a good review

314
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,799
Sure, sure

315
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,840
Alright, take care

316
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,679
Gourmet

317
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
What do you mean

318
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,559
Why are you dressed like that

319
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,080
I almost didn't recognize you

320
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,360
When in Xinjiang, do as the locals do

321
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,679
A bit of Xinjiang style

322
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,960
But I made a few tweaks

323
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,840
You call that a small tweak

324
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,279
You're doing magic in our restaurant

325
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,799
More customers than usual

326
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:23,679
Meal time

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,679
Not that many more though

328
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,679
Is this still our old Hong Shiliu

329
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,559
Let's go

330
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:35,720
Come

331
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:36,679
Bag

332
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,080
A bit

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,960
Surprised, right

334
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,879
Sorry, Mingliang

335
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:51,360
I

336
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,960
Made a decision on my own

337
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,639
Just wanted to surprise you

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,799
Thanks for your hard work, Dong

339
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,600
Boss

340
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,320
I'll go get the stuff

341
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,639
Here I am

342
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,320
Mingliang

343
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,440
This is our signature dish.

344
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,919
Stir-fried Lamb with Morels

345
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,720
This is specially made to welcome you.

346
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,480
Come on.

347
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,840
Try it, give it a taste.

348
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,720
Alright, alright.

349
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,720
You're the hero here.

350
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,279
Fresh and crisp, so tasty.

351
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,440
Murat's Dad

352
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,960
Your cooking has improved again.

353
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,240
It's mainly because the morels you found are excellent.

354
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
And thanks to An Dong's picky taste.

355
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,960
Me? I'm just so-so.

356
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,840
I've brought back another new specialty.

357
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,519
Qitai flour

358
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,880
Qitai flour

359
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,200
Makes chewy banmian and yellow noodles.

360
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,599
Sister Xiaoyan

361
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,880
She also gave me two

362
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,400
recipes for her signature dishes.

363
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,440
Really? Take a look.

364
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,920
An Dong

365
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,039
An Dong

366
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:19,799
What's up?

367
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,559
Check this out.

368
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,759
How to make banmian.

369
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,000
You brought this back too?

370
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,240
Let's give it a try.

371
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,519
Spoon out and coat with sauce.

372
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,440
Flash fry.

373
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,720
Every step matters.

374
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I've made flash-fried meat noodles all my life.

375
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,079
First time I learned this.

376
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,319
Right.

377
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,319
The meat slices should be golden.

378
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,079
With a hint of pink in the red.

379
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,920
That way, the meat stays tender.

380
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,160
It's still tough.

381
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,200
No, it's not.

382
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,000
Isn't it fine now?

383
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,839
He talks less, I listen less.

384
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,200
The whole world goes quiet.

385
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,720
These past two years, your mom

386
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,480
has helped your big brother with his kids.

387
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,480
It's just you and your dad at home.

388
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,359
All your dad's attention

389
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,559
is focused on you now.

390
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,279
All the pressure falls on you.

391
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,200
On his side,

392
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,119
I'll go talk to him.

393
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,839
And you,

394
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,680
try to understand him too.

395
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,319
I know.

396
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,960
My dad's scolded me more than once or twice.

397
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,480
Right?

398
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,319
Are you underestimating me?

399
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
I may not be that capable,

400
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,359
but I'm pretty thick-skinned.

401
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,319
Besides,

402
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,960
if he tells me to cook, I cook.

403
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,559
He tells me to practice knife skills, I do.

404
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,240
He says listen to An Dong,

405
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,359
so I listen, that's all.

406
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,799
What else can he say?

407
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,119
You're way too passive.

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,839
Bro,

409
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,079
stop worrying, okay?

410
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,880
If you keep worrying, you'll go gray.

411
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,680
I'm not a little kid.

412
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,759
I'm not clueless.

413
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,319
Honestly, what you mean

414
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,839
I understand perfectly.

415
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,480
Don't worry.

416
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,440
Alright.

417
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,279
This restaurant renovation—

418
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,119
Did An Dong pay for it?

419
00:18:59,119 --> 00:18:59,799
About how much?

420
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,599
I don't know.

421
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,960
Go ahead and get busy.

422
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,799
Okay, I'm heading over.

423
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,079
Don't worry.

424
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,119
Do you think my brother likes Nana?

425
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,720
He eagerly went to make Xuehualiang for her.

426
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,359
I thought they'd get together.

427
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,480
But after he came back,

428
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
they're still just like before.

429
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,720
I asked him to help with my promo stuff.

430
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:25,519
He said he was busy.

431
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,759
Turned me down flat.

432
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,920
Really firm about it.

433
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,799
Don't worry.

434
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,559
Mingliang knows better than both of us.

435
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,079
You don't really know him.

436
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,880
He cares more about me and Ankar

437
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,440
than he does about himself.

438
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,440
You know that.

439
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,160
My dad—

440
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,400
To put it nicely,

441
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,440
he's a workaholic.

442
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,759
As my mom says,

443
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,200
he's a muddle-headed guy.

444
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,400
He's always muddle-headed in life.

445
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,720
Since I was little,

446
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,519
Mingliang looked after me more than he did.

447
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,119
Take this time for example—

448
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,519
I wanted

449
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,880
him to share some of my stress.

450
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,559
But then I thought,

451
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,079
he's lived the same routine for years—

452
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
just the restaurant,

453
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,960
home,

454
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,799
and work.

455
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,200
Nowhere else.

456
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,440
When he rides alone,

457
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm worried he'll get into trouble.

458
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,000
If he goes again,

459
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,799
he'll just make things worse for my mom.

460
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,759
Then I'll be in even more trouble.

461
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,119
Yueyue,

462
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,160
I've met Uncle.

463
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,680
Hello, Uncle.

464
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,839
Alright, stop working.

465
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,440
Have a seat.

466
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,960
Uncle Hu

467
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,960
Actually, before I met Yueyue

468
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,480
I had already heard about you

469
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,079
It was from a

470
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,200
welder who helped build the factory

471
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,400
He said

472
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,160
you were the best welder he'd ever met

473
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,240
He said you could weld eggshells
with your eyes closed

474
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,359
without breaking the membrane

475
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
And you’re still just as skilled

476
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,279
Yes, yes

477
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,279
Your skills are amazing

478
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,920
I just never expected

479
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,839
you were actually Yueyue’s father

480
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,680
I also heard

481
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,680
besides your own factory work

482
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,519
you often help other companies

483
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,400
and train apprentices

484
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,960
You balance work and family perfectly

485
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,880
Alright, that's enough

486
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,920
Don’t think a few nice words

487
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,799
will make me help you

488
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,920
Young man

489
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,200
When I was courting my wife

490
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,000
I welded for her

491
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,680
two tightly connected gears

492
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,000
I told her

493
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,480
the big one is me

494
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,759
the small one is her

495
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,559
I would lead her

496
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,359
and make our life wonderful

497
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
But after a lifetime fixing machines

498
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,720
I still couldn’t fix my own family

499
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,839
Uncle, don’t say that

500
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,759
You’ve taken great care of your family

501
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,000
Back then, I was just like you

502
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,880
I came to Xinjiang alone

503
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,720
My parents weren’t with me

504
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,119
And the two kids

505
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,400
Mama Bayar

506
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,279
raised them herself

507
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,880
When Yueyue was born

508
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,680
I was out of town for repairs

509
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,039
I only found out when I got back

510
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,119
Yueyue was born premature

511
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,960
If it weren’t for Aysha

512
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,319
Young man

513
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,200
Marriage and love are not the same

514
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,400
You can’t rely on a moment’s passion

515
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,160
As Yueyue’s parents

516
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,759
we don’t want our daughter

517
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,559
to marry someone who neglects family

518
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,680
But we also don’t want

519
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,759
her to marry someone she doesn’t love

520
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,720
If that happens

521
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,480
she’ll never be happy

522
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,039
Uncle

523
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,839
I promise Yueyue will never be unhappy

524
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,200
Look at that heliostat

525
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,960
Only when it’s at the right angle

526
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,960
can it catch the sunlight

527
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,200
and gather energy

528
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,680
Between you and Yueyue

529
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,000
you must find the right way and approach

530
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,960
to find your happiness together

531
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,160
I didn’t expect my dad would go to the station
just for us

532
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,680
He made a special trip to the power station

533
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,039
There’s more you didn’t expect

534
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:58,519
What else?

535
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,559
Uncle came here

536
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,240
because Mingliang arranged it

537
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,480
Alright, stop crying

538
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,799
So many people love you

539
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,359
You should be happy, right?

540
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,720
My silly brother

541
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,720
when it comes to his own problems

542
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,359
he’s just like a muddle-headed fool

543
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,000
But for our issues

544
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,319
he always has a solution

545
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,400
Bayar

546
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,119
You’re back

547
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,960
Old Hu

548
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,119
Our family’s muddle-head

549
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,599
is really something

550
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,279
Didn’t even say hello

551
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,279
Went off to the Gobi and came back

552
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,960
But we have Mingliang

553
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,400
He planned the route perfectly

554
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,640
Even if I wanted to get lost

555
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,559
I couldn’t

556
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,160
Go wash your hands

557
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,559
Who told you to cook so deliciously

558
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
The smell made me dizzy

559
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:55,400
Cut it out

560
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,000
You think a few words

561
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
can fool me?

562
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,200
I’m telling you

563
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,880
I’ll settle things with Mingliang tomorrow

564
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,559
You traitors

565
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,960
all teamed up to trick me

566
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,480
It’s because you and Yueyue are so capable

567
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,839
One sneaks around with her mom

568
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,440
One goes off alone, leaving the group

569
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,359
I’ve seen it all

570
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,519
Only I, the dad

571
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,839
have to go meet this guy

572
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,920
Did you meet him?

573
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,440
How was it?

574
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,200
I didn’t meet him first

575
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:23,519
I was at the factory

576
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,319
walked around a bit

577
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,319
asked around about him

578
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,119
What did they say?

579
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,599
They said he’s a good guy

580
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,799
He’s an outstanding worker every year

581
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,240
Just like I was back in the day

582
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,400
I didn’t ask about his job

583
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,240
I asked what kind of person he is

584
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,400
He’s good too

585
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,200
Honest and reliable

586
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,079
Gets along well with colleagues

587
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
There’s a girl at his work who likes him

588
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,720
She even asked someone

589
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,240
to set them up

590
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,119
So what happened?

591
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,559
At the time

592
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,839
He turned her down right away

593
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,519
That’s what I thought

594
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,960
Those girls out there

595
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,240
none can compare to our Yueyue

596
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,279
Life is never perfect.

597
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,559
Nothing is flawless.

598
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,720
The old can't out-stubborn the young.

599
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,519
Can you really control the young forever?

600
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,880
Can we guarantee who Yuèyuè finds

601
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,720
will be better than Guangtian?

602
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,559
What Yuèyuè needs to go through

603
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,559
she must experience herself.

604
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,240
Our eldest is in Fujian.

605
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,480
Life is pretty good there.

606
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,400
Both grandkids are doing well.

607
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,880
What we need to do now

608
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,119
is be ready to support the kids if needed.

609
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,640
I understand all this.

610
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,480
I just don't want Yuèyuè to marry someone so far away.

611
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,480
I can't get over this in my heart.

612
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,559
Li Guangtian said

613
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,119
he and his colleagues

614
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,759
all live in Urumqi.

615
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,720
They have a group chat.

616
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,279
On Fridays, they come back together.

617
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,559
On Sundays, they head back.

618
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,000
If we keep dragging this out,

619
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,039
that's not a solution.

620
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,240
So let's just

621
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,359
let the two of them date for now.

622
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,039
With things as they are,

623
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,279
if you try to force them apart,

624
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,400
it won't work.

625
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,680
When did I say I wanted to break them up?

626
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,960
Did I ever say that?

627
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,519
I've only been gone one day,

628
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,839
and you already bought me this.

629
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,680
I don't even need it.

630
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,480
Don't flatter yourself.

631
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,839
With your old skin and face,

632
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,759
do you even need this?

633
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,599
I just

634
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,480
wanted Yuèyuè to send it to Li Guangtian.

635
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,359
It's so dry and sunny out on the Gobi.

636
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,279
Yuèyuè,

637
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,559
she's so immature.

638
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:34,960
That stubborn girl.

639
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,039
Dong-ge,

640
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,839
Sorry to disturb your rest.

641
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,359
I wasn't sleeping.

642
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:55,759
I was

643
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
just thinking about things.

644
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
I brought you something.

645
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,119
Hami melon wine,

646
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,519
Balikun wild mushrooms,

647
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,480
and big flower buns.

648
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,680
All are specialties from Hami.

649
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,039
You are

650
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,480
too kind.

651
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,119
My mom brought a gift for everyone at the restaurant.

652
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:10,960
Including you.

653
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,359
Thank you for

654
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,640
taking care of the restaurant.

655
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,559
Just a small token of appreciation.

656
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,200
Then I'll accept it.

657
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,720
Thank you.

658
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,559
And thank your mom too.

659
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:18,920
Big sister,

660
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,119
there's something

661
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,279
I'd like to ask you about.

662
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,279
Go ahead.

663
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:28,640
You answer first.

664
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,640
Liu,

665
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,039
um,

666
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,640
I saw the photo you sent.

667
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,400
The layout and everything are nice.

668
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,920
The price is fine too.

669
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,400
The only issue now

670
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,160
is still the distance.

671
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,200
It's still far from my restaurant.

672
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,480
I spend too much time commuting.

673
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,480
Can you keep looking for me?

674
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,039
As soon as possible, Liu.

675
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,400
My hotel lease is about to expire.

676
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,440
I don't want to renew it.

677
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,119
It's pretty expensive.

678
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,559
Alright?

679
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,640
Thanks for your help.

680
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,039
Liu,

681
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:00,839
I'll wait for your update.

682
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,200
Goodbye.

683
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,960
Go on, you were saying.

684
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,039
Come with me first.

685
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,480
This room

686
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,240
was set up by my mom when I was little.

687
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
It was used as a studio.

688
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,920
After I went to college,

689
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
I rarely used it.

690
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,720
Now, little by little,

691
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,319
it's become a storage room.

692
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,519
I just heard you on the phone

693
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,720
saying you wanted to find

694
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,279
a place near the restaurant.

695
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,559
So I suddenly thought,

696
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,079
maybe this room would work.

697
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,759
It's just a bit simple.

698
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,279
I don't know if you

699
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,079
These are all your treasures.

700
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:58,799
Well,

701
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,240
is it really okay for me to stay here?

702
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,720
As long as you don't mind,

703
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,720
I'll tidy it up in the next couple days.

704
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,559
Then you can move in.

705
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,839
If I can stay here,

706
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,640
that would be wonderful.

707
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,039
It

708
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,640
is like living at the restaurant.

709
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,440
So convenient.

710
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:16,960
Thank you so much.

711
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,880
These

712
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,119
are all your drawings?

713
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,480
From childhood until now?

714
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,240
Almost all of them are here.

715
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,039
I like this painting.

716
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,960
The colors are really bold.

717
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,799
And look at the light and shadow.

718
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,039
The contrast is handled so well.

719
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,720
It has a touch of Peter Fiore.

720
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:49,559
Dong-ge,

721
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,160
you know a lot about painting too?

722
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,960
Not many people know about him.

723
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,680
He's my favorite artist.

724
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,000
You know that?

725
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:58,880
In his paintings,

726
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,400
light isn't just a physical thing.

727
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,680
He turns it into

728
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,599
a vessel for emotion.

729
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,480
That's what I think

730
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,880
makes his art so captivating.

731
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,319
Really.

732
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,359
I really like him too.

733
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,039
They told me before

734
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,039
that you're a painter.

735
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:11,960
I thought

736
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,119
it was just flattery for the boss.

737
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,680
Turns out

738
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,480
you're truly accomplished.

739
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,960
Not at all, not even close.

740
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,960
I find it curious,

741
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,000
you're so good at painting,

742
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,599
and you run a restaurant too.

743
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,119
And it's not even a busy restaurant.

744
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:30,000
Managing a place like this,

745
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,160
all the daily chores,

746
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,599
doesn't it drain your energy?

747
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,079
Doesn't it

748
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,960
affect your creativity?

749
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,279
A lot of times,

750
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,400
you just can't have it all.

751
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,640
I have my own reasons.

752
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
But thanks for your concern.

753
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,200
I'm rambling, sorry.

754
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,519
Just wanted to say a bit more.

755
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:54,839
Forget it, forget it.

756
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
That's too off-topic.

757
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,200
Um...

758
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,759
You said outside

759
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,240
you wanted to ask me something.

760
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,559
I wanted to say,

761
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,880
lately,

762
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,359
Murat's Dad and Ankar,

763
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,039
the two of them,

764
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,119
are they

765
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,119
having a falling out?

766
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,640
Is it because of my cooking?

767
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,000
So, Mingliang,

768
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,119
see if

769
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,039
with this,

770
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,559
I can help you out somehow.

771
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,640
Mingliang.

772
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,720
Open the door.

773
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,160
Coming.

774
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,200
Let me get dressed.

775
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,480
What are you doing?

776
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,240
Are you trying to wreck the place?

777
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,039
Wreck what?

778
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:56,839
Someone's already robbed you.

779
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,119
And you're still dawdling here.

780
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,759
Hey, what do you mean?

781
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,039
You didn't change your shoes.

782
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,960
Robbed? What do you mean?

783
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,480
What are you talking about?

784
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,239
I asked you to do the eco campaign.

785
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,320
Why won't you do it?

786
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,599
Your love life—

787
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,440
I haven't even sorted that out for you.

788
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
Now your work stuff,

789
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,960
I have to help again.

790
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,280
Do I owe you or what?

791
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,360
Are you stupid?

792
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,960
It's not for me,

793
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,400
it's for yourself.

794
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,199
If you don't hurry up,

795
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,440
Nana will be snatched away.

796
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,719
Nana snatched—

797
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,519
What do you mean?

798
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:38,920
Say it clearly.

799
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,440
Speak, Hu Yue.

800
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,639
Now you're worried, huh?

801
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,760
I'm not telling you.

802
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,559
The campaign requirements and my plan

803
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:47,559
are all on your phone.

804
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,440
Do it or not, up to you.

805
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,360
I'll just pull a few more all-nighters.

806
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Put in a bit more effort.

807
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,760
No—

808
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,119
Yueyue,

809
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:54,960
Just say—

810
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,039
Mama.

811
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,239
Come, sit.

812
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:28,880
You wanted to see me?

813
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:29,719
Is something up?

814
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,159
I'd like you to be Hong Shiliu's manager.

815
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,840
Not sure if you'd consider

816
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,119
our little restaurant.

817
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,519
Mingliang,

818
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,360
I want to invite An Dong to join us officially.

819
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,199
To help you run the restaurant.

820
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:53,840
This...

821
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,679
is a bit sudden.

822
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,199
To join

823
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Hong Shiliu

824
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,239
and work with everyone,

825
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,519
it's my honor.

826
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,239
Of course I'd love to.

827
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,280
But

828
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,840
the pay won't be much for now.

829
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,320
If you can accept seven thousand a month,

830
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,760
we'll cover food and lodging.

831
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,280
No,

832
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,400
I don't want money.

833
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,239
Just food and lodging is fine.

834
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,920
I mainly want to study

835
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,360
Xinjiang cuisine here.

836
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,679
Dong-ge,

837
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,239
Really, I don't want it.

838
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,119
These days,

839
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,599
you've helped upgrade and renovate the place.

840
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,800
Spent quite a bit too.

841
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,320
We'll pay you back for all that.

842
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,440
Just name your price.

843
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,039
How about this—

844
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,840
From each month's

845
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,400
profit,

846
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,679
give me twenty percent.

847
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,239
Is that okay?

848
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,679
The restaurant isn't making much now.

849
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,159
You'd only get three or four thousand.

850
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,440
Maybe just pay a salary instead.

851
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,519
If one day

852
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,239
in the future

853
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,280
Hong Shiliu really takes off,

854
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
and profits go up,

855
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,960
my share increases,

856
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,480
don't hold back.

857
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:10,960
Okay.

858
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,199
Alright.

859
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:14,639
Deal.

860
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,119
Are you wondering if you should ask me

861
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,920
why I want An Dong to be the manager?

862
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,239
Mom,

863
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,320
ever since I was little,

864
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,440
in this restaurant,

865
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,519
there was you,

866
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,039
Murat's Dad,

867
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,800
Mama Bayar,

868
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,320
and later, Ankar.

869
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:07,559
We are all family.

870
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,119
But An Dong—

871
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,159
An Dong is truly capable.

872
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,480
The restaurant's success lately

873
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,599
is thanks to him.

874
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,400
You young people always say

875
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,719
let the experts handle professional work.

876
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,400
Times are changing,

877
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,360
and so are my views.

878
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,000
That's the only reason.

879
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,960
I'm just afraid you'll lose yourself.

880
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,480
Child,

881
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,880
your hands are meant for painting.

882
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,920
Your brushes must never dry out.

883
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,400
Your eyes should see a bigger world.

884
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,039
Don't just stare at the ledger.

885
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,320
Your heart

886
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,920
should feel life's vibrant colors.

887
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,920
Even if you face setbacks,

888
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,800
or get hurt,

889
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,880
don't let the restaurant be your whole world.

890
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,000
Did Yueyue

891
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,679
tell you about the promo video?

892
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,119
It's not just that.

893
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,119
I want you to have more personal space.

894
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,239
That's why I did this.

895
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,119
I want to try, too.

896
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
If An Dong ever leaves one day,

897
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,960
we can always hire another professional manager.

898
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:22,360
They're better at running restaurants than us.

899
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,760
Ankar actually listens to An Dong.

900
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,039
An Dong sees his strengths.

901
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,159
We see them too.

902
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,000
It's different.

903
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,760
For Ankar,

904
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,280
An Dong is more neutral,

905
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,360
more objective.

906
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,440
Maybe,

907
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,559
Murat's Dad

908
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,400
and Ankar's issues

909
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,159
could finally be resolved.

910
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,400
What about your own issues?

911
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,840
This plan is solid overall,

912
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,320
but it lacks tension.

913
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,960
It can't grab people instantly.

914
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
How about we discuss the last project?

915
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,000
That story was quite gripping.

916
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,239
The previous plan

917
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:32,360
was about rescuing a single animal.

918
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,159
It couldn't show

919
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,119
the diversity of Xinjiang's wildlife.

920
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,239
Let's brainstorm more.

921
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,440
Bro,

922
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:49,920
let me introduce everyone.

923
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,280
This is Mingliang, a young artist.

924
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,360
I invited him as outside help.

925
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,960
He also rescued Xiaoxiao.

926
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:57,639
Hello.

927
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,840
Xu Lai from PR.

928
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,840
Hello.

929
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,440
Come, have a seat.

930
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:02,920
Okay.

931
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,639
Yueyue sent me the requirements

932
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,480
and the previous plan.

933
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,960
I have a rough idea.

934
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm not great with words,

935
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,559
so I drew it out.

936
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,639
You can all take a look.

937
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:23,480
Honestly,

938
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,320
this idea is pretty creative.

939
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,159
Using cartoon illustrations

940
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,400
to show the animals

941
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,719
really lowers

942
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,559
our filming costs and difficulty.

943
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:32,559
Right?

944
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:35,679
Sorry.

945
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,800
The idea is great.

946
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,480
It really is.

947
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,039
I'm just thinking—

948
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:42,880
maybe the realism might suffer a bit.

949
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:45,960
How can we organically connect real animals

950
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,880
with these cartoon characters?

951
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,360
How do we bridge that gap?

952
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,199
What if we film

953
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,920
a video of an artist sketching?

954
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:55,519
Use the artist's canvas as the link?

955
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,800
Some video channels

956
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,079
show artists filming themselves painting.

957
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,440
We could try that.

958
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,280
I have some here.

959
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,039
You can take a look.

960
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,760
Can you do this kind of work?

961
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,679
I can give it a try.

962
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,480
Don't just "try,"

963
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,119
If he says "try," it means he can do it.

964
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,079
Let's go scout locations in the park.

965
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,000
Przewalski's horse.

966
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,599
Their most unique feature is the shoulder stripe.

967
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,920
It starts at the mane

968
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,480
and runs all the way to the tail tip.

969
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,199
And their "spring legs."

970
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:08,320
Crouch lower.

971
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,400
Try shooting from below.

972
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:10,480
Okay.

973
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:23,920
I'll help you.
