1
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,240
Do you feel a little empty inside?

2
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,640
It's a bit hard to let go.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,080
But I know it belongs to the sky.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,240
It doesn't belong to me.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,440
Don't worry, Nana.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,879
Grandpa said,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,359
they are brave spirits of the plateau.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,320
They can fly over the Tianshan Mountains,

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,399
over the Taklamakan Desert,

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,239
and over the Kunlun Mountains.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,120
Kids,

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,439
remember,

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,280
a single bird can't cross the snowy mountains.

14
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,319
Mom, where are you going?

15
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,360
Mom is going to the Kunlun Mountains to be a fairy.

16
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,520
Can I go find you then?

17
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,919
Wait until you grow up.

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,360
Nana.

19
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,759
Nana.

20
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,719
Don't come here.

21
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,360
Mom.

22
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,120
I've looked for you so many times.

23
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,240
I came here when I was little.

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,680
I've grown up now.

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,120
I even know how to tie my shoes.

26
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,759
Nana, Mom knows.

27
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,479
But someone is still waiting for you.

28
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,800
Nana.

29
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:23,960
What's wrong?

30
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,719
Everyone has one.

31
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,280
Group one, search over there.

32
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,800
Group two, this way.

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,479
Group three, the hillside.

34
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,360
Yes, yes.

35
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,759
Nana.

36
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
Nana.

37
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,719
Mom.

38
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,240
Nana.

39
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,399
Nana.

40
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,199
Don't fall asleep.

41
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:32,839
Don't fall asleep.

42
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,759
Wake up, let's go home.

43
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,720
Let's go home.

44
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,399
Let's go home.

45
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,600
Nana.

46
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,399
Wake up, Nana.

47
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
Wake up, wake up.

48
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,079
Let's go home.

49
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,160
Let's go home.

50
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,319
In the end,

51
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,519
it led us to the rocks over there.

52
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,839
That's how we found you.

53
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,279
Such a legendary thing happened.

54
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,879
To someone legendary.

55
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,639
If I ever see it again,

56
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,839
I must thank it properly.

57
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,680
If you see it,

58
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,000
please thank it for me too.

59
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,319
Don't make me worry like this again.

60
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,680
Okay?

61
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,240
Okay.

62
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,360
I promise.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,439
I made you worry.

65
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,160
Aisha and I,

66
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,959
we've never really competed.

67
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,360
Running businesses on the same street

68
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,160
isn't easy.

69
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,439
We should

70
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,480
look out for each other more,

71
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,600
and compete less.

72
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,399
My barbecue,

73
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,319
everyone on this street knows it.

74
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,519
Hong Shiliu Restaurant has been open for thirty years.

75
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,439
Hong Shiliu is more than just a restaurant.

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
It's also a symbol for Urumqi,

77
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,720
a benchmark for small restaurants here.

78
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,079
Since Hong Shiliu Restaurant opened,

79
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,120
there's been Free Pilaf seats.

80
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,759
I remember it clearly.

81
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,319
On opening day,

82
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,319
a few of us old friends

83
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,720
bought a table together

84
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,839
and brought it to the restaurant.

85
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,360
That very day,

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,720
we met a

87
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,240
customer in trouble.

88
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,439
Aisha not only let him eat for free,

89
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,319
she turned that table into the Free Pilaf table.

90
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,279
All these years,

91
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,279
so many customers

92
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,199
ate a free pilaf from Aisha

93
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,639
and found the strength to move on.

94
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,759
Don't worry, Mingliang.

95
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,319
Ankar took great photos.

96
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,360
He even shot two videos.

97
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,000
Kept one as backup.

98
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,079
Don't praise me.

99
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,160
Dong guided me the whole time.

100
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,199
Bro.

101
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,360
When are you coming back?

102
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,439
The doctor will check in soon.

103
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,480
If everything's fine,

104
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,600
we can go home tomorrow.

105
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,079
Alright.

106
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,000
Sister Nana,

107
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,199
come back soon.

108
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,399
I'll make you something delicious.

109
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,879
I'll make sure you get a good meal.

110
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,040
Okay.

111
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,519
Make lots of tasty food for me!

112
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,879
During this time,

113
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,879
you two have worked hard.

114
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,079
When I get back,

115
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,959
I'll gather all the info you collected

116
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,560
and combine it with what Mr. Hu found.

117
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,439
We'll go see Lawyer Tian together.

118
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,079
Is Mr. Hu also looking for evidence?

119
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,680
Mr. Hu and I

120
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,519
want to get our two million back.

121
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,639
Can we do it?

122
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,040
Let's give it a try.

123
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,279
You never know.

124
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,959
Alright, I'll stay with Nana first.

125
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,680
I'll stop chatting now.

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,319
We'll talk in person when I'm back.

127
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,279
Okay, goodbye.

128
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,000
It's my fault you had to sell the house.

129
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,480
I know Old Mu

130
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,519
feels awkward living in Hu Yue's new place.

131
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,439
So you guys

132
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
have been looking for a place.

133
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,079
It's a bit small here,

134
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,439
but I've tidied it up.

135
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,759
Three people can squeeze in.

136
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,720
After all, we're all at the restaurant.

137
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,720
We can look out for each other.

138
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,519
I've already bought the bed.

139
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,519
It'll be delivered today.

140
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,240
If you really mind,

141
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,519
I... I can move out.

142
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,199
Alright.

143
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,720
Okay, I'll move out this afternoon.

144
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,200
No, no, that's not what I meant.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,360
You...

146
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,879
You've already bought the bed.

147
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
My dad and I both hate wasting things.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,360
Okay.

149
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,279
Then...

150
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,320
Let's split up and handle things separately.

151
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,960
You go to Hu Yue's and pack up your things.

152
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,840
What about you?

153
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,720
I need to go to the notary office.

154
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,000
Ask them to come along.

155
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,000
Get the evidence from Fang Tao's shop.

156
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,080
Like the storefront,

157
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,080
the signboard,

158
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
and the decorations.

159
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,320
We need to compare all of them.

160
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,039
I'll also gather the photos I have

161
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,919
and the videos,

162
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,720
plus data from major websites.

163
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,639
I'll compile everything.

164
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,600
Then submit it all to the court.

165
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,720
Okay.

166
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,320
Let's go, let's go.

167
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,159
What?

168
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,360
Withdraw investment?

169
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,080
Boss Fang.

170
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,639
What I mean is,

171
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,120
please return my five hundred thousand principal.

172
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,039
I asked when the second round of funds would arrive.

173
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,200
But you immediately talk about withdrawing.

174
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,759
And mention that five hundred thousand principal.

175
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,559
Where is the principal?

176
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,960
Tables, chairs, ceiling—

177
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
all of these are the principal.

178
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,200
Are you out of your mind?

179
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,200
Jianping.

180
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,759
What do you think this place is?

181
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,080
I'm running a legitimate business here.

182
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,279
Not some small workshop.

183
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,879
Old Liu,

184
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,919
let me be honest with you.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,559
Lately,

186
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,080
I've contacted a few wealthy friends.

187
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,639
They all want to invest.

188
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,440
Don't forget,

189
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,960
you're one of the shareholders too.

190
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,720
If you withdraw now,

191
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,720
what does that look like?

192
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
You're undermining me, you know?

193
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,240
Right now, Anton

194
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,360
is itching to sue us.

195
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,639
I'm telling you,

196
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
don't start infighting with me now.

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,759
Boss Fang,

198
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,639
I'll be honest with you.

199
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,080
Back then,

200
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,960
when you asked me to set up Anton,

201
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,879
I felt uneasy about it.

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,759
I couldn't sleep at night.

203
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,600
Now we've set up

204
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,320
a knockoff Hong•Shiliu.

205
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,320
Trying to take down the real Hong Shiliu.

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,399
This... this isn't right.

207
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,679
How is it not right?

208
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,960
They're called Hong Shiliu.

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,759
We're Hong•Shiliu.

210
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,600
Is it the same?

211
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,679
Bo—Boss Fang,

212
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,559
I'm grateful you helped me make money.

213
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,039
It's just lately

214
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
I've had some cash flow issues.

215
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
You have problems,

216
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,600
I don't have any.

217
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,200
Let me tell you, Liu Jianping,

218
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,320
you and I

219
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,159
signed a contract.

220
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,519
Your signature is right there in black and white.

221
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,600
If you want your principal back,

222
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,919
that's possible.

223
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,240
Want to withdraw?

224
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,360
Fine.

225
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,200
But that's a clear breach of contract.

226
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,200
What,

227
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,200
you want to be like Anton

228
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,240
and pay triple the penalty?

229
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,440
That's not what you said before.

230
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,039
When you brought me in as a shareholder,

231
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,559
you said I could withdraw my funds anytime.

232
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,440
Did I say that?

233
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,360
Did I ever say that?

234
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,440
When did I say that?

235
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
If you insist,

236
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,720
Boss Fang,

237
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,000
please don't get mad.

238
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,039
Just pretend

239
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,200
I never said anything.

240
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,080
Alright.

241
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,720
That's more like it.

242
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,200
You'd better hope now

243
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,799
our Hong•Shiliu Restaurant

244
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,320
gets more and more prosperous.

245
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,120
And the money

246
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,679
keeps piling up.

247
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,440
You'll count cash till your hand cramps.

248
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,879
I'll head back now.

249
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
So greedy,

250
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,960
yet so timid.

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,519
Just right.

252
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,720
I bought you two quilts.

253
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,360
If they're not thick enough,

254
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,159
I'll get you more.

255
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,960
Why worry about this?

256
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,559
Mingliang asked you back

257
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,840
for this kind of thing?

258
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,600
Use your time to figure out

259
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,039
how to win back all our customers.

260
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,559
Old Mu,

261
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,960
it's getting late.

262
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,039
Why don't you go freshen up first?

263
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,559
You and Mulati's dad

264
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,559
even did a deep cleaning.

265
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,320
Alright.

266
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,159
To show my thanks,

267
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,840
I'll give you a big gift too.

268
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,200
Cheers!

269
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:36,720
Cheers!

270
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,759
But let me tell you,

271
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,840
I read your letter.

272
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,080
In your letter,

273
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,600
you only mentioned Mingliang's hard work

274
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,720
and Aisha mom's health.

275
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,200
Why didn't you mention me?

276
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,120
Is our relationship not good?

277
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,960
Am I not worth mentioning

278
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,919
in your heart?

279
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,440
Dad, um...

280
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,559
It's getting late.

281
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,200
Why don't you go rest upstairs?

282
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,200
It's the first day, so it'll feel strange.

283
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,600
But we'll get used to it.

284
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,480
Go ahead.

285
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,080
Um...

286
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,840
Your business journal—

287
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,080
can I borrow it to read?

288
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,759
Of course.

289
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,960
Just go and take it.

290
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:41,679
Also,

291
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,000
I have lots of other books in my room.

292
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,519
Whatever you want to read,

293
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,840
just help yourself.

294
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,200
Okay.

295
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:51,919
Thanks, Dong.

296
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,360
Smells so good.

297
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,159
About the restaurant.

298
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,639
Teach Ankar more.

299
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,840
He’s improving fast as a chef.

300
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,919
Management

301
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,440
Still has a long way to go.

302
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,320
No.

303
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,600
You

304
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,840
still trust me

305
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,200
and let me take care of your son?

306
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,840
What I trust

307
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,600
isn’t you.

308
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,159
It’s my son.

309
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,039
Old Liu,

310
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:52,960
what do you think?

311
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,079
We’re back!

312
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,599
You’re back.

313
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,359
Everyone’s moved in.

314
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,559
That’s great.

315
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,000
Really great.

316
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,400
On the intellectual property side,

317
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,799
the evidence chain is solid.

318
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,640
But

319
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,200
the investment contract

320
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
is tricky to handle.

321
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,319
It’s fine.

322
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,920
Let’s prepare for this lawsuit first.

323
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,200
That’s enough to give him trouble.

324
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,319
If I’d known we couldn’t get back the two million,

325
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,960
I should’ve recorded

326
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,079
when signing the contract.

327
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,599
Fang Tao wouldn’t leave such obvious evidence.

328
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,319
It’s okay.

329
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,200
By the way,

330
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,720
there’s more good news.

331
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,359
Last night,

332
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,200
pretty late,

333
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,720
Liu Jianping called me.

334
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,920
He agreed

335
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,119
to testify in court and make amends.

336
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,640
Good.

337
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,920
That’s great!

338
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,680
So,

339
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,319
I’ll make a call.

340
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,240
I’ll set up a meeting with Lawyer Tian.

341
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,319
Does that work?

342
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,279
I’ll contact Liu Jianping.

343
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:25,400
I’ll get in touch with Liu Jianping.

344
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,599
Have him meet the lawyer together.

345
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,000
Right?

346
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,359
Sure, sure.

347
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:27,799
Let’s go.

348
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,119
Ankar,

349
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,960
go see the lawyer with Dong.

350
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,240
Okay.

351
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,720
Get some rest early.

352
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,799
Now we have witnesses

353
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,000
and physical evidence.

354
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,119
We’ve got it all.

355
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,920
The IP case looks solid.

356
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,079
What about the investment agreement?

357
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,400
Mr. Liu,

358
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,000
let me confirm again.

359
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,680
When Fang Tao approached you,

360
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,519
he promised to help you recover

361
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,640
the one million loan Anton owed you.

362
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,279
After it was done,

363
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,480
he gave you a hundred thousand as a kickback.

364
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,640
Is that right?

365
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,200
Yes.

366
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,759
Do you have any evidence?

367
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,640
When I talked to him,

368
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,759
I recorded it.

369
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,000
Jianping, if this works out,

370
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,640
I’ll treat you well.

371
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,039
Alright.

372
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,759
If the evidence holds up,

373
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,000
this is

374
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,920
a classic case of malicious collusion

375
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
harming a third party’s interests.

376
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,960
I’ll organize the materials I have.

377
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,400
File the lawsuit as soon as possible.

378
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,240
I’m telling you,

379
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,279
with this evidence,

380
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,960
we’re set.

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,880
Really set.

382
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,240
Bro,

383
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,400
it’s not a big problem.

384
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,200
Okay.

385
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,640
Pack up your things

386
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,880
and move into my room.

387
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,799
Why?

388
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,599
You three are squeezed into one room.

389
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,279
Isn’t it crowded?

390
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,599
I’m studying, aren’t I?

391
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,720
I have lots of questions

392
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,240
to ask Dong.

393
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,440
Alright then.

394
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,039
Up to you.

395
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,960
Anytime.

396
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:12,920
Okay.

397
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,599
Mingliang,

398
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,400
I’ve made up my mind.

399
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,359
I’ve decided.

400
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,640
Decided what?

401
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,000
What are you two talking about now?

402
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,640
As long as you’ve decided.

403
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,200
I’ll send some materials to Lawyer Tian.

404
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,759
They’ll be useful in court.

405
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:39,720
Alright.

406
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,680
Bro,

407
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,519
What’s our plan next?

408
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,319
What do you think?

409
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,480
I think

410
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,160
I should follow your plan.

411
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,480
I think

412
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,000
while we wait for the verdict,

413
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,319
our restaurant

414
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,440
still needs to run.

415
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
So I have an idea.

416
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,160
Dong filmed some videos before.

417
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,759
Let’s re-edit them

418
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,960
and make a Hong Shiliu brand story.

419
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,039
Then,

420
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,559
ask Guangtian to make a QR code.

421
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,160
Everyone at the restaurant

422
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,200
can scan and watch.

423
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,759
Isn’t this intellectual property?

424
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,039
Good lad.

425
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:31,960
Nice!

426
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,359
Don’t underestimate me, okay?

427
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,759
I really didn’t like studying before.

428
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
But look at me now—

429
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,240
I’m so self-motivated.

430
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,759
Not just reading books,

431
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,279
I even study Dong’s notes.

432
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,119
Let’s do it your way.

433
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,519
Ankar,

434
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,160
you’ll run the restaurant from now on.

435
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,680
If you’re unsure,

436
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,160
talk it over with Dong.

437
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,279
What about you?

438
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,759
The restaurant’s been open so long,

439
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,440
you’ve forgotten I’m a painter, right?

440
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,839
I still owe a few paintings.

441
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,200
I need to finish them.

442
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,519
Don’t tell me you’re painting apples again.

443
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,160
Bro,

444
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,839
do you think I can do it?

445
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,240
You’re a young and ambitious lad.

446
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,319
Online, they say

447
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,799
this is the gentlest time
in Urumqi.

448
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,319
Whenever I have time

449
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,759
I'll come here with you.

450
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,960
Really.

451
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:08,279
Really.

452
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:21,599
Nana,

453
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,359
there's something

454
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,519
I'd like to discuss with you.

455
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,440
I want to rethink

456
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,400
my own future.

457
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,799
This time, it's not for Mom,

458
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,920
not for the restaurant,

459
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,680
it's what I truly want
after thinking it over.

460
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,079
Because I don't know
what the future holds,

461
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,079
I want to hear your thoughts.

462
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,240
But

463
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,039
no matter what comes next,

464
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,519
no matter which path I take,

465
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,039
I'll hold your hand

466
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:01,920
and never let go.

467
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,559
Go do what you want.

468
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,559
I'm here for you.

469
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,440
Thank you.

470
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,000
Nana.

471
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,960
Top up two thousand yuan

472
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
to unlock the secret menu.

473
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,759
Can I still join this event?

474
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:37,759
Sorry,

475
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,480
that's not our restaurant.

476
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,240
Look,

477
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,759
we're Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

478
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,519
That one has a dot in the name.

479
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,440
Isn't that your branch?

480
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,920
No, we don't have any branches.

481
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,960
And look,

482
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,519
we have an open kitchen.

483
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,240
You can see how every dish

484
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,279
is prepared.

485
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,799
We've never had

486
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,839
any secret menu or anything.

487
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,559
Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

488
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,240
Hong•Shiliu.

489
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,680
It's way too easy
to get confused.

490
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,079
Don't you think?

491
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:02,519
Yes, yes.

492
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:03,240
How about this—

493
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,079
scan this QR code.

494
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,240
It has

495
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,240
the real Hong Shiliu brand story.

496
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,079
Take a look.

497
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,000
Alright, alright.

498
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,519
Okay.

499
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,839
That's all for now, okay?

500
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,440
Coming, coming!

501
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,799
Here you go!

502
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,200
Fried pork noodles.

503
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,039
Six skewers of kebab, here!

504
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,480
That's awesome! (Xinjiang dialect)

505
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,279
Who came up with
such a clever idea?

506
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:29,799
Lately, our restaurant

507
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,799
has been doing much better.

508
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,839
It wasn't my idea.

509
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,559
Who was it?

510
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,079
It was Ankar's suggestion.

511
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,720
Mulati,

512
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,079
one big plate chicken,

513
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,079
two rice.

514
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:44,759
Okay.

515
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,279
Ankar.

516
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,720
Why are you looking at me?

517
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,000
Go on.

518
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,519
A bunch of dishonest people.

519
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,519
I had the contract ready.

520
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,359
They just backed out.

521
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,759
No integrity at all.

522
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,400
Boss Fang,

523
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,920
they probably heard

524
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,279
Hong Shiliu is suing us.

525
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:17,839
They're scared.

526
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,519
If you want a golden bowl,
you've got to take risks.

527
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,039
So what do we do now?

528
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,799
People's Court.

529
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,720
Call Liu Jianping.

530
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,519
Hello,

531
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,680
the number you dialed
is busy.

532
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,440
He hung up.

533
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:53,920
Call again.

534
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,440
Hello,

535
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,200
the number you dialed
is busy.

536
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,519
That rascal Liu Jianping

537
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,920
actually stabbed me
in the back.

538
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,680
I'm contacting a lawyer
right now.

539
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,319
Liu Jianping.

540
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,599
That kid Ankar

541
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,319
is really talented.

542
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,839
Lately,

543
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,480
he's like a whole new person.

544
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,440
He's doing great.

545
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,400
I can finally relax.

546
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,000
Mingliang can truly
let go now.

547
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,000
Of course.

548
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,559
I called everyone here today

549
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,839
to go over

550
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,599
the art exhibition venue.

551
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,119
Nana and I searched
for a venue for you,

552
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,319
we ran our legs off.

553
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,359
Mingliang,

554
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,440
I also looked online
for some options.

555
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,000
But I think

556
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,400
none of them are suitable.

557
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,240
I asked several places too,

558
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,599
but none would take it.

559
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,759
I get it.

560
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,519
I'm not famous.

561
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,160
And I can't afford
their venue fees.

562
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,319
Most importantly,

563
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,240
I can't confirm

564
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,839
the exact date
for my exhibition.

565
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,720
It depends on my painting progress.

566
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,119
Basically, professional venues

567
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,640
probably won't accept me.

568
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,960
Don't get discouraged.

569
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,279
Keep searching.

570
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,519
If professional venues
don't work out,

571
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,039
maybe we try a new approach.

572
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,960
I saw online that some people

573
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,119
hold art shows in cafes.

574
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,559
Maybe this place
is a good choice?

575
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,920
An art show in a cafe—

576
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,960
low cost and good traffic.

577
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,000
Art and life blend together.

578
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,039
If a cafe can host an art show,

579
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,559
why not a restaurant too?

580
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:33,839
Would you like extra noodles?

581
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,680
No, that's fine. No extra noodles.

582
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,319
Alright.

583
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,839
Hello.

584
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,480
Add one order of stir-fried morel
with meat.

585
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,480
Okay, got it.

586
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,839
One oil-seared meat noodles.

587
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:41,720
No extra noodles.

588
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,279
And one stir-fried morel
with meat.

589
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
Barbecue's here.

590
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,160
It's hot, it's hot.

591
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,960
Come on, eat while it's hot.

592
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,519
Waiter.

593
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,039
What do you need?

594
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,079
Two barbecues.

595
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:50,559
No problem.

596
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,039
Waiter.

597
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Add one wheat gluten here.

598
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:52,720
Okay.

599
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,920
Two barbecues.

600
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,519
One wheat gluten.

601
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,480
Hurry up, hurry up!

602
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:12,799
Welcome.

603
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,839
Looks really real, doesn't it?

604
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,440
Yeah.

605
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,400
Actually, it's fake.

606
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,680
What nonsense!

607
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,200
Really nice.

608
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,200
Sadik Dad.

609
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,160
Nana.

610
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,519
Mingliang.

611
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,440
Congratulations!

612
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,240
Thank you.

613
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,039
A gift for you.

614
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Congrats on your art exhibition.

615
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,480
Soulmate.

616
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,559
Thank you.

617
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,000
I'll take Dad to see the paintings first.

618
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,440
Alright.

619
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,240
Sister Nana.

620
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,039
Sadik Dad.

621
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,599
Have some tea.

622
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,200
Thank you.

623
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,039
This is the Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

624
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,000
Sorry about that.

625
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
We're not open today.

626
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,279
We're holding an art exhibition.

627
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,559
We're here for the exhibition.

628
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,440
Look.

629
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
You're a fan of the blogger?

630
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:34,759
Been following for so long.

631
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,720
Finally get to see the real work.

632
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,039
Come in, come in!

633
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:51,400
What's wrong, bro?

634
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,839
Are you worried about Dong?

635
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,440
A little.

636
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,759
If once doesn't work, try twice.

637
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,680
We'll definitely get a fair result.

638
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
Alright, great artist.

639
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,279
Stop worrying.

640
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,160
Lots of new faces today.

641
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,440
Go take care of them.

642
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:07,920
Let's go.

643
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,519
Ankar.

644
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:19,760
Get me a drink.

645
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,800
I've seen many paintings
of the Kunlun Mountains.

646
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Some are rugged and strong,

647
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,480
some are majestic and lofty,

648
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,800
some are mysterious and deep.

649
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,360
But yours is different.

650
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,280
There's warmth in the vastness.

651
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,519
Powerful yet still serene.

652
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:53,840
Very powerful.

653
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,559
Thank you for your encouragement.

654
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,039
My name is Mingliang.

655
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:58,079
My name is Mingliang.

656
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,519
Mingliang.

657
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,039
Yes.

658
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,119
That's a nice name.

659
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,239
That decorative painting

660
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,480
feels very commercial.

661
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,800
Is that yours too?

662
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,760
Yes.

663
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,679
To be honest,

664
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,320
I painted those

665
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,400
just to make money.

666
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,239
But putting them here

667
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
isn't very harmonious.

668
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,679
It kind of ruins the exhibition's artistry.

669
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,920
But,

670
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,119
you're really bold.

671
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,039
Aren't you afraid that one day,
as an artist,

672
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,760
these paintings

673
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
will bring criticism?

674
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,679
Honestly,

675
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,840
I've struggled with it for a long time.

676
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,159
But every painting here

677
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,840
is a part of my life.

678
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,039
The people I've met,

679
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,000
the scenery I've seen,

680
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,880
the stories I've lived,

681
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,000
they're all my journey.

682
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,400
These paintings belong here.

683
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,239
Even if they seem a bit out of place,

684
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,320
they're real.

685
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,239
In art,

686
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,079
sincerity matters most.

687
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,400
That's interesting.

688
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,000
Secretary Xu, any instructions?

689
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,039
Mingliang.

690
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,280
Let me tell you something.

691
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,679
Did the art academy director
visit your exhibition?

692
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,639
The director?

693
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,440
Is he in his fifties?

694
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,199
Speaks slowly and calmly?

695
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,199
Yes, that's him.

696
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,079
This year,

697
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,000
it's the 70th anniversary
of the autonomous region.

698
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,920
Our publicity department
and the art academy

699
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,480
want to co-host an exhibition.

700
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,719
We hope these paintings

701
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,960
can fully showcase Xinjiang.

702
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,400
I know about that.

703
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,159
It's gathering works from everywhere.

704
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,280
But I heard

705
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,920
the exhibition pieces
are already set?

706
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,079
Yes.

707
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,159
They're basically chosen.

708
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,000
But,

709
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,079
we all agree

710
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,239
it's missing a painting that

711
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,480
shows the Kunlun Mountains
from a new angle.

712
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,679
I've seen your Kunlun Mountains.

713
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,920
I recommended you to the director.

714
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,400
That's why he stood in front of
"Kunlun Morning Light"

715
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,280
for so long.

716
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:26,800
Yes.

717
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,199
The director will have someone
contact you.

718
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,599
Xu Lai.

719
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:31,719
I really

720
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,199
thank you.

721
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
No need to thank me.

722
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,760
Without a talented horse,

723
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,280
even a good judge is useless.

724
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,400
If you thank anyone,
thank yourself.

725
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:42,840
Alright.

726
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,400
That's all.

727
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,800
Just this.

728
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,079
I'll get back to work.

729
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,000
Thank you for coming.

730
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,679
And thank you so much for testifying.

731
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,360
I'm not doing this just for you.

732
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,880
It's also for my daughter.

733
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,239
I don't want

734
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,400
my daughter to have a dad she dislikes.

735
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,239
By doing this,

736
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:42,480
Yaya will definitely be proud of you.

737
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:45,920
As for Fang Tao and me,

738
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,960
we'll return the two million penalty

739
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,840
back to you.

740
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,559
The fake Hong•Shiliu

741
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,639
has also been ordered to fix things.

742
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,599
Luckily, Hong Shiliu

743
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,320
is still Hong Shiliu.

744
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,079
Yes.

745
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,119
What are your plans next?

746
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,039
I've had enough of all this.

747
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,679
I've stayed long enough.

748
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,639
I miss home.

749
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,239
I have a friend

750
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,199
who's run a restaurant for over ten years.

751
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:10,639
He's a very reliable person.

752
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,400
If you're interested,

753
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,039
I can connect you.

754
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,480
Introduce you to each other.

755
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:19,719
Is that okay?

756
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,320
Of course.

757
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,159
Their restaurant

758
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,039
isn't doing great right now,

759
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:24,559
but

760
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,280
he's truly sincere.

761
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,960
I think it's worth considering.

762
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:29,360
Really.

763
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,599
You can give it a try.

764
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,280
Let me share some good news.

765
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,199
It's finally coming to an end.

766
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,039
The money should arrive soon.

767
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,280
That's great!

768
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,519
That's great, wonderful news!

769
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,559
That's great!

770
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,880
That's great!

771
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,760
Thank you, everyone.

772
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,639
We really appreciate you, bro.

773
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,039
Dad, we can buy a house now.

774
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:13,840
A villa.

775
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:16,400
We can't afford a villa yet.

776
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Last time I went to Sister Yueyue's

777
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,880
and checked out their neighborhood.

778
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,360
It's pretty nice.

779
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:19,960
Really?

780
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,159
Maybe we should think about it.

781
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,760
Sure.

782
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,679
Then we'll come over for meals often!

783
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,519
Bro,

784
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,159
aren't you and Nana thinking about it?

785
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,559
We haven't planned that far ahead.

786
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,039
Right.

787
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,159
Our short-term plan

788
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,440
is to travel Xinjiang with our parents.

789
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,760
Try the pike Nana keeps recommending.

790
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,280
Aisha, I'm so jealous of you.

791
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,280
When I retire,

792
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,079
I'll take you there.

793
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:43,840
You said it!

794
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,880
I've got my little sweetheart too.

795
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,280
It's not like anyone's missing one.

796
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,920
Right?

797
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,039
Me too.

798
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:01,960
On such a wonderful day,

799
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,239
let's take a photo.

800
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:03,920
Yes, yes!

801
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,559
We must capture this moment.

802
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,280
Um,

803
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,679
how about we

804
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,840
stand under the pomegranate tree

805
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,239
for a big group photo?

806
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:09,920
Good, good!

807
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,280
Mingliang,

808
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,239
then you can paint it.

809
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,239
Okay.

810
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,239
Yueyue,

811
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,199
let's go get ready.

812
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:16,719
Yes, yes!

813
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,400
Let's go, let's go! Sounds good.

814
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:17,880
Aisha,

815
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,199
let's go, let's get ready.

816
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:21,519
Right?

817
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:21,920
Okay, Dad.

818
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,519
Mingliang, when you

819
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,719
Mingliang, when you were little,

820
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,440
just one apple as a kid.

821
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,920
I remember my first time at Hong Shiliu,

822
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,519
I sat right here.

823
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,119
Had Free Pilaf.

824
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,400
I finished one plate,

825
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,039
then ordered lamb chops,

826
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,880
and got rice two more times.

827
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,960
Bayar was so annoyed

828
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,280
he kept rolling his eyes at me.

829
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:27,119
Now,

830
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,840
all the problems are solved.

831
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,639
Hong Shiliu is getting better and better.

832
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,320
I should also

833
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,679
You weren't here when we picked pomegranates.

834
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,280
Bayar saved this one just for you.

835
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:48,840
Here.

836
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,199
Time for a photo!

837
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:16,719
Photo time!

838
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:17,679
Hurry, hurry!

839
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,320
Let's go!

840
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:18,840
I'll sit here.

841
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,199
Slow down.

842
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:22,599
Okay.

843
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,719
Okay.

844
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:24,840
Ten-second countdown.

845
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,440
Look at the camera, don't move.

846
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,679
Papa Hu,

847
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
you're too serious.

848
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,840
Let's all shout together.

849
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,280
Is the pomegranate sweet?

850
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,239
Sweet!
