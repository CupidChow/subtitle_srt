1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,719
Let's go.

2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:09,759
Nana.

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,240
Nana.

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,199
Nana.

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,160
Nana.

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,079
Ming Liang.

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:20,719
Me.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,480
Here's a bookmark I drew for you.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,039
It's beautiful.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,160
Thank you.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,280
This sketchbook is for you.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,079
We'll meet again.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,600
Mama.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,840
Is this what farewell feels like?

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,399
As long as we think of each other,

16
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,240
we're never truly apart.

17
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,520
Look, this is

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,960
our farewell moment with the Crane of Courage.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,319
It's still hard to let go, isn't it?

20
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,840
After all, we've spent

21
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,080
so much time together.

22
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,639
Goodbye.

23
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,439
Fly on, together with the wind.

24
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,039
Home at last, free at last.

25
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,039
Life is strength.

26
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,400
Life is freedom.

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,680
Life is a miracle.

28
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,759
I believe we and the Crane of Courage

29
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,520
will meet again in even better ways.

30
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,759
Because we've already

31
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,280
become good friends, right?

32
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,520
Uncle Turson.

33
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,360
I left in a hurry.

34
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,159
I forgot my phone.

35
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,240
Can I send it to you from home?

36
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,080
It's fine, it's fine.

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,439
It's seventy-three in total, right?

38
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,479
Fifty.

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
I just heard seventy-three.

40
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,080
We're all neighbors.

41
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,520
That's the wholesale price.

42
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,039
That won't do.

43
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,400
I can't take advantage of you.

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,120
Wait, wait.

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,319
You painted my sign for free.

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,520
Can't I give you a discount on the veggies?

47
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,879
It has to be fair.

48
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,520
Okay, I'll send it to you from home.

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,240
Alright.

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,800
Fresh veggies for sale!

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,479
Cheap!

52
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
The veggies are back.

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,039
Coming, coming.

54
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,639
Which one should we wash first?

55
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:05,879
Let me do it, Ming Liang.

56
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,800
I'm here.

57
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,439
Once this pot is ready,

58
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,279
your veggies will fit right in.

59
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,399
As long as nothing's delayed.

60
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

61
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,759
Ming Liang.

62
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,199
How is it?

63
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,399
We didn't run late, did we?

64
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,000
Just right.

65
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:27,920
Ming Liang

66
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,480
Since our restaurant started delivery

67
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,480
I've been feeling so anxious inside

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Every night I dream

69
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
about things like late orders

70
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,079
and bad reviews

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,519
It's really stressful

72
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,000
Let me tell you all about

73
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,680
um...

74
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,120
I bought too much cabbage and stuff recently

75
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
These delivery orders

76
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,399
are just like Bayar's temper

77
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,680
Sometimes there's none

78
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,920
Sometimes they come all at once

79
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,600
It's got me confused about buying groceries

80
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,759
Murat, you just buy what you need

81
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,000
So what am I supposed to do?

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,000
Alright, alright

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,319
We have customers here

84
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,040
Everything takes time

85
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,279
After a while

86
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,399
when customer numbers stabilize

87
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,040
our purchasing will stabilize too

88
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,720
It's fine

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,519
Ankar

90
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,720
I've got a task for you

91
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,040
Keep an eye on ingredient usage in the kitchen

92
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,800
If you notice anything running low

93
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,480
immediately take the related dishes

94
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,319
off the delivery platform

95
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,399
Once it's restocked

96
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,319
put them back on

97
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,000
Understand?

98
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,920
Sure, no problem

99
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Don't worry

100
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,399
Boss

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,600
Hello

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,720
Look here

103
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,560
The plastic wrap on your delivery box wasn't tight

104
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,839
The food spilled

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,160
That's not my fault

106
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:30,879
What's wrong?

107
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,160
Let me see

108
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,439
The customer complained about me

109
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,199
Who am I supposed to talk to about this?

110
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,160
That can't be, Ming Liang

111
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,680
We always wrap those boxes

112
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,759
really tightly

113
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,920
We're very sorry

114
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,560
This is definitely our fault

115
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,120
We'll cover your loss

116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,040
Ankar

117
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,240
Contact the platform

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,920
Explain the situation

119
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,360
Ask them to remove the bad review for the courier

120
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,040
We'll take care of all the losses

121
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,040
Please leave him your contact info

122
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,360
If there's any issue, contact us anytime

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,920
Sorry

124
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,680
Really sorry

125
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,319
Brother, here's the thing

126
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:55,920
Let me tell you

127
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,240
Here

128
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,879
Don't worry, at Hong Shiliu Restaurant

129
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,360
we'll never let you suffer a loss

130
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,000
Ming Liang

131
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,360
It's probably just been too busy lately

132
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm all mixed up

133
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,800
Maybe I didn't wrap the box tight enough

134
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,920
My fault, my fault

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,480
My fault

136
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,920
No, it's all my fault

137
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,120
I

138
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,720
was really slow getting the food out

139
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,800
so I made you

140
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,560
so anxious

141
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,360
None of you did anything wrong

142
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,480
I chose these delivery boxes

143
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,920
They're just not sealed well enough

144
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,560
Next time I'll pick a box

145
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,160
with a better seal, that'll fix it

146
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,680
But those boxes cost more

147
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,720
That'll raise our costs

148
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,920
We're just starting out

149
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,160
Some early investment is necessary

150
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,600
We can't let price

151
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,040
cause this to happen again

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,240
It's not a big problem

153
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,240
It's not a big problem

154
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,920
You all get back to work

155
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,040
I'll check on things

156
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,920
Alright

157
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:39,800
Alright

158
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,360
Today marks one week since

159
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
Hong Shiliu Restaurant reopened

160
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,319
and our first week doing delivery

161
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,600
We've had two hundred delivery orders

162
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,920
Thanks for your hard work, everyone

163
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,360
Let's keep it up tomorrow

164
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,240
Ming Liang

165
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,040
I see other restaurants

166
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,920
get a hundred or two orders a day

167
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
and they're so organized

168
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
We've only had two hundred all week

169
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,360
and we're already swamped

170
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,439
Your kitchen is like a battlefield

171
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Exactly

172
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,680
Take it slow

173
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,480
Right

174
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,680
The beginning is always the hardest

175
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,360
I think we're doing great

176
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't get discouraged, everyone

177
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
I think starting tomorrow

178
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,720
we should organize all orders

179
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,480
by time

180
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
and separate delivery from dine-in

181
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,240
Use red clips for dine-in orders

182
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,919
and blue for delivery

183
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,440
All our delivery orders

184
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,919
should be sorted by platform

185
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,360
Couriers just give their number when they arrive

186
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,360
No need for them to sort it out

187
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,120
That's a good idea

188
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,240
Hearing it like this

189
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,799
it sounds much clearer

190
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,039
So we won't

191
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,480
get all mixed up

192
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,240
and waste time

193
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,320
There are always more solutions than problems

194
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,559
YOU HAVE A NEW DELIVERY ORDER

195
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,879
PLEASE HANDLE IT PROMPTLY

196
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,240
Have a seat

197
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,320
You've all worked hard today

198
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,919
Ming Liang, let me help you

199
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,440
It's fine

200
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
I can do it myself

201
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,240
Five yuan

202
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,360
Nana

203
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
No bread today?

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,039
I've already ordered delivery

205
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,559
Okay

206
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,919
Take care

207
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,519
Leave it at the door, thanks

208
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,279
It's me, Ming Liang

209
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,559
What's wrong? What happened?

210
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,559
No, no, nothing.

211
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,279
Your delivery.

212
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,919
Sorry you had to come in person.

213
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,159
The order was wrong.

214
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,559
I was worried you'd leave a bad review.

215
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,159
I made you green apricot soup rice.

216
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,559
The kind we had as kids.

217
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,519
Yeah.

218
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,559
It's only in season once a year.

219
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,559
Now's the best time to eat it.

220
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,759
I remember you loved it as a child.

221
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,399
You always had half a bowl more.

222
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,519
Thanks.

223
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,279
This weekend,

224
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,960
I invited Hu Yue, Ankar, and Farman

225
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,080
to go to Nanshan together.

226
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,200
There are lots of new things there now.

227
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,279
Like stargazing guesthouses and such.

228
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:15,799
Take a look.

229
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,159
Pretty nice, right?

230
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,159
Yeah.

231
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,080
If you have time,

232
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
we can go together.

233
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,279
I've been to all those places.

234
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,080
You guys go ahead.

235
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:32,799
Bye.

236
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,080
Be safe on the road.

237
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,799
What did you buy? It's so heavy.

238
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,519
Take a look.

239
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,919
No idea.

240
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,159
Open it and see.

241
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,679
What is this?

242
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,159
I never bought this.

243
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,559
Maybe it was sent to the wrong place.

244
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,440
Did you order it and forget?

245
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,759
I do that all the time.

246
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,559
Really?

247
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,320
This one has hydraulic assist.

248
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,159
If there's a problem, I'll return it for you.

249
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:32,919
Nana.

250
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,440
Do you have a boyfriend now?

251
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,320
I don't.

252
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,440
You denied it so fast.

253
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,559
There must be something going on.

254
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:41,559
No.

255
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,799
It's your boyfriend.

256
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,159
My boyfriend?

257
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,559
Ming Liang.

258
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,159
Don't overthink it.

259
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,279
Last time I took Mama Aiyixia to the hospital,

260
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,960
he gave me this.

261
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,679
It was probably just to thank me.

262
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,679
Nana.

263
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,679
Let me tell you a secret.

264
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,919
Don't tell anyone else.

265
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,320
Ming Liang and my mom don't know.

266
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,279
I have a boyfriend.

267
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
He's my first love.

268
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,679
My mom was totally against it when she found out.

269
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,759
If it weren't for my dad

270
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,320
and Mama Aiyixia holding her back,

271
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,080
she would've made a scene at his work.

272
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,679
My sister was about to get married then.

273
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,279
She said she was moving to Fujian.

274
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,799
She was already upset.

275
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,919
I didn't want her to feel worse.

276
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,440
So I just told her we'd broken up.

277
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,159
Poor thing.

278
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,159
We've been dating in secret all these years.

279
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,279
It's been tough, hasn't it?

280
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,039
You have no idea how hard it's been.

281
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,159
I don't even dare send packages home.

282
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,039
I send everything to the Rescue Center.

283
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,759
I always ask Li Zhe to pick them up.

284
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,440
After a while, he got suspicious.

285
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,799
But I didn't expect

286
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,559
you to be so nosy too.

287
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,039
You even suspect me and Ming Liang.

288
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,919
You and Ming Liang are so close.

289
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,440
You've known each other so long.

290
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,200
Of course I...

291
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,279
I've always seen him as a brother.

292
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,440
Do you remember before you moved?

293
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,759
Studying.

294
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,399
After he finished his homework,

295
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,559
he'd watch me do mine.

296
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,440
After I finished,

297
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,159
he'd check it all over again.

298
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,320
Even more annoying than my mom.

299
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,159
Yeah.

300
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,320
He was like a mountain

301
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,679
on top of me and Ankar.

302
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,679
I'm with Ankar.

303
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,919
I'd never be with him.

304
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,159
You don't like him,

305
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,799
but that doesn't mean he doesn't like you.

306
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,039
Forget it, things like this...

307
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,399
I don't know how to explain it to you.

308
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,440
Maybe you should try dating.

309
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,279
You'll understand once you do.

310
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,319
If you have time,

311
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,799
we can go together.

312
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,519
I've been to all those places.

313
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,319
You guys go ahead.

314
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:17,920
Bye.

315
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,319
Be safe on the road.

316
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,519
That's Huihui's voice.

317
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:54,920
It's calling for its companion.

318
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,559
And it got a response.

319
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:06,920
It won't come back, will it?

320
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,039
Huimei is gone.

321
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,160
Wild release succeeded.

322
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,799
Raised for four months and eight days.

323
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,319
Don't get hurt out there, okay?

324
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,279
Protecting the health of the gray wolf pack

325
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,279
also protects Tianshan

326
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,319
and the balance of the natural ecosystem.

327
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,519
We all understand the reasons.

328
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,200
But it still hurts inside.

329
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,680
Director Gao

330
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,160
Wounded hearts need healing food.

331
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,160
I know a thirty-year-old restaurant.

332
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,039
The flavors are authentic.

333
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,319
Should we go try it?

334
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,440
You all go ahead.

335
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,920
I need to work overtime anyway.

336
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,559
I'll reorganize the documents.

337
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,519
Let's go together.

338
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,559
Invite the other team too.

339
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,920
It's my treat today.

340
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,440
Let's all enjoy a good meal.

341
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,039
Let's go.

342
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,519
Go.

343
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,039
Go.

344
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,319
Alright, alright.

345
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,559
Got it, got it.

346
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,759
Ming Liang, Yueyue tonight

347
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,559
is coming with colleagues to our restaurant.

348
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,839
That's great, welcome!

349
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,559
Ankar, Murat

350
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,519
So, Yueyue and her colleagues

351
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,039
are coming to eat at our restaurant tonight.

352
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,200
Make something delicious.

353
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,559
Don't worry, Mama Bayar.

354
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,319
I'll show off my best skills.

355
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:31,880
Don't worry.

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,839
Murat

357
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,319
Time to make our girl proud.

358
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,960
I'll make them eat a whole lamb.

359
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,240
And they'll want a second one!

360
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,079
Don't just brag.

361
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,039
Here, try some yogurt.

362
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,559
You get all this just for coming in.

363
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,039
That's so generous.

364
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,559
You could get full without even using chopsticks.

365
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,240
Come on, let's share.

366
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
Say my name when you come here

367
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,720
and you'll get VIP treatment.

368
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,359
Really?

369
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,319
I'm treating everyone today.

370
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,759
Thank you all

371
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,359
for taking care of Yueyue.

372
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,319
Everyone at this table is family.

373
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,319
I'll handle it, you go ahead.

374
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:39,839
Okay.

375
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,559
Eat and drink well.

376
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,839
Let us know if you need anything.

377
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,079
If you can't decide, just ask me.

378
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,200
Yueyue's picks will satisfy you.

379
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,039
Okay.

380
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,759
Is that your mystery guy?

381
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,880
Nonsense! I'll smack you!

382
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,720
Come on, come on.

383
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,400
I've prepared some fresh fruit for everyone.

384
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:58,559
Here.

385
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,359
Try it, try it.

386
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:00,880
Mom

387
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,559
Isn't fruit for after the meal?

388
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,400
You're serving it now?

389
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,319
If they're full, who'll eat the meal?

390
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,279
When did it get so complicated?

391
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,799
I—I’ll eat.

392
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,359
I just love fruit.

393
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:10,559
See?

394
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,279
Look, what do you want to eat?

395
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:12,799
Order.

396
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,000
Alright.

397
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:14,960
Take care.

398
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,559
I won't hold back!

399
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,559
I'm only ordering the expensive stuff.

400
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:20,799
Order number eight?

401
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,799
Is it not ready?

402
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,839
Number eight.

403
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,039
No, it's not here.

404
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
Maybe the delivery guy took the wrong one.

405
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,079
Sit here and have some water first.

406
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,759
I'll go after him.

407
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,519
Okay.

408
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,599
Hello?

409
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,880
Hold on.

410
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,559
Nana

411
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,079
Alright.

412
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,599
They're speaking a foreign language.

413
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,559
I can't understand it.

414
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,079
Is it a foreign school wanting to admit Ming Liang?

415
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,079
I'll take the call.

416
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,319
Be sure to ask clearly.

417
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,720
Is it about the admission?

418
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,720
Don't worry.

419
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,039
Hello.

420
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,000
Is this Ming Liang?

421
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,519
Hello, I'm Ming Liang's friend.

422
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,880
He's not here right now.

423
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,559
May I ask who you are?

424
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,359
Hello, I'm Dario.

425
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,039
I'm Ming Liang's master's program advisor.

426
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,039
I really admire his work.

427
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:19,880
I hope he'll reconsider joining my project.

428
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,480
Thank you, Mr. Dario.

429
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,039
When he returns,

430
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,200
I'll have him call you back.

431
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,039
Alright, thank you, goodbye.

432
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,880
Was it a call from a foreign university?

433
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,519
Do they want to admit Ming Liang?

434
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,960
It's Ming Liang's advisor.

435
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,880
He wants to comfort Ming Liang.

436
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,359
The advisor is very kind.

437
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,839
Ming Liang should really thank him.

438
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:50,799
Yes.

439
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:52,319
Go ahead.

440
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,480
Go eat with your colleagues.

441
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,200
Okay.

442
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:21,839
So what's going on?

443
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,799
Why so mysterious?

444
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,559
Dario just called.

445
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,319
Mama Aiyixia answered.

446
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,000
She knows now.

447
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,640
No, she handed it to me later.

448
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,119
See how nervous I am?

449
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,799
She doesn't understand English.

450
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,039
What did Dario say?

451
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,039
He said you declined the offer.

452
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,039
He regrets it.

453
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,200
Okay.

454
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
I'll call him back.

455
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,759
Have you ever thought

456
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,039
there might be a better way to handle this?

457
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,880
This is the best way right now.

458
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,240
Ming Liang

459
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,559
Mama Aiyixia

460
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,319
Ankar's new Spicy Chili Ice Cream

461
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,839
Nana hasn't tried it yet.

462
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,319
Here.

463
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,039
Spicy Chili Ice Cream

464
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,720
Such a cutting-edge idea.

465
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,759
Anjihai Flat Pepper is redder than
other chilies.

466
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,839
Its color is a bit more vibrant.

467
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,640
The red pigment can be used for lipstick.

468
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,319
After Ankar saw the video,

469
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,039
he said,

470
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:33,839
"If it can be made into lipstick,

471
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,240
why not make it into ice cream?"

472
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Let's all give it a try.

473
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,799
Didn't expect it would actually work.

474
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,279
Try it now.

475
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,079
It's cold, sweet, and spicy.

476
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,359
The taste is really unique.

477
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:52,759
Amir

478
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,799
You saw it all, right?

479
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,839
I failed to care for our son.

480
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,599
I even became a burden to Ming Liang.

481
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,839
If you were still here,

482
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:06,480
none of this would have happened.

483
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,519
If Captain Amir saw you sad,

484
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,000
his heart would break like Baogu Nang crumbs.

485
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,000
Sister-in-law,

486
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,319
your tears

487
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,240
could string a pearl necklace by now.

488
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,519
Please, don't cry anymore.

489
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,640
If you keep crying,

490
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,200
I'll take them as family heirlooms!

491
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:51,960
Hey.

492
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,799
My dad just called me.

493
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,559
Mama Aiyixia went to Memorial Park.

494
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,559
She found out.

495
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,519
She thought she had accepted it.

496
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,559
She accepted it.

497
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,799
But when planning things, she realized

498
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,079
there's so much she can't let go.

499
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,559
It's normal to feel that way.

500
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,079
You keep everything bottled up inside.

501
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,559
That's even worse for your health.

502
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,319
Getting out for a walk helps a lot.

503
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,400
It's time to go back.

504
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
If we don't,

505
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,519
Ming Liang will start to worry.

506
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,279
No rush.

507
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,960
These two kids

508
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:36,960
will be here soon.

509
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,319
Mom.

510
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,200
Dad Sadiq.

511
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,240
Mom.

512
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:10,720
I'm sorry.

513
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,039
It's me who let you down.

514
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,839
Mom is sick.

515
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,960
I made you worry.

516
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:39,960
Son,

517
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,000
don't worry.

518
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,960
I'm here.

519
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:35,880
Dad,

520
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,279
tell me, why

521
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,799
do both my mom and Amir have to leave?

522
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:53,599
Mom.

523
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,839
Dad Sadiq.

524
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,039
When I gave up studying abroad,

525
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,319
to be honest,

526
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,799
I didn't really know why.

527
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,000
I just felt I should do it.

528
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,079
But after I called my mentor,

529
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,599
I understood why I gave up.

530
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:08,960
Once before,

531
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,039
I went to the mountains to paint.

532
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,720
The scenery was beautiful.

533
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,799
But I always felt

534
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,319
my paintings lacked something.

535
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,079
Until I saw a girl

536
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,759
releasing a Crane of Courage.

537
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,519
And things like the restaurant's daily chores,

538
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,359
I never paid attention to them before.

539
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,359
I even thought

540
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,519
they would distract me from creating.

541
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,359
But after experiencing them, I realized

542
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,400
it's because of these little things

543
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:35,240
that I know what I should paint.

544
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,319
I told Professor Dario

545
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,799
why I decided to stay.

546
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,759
He told me something.

547
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,759
Only with love in your heart

548
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,200
can you create art.

549
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
He also said,

550
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,799
if I ever hit a creative block,

551
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,720
I should email him anytime

552
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:54,720
for advice.

553
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,240
You silly kid,

554
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,319
why didn't you say so earlier?

555
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,720
Now you can relax.

556
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,359
Ming Liang has grown up.

557
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,599
Our Nana has grown up too.

558
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,880
So,

559
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,319
no one goes home tonight.

560
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,519
Let's eat here.

561
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,480
I'll get things ready.

562
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:15,839
Okay.

563
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,039
I'll go with you.

564
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,319
Go ahead.

565
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,640
Hey, Li Zhe.

566
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,519
Nana.

567
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,039
Are you still at Memorial Park?

568
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,559
Yeah.

569
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,519
The Rescue Center got a call

570
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,359
about an injured bear cub.

571
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,319
Something came up at work.

572
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,279
I have to leave now.

573
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,039
Dad, Mama Aiyixia,

574
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,119
I have an urgent work matter.

575
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,039
I'll head out first.

576
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,039
You all keep chatting.

577
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:39,599
Alright.

578
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,559
Send me the location.

579
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,079
Isn't that Nana's car?

580
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,039
That's not the way to the Rescue Center.

581
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,559
I'll go check.

582
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:15,480
Gulinare

583
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,799
Mom.

584
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,559
Nana's car is empty.

585
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:54,720
Can't reach her by phone.

586
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,799
Please wait in the car.

587
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:56,839
I'll look around nearby.

588
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:57,559
Okay.

589
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,759
Be careful.

590
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,799
Gulinare

591
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,839
Gulinare

592
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,359
Why are you here?

593
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:28,599
What brings you here?

594
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,279
I saw your car parked over there.

595
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,359
The door was left open.

596
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,039
What's wrong?

597
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,079
I'm fine.

598
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,799
But it's in danger.

599
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:36,799
Who?

600
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,480
Xiao Zong Xiong

601
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,519
I was close by, so I came first.

602
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,200
The Rescue Center staff will arrive soon.

603
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,000
On my way to find Xiao Zong Xiong,

604
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,039
I found the mother bear's body.

605
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:49,839
It was almost eaten up by wolves.

606
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,359
Xiao Zong Xiong must have been starving.

607
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,480
That's why it came looking for its mom.

608
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,279
And it's very weak right now.

609
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,599
It keeps slipping down.

610
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,799
I'm afraid it won't last until help arrives.

611
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:59,480
Let me climb up.

612
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,000
I'll use my clothes to wrap it down.

613
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,319
No, that's too dangerous.

614
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,599
But isn't it dangerous for you too?

615
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:04,960
I...

616
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,480
Don't worry.

617
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,639
I often go outdoors to sketch.

618
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:09,760
I always look for

619
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
angles and compositions others can't find.

620
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,239
Climbing is part of the process.

621
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,079
I learned climbing from Ankar.

622
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,320
And this rock face has support points

623
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,039
that I can use for leverage.

624
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,039
Xiao Zong Xiong is small,

625
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,239
but it can still be aggressive.

626
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,559
You don't have rescue experience.

627
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,000
You don't know how to communicate with it.

628
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,840
I understand.

629
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,400
It's also searching for its mom.

630
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,039
I get how it feels.

631
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,800
Then test its reaction first.

632
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,519
Then wrap it with your clothes.

633
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:41,559
Okay.

634
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,360
Alright, keep climbing up.

635
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:52,599
Up.

636
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,360
Careful, careful.

637
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,719
There's a foothold there.

638
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
A bit above your left foot.

639
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,800
Yes.

640
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,039
You can take off your jacket now.

641
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,559
Little one,

642
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,039
don't be scared.

643
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,079
I'm here to help you.

644
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,000
Careful.

645
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,559
Stay focused.

646
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,000
Don't get distracted.

647
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,360
Good, slowly down.

648
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,480
Slide down slowly.

649
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,760
Hold on tight.

650
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,800
Careful.

651
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,719
Are you okay?

652
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,519
I'm fine.

653
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:33,719
Come.

654
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,599
Ankar.

655
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:22,760
Don't take this.

656
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,679
That's mine.

657
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,119
I'm heading out for a bit.

658
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,239
Alright, be safe.

659
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,320
Ming Liang.

660
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,079
Nana.

661
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,760
Morning.

662
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:11,960
Why are you here?

663
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,599
I went to the market this morning

664
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,599
and got some veggies and fruit for Xiao Zong Xiong.

665
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,159
See if Xiao Zong Xiong can eat these.

666
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,719
Thanks.

667
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,320
You've handled everything?

668
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,800
Yes.

669
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:25,679
What a coincidence.

670
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,920
They're all its favorites.

671
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,159
That's good.

672
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,719
Thanks, I'm off to work.

673
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,159
Okay.

674
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,400
Take it easy.

675
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,440
Nana.

676
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,239
Is it not doing well?

677
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,239
External wounds aren't the issue.

678
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,440
The main thing is, it's not eating.

679
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,480
It hasn't touched water or food.

680
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,320
Look.

681
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,639
Here's the test report.

682
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,760
It has inflammation in its body.

683
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,000
But in this case,

684
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,159
we can't give it anti-inflammatory shots.

685
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:15,760
Did you give it a nutrition shot?

686
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,320
Yes.

687
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,400
Two shots.

688
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,800
But it pulled them out.

689
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,719
It's not cooperating.

690
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,239
If this keeps up,

691
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,800
it probably won't last long.

692
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,199
A three-month-old cub.

693
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,400
Just weaned.

694
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,639
Lost its mom and moved to a strange place.

695
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,320
It's probably not adapting well.

696
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,480
Lacks a sense of security.

697
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,880
It seems

698
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,639
interested in this bag.

699
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,599
Is it missing some trace elements?

700
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,639
Probably not.

701
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,960
It's seeking comfort.

702
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,480
I'm here to help you.

703
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,280
It's treating Ming Liang as its foster dad.

704
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:51,320
Ming Liang.

705
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,719
He's the young owner of Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

706
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,800
Yes.

707
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,679
Injured wild animals

708
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,519
often become attached to their rescuers.

709
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,920
That's normal.

710
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,639
How about we file a report

711
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:05,639
and request Ming Liang to come over

712
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,159
to help Xiao Zong Xiong transition.

713
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,719
Xiao Zong Xiong is only three months old.

714
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,800
Once it bonds with humans,

715
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,199
it's hard to reverse that mentally.

716
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,199
It may develop identity issues.

717
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,960
Let's observe for now

718
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:19,000
and decide what to do next.

719
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,239
Okay.

720
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,920
Let's look for

721
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,320
cases of rescuing brown bears like this.

722
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,239
Ones we can learn from.

723
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,440
Alright.

724
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,400
Sure.

725
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,320
Let's go.
