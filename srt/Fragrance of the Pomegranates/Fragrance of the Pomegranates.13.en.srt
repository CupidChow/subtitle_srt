1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,720
Mingliang, hurry up!

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,360
Coming, Nana!

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,399
Look, there's a fox!

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,640
Mom.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,839
A fox ran into that ranch.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,359
It's not the fox that ran to the ranch.

7
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,160
We built the ranch

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,079
right on their home.

9
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,759
If you can't protect your loved ones,

10
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,400
you're not a true Balan

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,199
of the grasslands.

12
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,439
Someone asked me to tell you this.

13
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,599
Was it Mayila who said that?

14
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,120
No, it was Grandpa Bazarbeck.

15
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,000
Baheti.

16
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,520
You're not as wise as a seventy-year-old.

17
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,439
Open-minded.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,199
Nor as sincere as a woman

19
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,360
who loves with all her heart.

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,879
She's free.

21
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,479
And carefree.

22
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,719
At first,

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,439
I thought her love was like my ex-wife's,

24
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,479
just a passing breeze.

25
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,479
Gone once it blows by.

26
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,000
But later I realized

27
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
they're nothing alike.

28
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,319
Mayila is the sun.

29
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,360
She's not the wind.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,319
She always wants to warm me.

31
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,560
And me?

32
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,360
I'm just a herdsman.

33
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,360
Divorced.

34
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,560
Raising a daughter.

35
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,560
I want to get closer to the sun.

36
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,280
But I don't deserve it.

37
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,600
She's like the sun,

38
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,199
shining into your heart.

39
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,279
But she's not the sun.

40
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,959
She's just a woman.

41
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,319
She feels pain too.

42
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,439
She gets hurt and sad.

43
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,639
In her heart,

44
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,399
there are shadows sunlight can't reach.

45
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,279
Your Sibuzie

46
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,160
shouldn't always play sadness.

47
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,279
You should play love

48
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,600
into the heart of the one you love.

49
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,959
Thanks, brother.

50
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,279
Mayila.

51
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,839
I haven't seen Turan.

52
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
See her if you want.

53
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,079
If you want, just go.

54
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,040
It's none of my business.

55
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
What are you doing? Let go.

56
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
I won't let go.

57
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
Are you drunk?

58
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,720
Stop acting crazy.

59
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,720
Give it to me.

60
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
Take it, take it, take it.

61
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,959
I did drink a little.

62
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,800
But I'm not crazy.

63
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mayila, look at me.

64
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,600
I finally understand.

65
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,480
You're not the wind.

66
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Nor the sun.

67
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,839
You're just Mayila.

68
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,160
I...

69
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,120
I like you, Mayila.

70
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,480
You got drunk and came to confess, huh?

71
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,360
Don't you like Turan?

72
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,000
Didn't you say she's a good woman?

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,839
She's a good wife.

74
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,160
Go find your good wife.

75
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,319
I lied.

76
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,480
You're the only one in my heart.

77
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,240
Who knows what you're saying?

78
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,800
Say something when you're sober.

79
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,480
How would I know?

80
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,920
You won't let me see Bota.

81
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,879
You're Bota's dad.

82
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,680
You won't let me see her.

83
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
I can't see her.

84
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,600
That's how my job is.

85
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,480
Don't you know?

86
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,680
I said don't pick her up.

87
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,920
I didn't say you can't see her.

88
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,720
How can I see her?

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Should I go to your house?

90
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,600
If I don't pick her up,

91
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,279
how do I see her?

92
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,600
Bota's first time rolling over,

93
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,360
her first steps,

94
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,920
her first words—

95
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,800
I was there.

96
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,680
We both witnessed it.

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,480
You said I can't see her,

98
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,279
so I can't see her.

99
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,959
You have no idea

100
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,600
what this means to me and Bota.

101
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,600
How cruel.

102
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
It's not just Bota.

103
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,720
I can't leave you either.

104
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,920
Baheti, let me tell you—

105
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,439
I said

106
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,480
as long as you don't marry,

107
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,800
I'll keep waiting for you.

108
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,279
But I take it back.

109
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,480
Pretend I never said it.

110
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,240
Go.

111
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,959
I'm not leaving.

112
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,720
You're drunk.

113
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,720
Don't act crazy here.

114
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,600
Don't make me see you like this, okay?

115
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,480
Go.

116
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,080
Leave.

117
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,679
Don't make me hate you more.

118
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,360
Nana.

119
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,360
Nana.

120
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,480
Come with me, quick!

121
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,919
There's trouble over there again.

122
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,480
The beaver is stealing sunflowers again.

123
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,080
No.

124
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,799
It's our shrub willow.

125
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,320
The herders' sheep ate it.

126
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,600
Let's go, let's go.

127
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,799
Uncle.

128
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,399
I've told you many times.

129
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,039
Can you watch your sheep?

130
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,799
Don't let them eat the shrub willow.

131
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,240
Didn't I drive them away?

132
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,720
They just nibbled a few roots.

133
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,879
What's the big deal?

134
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,000
Here's the thing, uncle.

135
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,799
The beaver

136
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,519
is storing food for winter.

137
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,240
If all the shrub willow is eaten,

138
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,919
they won't survive the winter.

139
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,000
Besides,

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,519
we planted the shrub willow.

141
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,840
Let's be reasonable.

142
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,919
Be reasonable.

143
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,360
Look.

144
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,360
See.

145
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,840
Look.

146
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,759
The beaver is gnawing on sunflowers.

147
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,840
Faster than a Balan slurping noodles.

148
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,440
Even faster.

149
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,679
Our alfalfa at home

150
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,000
just started to sprout.

151
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,080
The lambs haven't even tasted it yet.

152
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
But the beaver already chewed it up.

153
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,159
Same thing happened at my brother's.

154
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,679
The beaver ate his crops too.

155
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,799
So, uncle,

156
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,440
I was out of line earlier.

157
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,639
Can we find a compromise?

158
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,279
Please don't make it too hard for us.

159
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,679
I'm really sorry about this.

160
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,519
For this situation,

161
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,399
we'll report it to the authorities.

162
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,840
We'll request some forage grass

163
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,240
or crop seeds

164
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,159
to compensate you.

165
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,919
And for other affected herders too.

166
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,799
Is that okay?

167
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:05,799
Really?

168
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:06,720
Yes, really.

169
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,919
We'll get started right now.

170
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,440
So,

171
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,799
tell me about the damage at home,

172
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,759
can you let me know?

173
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,919
All the herders who suffered losses,

174
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,919
we'll count them together.

175
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,679
I'll go with you.

176
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,080
Right.

177
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,200
Then let's go.

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,679
Thank you, uncle.

179
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,559
Sorry for the trouble.

180
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,519
Sorry about this.

181
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,639
This crisis is resolved for now.

182
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,159
But what about next time?

183
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
We can't ask for compensation every time.

184
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
The beaver eats the crops,

185
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,039
herders lose their property.

186
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,120
That's why they let cattle and sheep

187
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,679
graze on our shrub willow.

188
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,039
It's a vicious cycle with no solution.

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,480
Beavers eat crops

190
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,440
to build dams

191
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,320
and protect their homes.

192
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,919
When beavers build dams,

193
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,159
they can store water.

194
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,039
That creates natural reservoirs.

195
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,080
It also purifies and improves water quality.

196
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,879
Protecting beavers

197
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,360
means protecting the pasture.

198
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,039
Protecting the pasture

199
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,679
means protecting the herders' homes.

200
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,879
Perfect.

201
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,039
The logic is a perfect loop.

202
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,639
But how should we

203
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,799
explain this to the herders?

204
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,039
I lost the wrestling match with Bahti.

205
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,679
But the job got done.

206
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,399
Not a loss.

207
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,320
You had quite an eventful day.

208
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,440
Nana, have you been hanging out with Yueyue too much?

209
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,759
Why do I hear a hint

210
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,039
of regret for not seeing it in person?

211
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,360
You caught me.

212
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,559
I've never seen you wrestle.

213
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,679
If you were watching,

214
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,919
I'd need to practice more.

215
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,480
Business is done.

216
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,759
Should we head back now?

217
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,679
How are things on your end?

218
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,320
Beavers and cattle,

219
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,240
the food war—

220
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,159
how did it go?

221
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,519
I discussed with my colleagues

222
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,480
about giving a talk to the herders.

223
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
We'll explain why beavers matter to the pasture.

224
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,639
Just not sure if anyone will show up.

225
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,919
It'll be fine for sure.

226
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,200
Our Nana always gets a big response.

227
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,559
Alright, get back to work.

228
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,639
Bye.

229
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,960
Boss.

230
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,159
Coming, coming!

231
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,440
Let me know if you need anything.

232
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm here.

233
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,759
Check, please.

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,080
You ordered one mixed noodles,

235
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,000
two skewers,

236
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,120
and one big Wusu beer.

237
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,559
Long time no see.

238
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,639
How did you find this place?

239
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,639
What do you think?

240
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,159
Shall we talk outside?

241
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,200
You sure know how to hide.

242
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,320
Anton.

243
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,559
You even ran all the way to Xinjiang to avoid me.

244
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,919
I had to find somewhere to start over.

245
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,919
There are lots of opportunities here in Xinjiang.

246
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,240
I plan to earn money fast and pay you back.

247
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,559
I really wasn't hiding from you.

248
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,759
We've known each other for years.

249
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,679
Don't give me that.

250
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,519
It's because of our friendship

251
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,080
that I got screwed over by you.

252
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,039
When your restaurant had cash flow problems,

253
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,519
I didn't hesitate.

254
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,600
I lent you the money, didn't I?

255
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,360
And what did you do?

256
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,519
You just walked away.

257
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
You think by hiding here

258
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,639
I wouldn't be able to find you, right?

259
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,799
I admit I owe you.

260
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,440
I'll definitely pay you back.

261
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,639
I just want

262
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,279
a little more time from you.

263
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,159
I don't have time.

264
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,639
You only have yourself to worry about.

265
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,039
After you left,

266
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,600
Erni took Yaya and left.

267
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,960
We had a huge fight.

268
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,960
I haven't seen my daughter in ages.

269
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,840
Do you know that?

270
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,759
I really didn't know that.

271
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,519
I want to

272
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,799
bring a friend over.

273
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,159
I'll just say a few words and go in.

274
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,440
Since we're friends,

275
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
come in and have a seat.

276
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,639
Why stand at the door?

277
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,399
He has something urgent.

278
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,720
He won't come in.

279
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,440
It's fine.

280
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,159
I'll head back soon.

281
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,279
It's fine, you go ahead.

282
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,759
Alright, Anton.

283
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,679
This restaurant of yours now—

284
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,360
must be making good money, right?

285
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,279
It's not my restaurant.

286
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm just an employee.

287
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,799
An employee, huh?

288
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,279
Alright.

289
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,919
Then I'll go talk to the boss now.

290
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,679
Tell him what kind of person you are.

291
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,840
If you go in now,

292
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,039
I'm totally done for.

293
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,799
Darn it, I'm finished.

294
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,039
You won't get a single cent.

295
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,840
Fine.

296
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,360
You can ruin me by going in.

297
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,639
But if you do,

298
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,200
will your wife forgive you?

299
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,679
Will Yaya come back?

300
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,279
Just give me a little more time.

301
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,279
I can pay you back.

302
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,279
For Yaya's sake.

303
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:19,799
Anton.

304
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,960
I'll trust you one last time.

305
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,559
If I don't get the money,

306
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,879
I'm not leaving Urumqi.

307
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,080
You'd better hurry.

308
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,559
You made all these yourself?

309
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,440
Most of them, yes.

310
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,679
Some are bought, even better.

311
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,399
Like this one—

312
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,279
This is silver.

313
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,559
You really went all out.

314
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,799
This saddle—

315
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,839
I made it to custom measurements.

316
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,200
It's comfortable to sit on.

317
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,920
Now all I need is my own horse.

318
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,279
What do you mean?

319
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,039
I guess I misjudged you.

320
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,680
You gave her the whole set of tack.

321
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,000
Why not give her a horse too?

322
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,279
A horse I can give.

323
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,160
But not these.

324
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,440
If you want, I'll get them ready for you next time.

325
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,680
How long did you prepare all this?

326
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,400
All in all,

327
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,480
over a year, I think.

328
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,200
So why not give them to her yourself?

329
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,519
I hurt her feelings.

330
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,720
If I give them to her,

331
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,200
she definitely won't accept.

332
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,440
When did you plan to give them to her?

333
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,559
I never thought about it.

334
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,799
At first, I only made the saddle.

335
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,680
Then I made the pad.

336
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,799
Gradually, I made more and more.

337
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,160
So I just completed the whole set.

338
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,599
But there was never a good time.

339
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,720
You sure know how to wait.

340
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,319
I need a favor.

341
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,079
Can you give them to her for me?

342
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,480
Just say

343
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,680
you bought them.

344
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,200
You think my sister's stupid?

345
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,359
She'll figure it out right away.

346
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,440
That they're from you.

347
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:46,759
You'll think of something.

348
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,519
I can help you.

349
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,079
But you have to help me first.

350
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,160
These flyers later—

351
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,160
hand them out to the elderly who come.

352
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,519
Alright.

353
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,559
It's already this late.

354
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,559
I don't think anyone else will come.

355
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,759
It's fine.

356
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,400
Maybe everyone's busy today.

357
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,599
Anyone who comes is a win.

358
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,279
If it doesn't work out,

359
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,680
we'll go door to door.

360
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,839
Let's get started.

361
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,599
Three elderly gentlemen.

362
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,640
Why is it those two?

363
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,039
Are they here to cause trouble?

364
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,880
We're not here to cause trouble.

365
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,119
We're here to listen to the talk.

366
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,599
Quick, greet our guests.

367
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,079
Okay.

368
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:38,960
Hey, folks! Hey, folks!

369
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:40,920
Get off, get off, get off.

370
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,920
Come, sit here, sit here.

371
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,440
Some are friends I met wrestling.

372
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,200
But it's mostly thanks to Bakhte.

373
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,680
He gathered the herders near
the reserve.

374
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,240
He invited them all to hear your talk.

375
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,680
Nana, this is Bakhte.

376
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,440
Hello.

377
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,039
Bakhte.

378
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,000
This is Gulinar.

379
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,680
My girlfriend.

380
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,359
Hello, hello.

381
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,960
Hello.

382
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,319
Thank you for supporting our work.

383
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,559
These beavers are good animals.

384
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,680
They're helpful for the pasture.

385
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,920
Just explain it clearly to them.

386
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,960
There won't be any problem.

387
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,000
Alright, thank you.

388
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,119
Nana, let's get started.

389
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,279
Okay, I'll be right there.

390
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,640
Go for it!

391
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,119
Nana.

392
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,200
Thank you so much.

393
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
for coming here today

394
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,720
to our beaver protection seminar.

395
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,480
You might all ask me,

396
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,880
why do we need to protect beavers?

397
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,720
Here, we have three reasons.

398
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,160
First of all,

399
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
they play a key role in ecology.

400
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,119
Well,

401
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,680
Hong Shiliu Restaurant,

402
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,480
its business was just average before.

403
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,680
It barely broke even.

404
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,720
Then I took over.

405
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,240
Anyway, it's doing pretty well now.

406
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,920
It's now one of Urumqi's

407
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,759
top trending restaurants.

408
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,920
Not bad.

409
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
This pace

410
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,960
in the restaurant business

411
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,640
is really impressive.

412
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,839
You're too kind.

413
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,599
Small business

414
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,279
is hard to scale up.

415
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Of course, if

416
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,880
Mr. Fang, you're interested,

417
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,279
and decide to invest,

418
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,000
I can guarantee within the set time

419
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,720
to reach the goals in the plan.

420
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,519
How many branches do you plan to open?

421
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,240
For now, just one to start.

422
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,480
Step by step.

423
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,759
After all, this old place

424
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
has veteran staff

425
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,160
who are pretty traditional.

426
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,839
I want to make this one succeed

427
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,880
and show results.

428
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,440
Let them see the benefits.

429
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,799
That's the key.

430
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,599
Your proposal

431
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,079
looks great.

432
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,680
The approach is right.

433
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,039
When you chose this place,

434
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,319
it probably wasn't by chance.

435
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:28,960
It's an old restaurant.

436
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,440
The food is good.

437
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,079
It has warmth.

438
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,920
Honestly, it fits

439
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,160
my goal to make a comeback.

440
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,519
Anton,

441
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,160
you're not being honest.

442
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,039
The most important thing

443
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,759
is the people here.

444
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,440
They're all kind.

445
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,559
And very genuine.

446
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,279
But you, Anton,

447
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,440
are always scheming.

448
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:04,599
It's fine, Mr. Fang.

449
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,400
If you're interested,

450
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:08,920
go ahead and invest.

451
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,279
I'm looking forward to it.

452
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,319
If you have any issues
with me personally,

453
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,279
any concerns,

454
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,920
I understand.

455
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,240
We have plenty of time ahead.

456
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,480
I heard

457
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,720
your boss even let you stay
at their home.

458
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,640
Time is running out.

459
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,160
If you have any issues
with me personally,

460
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,119
any concerns,

461
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:09,839
I understand.

462
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,119
We have plenty of time ahead.

463
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,960
But Mr. Fang,

464
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,400
there's something I must say.

465
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,960
About Hong Shiliu Restaurant,

466
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,000
I truly

467
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,599
want to make it great.

468
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,079
And I'm confident

469
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
whether you invest or not,

470
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,000
within one year,

471
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,559
I'll make it

472
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,759
a model for all Xinjiang restaurants.

473
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:40,559
Alright.

474
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,240
Anton,

475
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,640
So,

476
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,200
drink more of this tea.

477
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,920
It cools you down.

478
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:49,920
And calms your mind.

479
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,000
Anton,

480
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,160
I'm a businessman.

481
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,920
I only care about profit.

482
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,920
This money

483
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,599
I can invest.

484
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,599
Really.

485
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,200
But I have a condition.

486
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,160
Go ahead.

487
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,920
I trust your ability.

488
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,640
I believe in you.

489
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,119
I also believe in Hong Shiliu.

490
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,759
It will surely grow and thrive.

491
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,920
But,

492
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,200
I still have some concerns.

493
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,279
What if,

494
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,240
just in case,

495
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,559
what if you, Anton,

496
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,359
leave this restaurant?

497
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,880
Or if it shuts down?

498
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,359
Who do I turn to then?

499
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,480
So your...

500
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,920
You mean...

501
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,440
One million is no small sum for me.

502
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:42,920
So,

503
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,440
this money

504
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,519
I can invest in you.

505
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,480
But

506
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,240
I have one request.

507
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,880
I need Hong Shiliu as collateral.

508
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,640
Sis.

509
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,079
Come in.

510
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,839
Where did you get this from?

511
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,880
Please help me return it.

512
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,519
Thank you.

513
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,279
He said this saddle

514
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,960
was custom-made to your size.

515
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,599
I was just thinking,

516
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,920
you've done so much for him.

517
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,519
You should let him thank you.

518
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,039
So,

519
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:21,880
okay.

520
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,160
You haven't known him long.

521
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,279
And he's already won you over.

522
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,599
He's really something.

523
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,400
No,

524
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,079
No, sis.

525
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,880
His feelings for you are real.

526
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,960
But so is the hurt he caused.

527
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,839
No one can choose for you.

528
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Whatever you decide,

529
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
I'll support you.

530
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,799
If you really don't want it,

531
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,720
I'll return it to him right now.

532
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:02,640
Mingliang,

533
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,759
I used to believe

534
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,680
Baheti would fall in love with me.

535
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,079
That's why I kept hoping

536
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,680
and waited for him for years.

537
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,680
But

538
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:14,440
after he clearly rejected me that day,

539
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,440
my heart turned cold and barren.

540
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,839
Nothing could grow there.

541
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,160
So even if I know he loves me now,

542
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,400
I can't bring myself to accept him.

543
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,519
Loving someone hurts too much.

544
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,880
I'm scared.

545
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,119
Nana once asked me,

546
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,240
Isn't love about two people?

547
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,839
Maybe you and Baheti

548
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,480
are held back by too much.

549
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:38,680
Sis,

550
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,119
I don't want to see you

551
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,000
afraid to love again.

552
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,440
Bro,

553
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,119
about opening the new branch,

554
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,160
can you tell me more?

555
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,160
I've pretty much explained it.

556
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,000
The only issue now is

557
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,920
he needs a guarantor.

558
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,880
I just want to confirm,

559
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,359
do you mean whoever makes it happen

560
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,279
will be the branch owner?

561
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,279
That's right.

562
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,400
Bro, I trust you.

563
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,839
I can be your guarantor.

564
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:24,799
Don't worry.

565
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,599
Once the branch opens,

566
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,920
I'll work really hard.

567
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,759
Keep your voice down.

568
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,240
How many times have I told you?

569
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:33,920
Success comes from secrecy.

570
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,359
Don't worry.

571
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,240
They're all resting.

572
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,039
Um,

573
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,079
when can we

574
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,440
meet with Mr. Fang

575
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,680
and sign the contract?

576
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:44,759
What is it?

577
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:45,880
Bro,

578
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,240
Don't you trust my abilities?

579
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,759
Let me tell you, our restaurant—

580
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,160
Stop.

581
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:49,880
Like this.

582
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,519
Ankar,

583
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,359
Here's the deal, Ankar.

584
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,640
Wait for my news.

585
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,119
I'll wait for your news then.

586
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,519
I'll go prep the food first.

587
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,079
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

588
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,720
the sky is full of little stars.

589
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,920
Whose feet are the biggest?

590
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,400
Mom's feet are the biggest.

591
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,079
Dad and Mom have big feet.

592
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,680
Everyone in the family.

593
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,839
Dad,

594
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,960
Did you invite Mayila's mom?

595
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Mingliang leaves tomorrow.

596
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,680
Tonight I've planned a bonfire party.

597
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,480
Of course.

598
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,240
Will she come?

599
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,400
You're here.

600
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,440
You look beautiful today.

601
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,160
Really.

602
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:10,839
Really.

603
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
I brought gifts for everyone.

604
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,160
Okay.

605
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,559
Let me introduce everyone to you.

606
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,000
Okay.

607
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,440
Let's go.

608
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:20,640
Grandpa,

609
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,680
Auntie,

610
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,119
Little brother,

611
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,839
This is my girlfriend, Nana.

612
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,119
Hello, everyone! Hello!

613
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,680
Hello, Grandpa.

614
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,160
Where's Mayila?

615
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,319
Mayila.

616
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,319
She hasn't come back yet.

617
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,440
My sister's at Kumila's today.

618
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:14,240
So you and Bota mean a lot to me.

619
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,440
Your knife can cut the toughest hide,

620
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,000
but not your own heart.

621
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,720
From now on,

622
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
let's act like strangers.

623
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,160
I said as long as you don't marry,

624
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,640
I'd keep waiting for you.

625
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,359
But I take that back now.

626
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:57,680
Mayila,

627
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,240
What are you doing?

628
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,719
It's getting dark.

629
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,000
It's not safe alone.

630
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,880
I'll take you to the bonfire.

631
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:14,599
I can go by myself.

632
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,920
Mayila,

633
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,000
Mayila, wait for me!

634
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,679
Your motorcycle is too loud.

635
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,599
It'll scare the horses.

636
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,440
You said you'd pick me up,

637
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,440
but you're so far away.

638
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,599
If a wolf took me, you'd never know.

639
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,920
Didn't you say

640
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,480
I was—

641
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:44,719
not the wind,

642
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,960
not the sun?

643
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,840
I thought you'd leave

644
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,360
like the wind.

645
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,440
But later I thought

646
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,400
you were the sun,

647
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,760
bringing me light.

648
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:53,639
But

649
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,840
you are just you.

650
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,880
Mayila,

651
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,639
do what you want.

652
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,440
I'll be behind you,

653
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
always watching over you.

654
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,000
Bakhti

655
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:13,880
Are you okay?

656
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,119
Bakhti

657
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,639
Let me see. Let me check.

658
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,360
What's wrong?

659
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,519
Is your leg alright?

660
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,519
Try moving it.

661
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,639
You do care about me.

662
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:23,880
Who cares about you?

663
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,920
Let me see.

664
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,159
Your hand is all scraped up.

665
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,440
Mayila

666
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,599
I can't live without you.

667
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,159
Mayila

668
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,760
I used to think

669
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,400
letting go was the best ending.

670
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,400
But later I realized

671
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,320
losing you

672
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,639
hurts more than losing my life.

673
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,480
This time,

674
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,639
I won't let go.

675
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,840
Good for you.

676
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:48,719
Come on!

677
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,639
I'm so happy! So happy!

678
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,440
Kid,

679
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,360
If fate allows, we'll meet again.

680
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,760
Grandpa said

681
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,159
if there's a chance, we'll meet again.

682
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,920
That's right.

683
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,199
Grandpa,

684
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,880
please take care of yourself.

685
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,599
Don't worry.

686
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:23,960
When you go back,

687
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,639
take good care of Aisha Mom.

688
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,599
And look after yourself.

689
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,280
Mingliang,

690
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:32,400
I'll bring Mayila and Grandpa

691
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,519
to Urumqi to see you.

692
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,320
Sounds good.

693
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:36,440
Everyone should come.

694
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,719
Mom loves a lively crowd.

695
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,440
Call us if you need anything.

696
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
Take care of my sister.

697
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,000
Or else I...

698
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:49,599
I'm leaving now.

699
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,320
I'm off.

700
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,960
Grandpa, let's go.

701
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,239
Goodbye.

702
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,119
Anton,

703
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,119
We've talked so many times now.

704
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,880
Have you made up your mind?

705
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,760
It's alright.

706
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,199
That's business.

707
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,280
Cooperation is voluntary.

708
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,320
No need to force it.

709
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:35,920
Actually,

710
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,599
I'm planning to leave Urumqi too.

711
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,800
After this last cup of snow chrysanthemum tea,

712
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,920
I'll be on my way.

713
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,039
See you at the usual spot.

714
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,960
Brother Dong,

715
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,519
My brother said

716
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,840
he'll be back before lunch.

717
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,559
He sent big-tailed mutton ahead of time.

718
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,559
Let me tell you,

719
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,360
that's the nobility of mutton!

720
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,119
What are you doing?

721
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,199
There's good news!

722
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,119
Come with me.

723
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Good news!

724
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,800
Good news.

725
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,679
Good news.

726
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,440
Mr. Fang,

727
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:40,519
Have some tea.

728
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,039
Thank you.

729
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,079
Anton,

730
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,920
To be honest,

731
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,360
what I have my eye on in Urumqi

732
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,920
isn't just Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

733
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,679
It's not even my top pick.

734
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,719
If it's so hard for you,

735
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,719
then forget it.

736
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,800
I won't push you.

737
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,960
Actually,

738
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,039
I have several friends

739
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,320
who know I'm investing in you.

740
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,039
They keep telling me to be careful.

741
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,039
Why's that?

742
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,360
After all, before...

743
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,400
It was my fault before.

744
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,079
I was picky about the contract.

745
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,119
Hope you don't mind.

746
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,039
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

747
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,199
But

748
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,639
there's one more thing in the contract to discuss.

749
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:24,400
Right.

750
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,119
This sixth clause,

751
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,440
here it says

752
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,599
once the contract is signed,

753
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,599
payment must be made immediately.

754
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:30,360
What do you think?

755
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,360
Don't worry about that.

756
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,280
Integrity is the foundation of business.

757
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,199
Mr. An,

758
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:46,039
Sign it.

759
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,000
Go ahead and sign.

760
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,760
I've already signed the guarantee contract.

761
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,079
Our new branch is about to open.

762
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,079
Didn't Mr. Fang say

763
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,920
this one million is just the beginning?

764
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:00,960
Let's work hard when the time comes.

765
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:01,719
Let's get to work!

766
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,000
More investment is coming in.

767
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,280
Right, Mr. Fang?

768
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,920
Of course.

769
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,880
This young man is really motivated.

770
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,119
Alright.

771
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,800
I really didn't expect this.

772
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,519
This Mr. Fang—

773
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,920
agreed to invest in us so quickly.

774
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,480
One million!

775
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,000
I can't imagine how many naan I'd have to bake

776
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,039
or how many desserts I'd need to make

777
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,079
to earn that much money.

778
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,320
Anyway, now we have this one million.

779
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,239
Our branch

780
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,519
can open very soon.

781
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,000
Once the money arrives,

782
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,920
we need to get moving right away.

783
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,320
We must make every cent of this investment

784
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,400
count where it matters most.

785
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,440
It all has to show results.

786
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,679
We have to live up to our investor's trust.

787
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,079
I know, bro.

788
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,119
Whatever you say,

789
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:15,960
I'll do as you ask.

790
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:18,440
Anton,

791
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:19,840
stop hiding.

792
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,360
Let's meet up.

793
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,719
Why aren't you leaving?

794
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,559
What are you thinking about?

795
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,119
I was just thinking,

796
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,639
getting the funds is only the first step.

797
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,280
There’s a lot to do after opening the branch.

798
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
We need to get started right away.

799
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,599
I know.

800
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,320
Find a location,

801
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,079
renovate it...

802
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:44,760
Oh, right—

803
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:47,320
we also need a food business license,

804
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,440
and a business permit.

805
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:49,480
Yes.

806
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,199
I can handle all of that.

807
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:53,800
What I mean is,

808
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,280
about opening the branch,

809
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,440
we must take it step by step.

810
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:00,599
Success comes from keeping things quiet.

811
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,440
So before the branch officially opens,

812
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:07,159
we must keep it secret from everyone else.

813
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,599
Including Mingliang.

814
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:09,519
Okay.

815
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,920
Anyway, right now

816
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,440
they don't believe in me opening a branch.

817
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:14,400
I'll work really hard when the time comes

818
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,440
to get this branch up and running.

819
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:17,119
Then I'll give them a big surprise.

820
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,360
Right, bro?

821
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,719
From now on,

822
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,039
I'll stick with you and work hard, bro.

823
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:22,119
I'm off.

824
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:27,800
Let's go.

825
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:34,639
Alright.
