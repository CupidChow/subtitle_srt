00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,879
Ming Liang

2
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,199
Why aren't you coming home?

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,000
Murat's Dad

4
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,679
I don't know how to write this essay.

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,920
Ming Liang

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,840
Let me take you home, son.

7
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:00,879
Ankar

8
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,680
Ready to serve!

9
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Mama Bayar

10
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,120
Blackcurrant Naan

11
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,639
Eighteenth batch is out!

12
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,759
Coming, coming!

13
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,439
Here you go.

14
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,400
It looks really nice!

15
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,159
Come on, come on!

16
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,159
Auntie

17
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,759
What is this Blackcurrant Naan?

18
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,479
I've only heard of blackcurrant jam.

19
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,120
Never heard of it in naan before.

20
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, this—

21
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,840
It's our young chef at the restaurant

22
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,759
who came up with this new dish.

23
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,800
Young people really love it.

24
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,719
We put blackcurrant jam

25
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,919
inside the naan.

26
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,560
We use our restaurant's select blackcurrants

27
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,319
with a special recipe.

28
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,400
If you leave Hong Shiliu,

29
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,560
you won't taste this anywhere else.

30
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,879
Want to try one?

31
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,199
Let's have one then.

32
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:41,719
Alright.

33
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,719
One Blackcurrant Naan.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,639
Auntie

35
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,080
Can we get one of those too?

36
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,800
Blackcurrant Naan, right?

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
No problem.

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,080
And a Yogurt-Fruit Jam Zongzi.

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,560
One.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,719
Just a moment.

41
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,400
Coming right up.

42
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,120
Ming Liang

43
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Looks like Ankar's new dishes

44
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,840
are really popular with young people.

45
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,919
Those young folks,

46
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,919
when they see your beautiful menu design,

47
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,479
they all order.

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,439
After ordering,

49
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,159
they take photos, photos, photos.

50
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,599
They say they come to Hong Shiliu for pretty food.

51
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,279
It's all thanks to Ankar's great ideas.

52
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm exhausted.

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,240
It's only halfway through the day,

54
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,920
and I've sold eighteen Blackcurrant Naans.

55
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,279
Why complain about being tired?

56
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,920
You come up with ideas,

57
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,879
I do the work.

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,519
I'm the one baking the naan.

59
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,639
But add some roast meat and cheese,

60
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,680
Dad,

61
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,759
why do I smell yogurt in here?

62
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,560
A man should be like an eagle—

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,879
your heart should be wider than the sky.

64
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,079
Even broader than the sky itself.

65
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,079
You think my cooking is simple,

66
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,759
but there's a lot of skill in it.

67
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,199
Just bragging about your own stuff.

68
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,199
You're really talking big.

69
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,079
Dad, you should know

70
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,079
these trendy dishes

71
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,040
blend techniques from many places.

72
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,720
So we need to innovate too.

73
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,959
We have to put our heart into it.

74
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,399
Look,

75
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,519
my Blackcurrant Naan,

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,160
cheese and roast meat,

77
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,560
I've mixed in flavors from all over.

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
That's why people like it.

79
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Trendy dishes

80
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,639
are just a passing fad.

81
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,079
Alright, Dad.

82
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,560
You wouldn't get it anyway.

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,240
But you should know,

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,600
it's the age of smart technology.

85
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,519
We need to livestream.

86
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,480
What do we need?

87
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,360
Innovation.

88
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,519
We have to innovate.

89
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,759
Mixing things up is what sells.

90
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,959
What are you two chatting about?

91
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,439
Hurry up!

92
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,399
Crayfish Baked Bun!

93
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,360
Stir-fried Pork Noodles!

94
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,920
Quick!

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,560
Coming!

96
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,680
Always saying things I can't follow.

97
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,399
What?

98
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,639
Your cooking's no good.

99
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,199
Nothing works.

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Murat's Dad

101
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,319
Look at the customer comments lately.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,319
They're all praising your food.

103
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:52,920
Really?

104
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,879
They say Big Plate Chicken is too greasy.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,319
Big Plate Chicken isn't greasy.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,199
That's boiled chicken.

107
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,480
And the Pepper Chicken isn't spicy.

108
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Is that even Pepper Chicken?

109
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,759
If you can't handle the noodles,

110
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,480
just have pilaf, darn it.

111
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,959
Always glued to your phone every day.

112
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,079
What are you laughing at?

113
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Dad, let me show you something.

114
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,000
Customers posted online reviews saying

115
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,240
my dishes really surprised them.

116
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
They even said it's the most

117
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,000
innovative fusion cuisine they've seen.

118
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,480
It's the most beautiful food in Xinjiang.

119
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,439
Take a look.

120
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,279
See what they said about my cooking.

121
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:33,839
Is there really

122
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,480
food that good?

123
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,839
I use only real, quality ingredients.

124
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,959
Young people nowadays,

125
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,279
why don't they like it anymore?

126
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,879
Didn't I tell you before?

127
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,639
People just want

128
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,519
fresh, new things they've never tried.

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,720
Tastes have changed.

130
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,399
That's just for novelty.

131
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,279
But even novelty brings repeat customers.

132
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,079
Besides,

133
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,040
what do people care about now?

134
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,720
It's healthy, light food.

135
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,079
Your oily, salty dishes

136
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,360
are out of fashion now.

137
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,439
Let me show you.

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,079
It's not just me saying this.

139
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,040
Experts say so.

140
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,839
They recommend healthy, light eating.

141
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,600
They even gave daily intake

142
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,040
nutrition standards.

143
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:09,879
Standards?

144
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,040
What standards?

145
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,000
You want to set standards for me?

146
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,720
My wok is the only standard I need.

147
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,680
Murat's Dad,

148
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,639
look.

149
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,160
Ming Liang,

150
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,600
tell me,

151
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,199
is my way outdated?

152
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,519
Murat's Dad,

153
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,560
you have your loyal customers.

154
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,079
He has his new fans.

155
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,040
If we combine both,

156
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,560
our customer base will double.

157
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,079
I don't know about fans.

158
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,439
I only care about the noodles in my pot.

159
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,519
Murat's Dad,

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,279
Enough.

161
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,279
Stop trying to comfort me.

162
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,480
Dad,

163
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,600
let him be alone for a while.

164
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,600
If you go now, you'll just make it worse.

165
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,519
He needs time to accept new things.

166
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,600
It's a process.

167
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,839
Put your mask on.

168
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,480
It's fine.

169
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,720
I'll check on Murat's Dad in the backyard.

170
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,040
Mom, it's about time for your medicine.

171
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,960
Aisha,

172
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,360
that customer is back again.

173
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,519
Dressed so well,

174
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,960
never orders a single dish.

175
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,559
Goes straight to our free pilaf spot.

176
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,039
Eats happily every time.

177
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,399
I think he comes here

178
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,679
just to get free food and drinks.

179
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,159
I'll go ask him.

180
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,720
If the customer doesn't say,

181
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,679
we don't ask.

182
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,279
That's our restaurant's tradition.

183
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,360
As long as he sits there,

184
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,279
we serve free pilaf.

185
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,600
Here.

186
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Take this over to him.

187
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,360
Gold can't compare to your kind heart.

188
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,799
Every family has its own troubles.

189
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,919
Running a restaurant isn't just for money.

190
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,159
Sorry about that.

191
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:39,639
We...

192
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,519
You're here.

193
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,639
Just got off work?

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,399
Have you eaten?

195
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,320
I'll make you something to eat.

196
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,200
No, no, it's fine.

197
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,360
I need to borrow your jacket.

198
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,840
My jacket?

199
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,159
It's not for me.

200
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,840
It's for Smiley, the little brown bear.

201
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,399
Honestly, you asking to borrow clothes

202
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,399
actually makes me happy.

203
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,679
What's there to be happy about?

204
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
It means I'm still useful to you.

205
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,960
You've been helping me a lot lately.

206
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,200
Finally,

207
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,480
I get a chance to help you for once.

208
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,720
You've helped me plenty too.

209
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,279
With lots of things.

210
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,519
Even if you talk about it,

211
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,960
others might not be able to help.

212
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,159
You still have to solve it yourself.

213
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,840
But saying it out loud

214
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,320
makes you feel a bit better inside.

215
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,399
You must've noticed too,

216
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,360
Smiley isn't doing well.

217
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,720
We don't know if he'll make it.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,960
Everything has a spirit.

219
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,799
Smiley suddenly lost his mother.

220
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,399
The pain in his heart

221
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,720
may be harder to heal than his body.

222
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Sometimes,

223
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I wish animals could have therapists too.

224
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,799
Someone to help them through it.

225
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,159
Besides clothes,

226
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,039
is there anything else I can do?

227
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,639
Let me check first.

228
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,159
See if your jacket helps.

229
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,159
If you need anything,

230
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,919
I'll always be here to help.

231
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,440
Okay.

232
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,159
I'm heading out.

233
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,919
Good night.

234
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,559
Bayar.

235
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,879
Uncle Nawu.

236
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,919
What's wrong?

237
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,639
I've eaten Murat's Big Plate Chicken for ten years.

238
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,000
Now he's moved away.

239
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,799
I come every month for it.

240
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,919
You can't just do well in business and

241
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,639
let Ankar mess with me.

242
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,279
Uncle Nawu,

243
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,919
this is made by Murat's Dad.

244
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,399
Come on, try it.

245
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,279
Here.

246
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,519
This Big Plate Chicken tastes like sweet and sour fish.

247
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,519
What's wrong? What's wrong?

248
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,399
What's wrong?

249
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:29,519
It's fine, it's fine.

250
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,039
It's nothing serious.

251
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,080
Look.

252
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,799
Haven't seen you in ages.

253
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,440
Come on, come on.

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I heard that now

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,919
you've found a young, pretty wife.

256
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:41,679
It's fine.

257
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,159
Uncle Nawu is really picky.

258
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,960
Just make him a new one.

259
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

260
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,399
Murat's Dad

261
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,399
Naan from the pit

262
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,559
can't all be baked perfectly.

263
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,919
It's normal to make mistakes sometimes.

264
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,639
Murat

265
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,799
You have to make my Big Plate Chicken yourself.

266
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,320
Don't let Ankar mess with me.

267
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,960
Alright, don't worry.

268
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,120
No problem.

269
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,879
Come on, come on.

270
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,279
Nawu

271
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,039
It's been a long time since we met.

272
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,639
Come.

273
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,799
I'll have a drink with you.

274
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,279
Nana, you always have a way.

275
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,879
Need Ming Liang's clothes.

276
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,919
Now Smiley can stand and move around.

277
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,080
It can eat a little, too.

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,879
But

279
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,519
looking at this test report,

280
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,519
the indicators are still far off.

281
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,519
The results aren't as good as expected.

282
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,399
Otherwise,

283
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,399
let's ask Director Gao for advice.

284
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,360
Have Ming Liang come help for a few days.

285
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,080
Smiley is still too young.

286
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,159
If Ming Liang comes,

287
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,399
what if it gets attached to him?

288
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,759
Once it bonds with humans,

289
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,279
it'll be hard to release it later.

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,120
You all head back first.

291
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,759
I'll stay tonight to observe.

292
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,320
Hello?

293
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,639
Hello, Nana?

294
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,360
Is Smiley doing better today?

295
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,799
Not really.

296
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,360
Still under observation.

297
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,399
Are you still at the rescue center?

298
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,480
Okay.

299
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,399
It's my first time here at night.

300
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,240
It really looks different.

301
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:28,559
Yes.

302
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,120
I also love walking here at night.

303
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,039
There aren't many people in the park at night.

304
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,399
Look up and it's all stars.

305
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,000
Come.

306
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,600
Eat.

307
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,879
I swear I gain weight every time I see you.

308
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,759
But I really have no appetite today.

309
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,120
I'll eat it tomorrow.

310
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,000
Have some plum juice.

311
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,759
Okay.

312
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,039
Add ice if you want.

313
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,039
It's delicious.

314
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:00,639
Which place is it from?

315
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,799
Hong Shiliu

316
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,039
Homemade.

317
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,399
If you like it,

318
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,679
tell me in advance next time.

319
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,360
I'll make it for you.

320
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,919
Smiley is just like you.

321
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,240
When it's upset,

322
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,559
it can't eat.

323
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,159
Smiley shows signs of depression.

324
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,360
That serious?

325
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,559
Actually, many people don't know

326
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,279
animals have emotions too.

327
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,240
Like OCD,

328
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,159
anxiety,

329
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:42,919
phobias,

330
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,039
PTSD,

331
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,919
all can happen to them.

332
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,679
Worse, they can develop stereotypes

333
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,639
and somatization and other behaviors.

334
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,919
I read a news story before

335
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,119
about a tiger in a zoo

336
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
that lost its cub.

337
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,960
It became depressed.

338
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
Then the zookeepers

339
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,039
dressed a piglet in tiger skin.

340
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,640
In the end, the tiger treated the piglet

341
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,119
as its own cub.

342
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,920
If Smiley gets used to my scent,

343
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,440
should I wear a bear suit too?

344
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,960
I'll be its foster dad.

345
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:28,920
Would that work?

346
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,640
I'm really happy tonight.

347
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,519
Farman told me

348
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,039
the family's attitude

349
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,759
affects the patient's mood.

350
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,160
He said if I'm positive and optimistic,

351
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,279
my mom will feel better too.

352
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,119
Then there's still hope.

353
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,920
Same goes for you.

354
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,640
Let's go.

355
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,920
I'll take you somewhere.

356
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,279
Yueyue probably told you already.

357
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,680
She wants you to be Smiley's foster dad.

358
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,519
But I didn't agree.

359
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,519
Before my mom passed away,

360
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,640
she told my dad

361
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,680
not to buy shoes with laces.

362
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,799
Nana couldn't tie her laces yet.

363
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,480
They all say

364
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,480
time makes you forget everything.

365
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,759
But I don't think that's true.

366
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,039
Time just stores some memories away.

367
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,960
Then, when you least expect it,

368
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
they suddenly resurface.

369
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,680
Like when I see a young mom

370
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,880
tying her daughter's shoelaces.

371
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,319
When I heard Mama Aysha was ill,

372
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,920
my heart still aches.

373
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:11,720
Don't laugh at me,

374
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,240
but lately, several times

375
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,160
I've woken up suddenly from sleep.

376
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,960
I sneak to my mom's window

377
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,359
and see her

378
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,759
before I can relax.

379
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,880
That's why I don't want you

380
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,599
to be Smiley's foster dad.

381
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,880
Even if you become Smiley's foster dad,

382
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
I might not be able to save it.

383
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,480
Even if I do save it,

384
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,839
we still have to try to release it.

385
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,839
So, at some point,

386
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,799
you'll lose it anyway.

387
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,880
Of course I know the ending

388
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,799
will be

389
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,880
separation.

390
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,160
But the process is beautiful,

391
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,119
irreplaceable.

392
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,519
I want to give it a try.

393
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,000
Nana

394
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,759
Seeing it like this now,

395
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,920
I really want to try.

396
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,559
Even if there's only a tiny chance,

397
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,039
I want to try.

398
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:18,839
Is that okay?

399
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,200
You're stronger than I thought.

400
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:40,599
Thank you.

401
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,240
Take care.

402
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,000
Okay, thanks.

403
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,839
Take care.

404
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,119
Come on, come on.

405
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,000
Give it to me, Ming Liang.

406
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,599
Go ahead, go on.

407
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,519
No rush, I'll finish it.

408
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,519
Don't worry.

409
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,759
You still don't trust me with it?

410
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,720
Alright.

411
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,640
Aisha.

412
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,799
Do you know Ming Liang

413
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,519
why he's in such a hurry?

414
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,240
What's up?

415
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,559
He's going to the rescue center.

416
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,079
Yueyue told me.

417
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,799
She said Ming Liang was asked to help

418
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,799
take care of a little brown bear.

419
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,519
I actually think

420
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,319
those two kids now

421
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,440
are getting closer and closer.

422
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,400
Don't you think

423
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,519
he's going to see Yueyue?

424
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,039
What's with that look?

425
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,480
He's going to the rescue center.

426
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,839
If not Yueyue, who else?

427
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:33,799
You look like

428
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,799
you don't want us to be in-laws.

429
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,039
That's not it.

430
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,799
Ming Liang.

431
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,720
Remember to buy Yueyue

432
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,039
her favorite milk tea.

433
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,720
I know.

434
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,200
She even gave me a snack list.

435
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,119
Asked me to buy everything on it.

436
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:49,599
Alright, alright.

437
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,319
Go on, hurry up.

438
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,680
Mom, I'm heading out.

439
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,519
Aisha.

440
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,920
If we're free this afternoon,

441
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,440
let's go to the Grand Bazaar.

442
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,480
If those two kids' feelings

443
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,880
keep developing well,

444
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,480
they'll be engaged soon.

445
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,839
We should dress up nicely too.

446
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,279
Aisha.

447
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:23,799
Look.

448
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,599
That person is here again.

449
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,279
Don't keep staring.

450
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,000
It's rude.

451
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,559
No,

452
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,160
I just find it strange.

453
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,960
Look at his clothes and accessories—

454
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,440
he doesn't look like someone short on food.

455
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,240
This person

456
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,839
is different from the others before.

457
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,480
I just feel

458
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,720
it's not that simple.

459
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,440
So what do you think he does?

460
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,039
He ate, he finally ate.

461
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,519
Finally ate.

462
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,599
Finally ate.

463
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,880
I'm not a bad foster dad, right?

464
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,480
Not bad.

465
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,079
The little one finally has energy.

466
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,359
Sorry to trouble you these days.

467
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,559
You've had to come and go a lot.

468
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,000
You say that

469
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,079
but it's all for the bear cub.

470
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,200
It's worth it.

471
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Bear cub? Really?

472
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,559
Can't you call it something nicer?

473
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,279
You haven't named it yet.

474
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,720
Haven't had time.

475
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,440
Why don't you name it?

476
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,279
Me? Name it?

477
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,319
You're basically its foster dad.

478
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:43,559
Alright.

479
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,799
Let me think.

480
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,200
It suffered so much before.

481
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
I just hope it can be happy from now on.

482
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,279
Let's call it Smiley.

483
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,599
What do you think?

484
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,839
Smiley.

485
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,599
That's nice.

486
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,240
May it grow up healthy and happy.

487
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,480
Alright, Smiley?

488
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,119
Eat your meal like a good kid.

489
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,839
Grow up well.

490
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,759
I'll come visit you often from now on.

491
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,200
Why are you clicking your tongue?

492
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,480
What's with that look?

493
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,640
I... I... I...

494
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,279
I don't know either.

495
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,680
What kind of look should I have?

496
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,240
You look like a cat with its tail pinched.

497
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,000
What are you trying to say?

498
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,480
Yueyue.

499
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,720
He's your boyfriend.

500
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,279
But now he's with Nana, the two of them...

501
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,039
Uh...

502
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,519
How many times have I told you?

503
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,599
Stop bringing this up.

504
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,920
It's not just the restaurant—don't mention it.

505
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,960
You can't talk about it here either.

506
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,279
Maybe he doesn't even know...

507
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,640
...he's your boyfriend, right?

508
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,559
Hu Yue.

509
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,000
You're just crushing on him.

510
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,599
He's my brother.

511
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,480
My situation is way too complicated.

512
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,440
Even if I explain, you won't get it.

513
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,200
Uh... uh...

514
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,279
That's a lot to take in.

515
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,000
So... who is your boyfriend, then?

516
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,960
You're so annoying.

517
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,559
Yueyue.

518
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,079
Got yourself a boyfriend now.

519
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,480
Who is it?

520
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,359
Li Zhe said he'd set me up with someone.

521
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,599
It's time to eat.

522
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,079
Murat's Dad needs you more.

523
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,759
Goodbye.

524
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,599
Go see him off.

525
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,599
Go, go, go.

526
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,559
Let's go together.

527
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,359
Take it slow.

528
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:26,960
Goodbye.

529
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,559
Did something happen to Murat's Dad?

530
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,359
Nothing serious.

531
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,359
You know, those who used to eat at the restaurant...

532
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,079
Basically,

533
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,720
they all came for Murat's Dad's cooking.

534
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,240
Now there are lots of new customers.

535
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,680
Most of them are young people.

536
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,480
They're not used to his flavors.

537
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,680
So he's a bit discouraged.

538
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,119
A couple years ago, my dad's knee gave out.

539
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,119
After he got a new one,

540
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,440
for a while,

541
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,119
he used to be so cheerful.

542
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,240
But he got so down, he lost weight.

543
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,319
So how did you deal with it?

544
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,440
What could I do?

545
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,599
As the younger generation,

546
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,240
all we can do is be there for them.

547
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,559
Just like when we were kids,

548
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,079
they were always there for us.

549
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,440
Don't worry.

550
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,920
There's a saying we use at work.

551
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,960
Every stage of life

552
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,039
is a time to be an apprentice.

553
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,319
I'm off.

554
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,640
Potatoes, twenty kilos.

555
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,039
Tomatoes, let's get thirty kilos.

556
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,319
Okay.

557
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:29,680
Oh, right.

558
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,200
We need cheese too.

559
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,599
We're almost out of blackcurrant.

560
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,039
Didn't we just buy blackcurrant two days ago?

561
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,000
Did you forget?

562
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,359
My Blackcurrant Naan

563
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,759
is our restaurant's signature now.

564
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,039
Every table ordered it today.

565
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,839
Several people even took it to go.

566
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,559
Look at you, so impressive.

567
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,039
Blackcurrant.

568
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,480
Murat's Dad.

569
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:52,799
That's enough, enough, enough.

570
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,000
Almost forgot.

571
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,480
Flour.

572
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,599
The most important—flour.

573
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
We used to go through a month's flour supply.

574
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,119
Now we've used it all in just a few days.

575
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,160
Can't bake naan without flour.

576
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,119
Son.

577
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,799
The best scale

578
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,799
is the customer's taste buds.

579
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,440
You've done really well.

580
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,359
Has the water from Tianshan started flowing upward?

581
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,319
Bro, did you hear that?

582
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,519
Dad's praising me.

583
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,039
Rolled liangpi.

584
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,319
Big bro.

585
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,000
Come try my rolled liangpi.

586
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,759
Young people love it these days.

587
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,720
You'll want more after just one bite.

588
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,279
Big bro, give it a try.

589
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,680
You eat it yourself.

590
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,400
Liangpi, liangpi.

591
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Rolled liangpi, rolled liangpi.

592
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:55,960
There's a special event.

593
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,920
Liangpi, liangpi.

594
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,039
Murat's Dad.

595
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,200
You forgot your water cup.

596
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,720
Getting old.

597
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,039
Can't remember things anymore.

598
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,279
Come, have a seat.

599
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,680
Anyone who jokes about being old

600
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
is just showing off how young they still are.

601
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,039
The melting snow of the Tianshan Mountains

602
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:38,319
still can't

603
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,039
catch up with the spring

604
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:40,759
streams.

605
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,480
I've figured it out these past few days.

606
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,279
Different ages,

607
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,759
different ideas,

608
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,559
even different tastes.

609
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,279
Ming Liang,

610
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,720
has Aisha ever told you

611
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,559
how I came to the restaurant?

612
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,000
No.

613
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,720
Back then,

614
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,559
I was only twenty.

615
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,720
I came from Aksu to Urumqi to work.

616
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:07,720
My wallet

617
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,960
and ID were both lost.

618
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,079
I had no money,

619
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,880
and was too embarrassed to go home.

620
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,599
Tried to find work, but no ID.

621
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,720
No one

622
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,720
dared to hire me.

623
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,839
At that time,

624
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,599
I was so hungry

625
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,200
I even

626
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:28,839
searched through

627
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,519
the trash bins.

628
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,759
Later,

629
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,839
I saw Aisha's sign.

630
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,720
I went straight in.

631
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,839
She gave me a big

632
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,599
plate of pilaf,

633
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,440
with lots and lots of meat.

634
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,759
And then you stayed at the restaurant?

635
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,119
I didn't dare eat it.

636
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,200
Why?

637
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,039
If I ate it,

638
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,200
I was afraid

639
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,880
she'd ask me for money.

640
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,839
Aisha, with her tiny frame,

641
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,680
stood blocking the door.

642
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,440
She sternly told me,

643
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,799
"Don't waste food."

644
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:12,200
She watched me finish eating,

645
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,119
but still wouldn't let me leave.

646
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,519
She said I'd eaten so much of her meat,

647
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,240
and had to work for her to pay it back.

648
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,440
She thought of everything,

649
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,039
inside and out.

650
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:28,839
Ming Liang,

651
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,440
Hong Shiliu

652
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,319
is starting to recover.

653
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,160
Don't lose money

654
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,519
again because of me.

655
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,880
It's time for me to retire.

656
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,359
Murat's Dad,

657
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,160
I know you care about me.

658
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,759
But what will happen to the restaurant if you leave?

659
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,279
My mom will be sad.

660
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:24,519
When I was little,

661
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,279
you always carried me on your shoulders.

662
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,279
Back then, I always called you Dad.

663
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,519
Ankar would always get upset with you,

664
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,000
saying I was stealing his dad.

665
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,000
But every time I called you,

666
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,319
you'd answer me right away.

667
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,279
Silly child,

668
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,400
I watched you grow up.

669
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
You're my son.

670
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,000
From childhood to now,

671
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,880
Mom,

672
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:58,680
you,

673
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,039
Mama Bayar,

674
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,400
gave me all your best love.

675
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,200
When I was young,

676
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
I always worried

677
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,559
you'd leave me one day.

678
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,160
Nonsense.

679
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,880
Who could ever abandon their own child?

680
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,960
I've been thinking about it too lately.

681
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,000
I want to run the restaurant well,

682
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,559
but I want even more to protect this family.

683
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,440
Be with Mom,

684
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,400
you,

685
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,359
and Mama Bayar.

686
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,279
So we can always be together.

687
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,559
Child,

688
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,359
child, we

689
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,279
let's go home.

690
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,440
I have a small goal.

691
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,360
I plan to save 1,314 bills.

692
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,360
One hundred thirty-one per year for four years.

693
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,719
How many years will that take?

694
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,280
Thirty-seven years.

695
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,280
That's truly a lifetime.

696
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:24,599
Yueyue,

697
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,280
Stop.

698
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:26,639
Don't say sorry.

699
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,199
Did you miss me?

700
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,840
I did.

701
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,039
How much?

702
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,840
Yueyue,

703
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,840
Why did you lock the door?

704
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,079
Mom, I fell asleep.

705
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,719
Sleeping.

706
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,079
You're sleeping?

707
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,280
Why is the light still on?

708
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
Who are you mumbling to?

709
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,039
Who else?

710
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,320
Ming Liang.

711
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
It's Ming Liang?

712
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,519
Alright, alright.

713
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,280
Don't stay up talking too late.

714
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,239
It's fine if we talk late.

715
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,360
It's fine.

716
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:14,880
Smiley

717
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,440
Looks like it wants to join the soccer team.

718
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,440
The enrichment toy from a few days ago,

719
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,880
it really loved it.

720
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,719
Played from morning till night.

721
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,840
Seems fully recovered now.

722
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,199
It's a real little rascal now.

723
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:30,800
That's wonderful.

724
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,000
This is Smiley's medical report.

725
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,480
Yeah.

726
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,199
How is it?

727
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,000
Look.

728
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,239
These numbers

729
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,960
have all returned to normal.

730
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,159
Starting today,

731
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,599
it can officially move into

732
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,000
the rehabilitation stage.

733
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,840
You've worked hard these days.

734
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,960
You can retire as its foster dad now.

735
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,199
Can I still come visit it later?

736
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,440
Yes.

737
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,880
But watch how often you come.

738
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,920
Even though a bear cub this small

739
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,719
has a low chance of surviving in the wild,

740
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,519
we still want to try our best.

741
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,239
We try to keep its wild instincts.

742
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,559
So it can return to real nature.

743
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:10,840
Will it make it?

744
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,559
Will it get hurt?

745
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:13,840
Is it dangerous?

746
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,440
You really look

747
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,159
like an old father now.

748
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
Now I understand

749
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,760
how Murat's Dad feels.

750
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,000
Happy the child grows up,

751
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,159
but worried about not being needed.

752
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,880
You have to believe

753
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,960
Murat's Dad and my dad

754
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,599
each have their own way

755
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,119
to handle life's changes.

756
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:44,760
I'll get its food ready.

757
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,000
Slice an apple.

758
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,719
Make the pieces smaller.

759
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,280
Okay.

760
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,480
There's a capsule over there, grab it.

761
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:10,559
This one?

762
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,440
Yes, just one.

763
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,440
Break it open.

764
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,039
Nana.

765
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,440
I still have a video to edit.

766
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,599
You guys go ahead.

767
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,280
Murat's Dad.

768
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,480
Didn't we agree the other day?

769
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,599
What are you doing?

770
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,119
Ming Liang, don't worry.

771
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm not leaving.

772
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,800
If you find a good head chef,

773
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,800
I'll take a demotion and pay cut.

774
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
I'll be the sous chef.

775
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,760
That's not necessary.

776
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,880
You can't put new wine in old bottles.

777
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,079
The closer we are,

778
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,760
the more we put the team first.

779
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:11,840
Don't worry.

780
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,760
I'll still keep an eye out for you.

781
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,760
Aisha and I agreed on this.

782
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,320
You've eaten pilaf here for days.

783
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,679
So you wanted to replace my dad?

784
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,599
Alright.

785
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,639
Let's see what you can do.

786
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,800
I can't cook.

787
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:50,880
You—

788
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,360
Then why did you challenge us?

789
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,960
I can't cook,

790
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,679
but

791
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,480
I can eat.

792
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,199
You can eat.

793
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,239
I can kick people out.

794
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,920
I'll be direct then.

795
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,519
Me,

796
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
I'm a food critic.

797
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,559
I can't cook,

798
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,199
but I can teach you to make great food.

799
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,679
And I can make our restaurant

800
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,199
in no time

801
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:25,400
the best in all of Urumqi.

802
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,800
Buddy,

803
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,880
I have anti-fraud apps on my phone.

804
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,360
I don't need that.

805
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,920
How about this—

806
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,480
Give me the time to make one dish.

807
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:40,880
I can make your dish

808
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,800
taste better than yours.

809
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,159
More delicious.

810
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,480
I've been cooking for thirty years.

811
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,320
He wants to compete with me?

812
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,440
That's like a lamb competing with a camel to sneeze.

813
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,480
Isn't that overestimating himself?

814
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,320
If you really have the skill,

815
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:07,559
try it.

816
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,400
Go ahead.

817
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,599
I, Old Mu, don't buy it.

818
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,559
Let's go.

819
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:23,719
Mom.

820
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,960
What's going on?

821
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,840
That guy wants to challenge Murat's Dad.

822
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,280
You really picked a tough one.

823
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:36,440
My dad's best dish is morel mushroom stir-fry.

824
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,079
Let's start.

825
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,360
Okay, take it out.

826
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,760
Isn't that too soon?

827
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,559
Hurry, scoop it out.

828
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,199
Scoop it out now.

829
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,280
It's only been ten minutes.

830
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,199
The morels aren't rehydrated yet.

831
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:11,039
You can add the mushrooms now.

832
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,000
Come on, toss the pan.

833
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,559
Let it heat evenly.

834
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:22,559
Wait.

835
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:31,559
Take it out.

836
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,119
Isn't it undercooked?

837
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:33,800
Take it out.

838
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,159
Can't be late. Got it.

839
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:37,000
It's ready.

840
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,599
This is Murat's dish.

841
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,000
I've eaten it for years.

842
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:05,840
Delicious.

843
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,679
Aisha.

844
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,519
Your tongue is a gourmet's tongue.

845
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:15,679
Wait.

846
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,280
Come.

847
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,440
Rinse your mouth with water.

848
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:28,360
So unrelated flavors

849
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,920
don't affect your taste buds.

850
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,840
Show your skills.

851
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,440
Come.

852
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,079
Mom.
