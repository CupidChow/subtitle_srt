1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:05,960
Hold on tight.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,519
Mom, this is so much fun!

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:13,359
Let's do it again.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,839
Okay.

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,599
Let's do it again.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,160
Here we go!

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:19,920
Mom.

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,719
The sun fell into the desert.

9
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,640
It's beautiful.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,359
Yeah.

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:25,640
Liangliang.

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,039
What are you drawing?

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,239
It's Nana.

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,440
Next time, I'll bring her to play.

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,200
Sure.

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,400
We haven't spent much time together.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,000
But back in Urumqi,

18
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,680
you seemed humble,

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,439
but always felt a bit above it all.

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
But now,

21
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,080
you're much more down-to-earth.

22
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,599
Alright.

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll take that as a compliment.

24
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,159
Um...

25
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,879
About the pattern design...

26
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,759
How's your thinking on it?

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,280
It's only been a few days.

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,240
You've already drawn them.

29
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,520
That's not right.

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,000
Grandma Parida.

31
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,840
What's wrong with it?

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,639
I can make adjustments.

33
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,520
My mom means

34
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,520
this isn't Atlas silk.

35
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,719
It's not Atlas silk.

36
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,680
That's a pretty vague critique.

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't even know where to start redesigning.

38
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,719
It's my fault.

39
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,879
I didn't think it through enough.

40
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,479
When I saw your designs,

41
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,000
I actually had some doubts.

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,840
I heard Sister Hatiman say before

43
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,199
when she first came back,

44
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,759
she hired designers from Jiangsu.

45
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,240
Their patterns were beautiful.

46
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,560
But...

47
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,199
Grandma Parida just wouldn't accept them.

48
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,599
So how did Sister Hatiman solve it?

49
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,400
She didn't want to upset Grandma Parida.

50
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,800
She had to go along with her.

51
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,719
She let the designers go.

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,240
Kept using the old patterns.

53
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,479
Only innovated within what Grandma Parida allowed.

54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,439
Made some small changes.

55
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,919
I've been observing lately too.

56
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,240
All these traditional crafts are handmade.

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,639
Only three to four meters a day.

58
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,160
Sister Hatiman knows Atlas silk

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,360
and understands the market.

60
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,079
Even she couldn't persuade them.

61
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,000
So where do you want me to break through?

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,240
Where should I try to innovate?

63
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,519
How

64
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,639
to combine traditional craft with the market

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,160
has always been a tough problem.

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,639
Grandma Parida

67
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
has made traditional Atlas silk all her life.

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
The market doesn't accept it.

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,279
It's a blow to her too.

70
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:45,920
I thought

71
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,600
with your artistic skills

72
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,279
and your old friendship with Grandma Parida,

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
things might be different.

74
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,439
It's not your fault.

75
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,639
I kind of expected this outcome.

76
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,439
I was a bit impatient.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,639
After all,

78
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
I'm worried about the restaurant.

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,279
I didn't mean to pry into your privacy.

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,160
Just while interacting with you,

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,800
I could sense your anxiety.

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,279
So I asked Sister Hatiman

83
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,240
about your situation.

84
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,160
To be honest,

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,600
my restaurant got copied.

86
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,000
We could face

87
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,600
closure and bankruptcy any time.

88
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,879
Is there anything I can do to help?

89
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,480
You've got enough on your plate.

90
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,279
I'm not telling you this for any reason.

91
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,600
I just wanted to say

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I might not be staying here much longer.

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,199
I understand.

94
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,160
You've already helped me a lot.

95
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,480
At least now I have

96
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,959
a beautiful and innovative draft.

97
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:53,879
It's fine.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
If you need to go, just go.

99
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,079
Let me take this call.

100
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,800
Go ahead.

101
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,519
The evidence is collected.

102
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,439
I've sent it to your email.

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,279
Check your inbox.

104
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:04,920
Okay.

105
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,000
Also,

106
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,240
there's something else.

107
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,120
I want to discuss it with you.

108
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
Can you stay a bit longer?

109
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,040
Stay in Hetian for a while.

110
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:14,839
What do you mean?

111
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,240
I know Fang Tao thinks three moves ahead.

112
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,600
That copycat restaurant opened so fast.

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,879
He's very calculating.

114
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,399
He even knows you're in Hetian.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,639
Shows he's watching your every move.

116
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,279
Let's use his arrogance against him.

117
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,120
We'll play the Empty City Strategy.

118
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,279
I did turn on location in my Moments.

119
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
So you mean

120
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,040
I should keep staying in Hetian?

121
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,720
That's right.

122
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,480
Create a false impression for him.

123
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,480
Make him think

124
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,079
you don't care at all

125
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,319
about his copycat restaurant.

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,920
Liang, I caused this trouble.

127
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,360
I'll make sure to fix it.

128
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,279
Given the situation,

129
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,680
stay in Hetian and work with us.

130
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,360
I'll think about it.

131
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,480
If we use the method you just mentioned,

132
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,040
how confident are you

133
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,480
that Mr. Qian will agree to it?

134
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,279
Five.

135
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,600
Seventy percent.

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,600
Let me do it.

137
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,720
I'll design a pattern that will satisfy

138
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,480
both Grandma Parida and Mr. Qian.

139
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,839
Thank you.

140
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,519
If the restaurant needs any help,

141
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,160
just let me know.

142
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,319
No need to be so polite.

143
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,079
I'm not just helping you.

144
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,399
Alright.

145
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,279
Go ahead and get busy.

146
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,079
I'll go look for inspiration.

147
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,319
Mingliang.

148
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,399
So,

149
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,839
are we friends now?

150
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,279
Secretary Xu.

151
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,639
So you never considered me a friend?

152
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,079
That's not what I meant.

153
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,519
You're Nana's friend,

154
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,279
so you're my friend too.

155
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,319
Enough talk, friend.

156
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,160
Let's work hard together.

157
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,839
My overall style

158
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,480
mostly follows

159
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,959
the Atlas silk tradition.

160
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,519
I just tweaked the colors a bit.

161
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,199
But Grandma Parida said

162
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,399
they aren't real Atlas silk.

163
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,120
What is real Atlas silk like?

164
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,639
Our girls are called Atlas silk.

165
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,840
Fluttering Blossom.

166
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,519
Fluttering Blossom.

167
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,480
It's a metaphor.

168
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
It describes the look of a cuckoo in flight.

169
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,639
It's very beautiful.

170
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,759
So lively.

171
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,960
It feels like wearing spring itself.

172
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,720
Usually, when Grandma

173
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
is making Atlas silk,

174
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,639
how does she make Atlas silk

175
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,519
capture the look of a flying cuckoo?

176
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,639
She imagines

177
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,399
the shape of the wind,

178
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
the look of sunlight,

179
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,480
the form of clouds.

180
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,200
It's as if you can hear them breathing.

181
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,080
Where there's breath, there's life.

182
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,039
Did I only capture their form

183
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,399
but not their spirit?

184
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,519
They're not as neat as your designs,

185
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,519
not as pretty,

186
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,519
but that's what Atlas silk truly is.

187
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,960
What we see

188
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,639
isn't their real appearance.

189
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,279
Their true form

190
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,519
lives in people's hearts,

191
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,960
in memories,

192
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,639
in pain,

193
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,519
in joy.

194
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,480
Maybe that's the soul.

195
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,919
I finished editing your video.

196
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,759
I used all your discarded footage.

197
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,519
Thanks for your hard work.

198
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,399
Sorry you had to stay up late too.

199
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,159
When the restaurant faces trouble,

200
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,279
I get anxious too.

201
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,840
I've wanted to help for a while.

202
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,720
Go ahead and post it.

203
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:53,759
Alright.

204
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,080
Get some rest.

205
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,399
Oh, right.

206
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,200
Everything's correct.

207
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,960
Have the workers weave according to this.

208
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:14,960
You should go too

209
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,039
and share your ideas with them.

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,600
Okay.

211
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,919
Mom.

212
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,399
I'm heading out.

213
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,159
You raised a good son.

214
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,639
He's much more successful than me.

215
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,200
Back then,

216
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,080
if I'd kept learning from you,

217
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,399
I wouldn't be like this now,

218
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,960
unable to help you at all.

219
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,039
You silly girl,

220
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,759
why can't you let this go?

221
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,799
Do you really think

222
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,240
back then,

223
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,000
I didn't know you were leaving?

224
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,399
Do you know why I didn't stop you?

225
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,399
You left,

226
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,279
but Atlas silk threads still held you.

227
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,559
And they brought you back, didn't they?

228
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,919
This new pattern design

229
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,279
is really unique.

230
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,000
It's gorgeous.

231
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,279
Exactly.

232
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:15,759
What's wrong, Mr. Qian?

233
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,759
Is there a problem?

234
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
Mr. Qian, if you see any issues,

235
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,559
we can adjust it anytime.

236
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,399
No need to change it, no need.

237
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,919
This is already perfect.

238
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,120
This style,

239
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,639
I've never promoted it

240
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,559
in the market before.

241
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,759
To be honest,

242
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,919
the market is very unfamiliar with it.

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,279
If I take it all and it doesn't sell,

244
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,440
if the response is bad,

245
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,279
I'll be stuck with it.

246
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,279
That, that...

247
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,039
That's a lot of pressure.

248
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,399
I understand.

249
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,360
So you mean...

250
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,399
Secretary Xu,

251
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,799
how about this:

252
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,639
I'll buy three hundred thousand worth of silk first,

253
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,039
and test the market.

254
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,159
If the feedback is good,

255
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,679
I'll double my orders right away.

256
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,399
How does that sound?

257
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,639
You're right.

258
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,159
It's our first partnership,

259
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,279
so caution is wise.

260
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:09,039
It's responsible for both sides.

261
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,279
Alright, let's go with Mr. Qian's plan.

262
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,039
We'll start with three hundred thousand units.

263
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,159
This will be our first batch.

264
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,519
Secretary Xu, you're so straightforward.

265
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,279
Come on,

266
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,519
let's sign the contract right now.

267
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,159
Okay.

268
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,440
Our cooperative's legal representative

269
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,279
is Grandma Parida.

270
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:22,919
She's getting on in years,

271
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,919
so you may need to visit her in person.

272
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,399
No problem.

273
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,519
Xiao Ai,

274
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,440
your design is amazing.

275
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,399
Take Mr. Qian to sign the contract.

276
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:29,919
Alright.

277
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,799
Your job isn't easy at all.

278
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,639
Three hundred thousand.

279
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,759
Probably not enough for you
to expand your business.

280
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:45,919
I expected that.

281
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,519
At least it's a good start.

282
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,639
You get the main credit.

283
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,679
I just added a little extra.

284
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,360
The new textile machine has arrived.

285
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,559
Once Aman’s mom and the others return,

286
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,240
it’ll be put to good use.

287
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,320
I’ll head out now.

288
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,840
Perfect timing.

289
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,080
Let me take a few minutes of your time.

290
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,039
I want to discuss something with you.

291
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,440
Sure.

292
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,320
What’s up?

293
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,919
The quarter’s ending soon.

294
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,480
Have we paid the suppliers?

295
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,960
But the money we have on hand

296
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,039
definitely isn’t enough.

297
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,960
Our restaurant doesn’t have much money now.

298
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Originally, I thought

299
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,240
we could work harder

300
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,559
and boost our sales.

301
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,720
But Fang Tao opened a competing restaurant.

302
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,320
It’s cut down our customer flow.

303
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,320
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,840
So...

305
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,679
I wanted to talk to you about it.

306
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
There is one possible solution.

307
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,840
In situations like this,

308
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,200
we can issue IOUs.

309
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,960
That way, we can delay payment
for a quarter.

310
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,559
Our restaurant has never used IOUs.

311
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,360
Delaying payments.

312
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,600
Yes, I know.

313
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Delaying isn’t the goal.

314
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,080
We can use this time

315
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,320
this quarter

316
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,480
to do a lot of things.

317
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
That’s the main point.

318
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,200
You mean we use this period

319
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,200
to win back our customers.

320
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Let everyone know

321
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,080
his restaurant is a knockoff.

322
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,039
Exactly.

323
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,120
Once our funds come back in,

324
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,320
we’ll immediately

325
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,960
settle everyone’s payments.

326
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,960
Will that work?

327
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,120
Yes.

328
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,320
Let’s do it this way.

329
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,600
Those who agree to sign IOU contracts,

330
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,840
we’ll make it clear with them.

331
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,320
Those who don’t agree,

332
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,200
we’ll settle with them now.

333
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,600
I think it’s tough for everyone
doing business now.

334
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,200
Our Hong Shiliu Restaurant

335
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,679
has been around for thirty years.

336
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,440
We must keep our reputation.

337
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,360
That’s good.

338
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,840
That’s good.

339
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
The way you talk now

340
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,960
is more and more like Ming Liang.

341
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,080
Then tomorrow, you call the suppliers.

342
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,080
You make the call.

343
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,960
Okay, okay.

344
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,080
Actually, you should call.

345
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,960
If they know I’m still at the restaurant,

346
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,600
I guess

347
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,360
we won’t be able to negotiate anything.

348
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
What are you talking about?

349
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,240
You’re at Hong Shiliu

350
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,320
as the manager for a day.

351
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,840
That makes you the rightful
representative of Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

352
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,320
You’re the official representative.

353
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,200
You’re afraid of everything.

354
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,600
That’s not your style.

355
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:53,960
I’m leaving.

356
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,799
I’ve thought about what you said.

357
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,599
But I have an idea.

358
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,119
We can’t put all our hopes

359
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,960
just on these buyers.

360
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,599
It’s the age of e-commerce now.

361
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,599
Why can’t we

362
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,920
reach consumers directly?

363
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,440
You want to sell yourself?

364
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,079
Selling directly isn’t realistic yet.

365
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,839
In this village,

366
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
we don’t have proper garment technology.

367
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,440
We can’t rush things.

368
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,599
But we can attract more buyers.

369
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,599
At the same time,

370
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,599
we’ll pave the way for the future.

371
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:32,960
Look,

372
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
since I came to the village,

373
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,960
I started my own video channel.

374
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,200
I’m planning

375
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,799
to find some models

376
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,960
to wear our Atlas silk

377
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,559
and shoot some promotional videos.

378
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,720
Get some buzz going first.

379
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,839
Let more people see our Atlas silk.

380
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,480
That’s a good idea.

381
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,359
But for the videos to be seen,

382
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,079
we need good ideas.

383
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,839
We really do need good ideas.

384
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,839
Teacher Ming Liang,

385
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,119
You want my help again, don’t you?

386
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,720
If possible,

387
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,599
that would be perfect.

388
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,960
Like the promo we did before,

389
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,359
your ideas were excellent.

390
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,960
You really make the most of everyone.

391
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,839
I do have an idea.

392
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,599
Quick, let’s hear it.

393
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,359
The most attractive thing about Atlas silk

394
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,960
is its vibrant colors.

395
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,200
How about

396
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,960
you shoot a Transformation Video.

397
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,720
I knew you were the right person.

398
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,200
If that’s the case,

399
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,079
I have the perfect candidate.

400
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:46,720
Who is it?

401
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,720
Grandma Aman

402
00:18:59,319 --> 00:18:59,839
Here you are.

403
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:00,599
I'm busy right now.

404
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,839
Go ahead, don't let me interrupt.

405
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:06,839
Elder Secretary

406
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,079
Sorry to keep you waiting.

407
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,319
I really apologize for that.

408
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,079
You're so busy, yet I still bother you.

409
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,160
This village truly depends on you.

410
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,079
So, for anything important,

411
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,400
we still need you to take the lead.

412
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,839
Please help us, give us some advice.

413
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,079
You're quite the talker, young man.

414
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,000
What's your name again?

415
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,000
My surname is Xu.

416
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,799
Just call me Xiao Xu.

417
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,839
Secretary Xu, right?

418
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,519
That's right.

419
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,119
If you need anything, just say it.

420
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,039
If I can help,

421
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,400
I absolutely will.

422
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,240
We really need you, Elder Secretary.

423
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,400
Let me give you a quick update.

424
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,599
Our village's Adilais Silk factory

425
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,319
plans to expand this year.

426
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,799
Just a few days ago,

427
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,640
we already sold 300,000 worth of goods.

428
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,119
That's wonderful news!

429
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:51,920
It really is.

430
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,079
So we want to seize the momentum

431
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,279
and promote it even more.

432
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,839
Try to get more orders.

433
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:57,839
As for us,

434
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,319
we've learned from many other factories.

435
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,359
We're ready to use

436
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,640
the resources we've saved up before.

437
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,079
We'd like you to help us film a promo video.

438
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,839
A promo video?

439
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,680
It's the popular short video style.

440
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,079
We want to use short videos

441
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,480
to showcase our Adilais Silk

442
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,680
and all these years

443
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,119
of tree planting and reforestation,

444
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,880
and our desert "bordering" efforts.

445
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:22,839
Let others see

446
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,400
how our little village by the desert

447
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,599
has completely transformed.

448
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,839
That does sound great.

449
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,920
But how will you make it happen?

450
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,839
Have you thought it through?

451
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,079
What do you mean?

452
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,599
Xiao Xu,

453
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,920
you young folks,

454
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,000
it's good to be ambitious.

455
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,039
But,

456
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,920
don't always aim for big things.

457
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,279
Or just flashy things.

458
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,400
The small tasks matter too.

459
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,079
For example, cutting patterns

460
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,319
isn't really my job.

461
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,039
It's for the younger generation.

462
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,400
Elder Secretary is right.

463
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,119
Yes, absolutely.

464
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,160
I was careless.

465
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,759
No need to blame yourself.

466
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,519
Right now,

467
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,680
no need for criticism or self-criticism.

468
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,079
You're so nervous you're sweating.

469
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:06,839
Wipe it off.

470
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,799
Go ahead, wipe it off.

471
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,279
Wipe it.

472
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,759
You all are, what do you call it,

473
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,079
village officials, right?

474
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,079
Yes, village officials.

475
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,640
You probably won't be here long.

476
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,559
Because this work

477
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,279
can't be finished in a day or two.

478
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,039
I'll stay out of it.

479
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,599
Elder Secretary has issues with me.

480
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,480
Grandma.

481
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:36,839
Grandma.

482
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,119
Secretary Xu.

483
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,119
The new fertilizer we ordered online arrived.

484
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,160
Here, hand it to me.

485
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Secretary Xu.

486
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,000
Didn't Grandma spill water on the fertilizer?

487
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,599
Did it get damp?

488
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,519
Why are you using it again?

489
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,240
Aman.

490
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,559
I made a mistake.

491
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,119
It's okay.

492
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,240
We'll use the new fertilizer soon

493
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,319
and apply it again, it'll be fine.

494
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,559
Well, well...

495
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,839
Secretary Xu,

496
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,480
why didn't you mention this earlier?

497
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,680
Well...

498
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,480
Elder Secretary.

499
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,920
I wasn't careful enough.

500
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,400
I meant to fertilize two days ago.

501
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,839
But the delivery was late.

502
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,480
I didn't explain it well to Grandma Aman.

503
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,920
Otherwise, you wouldn't have made a mistake.

504
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,839
You just mentioned

505
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,480
filming a video.

506
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:29,599
Yes.

507
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:30,839
Which day?

508
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,119
The day after tomorrow.

509
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,319
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

510
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,119
You, you...

511
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,799
It's only because you asked me.

512
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,359
If it were someone else,

513
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,480
Alright then.

514
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,319
Let me thank you on everyone's behalf.

515
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,160
Of course, it's not just for me.

516
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,759
It's for everyone in the village.

517
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,119
Elder Secretary, you may not know yet,

518
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,599
but Aman's parents

519
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,920
are getting tickets to come back.

520
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,160
Young people these days

521
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,279
are really quick-witted.

522
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,839
Full of ideas, really.

523
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,039
That's great.

524
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:09,799
Elder Secretary.

525
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,680
As an old comrade,

526
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:12,799
today,

527
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,400
I'll fully cooperate.

528
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,599
Why don't you take the clothes first

529
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,920
and change in the tent?

530
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,079
Change into what?

531
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,839
Change into these clothes.

532
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,880
No, no.

533
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:24,880
No need to change.

534
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:25,839
No need for that.

535
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,799
My outfit is just fine.

536
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,839
I wear this to county and city meetings.

537
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,079
Always this outfit.

538
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,319
It is nice, yes.

539
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,839
But aren't we filming

540
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,680
an Adilais Silk transformation video?

541
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,559
You need to wear Adilais Silk clothes.

542
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,680
W-what do you mean?

543
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,119
You have to wear Adilais Silk clothes.

544
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:47,599
You...

545
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,599
You want me to wear this?

546
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:50,599
That's right.

547
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,319
Aren't you just messing around?

548
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:57,880
No, it's not.

549
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,279
Young people have no limits these days.

550
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,319
I thought you asked me here today

551
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,359
to talk in front of the camera,

552
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,200
say a few things, introduce stuff.

553
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,960
Introduce this, introduce that.

554
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,559
But you want me to wear this to present?

555
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,559
Aren't you making me lose face?

556
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,480
Where am I supposed to put my pride?

557
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,119
Don't tell me this is custom-made for me.

558
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,359
I'm not doing this.

559
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,880
Elder Secretary, please don't leave!

560
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,680
Why are you just standing here?

561
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:24,640
Where's Elder Secretary?

562
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,759
Elder Secretary left.

563
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,079
He left.

564
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,599
It was so hard to get him here.

565
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,359
Why did he leave?

566
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,319
I asked him to change for the shoot.

567
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,599
He suddenly got upset for no reason.

568
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,640
He said we're disrespecting him.

569
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,319
Isn't this a good thing?

570
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:38,839
How...

571
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,160
How is this disrespectful?

572
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,920
Did Elder Secretary misunderstand?

573
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,359
Ming Liang.

574
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,079
Go to Yuhe Xiaozhu Guesthouse.

575
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
A friend has arrived.

576
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,079
A friend?

577
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,480
Who is it?

578
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,839
You'll know when you get there.

579
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,519
Nana.

580
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,480
Why is it you?

581
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:04,160
Wait—

582
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,079
Why did you come here?

583
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,039
Nana.

584
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:11,160
You haven't even arrived yet,

585
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,079
but you're already famous in the village.

586
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,680
Ayi Xia Mama.

587
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,319
Are you joking with me?

588
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,119
How is this a joke?

589
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,079
Ming Liang drew a picture

590
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,000
of you wearing an Atlas silk

591
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,480
scarf in the portrait.

592
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,119
The big boss from the clothing factory

593
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,480
liked it at first sight.

594
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,160
He was about to leave,

595
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,759
but stayed to discuss cooperation.

596
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,519
He never mentioned this to me.

597
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,519
Boys care about their pride.

598
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,400
Isn't he helping Xiao Xu

599
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,480
pick a model for the video?

600
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,839
He kept choosing but wasn't satisfied.

601
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:41,920
If you ask me,

602
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,839
you're the only one in his heart.

603
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,680
He didn't mention this to me either.

604
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,599
I heard from Yueyue

605
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,319
the shelter hasn't been busy lately.

606
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,599
Director Gao told you all

607
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,839
to take your annual leave now.

608
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,559
Hetian is at its most beautiful now.

609
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,599
You came to Hetian,

610
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,559
Ming Liang will show you around.

611
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,799
Ms. Ayi Xia,

612
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:05,079
you even found out about this?

613
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,359
You're not giving me a chance to refuse.

614
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,359
Alright, I get it.

615
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,599
We'll be waiting for you.

616
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,119
Goodbye.

617
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,319
Goodbye.

618
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,319
I didn't know you were coming.

619
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,559
If I'd known, I would've picked you up.

620
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,799
Could've found you a better guesthouse.

621
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,880
This one's pretty good.

622
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,319
It's all in the village.

623
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,119
Easy to find

624
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,599
and convenient for Ayi Xia Mama.

625
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,880
You settle in first.

626
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:43,839
I'll go buy something.

627
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,599
I'll be right back.

628
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,640
I'm downstairs.

629
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:12,880
Xu Lai.

630
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,160
Friend!

631
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,319
Long time no see!

632
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,079
Why didn't you let us know you were coming?

633
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,799
I just heard from Sister Hatiman that you arrived.

634
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,640
I got some daily necessities ready for you.

635
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,839
You didn't have to go to all that trouble.

636
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,079
I brought everything I need.

637
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,839
You're here to help us shoot the promo video.

638
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,599
As Secretary, I have to show my appreciation.

639
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,920
Alright, Secretary Xu.

640
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,559
And this too.

641
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,599
I put this together during my break.

642
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,599
Thought it could be a guide for friends visiting.

643
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:36,839
Secretary Xu.

644
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,319
Ming Liang.

645
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,839
You organized it so well.

646
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,079
I'll return it after I read it.

647
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:42,799
Alright.

648
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,599
You two chat.

649
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,319
I'll head out first.

650
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:44,880
I'm leaving.

651
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,079
Bought too much.

652
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,559
Lots of mosquitoes in autumn.

653
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,839
Let's keep one for later.

654
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,359
If we use up both bottles,

655
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,279
I'll probably be bitten so much

656
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,400
I'll look like the surface of the moon.

657
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,599
Nana.

658
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,599
Come take a walk with me.

659
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,480
In a bit.

660
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,519
The sunset here is especially beautiful.

661
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,000
Nana.

662
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,920
I was wrong about what happened last time.

663
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,119
Secretary Xu.

664
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,000
Is this the spot you mentioned

665
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,599
for the best sunset shot?

666
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,599
I'm really sorry.

667
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,599
I didn't know you two were here.

668
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,839
It's fine.

669
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,680
We'll go somewhere else.

670
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,839
You guys go ahead and shoot.

671
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,079
We'll move to another spot.

672
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,599
Secretary Xu.

673
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,559
Didn't you say you wanted to call Sister Gulinair?

674
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,640
But you were worried she'd be too tired.

675
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,319
Just right.

676
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,599
No, you're just too talkative.

677
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,519
We came here to shoot the video anyway.

678
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,279
Did you bring the clothes?

679
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,039
They're right here.

680
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:00,799
Hand them to me.

681
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,680
I'll go change.

682
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,160
Sorry, Ming Liang.

683
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
I really didn't mean to.

684
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,079
I know you wouldn't.

685
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,000
Work comes first.

686
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:10,799
Let's hurry and shoot.

687
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,079
Thanks for understanding.

688
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:14,839
Ming Liang.

689
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:18,880
Can you help me film?

690
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,119
There are two more models over there.

691
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:20,680
Daylight is limited.

692
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,359
I'm afraid we won't finish.

693
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,119
I'll film for you.

694
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,359
Dong Ge

695
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,119
What did the suppliers you contacted say?

696
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:31,279
What did the suppliers you contacted say?

697
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,839
Only two agreed to sign the contract.

698
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,640
The others said they need to think more.

699
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,640
Ankar

700
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,920
Ji Ge

701
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,079
Boss Ji

702
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:48,599
Please sit.

703
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,400
No need.

704
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,640
I've always supplied drinks to Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

705
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,680
I trust you.

706
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:53,880
I trust you.

707
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,079
If payment is a few days late,

708
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,799
it's fine.

709
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,839
But

710
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,319
if you keep this person in the restaurant,

711
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,079
I can't sign this debt contract.

712
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:04,599
I don't dare sign it.

713
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,839
I can resign.

714
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,079
I won't be the manager.

715
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,599
I'll just be a waiter.

716
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,400
Just a regular staff member.

717
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:09,920
Ji Ge

718
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,880
You make sense.

719
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,119
But you also know

720
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,599
how we do things at Hong Shiliu.

721
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,119
Since we chose Anton

722
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,079
as our manager,

723
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,079
we have our reasons.

724
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,839
Your bill is thirty-three thousand five hundred eight.

725
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,519
Dong Ge, as manager,

726
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,839
please settle with Ji Ge.

727
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,359
Ankar, this...

728
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,680
Don't be too impulsive.

729
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,559
Please, Boss Ji.

730
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,079
Ankar, you...

731
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,119
At this moment,

732
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,079
you're more important than the suppliers.

733
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,319
What's wrong?

734
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Mingliang said

735
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,079
Brother Baheti is coming tomorrow too.

736
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,079
Baheti

737
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,319
The one who supplies us lamb.

738
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,119
That's a big deal.

739
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,079
Sorry.

740
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,400
We're not open yet.

741
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,079
Eleven o'clock.

742
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,079
We open at eleven.

743
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,000
Anton

744
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,759
You're Ankar.

745
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
You're Brother Baheti, right?

746
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,039
Please, have a seat.

747
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,240
Please, have a seat.

748
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,519
Have some water.

749
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:42,000
You've surely seen the contract.

750
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,279
It's fine.

751
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,079
If you have any comments

752
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,759
or are unhappy with anything,

753
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:46,599
just tell us directly.

754
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:47,839
We'll fully cooperate.

755
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,839
We've made up our minds.

756
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,640
We won't sign the debt contract.

757
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,680
Yes, that's how it is, brother.

758
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,279
About this debt contract,

759
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,359
you can add interest.

760
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:56,799
Yes.

761
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,160
Although our partnership

762
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,000
hasn't been that long,

763
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,599
you should trust our restaurant.

764
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,839
What are you saying?

765
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,279
It's normal they don't trust us.

766
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,839
Let's listen to Baheti.

767
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,759
Make your requests.

768
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,039
Any request is fine.

769
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,880
As long as you keep supplying.

770
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,599
I can resign.

771
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,079
If you don't trust me, I can...

772
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:13,679
No.

773
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,400
It's okay.

774
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,360
Really, I...

775
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,840
As long as they supply as usual,

776
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,039
my resignation doesn't matter, right?

777
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:18,400
No.

778
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:18,840
What's wrong?

779
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,880
About the lamb,

780
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,599
just do as Mingliang discussed.

781
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,079
Supply as usual.

782
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,519
And then?

783
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,079
Mingliang had such a big issue

784
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,079
and didn't tell me at all.

785
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,159
Just sent me a lousy contract.

786
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
I came this time

787
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
just to see

788
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,320
if your restaurant needs any help.

789
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:45,920
No.

790
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,079
Then how do we explain to Mingliang?

791
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,400
Right, you... you like this...

792
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,360
It's fine, easy to handle.

793
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,320
Mingliang

794
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,599
I've already torn up the debt contract.

795
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,840
Don't bring it up again.

796
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,639
I even kept it from Mayila.

797
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,800
If you mention it again,

798
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,400
face the consequences yourself.

799
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,400
Alright, Bakhti.

800
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:15,639
I'll do as you say.

801
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:16,559
It's settled.

802
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,639
Thanks, bro. Thanks, bro.

803
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,840
Really appreciate it. Thank you so much.

804
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,880
Hey, stay here.

805
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,320
Let's have a meal together.

806
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,320
Let's really

807
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:27,800
No need.

808
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,599
I've got something to do later.

809
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,320
I'll head out first.

810
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,320
Wait, you—

811
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,880
You go handle your business first.

812
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,280
But you must come back later.

813
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,639
When you return, I'll treat you to dinner.

814
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,039
Let's get together and talk properly.

815
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:37,280
Alright?

816
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Okay, it's a deal.

817
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,679
Alright.

818
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,280
Let's have a couple drinks.

819
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,880
I'll wait for you, we'll drink together.

820
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,320
Sure, sure.

821
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,800
Alright then.

822
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,559
Thank you.

823
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,079
Thanks.

824
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,599
Thank you so much.

825
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Alright, alright, sis.

826
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,679
I really appreciate it, truly.

827
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,559
Okay, okay.

828
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,800
I'll tell Dong.

829
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,840
Alright.

830
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,320
What's up?

831
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,840
It's Sister Xiaoyan, who supplies us morels.

832
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,119
She called me and said

833
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,840
She's just like Brother Bakhti.

834
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,280
And also,

835
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,880
She said because

836
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,119
the sales channel for morels to Jiangsu

837
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,599
was introduced by you.

838
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,840
She was really moved.

839
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,039
You didn't even mention money back then.

840
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,039
With these suppliers secured,

841
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,599
our restaurant can run as usual.

842
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,480
That Fang Tao

843
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,000
seems to have lost his cool.

844
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,280
Speaking of the supplier debts,

845
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,480
we've handled it smoothly these days.

846
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,079
I think Fang Tao

847
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,760
probably won't stir things up

848
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,719
with the suppliers.

849
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,400
This is the empty city strategy

850
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,079
we used with Mingliang.

851
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,079
It worked.

852
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:46,920
Slow down, you guys.

853
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,559
Take it easy.

854
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,360
Mulati.

855
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,639
Dad.

856
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,360
Mulati.

857
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,920
Slow down, slow down.

858
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,599
You drank, so go slow.

859
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,079
It's fine.

860
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,159
Take it easy.

861
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,960
Ankar.

862
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,679
You can really hold your liquor.

863
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,239
Yeah, I can.

864
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,079
Did you hear? Go slow.

865
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,760
Bayar's mom.

866
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,239
This time, we drank happily.

867
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,960
When the time comes,

868
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,599
everyone will go to the grasslands.

869
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,599
Maiyla and I

870
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,679
will host you well.

871
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,079
Alright, alright.

872
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,480
Why stay at a hotel?

873
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:13,559
Ankar.

874
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,360
You tell him

875
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,440
to come home.

876
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,000
Let's all go home together.

877
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,639
Dad, dad.

878
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,480
Dad, did you forget?

879
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,280
Brother Bakhti still has things to do.

880
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,719
Right.

881
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:22,800
Big Brother Mulati.

882
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,159
I've already booked my room.

883
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,239
Next time,

884
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,199
when I come,

885
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,000
I'll visit your home, okay?

886
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:29,480
Sure.

887
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,199
Alright, that's settled.

888
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:31,719
See you next time.

889
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,440
See you next time.

890
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,519
Go slow, go slow.

891
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:33,960
Goodbye.

892
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:34,599
Bye.

893
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,239
Goodbye, goodbye.

894
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,280
You, get in the car.

895
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,119
I'll drive you back.

896
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,239
It's not on my way.

897
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,159
We'll just walk back.

898
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,800
It's not that far.

899
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,559
No, no, no.

900
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,719
Dad, dad, dad.

901
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,159
Bro, we'll walk ourselves.

902
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,760
We'll sober up a bit.

903
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:46,440
Right.

904
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,960
We're heading back to the hostel.

905
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,039
To sober up.

906
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,599
Then I'll take Dong back to the restaurant.

907
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,039
Alright.

908
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:56,519
Take it easy.

909
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,679
Go slow.

910
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,599
Be sure to go slow.

911
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,119
Okay.

912
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:00,920
Careful, careful.

913
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:01,800
Dong, get in the car.

914
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,880
Go slow, go slow.

915
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:03,960
Go slow.

916
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,079
Sorry, sir.

917
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,079
Mulati's dad must've sold his house.

918
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,559
That's how he got so much money.

919
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,400
That old Mulati

920
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,280
is such a fool.

921
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,679
Why not just talk about things?

922
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,079
We could all discuss it.

923
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,800
Everyone could help out.

924
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,719
If that doesn't work,

925
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,880
he could squeeze in at our place.

926
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,360
Why insist on living here?

927
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,920
I added socks for Ankar to my order.

928
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,719
He insisted I send them to the restaurant.

929
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,079
I should've known about this earlier.

930
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,440
Darn it, you know,

931
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,239
he sold his house too.

932
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,079
How will he live from now on?

933
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:32,960
It's fine.

934
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,280
I'll go drag them out.

935
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,559
Enough, you—

936
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,400
It's all because of you.

937
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,199
I know old Mulati well.

938
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,199
He's really stubborn.

939
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,920
He insists on doing it this way.

940
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,639
It's all about saving face.

941
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,519
You just had to barge in.

942
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,400
Where does that leave their dignity?

943
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,920
That reputation, you know.

944
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,440
Then I'll take responsibility.

945
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,639
What responsibility are you taking?

946
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,920
He... he gets the studio.

947
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,760
I sleep on the street.

948
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,559
You two, stop making trouble.

949
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,039
I'll handle this.

950
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
This V8 route,

951
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,239
he cleared it in just three tries.

952
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:20,519
That's a real pro!

953
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,519
Me.

954
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
My son.

955
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,599
The guy who just washed up?

956
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,000
So cool.

957
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:28,880
He also

958
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,239
hasn't played in ages.

959
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,880
Lately,

960
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,159
he's been super busy.

961
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,800
Dad, why are you up?

962
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:44,119
Go to sleep.

963
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:44,960
Come.

964
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,239
Come on, go to bed.

965
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:47,679
Don't move.

966
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,039
I... I'll walk myself.

967
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,199
Don't move.

968
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:52,679
Okay.

969
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,519
Okay, Dad, come.

970
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:15,960
Sorry about that.

971
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,400
It's fine, it's fine.

972
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:18,599
Oh, right.

973
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,480
I have earplugs.

974
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:23,639
It's fine, it's fine.

975
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,760
Pro!

976
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,119
Take us climbing next time.

977
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I'm not a pro.

978
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
My dad's the real pro.

979
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:36,599
Sure.

980
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,239
You're welcome to visit the co-op.

981
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,960
I'll have our staff contact you.

982
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:41,960
Alright, goodbye.

983
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,079
Hello, Mr. Qian.

984
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:45,800
Secretary Xu.

985
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,079
Your transformation video went viral.

986
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,679
We want to place more orders.

987
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,480
We didn't expect it to blow up so fast.

988
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,679
It caught us off guard too.

989
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,400
As you know,

990
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,800
our fine weaving has limited output.

991
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,960
We've had nonstop calls these days.

992
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,039
Old customers get priority, of course.

993
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:00,760
Alright.

994
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,079
Goodbye.

995
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:05,719
Xiao Ai.

996
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:07,880
Contact Elder Secretary right away.

997
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,599
The transformation video exceeded expectations.

998
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,480
Let's keep filming.

999
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,360
Alright, Secretary.

1000
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,159
You young folks really know how.

1001
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,000
My thinking is really outdated.

1002
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:24,599
I thought

1003
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,280
our Atlas silk

1004
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,800
was only for women's clothing.

1005
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:29,800
Look,

1006
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:30,559
this...

1007
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,679
Elder Secretary, you didn't know,

1008
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,719
but there have been

1009
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,440
Atlas silk men's clothes for a while now.

1010
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,039
I wanted to expand our market,

1011
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,400
so I had the village tailors

1012
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,679
make some men's samples.

1013
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,639
This shirt and vest

1014
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,679
were custom-made just for you.

1015
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,400
After Secretary Xu arrived,

1016
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,039
the co-op started trying men's wear.

1017
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,519
Great, great.

1018
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,519
That's... interesting.

1019
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:55,079
It's more than just interesting!

1020
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,079
Your energy and spirit

1021
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,679
with our hometown Atlas silk

1022
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
you look just like a returning overseas Chinese.

1023
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,480
Wha— what?

1024
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:03,519
An overseas Chinese.

1025
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,800
Overseas Chinese.

1026
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,639
I could be an overseas Chinese?

1027
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,559
No way, no way.

1028
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:11,159
Come on, come on.

1029
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,119
Let's start, start, start.

1030
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:12,719
Start, start.

1031
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:18,079
Okay.

1032
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:21,599
Alright, Elder Secretary, let's begin.

1033
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,000
Alright.

1034
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,320
Come.

1035
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,960
Stop, stop, stop.

1036
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:28,760
Everyone, stop right now.

1037
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,760
No filming allowed.
