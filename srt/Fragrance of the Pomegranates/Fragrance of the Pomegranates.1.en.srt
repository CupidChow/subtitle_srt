1
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:05,719
Are we there yet?

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:07,679
Hang in there, kids.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,880
Mingliang, I'm a little scared.

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,039
Just hold on a bit longer.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,559
Nana, don't be afraid. I'm here.

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,920
Hop on, I'll give you a lift.

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,519
Thank you.

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,239
Hurry, get in!

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,399
Nana, come on up!

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,800
Good thing it's okay.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,320
We rescued an injured little crane.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,079
Kids, that's a Crane of Courage.

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,119
Crane of Courage.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,159
They're brave spirits of the plateau.

15
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,119
Each year, they face a tough migration.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,640
Flying over Tianshan.

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,799
Flying over the Taklamakan Desert.

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,520
Flying over the Kunlun Mountains.

19
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,719
I'm Mingliang.

20
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,919
I grew up at the foot of Tianshan.

21
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,919
Mountains and desert

22
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,240
were the first colors on my canvas.

23
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,520
My dream is to let these colors

24
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,039
reach faraway places.

25
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,240
Uncle Mingliang,

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,479
you've been painting for a week.

27
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,520
Still not finished?

28
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,960
Feels like something's missing.

29
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,319
I just can't paint it.

30
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,479
That feeling that shook my soul.

31
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,199
Soul-shaking? I don't get it.

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,759
Uncle, your phone's vibrating.

33
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,199
Hello, Mom.

34
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,680
Finished painting.

35
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,039
Almost done.

36
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,039
You went to Lao Ma's workplace to paint.

37
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,560
You care, so your art has heart.

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,039
He can feel it.

39
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,319
Just don't lose track of time painting.

40
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,680
Or you'll miss the train again.

41
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,680
See you tonight, Mom.

42
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,240
My foster mother, Aisha.

43
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,840
She gave me a second chance at life.

44
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,599
With her busy hands,

45
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,840
she lifted my brush and my future.

46
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,039
She runs a restaurant in Urumqi.

47
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,199
Everyone working here

48
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,960
feels like family to me.

49
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,000
This is Murat, our head chef.

50
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,759
He watched over me growing up.

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,319
This is his son, Ankar.

52
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,199
Always inventing new dishes.

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Bayar.

54
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,519
Bayar, our waitress.

55
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,600
She's like another mom to me.

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,319
Their love is like Tianshan's melting snow,

57
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,199
quietly flowing through my life's canvas.

58
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,600
Prune juice, for you.

59
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,759
Drink more, it's good for digestion.

60
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,879
Thank you.

61
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,920
Aisha.

62
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,279
When is Mingliang coming back?

63
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,040
Did you remind him?

64
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
I did, I did.

65
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm worried he'll just keep painting

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,040
and forget about Lao Ma.

67
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,199
He hasn't left yet.

68
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,199
And he's already forgetting me.

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,199
Lao Ma.

70
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,199
Just as I thought...

71
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,279
When people leave, the tea cools.

72
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,600
But your tea is still piping hot.

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,040
Hard to forget, even if I try.

74
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,600
What do you mean?

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,879
This is my retirement gift from colleagues.

76
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,639
I'm leaving it at your restaurant.

77
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,480
Look, these flowers are beautiful.

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,759
But Bayar, you're the real rose here.

79
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,480
Who's beautiful?

80
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,040
Who's beautiful?

81
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,759
You are.

82
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,920
All beautiful, all beautiful.

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,600
Lao Ma, have a seat.

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,480
Your old spot, huh?

85
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,000
Alright.

86
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,480
Murat.

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,879
Hello, Lao Ma.

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Hi, Uncle Ma.

89
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,480
Ankar.

90
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,319
Murat, Lao Ma's usual three.

91
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,720
A'isha's Pilaf, Tiger Salad, milk tea.

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,800
My muse

93
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,879
probably won't show up today.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,199
Goodbye.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Fly, Tong Feng.

96
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
Home now, free at last.

97
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,879
Mire, you're back.

98
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,600
Fly, my dear girl.

99
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,959
With Tong Feng.

100
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,920
Cross the Kunlun Mountains and you win.

101
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,279
Do you feel empty inside?

102
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,399
As a child, I saved a Crane of Courage with a friend.

103
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,839
When we set it free,

104
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,519
he said the same thing to me.

105
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,720
What did you say to him?

106
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,759
It belongs to the sky,

107
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,079
not to me.

108
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,040
Nana.

109
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,519
That's beautifully said.

110
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,720
You know,

111
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,519
you're born for this job.

112
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,519
Your painting is pretty good.

113
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,639
Did you paint this?

114
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,639
No.

115
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,160
A friend gave it to me.

116
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,039
Let's go.

117
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,039
Come on, give it to me.

118
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,840
Thanks, bro.

119
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,600
You're just like Tong Feng.

120
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,519
You come and go like the wind.

121
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,519
Leaving so soon?

122
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,200
Ming, about what Dean Gao said—

123
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,639
Have you thought it over?

124
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,840
Thank him for me.

125
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,720
Tell him I appreciate his concern.

126
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,080
I'm not transferring for now.

127
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,639
But Dean Gao said—

128
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,600
If you don't transfer this time,

129
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,600
it might be hard later on.

130
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,399
Honestly,

131
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,960
I've been here for over ten years.

132
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,279
I've thought about leaving many times.

133
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,519
When my car fell into an ice pit,

134
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,519
I wanted to leave.

135
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,039
When that brown bear chased me all over,

136
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,720
I wanted to leave then too.

137
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,399
When my wife and kids called, I wanted to leave even more.

138
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,519
But it's strange—

139
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,720
Every time I think about leaving,

140
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,159
these mountains always find a way to keep me.

141
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,080
Last year,

142
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,080
I finally decided to leave.

143
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,279
Then I discovered Juan Mao Ju.

144
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,159
You found Juan Mao Ju?

145
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,840
Look—

146
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,159
Here.

147
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,639
Found it in the gravel.

148
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,720
It's a new plant record for Xinjiang.

149
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,279
Yes.

150
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,639
At first, you can't tell at all.

151
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,399
If you don't look closely, it looks like a rock.

152
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,720
But when it blooms—

153
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,399
It's so delicate.

154
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,279
Some even look like pineapples.

155
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,840
Yellowish.

156
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,600
I get it now.

157
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
You just can't let go.

158
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,399
Of your plant and animal friends.

159
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,080
You want to stay here forever.

160
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,159
To witness everything here.

161
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,279
Yes, I can't let go.

162
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:18,840
Go on, hurry.

163
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,720
It's getting late.

164
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,840
Leave early, you'll have more time on the road.

165
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:22,919
Alright, I'm heading out.

166
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,279
Okay.

167
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,080
Take care out there.

168
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,960
Don't worry.

169
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,399
Nana.

170
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,639
Chase the wind and moon, don't linger.

171
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,840
Beyond the flatlands, spring mountains await.

172
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,840
Good luck.

173
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,240
Lao Ma.

174
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,039
Do you know who Aisha invited
to tomorrow's Aodelaxi?

175
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,519
Who did Aisha invite?

176
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
It's not Nana, is it?

177
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,120
Police.

178
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,279
Old cop.

179
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,159
Nothing gets past you.

180
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,279
It's been years

181
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,799
since I last saw Nana.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,519
In my memory,

183
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,399
Nana is still that eight-year-old

184
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,039
little kid.

185
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,000
Back then, Nana and Liangliang—

186
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,759
just seven or eight years old.

187
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,279
Those two dared to hold hands

188
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,399
and walk toward the Kunlun Mountains.

189
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,639
Two kids,

190
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,519
so clever and mischievous.

191
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,159
Following strangers,

192
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,360
they even got on a train!

193
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,679
Luckily, I was patrolling the train.

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,279
I spotted those two kids.

195
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,279
I knew something was off.

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
I went over and scared them.

197
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,879
Nana started crying.

198
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,519
Liangliang tried to be a hero.

199
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,519
He pulled her behind him.

200
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,559
He stood up to me.

201
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,519
I grabbed one in each hand.

202
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,159
Took them to the duty room.

203
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,279
Sir, looks like that guy's tire blew out.

204
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,639
Should we go check it out?

205
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,399
Sure.

206
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,759
What's wrong with your car? Need help?

207
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,399
No, thanks.

208
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,399
Gulinar.

209
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,639
Liangliang.

210
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,519
It's me.

211
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,360
Bro, are we leaving or not?

212
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,039
Coming.

213
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,039
Your car needs to go soon.

214
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,919
Go on, hurry up.

215
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,279
Changing a tire is easy.

216
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,399
Just you?

217
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,759
I can do it alone.

218
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,519
Let me do it.

219
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:13,519
What's up?

220
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,399
You really think

221
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,919
I'd leave you here alone?

222
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,279
It's been so many years.

223
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,679
Who knows what you've become?

224
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,399
Three shows the child, seven shows the adult.

225
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,039
We grew up together till eight.

226
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:25,759
Let me do it.

227
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,159
The jack isn't working well.

228
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:31,919
Here, put it here.

229
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,759
I heard from Yueyue

230
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,279
you're a painter now.

231
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,399
Half a painter.

232
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,639
I heard from Yueyue

233
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,159
you two are colleagues now.

234
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,039
Both working at the wildlife rescue center.

235
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,159
That's great.

236
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,559
You've already fulfilled your childhood dream.

237
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,639
Tall build.

238
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,120
Delicate head shape.

239
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,279
Long limbs.

240
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,159
I meant earlier.

241
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,039
Junggar Bactrian Camel

242
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,159
Sorry, it's just a work habit.

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,799
But,

244
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,279
this description suits you too.

245
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,360
It actually fits you well.

246
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,399
You really haven't changed at all.

247
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,399
You always compare me to animals.

248
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,519
The last time we met

249
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,759
was before you left for school.

250
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,759
We can keep in touch more often.

251
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,759
Aren't you going to study abroad?

252
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,279
Did Yueyue say that again?

253
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,840
Yes.

254
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,759
She always talks about you.

255
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,919
I still don't know if I'll get accepted.

256
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,639
If I get accepted,

257
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:20,960
and go abroad,

258
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,120
we can still meet up.

259
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,279
Okay.

260
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,759
It's over ten hours to Urumqi.

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,919
I refunded my train ticket.

262
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,879
Let's take turns driving.

263
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,279
Me?

264
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
Yeah, I have something to do on the way.

265
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,399
You should take the train back.

266
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,759
Aisha is still waiting for you.

267
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,639
The train is faster.

268
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,639
Don't delay things at home.

269
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,159
Alright.

270
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,159
Teacher, when will you update?

271
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,559
Why hasn't the blogger updated?

272
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,159
Where did you go?

273
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,440
I've always followed your work.

274
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,919
Why no updates lately?

275
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,799
Tomorrow night is Lao Ma's farewell.

276
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,759
I'm home.

277
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,519
I'm still on the subway.

278
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:10,039
My mom must've made lots of food.

279
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,039
Come eat with us.

280
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,359
I can't.

281
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,759
I'm still working on promo materials.

282
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm not as lucky as you.

283
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,519
Alright, see you tomorrow then.

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,880
Tomorrow is Lao Ma's Aodelaxi.

285
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,039
Someone unexpected will be there.

286
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,359
Who?

287
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,640
Come, come, come.

288
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,880
Put it right here, yes.

289
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,319
Mingliang is back.

290
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,440
Uncle Adili.

291
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Hello, hello, hello!

292
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,160
Come, eat and drink well!

293
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,920
Mingliang is back.

294
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
You, I like your style!

295
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,839
Mom.

296
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,359
Mingliang.

297
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,920
Mingliang is back.

298
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,960
Beautiful Bayar.

299
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,119
Give me a hug, give me a hug.

300
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,799
Let me see.

301
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,160
You've tanned and lost weight.

302
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,960
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

303
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,480
You must be hungry.

304
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,319
I'm hungry.

305
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,359
Murat.

306
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:16,400
You're back.

307
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,160
Can you stay longer this time?

308
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,319
A week at most.

309
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,160
Tutoring classes have started.

310
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,440
I still have to teach the kids.

311
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,920
Pilaf with lots of meat.

312
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,200
That's too much, Bayar.

313
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,359
Not too much, not at all.

314
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:26,920
Eat up!

315
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,440
About your graduate program—

316
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
Did you get the admission letter?

317
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,119
No result yet.

318
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,160
But a couple days ago,

319
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
the foreign school's advisor

320
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,119
called me.

321
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,400
Asked about my intentions.

322
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,880
The advisor called you?

323
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,119
Sounds promising.

324
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,000
Not for sure yet.

325
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,079
In the end, the advisor said

326
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,680
my paintings lack a bit of soul.

327
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,640
Told me to keep searching.

328
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,160
Uh...

329
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,119
What... what soul?

330
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,200
Soul.

331
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Soul.

332
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,559
What kind of soul?

333
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,960
Has anyone seen what a soul looks like?

334
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,960
It's like your cooking,

335
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,920
it has soul.

336
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,119
Painting needs soul too.

337
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
How about this—

338
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,839
Tomorrow morning,

339
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,319
go to the market with Murat.

340
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,319
Buy some veggies and meat.

341
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,119
Go out and see more.

342
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,440
Maybe you'll find it.

343
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,480
No need.

344
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,720
Mingliang just got back.

345
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
I'm not old and frail.

346
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,720
Just let him go.

347
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,880
That "soul" he mentioned—

348
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,440
It won't fall from the sky.

349
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,920
It won't grow from the ground.

350
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,720
You won't find it sitting here.

351
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,079
He needs to get out more.

352
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,640
Maybe he'll find it in a flash.

353
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,079
Your mom's right.

354
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,960
It's fresh.

355
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
One point five per kilo.

356
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,160
Can you make it cheaper?

357
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,920
Take a look at anything tasty.

358
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,319
How do you sell this, boss?

359
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,160
Unmarried lamb.

360
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,920
The meat is very tender.

361
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,960
See, just like me.

362
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,079
Wait, is this meat fatty?

363
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:58,559
It's all trimmed off.

364
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,799
Alright, alright, alright.

365
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:00,880
Mingliang likes it.

366
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,599
Mingliang likes it.

367
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,839
This month's revenue

368
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,160
after deducting material costs
and losses

369
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
and staff salaries

370
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,680
we're still losing money

371
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,079
Aisha

372
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,440
Good thing this place is yours

373
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,640
Otherwise, who could handle it?

374
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,319
Here

375
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,160
Even though you're the boss

376
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,240
you can't always pay out of pocket

377
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,400
just to support us

378
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,440
When you renovated years ago

379
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,160
you spent almost all
your savings

380
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,559
on it

381
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,640
Business hasn't been good
these past two years

382
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,839
You keep putting money in

383
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,839
But it can't go on like this

384
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,079
This just won't work

385
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,200
The graduate school
admission letter

386
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,000
Did you get it?

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,839
A professor from
the foreign school

388
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,880
called me a few days ago

389
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,119
asked about my plans

390
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,880
If the professor called

391
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,160
it's pretty much set

392
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,839
Auntie, have some water

393
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,400
Thank you

394
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,359
Auntie

395
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,799
Our restaurant's food
is honest and real

396
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,880
But too few people know about it

397
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,160
I have a client
who does marketing

398
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,440
Maybe he could help
promote us online

399
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,400
Business might pick up

400
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
No need to sell the place

401
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,400
I've run it for over thirty years

402
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,160
I want to slow down

403
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,799
I want to take a break

404
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,839
Back then

405
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,680
I had just come to Urumqi
from my hometown

406
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,400
Work was unstable then

407
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,599
I couldn't even afford food

408
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,960
I ate a lot of free
A'isha's Pilaf at your place

409
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,400
If you really sell the restaurant

410
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,200
I won't know where to eat

411
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,559
such delicious pilaf again

412
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,839
Come to my house

413
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,640
I'll make sure you eat your fill

414
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,160
Transfer fee is eighty thousand

415
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,400
Future rent is one hundred twenty thousand

416
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,960
Total is two hundred thousand

417
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,359
This is for Bayar and Murat

418
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,400
The future rent goes to Mingliang

419
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,880
so he can study abroad

420
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,079
Aisha Mom

421
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Nana

422
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Hello

423
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Come, have a seat

424
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:25,640
Nana

425
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,799
Did you know?

426
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,599
Mingliang is back

427
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,160
We've met

428
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,400
On my way back
from southern Xinjiang

429
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,240
he hitched a ride for part of the way

430
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
That kid

431
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,920
He didn't tell me

432
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,640
Maybe he thought
there was nothing to say

433
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,640
After all, it's been years
since we met

434
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,200
Everyone has their own life now

435
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,880
When you were kids,
you talked about everything

436
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
But now you've grown up

437
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,160
and become distant

438
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,599
A single bird can't cross
the snowy mountains

439
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,119
I hope you kids

440
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,920
can be like us

441
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,799
and look out for each other

442
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:03,880
Mingliang

443
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:04,839
Yueyue

444
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,160
Ankar

445
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,319
They're all your friends

446
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,160
Help each other

447
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,119
Fly together

448
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Your dad and I are getting old

449
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,079
We'll always go before you

450
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,079
Did something happen?

451
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,319
Lao Ma

452
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,200
Is tonight's food all ready?

453
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,119
All set, all set

454
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,160
With me as the chef

455
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,400
you can all relax

456
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,599
You just can't help bragging

457
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,160
Hey, Gulinair

458
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,640
What's up?

459
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,839
Watch your mouth

460
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,000
Chili

461
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,319
What did you say?

462
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,440
Captain, captain

463
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,480
Captain

464
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,160
Amir

465
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,880
Amir

466
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,960
Aisha

467
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,559
I couldn't save
the child's parents

468
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,200
This child deserves
a bright future

469
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,200
Amir

470
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,319
Amir

471
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,119
I raised this child

472
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,960
How is it?

473
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,400
Aisha Mom is awake now

474
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,400
Her condition is stable

475
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,440
Mingliang

476
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,640
Come with me for a moment

477
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,160
Let Mingliang go first

478
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,079
Your mom has a brain tumor

479
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,160
It's near the brainstem

480
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,119
The tumor is pressing
on her brain

481
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,079
causing brief unconsciousness

482
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,559
Okay, thank you doctor

483
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
Aisha Mom's illness

484
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,680
was found two months ago

485
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,559
She didn't want me
to tell anyone

486
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,799
especially you

487
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,480
The tumor's location is tricky

488
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,039
Surgery is risky

489
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,559
Serious complications
could happen

490
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,240
like long-term coma

491
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,920
or loss of body function

492
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,160
So she doesn't want surgery

493
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,480
She's been taking
targeted medicine

494
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,960
Her condition is stable now

495
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,880
The tumor hasn't grown

496
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,880
But we still need to monitor it

497
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,880
Get regular checkups

498
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,160
Watch her closely day to day

499
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,400
for dizziness, headaches,
or fainting

500
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,480
If any appear

501
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,079
get medical help right away

502
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,400
Mingliang

503
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,160
Mingliang

504
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,079
I'm just a fool.

505
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,319
I saw Aisha taking medicine from a pill box.

506
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,799
I asked her.

507
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,920
She told me it was vitamins.

508
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
And I believed her.

509
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
What do you think of me?

510
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,759
Why am I always so muddleheaded?

511
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,559
What kind of person am I?

512
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,000
Bayar's mom.

513
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,440
Murat's dad.

514
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,680
You two go back to the restaurant first.

515
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,079
Prepare as usual.

516
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
I'll stay here, it's fine.

517
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,319
What?

518
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Still as usual?

519
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:01,920
Prepare for what?

520
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,000
At a time like this?

521
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,079
I'll call Lao Ma.

522
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:05,799
Cancel it.

523
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,640
You know my mom's personality.

524
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,880
She definitely wants Uncle Lao Ma

525
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,359
to return to Shanghai happy.

526
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,880
Not another person sad for her.

527
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Liangliang is right.

528
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,920
Let's just follow

529
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,000
Aisha's wishes.

530
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,079
Bayar's mom.

531
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,920
Okay.

532
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,240
Alright.

533
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:33,640
Let's do it.

534
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,119
We'll make it beautiful.

535
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,920
Come on, Lao Mu, let's go.

536
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,319
We really owe you today.

537
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,599
You should head back and get busy.

538
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,359
Take care of yourself.

539
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:53,960
Don't worry.

540
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,359
No problem.

541
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:12,400
Bayar.

542
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,000
What's wrong?

543
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
It's nothing.

544
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,119
What kind of onions did you buy?

545
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,680
They're making my eyes water.

546
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,000
If you keep this up,

547
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,160
I'll cook without salt

548
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,160
from now on.

549
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Alright, Yueyue.

550
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,640
Your mysterious boyfriend is reliable.

551
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,200
For tonight's farewell party,

552
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,559
he delivered the clothes at noon.

553
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,559
Not a minute late.

554
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,119
Didn't Nana say she'd come back to work overtime?

555
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,599
Yeah.

556
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,079
Did you finish your work?

557
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:08,640
I...

558
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,160
I get it.

559
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,400
I'll get back to work then.

560
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,319
Bye.

561
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,920
Why are you back again?

562
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,359
Nana.

563
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,440
Tong Feng is truly amazing.

564
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,400
Are colleagues still monitoring it over there?

565
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:34,839
Nana.

566
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,119
Your new dress is beautiful.

567
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,559
Why are your eyes swollen?

568
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,880
No, it's just windy and dusty outside.

569
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,160
Did you cry?

570
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,559
Tong Feng isn't doing well.

571
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,200
No.

572
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Don't overthink it.

573
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,640
I'm heading to the station.

574
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,400
Hey, Mingliang.

575
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Did Nana visit Aisha today?

576
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Did you see her?

577
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,960
Nana.

578
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,960
Mingliang said to transfer the medical fee to you.

579
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,079
Please accept it.

580
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,920
So you know everything.

581
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,640
He won't let us go to the hospital.

582
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:52,839
He said

583
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,319
Aisha is afraid to disturb our work.

584
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,400
I wondered why she's been

585
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,319
always talking about childhood lately.

586
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,400
She regrets you didn't grow up with us.

587
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,359
She wants me to bring you to Hong Shiliu more often.

588
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,400
We should visit her more.

589
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:11,559
Okay.

590
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,079
What's wrong?

591
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,680
Bayar's mom said

592
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,839
the farewell party has started.

593
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,639
Come on, come on.

594
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,360
Everyone's sitting down eating watermelon.

595
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,400
Just sliced.

596
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,119
Come, Buli.

597
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:40,599
Come on, come on.

598
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,679
Lao Ma, please have a seat.

599
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:43,199
Look at this.

600
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,199
You set up such a big feast.

601
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,480
And came all the way back.

602
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,920
What can I even say?

603
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,360
It's what we should do.

604
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,639
Mingliang.

605
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,119
Uncle Ma.

606
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,639
We all prepared retirement gifts for you.

607
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,639
This one's from Mom.

608
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,599
How to make this pilaf,

609
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,400
I've written it all down for you.

610
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,960
When you return to Shanghai,

611
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,000
you can have authentic

612
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,320
A'isha's Pilaf.

613
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,360
You gave me your family recipe.

614
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,400
Aren't you afraid I'll steal your business?

615
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,440
If you open A'isha's Pilaf in Shanghai,

616
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,559
it'll be a big deal.

617
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,960
It'll be amazing.

618
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,159
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

619
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:29,920
Uncle Ma.

620
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:33,119
This one's from Gulinar.

621
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,559
Nana.

622
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:34,960
That's right.

623
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,920
Nana is really busy at work.

624
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,920
She was worried she couldn't make it.

625
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,880
So she sent her gift ahead of time.

626
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,599
Take a look.

627
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,960
I brought Xinjiang's four seasons

628
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,599
back to Shanghai.

629
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
When I miss you all,

630
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
I'll look at it.

631
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,199
Uncle Ma.

632
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,559
This is what I prepared for you.

633
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,639
This road

634
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,800
is the one you always traveled.

635
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,679
Mingliang.

636
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,000
You really understand Uncle Ma.

637
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,800
This road

638
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,400
I've traveled it for thirty years.

639
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,639
Now my train

640
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:13,920
has reached its station.

641
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,559
I really can't bear to leave.

642
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,360
Thank you, thank you.

643
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,559
No need to be polite.

644
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,559
Don't be sad.

645
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,400
Maybe we'll see each other in a few days.

646
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,480
Yes, for sure.

647
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,119
Uncle Ma.

648
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,239
Uncle Ma.

649
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,400
Lao Ma.

650
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,559
Look.

651
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,599
Who's the pretty girl next to Yueyue?

652
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,679
Nana

653
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,280
Congratulations on starting
your new journey in life.

654
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,079
Thank you.

655
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,599
Child.

656
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,320
From now on, Uncle Lao Ma

657
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,440
won't be able to protect you anymore.

658
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,719
You two

659
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,480
better not get lost again.

660
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,760
Today is a joyful day.

661
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,519
Let's sing and dance!

662
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,360
Ailixier

663
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,480
Alright, yes, come on!

664
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,719
Friends, let's sing!

665
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:26,920
Mom.

666
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:35,800
Bayar's mom.

667
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,719
You should go dance too.

668
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,039
Murat, let's go.

669
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,719
Come on, Murat.

670
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,079
Let's go.

671
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,960
No crying.

672
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,119
Did you hear me?

673
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,840
Don't move.

674
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:50,679
Don't move.

675
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,559
If you dare cry today,

676
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,000
I'll draw every face you've made

677
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,320
while crying since you were little.

678
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
And show them at your wedding video.

679
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,920
Aisha, I'm here!

680
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,199
Professor Dario, this is Mingliang.

681
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,760
Thank you and your academy

682
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,639
for giving me this opportunity.

683
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,800
But after much thought,

684
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,719
I have to

685
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,239
choose to give it up.

686
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,360
For me,

687
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,920
this is a very difficult decision.

688
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,559
Thank you so much.

689
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:35,800
I...

690
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,920
If it were me,

691
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,199
I'd do the same.

692
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,039
I'll keep your secret.

693
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,679
I owe you one again.

694
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,920
I owe you too.

695
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,800
Ailixier

696
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,719
Let's sing a song together.

697
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,480
Alright, what do you want to sing?

698
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,079
Let's sing the happiest one.

699
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:00,599
Okay.

700
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,199
Let's sing together, alright?

701
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,480
You're really not going back to Beijing?

702
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:14,679
That's right, senior.

703
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,920
I'm planning to stay in Urumqi.

704
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,400
Mom.

705
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,320
What are you looking at?

706
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,280
Do you still remember?

707
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,880
One year, there was a strong wind.

708
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,559
It broke the branches over there.

709
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,920
There were many little pomegranates on them.

710
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,280
Yueyue hugged the pomegranates and cried and cried.

711
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,039
She asked us to glue the branches back together.

712
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,519
I remember Bayar's mom said

713
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,719
it couldn't be fixed.

714
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,920
She gave you all the little pomegranates.

715
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,719
But she cried even harder.

716
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,360
But later, new branches grew there.

717
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,119
And the pomegranates were especially sweet.

718
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,960
Back then, I thought

719
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,800
every ending

720
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:09,000
isn't really the end.

721
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,239
It's just a new way

722
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,519
for things to go on.

723
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,880
Mom.

724
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,960
You mean

725
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,760
this idea

726
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,400
I've been thinking about it for a while.

727
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,719
A few days' rest will be good.

728
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,000
When your body

729
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,480
is as rosy as a pomegranate flower,

730
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,840
I'll light the stove again.

731
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:47,000
Murat

732
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,400
It's not just a few days' closure.

733
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
I've already contacted Xiao Liu.

734
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,119
What's wrong, Aisha?

735
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,800
What are you really planning to do?
