1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,519
Bro, hurry up.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:07,320
Got it, I'm almost done.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,240
Mama Aiyixia

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,560
What are you all doing?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,160
Mama Aiyixia

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,519
Wait, don't go in yet.

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,000
Wait.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,160
Mom

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,840
Happy birthday!

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,960
Thank you, kids.

11
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,960
Dong

12
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,479
I'm at the market.

13
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,000
I found two good lamb vendors.

14
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,280
Let's try them first.

15
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,599
The two bags are different.

16
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,960
Tell me which one tastes better.

17
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,680
We should

18
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
cook two dishes and taste them first.

19
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,479
Serve them only if they're good.

20
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,319
No problem.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,039
Ming Liang

22
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,960
Ming Liang

23
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,560
Sister Buli

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,360
Someone at the corner is arguing

25
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
because of your restaurant.

26
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,719
Have you been to Hong Shiliu Restaurant?

27
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,039
You say it's just for show.

28
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
That seat is for those in need.

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,639
This is clearly just a marketing stunt.

30
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,719
You're just a shill, aren't you?

31
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,280
How am I a shill?

32
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,400
Let go of me.

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,599
Let me explain to you.

34
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,319
Hong Shiliu Restaurant has been open for thirty years.

35
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,159
I'm calling the police!

36
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,439
A lot of people know about this seat.

37
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,000
Go ahead and ask.

38
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,680
A fake can't pass for real.

39
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,639
And the real can't be faked.

40
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,360
Let's talk this out calmly.

41
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,520
I know, I know, fine.

42
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,439
Let go.

43
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,159
So annoying.

44
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,319
You're Ming Liang.

45
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,080
Yes.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,439
I finally get to meet you, Ming Liang.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,719
You look way better in person than in photos.

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,159
You, you are...

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,639
Mom

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,800
Someone's here for you.

51
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,599
Mama Aiyixia

52
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,639
Mayila

53
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,840
Mayila, I missed you so much!

54
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,960
I missed you too!

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,520
I...

56
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,960
When I was in school,

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,240
it was Mama Aiyixia who secretly supported me.

58
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,240
You didn't know, did you?

59
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,759
You made my kindness

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,639
blossom even more.

61
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,280
After graduation,

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,879
I thought she'd stay in Urumqi.

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
But she insisted on going back to Fuyun.

64
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,639
She became a childcare counselor.

65
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,000
That's right.

66
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:21,800
At that time,

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,560
weren't you working and studying elsewhere?

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,560
Every time I came back to Hong Shiliu,

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
we always just missed each other.

70
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,439
This time I came to Urumqi

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,839
to buy a projector for the kids.

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,040
I was determined to visit Hong Shiliu.

73
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:33,759
See?

74
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,759
Good thing I came back.

75
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,759
Now we siblings finally get to meet.

76
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,240
Right?

77
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,040
No.

78
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,000
Wait a second.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,120
Wasn't my mom an anonymous sponsor?

80
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,639
How did you know

81
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,240
it was my mom who helped you?

82
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,040
When I was studying in Urumqi,

83
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,639
whenever I had time,

84
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,480
I went out looking for my sponsor.

85
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,079
I wanted

86
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,600
to thank her in person.

87
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,240
From bits and pieces in her letters,

88
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,360
I learned she ran a restaurant in Urumqi.

89
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,199
There are so many restaurants in Urumqi.

90
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,639
I went to each one,

91
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,560
asking at every place.

92
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,399
Until that day...

93
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,959
If you're going through hard times,

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,639
just pause for a moment.

95
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,079
If you're facing difficulties,

96
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,319
please take a break.

97
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,959
Miss

98
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:50,879
Miss

99
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,160
One order of pilaf, please.

100
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,199
Hello.

101
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,399
I'm Mayila.

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
Now that the restaurant is so popular,

103
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,160
you still keep that seat.

104
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,600
You're the kindest person

105
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,240
I've ever met, truly the kindest.

106
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,800
It's no big deal.

107
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,120
People

108
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,399
should always

109
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,000
remember their roots.

110
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,040
Whether I'm here or not,

111
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,800
that table must always be there.

112
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,759
You'll always be here.

113
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,040
You're so good,

114
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,920
so kind.

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,079
Good things happen to good people.

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,199
You'll live a long, happy life.

117
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,439
Hong Shiliu Restaurant will only get more popular.

118
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,560
Right?

119
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,759
This girl...

120
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,560
Let's eat.

121
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,839
Brother Ming Liang

122
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,759
Your needs,

123
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,000
our boss already told me about them.

124
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,279
This projector here

125
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,360
is a great fit.

126
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,480
It has higher lumens,

127
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,959
so it's brighter.

128
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,199
For example, in a classroom during the day,

129
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,920
you can see clearly even without curtains.

130
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,759
Many schools in our city

131
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,639
use this exact model.

132
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,160
Your recommendation is definitely solid.

133
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,920
What are they buying lately?

134
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:07,879
Recently,

135
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,000
drones have been selling well.

136
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,879
A lot of herders

137
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:10,480
come to buy them.

138
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,439
Herders buying drones?

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,639
To shoot short videos?

140
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,560
Of course not.

141
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,439
They use them for herding sheep.

142
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,279
Herding sheep?

143
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:16,759
Here,

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,879
let me show you.

145
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:18,759
Look here.

146
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,560
This one

147
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,879
was tested by herders on the Bayanbulak Grassland.

148
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,759
It has smart tracking and thermal imaging.

149
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,680
It can automatically count the flock.

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,199
If a sheep goes missing,

151
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,839
it instantly detects and alerts you.

152
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,040
It's even faster than riding a horse.

153
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,759
Really?

154
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,560
Let me see.

155
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,399
You want to buy one too?

156
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,879
No,

157
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,240
I have a friend

158
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,600
who does wildlife rescue.

159
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,560
I wonder if she could use it.

160
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,560
And this one,

161
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,319
this here

162
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,600
is a solar-powered collar.

163
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,439
Put this

164
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,160
on the sheep.

165
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,680
If a sheep lies down

166
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,199
or wanders off,

167
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,319
the phone app

168
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,879
will detect and alert you automatically.

169
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,639
It's even sharper than an old herder's eyes.

170
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:50,879
Let me see.

171
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,800
Back then, if we didn't do well in school,

172
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,959
our parents would say,

173
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,560
"If you don't study, you'll herd sheep."

174
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,959
Now, if you don't study,

175
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,199
you can't even herd sheep right.

176
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,000
Is this expensive?

177
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,879
This childcare instructor job of yours,

178
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,920
what exactly do you do?

179
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,639
Simply put, it's like being a child educator.

180
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,639
Mainly for our herding areas,

181
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,680
for children aged zero to three,

182
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
providing early education.

183
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,000
That's it.

184
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,639
So, you must have a lot of cattle and sheep.

185
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,319
Buying this?

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,759
No,

187
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,519
we don't have that many.

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,480
I...

189
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm buying it for a friend.

190
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,199
He's kind of

191
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
the leader in our area.

192
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,159
His family has a lot of livestock.

193
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,440
I figured he could use it.

194
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
You're buying this gear out of your own pocket—

195
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
not just a good teacher,

196
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,120
but a great friend too.

197
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,759
Isn't this what Mama Aiyixia taught me?

198
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,080
You know,

199
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
when I just graduated,

200
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,519
I actually had a chance

201
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,759
to stay in Urumqi.

202
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,000
But there was always a voice

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,759
calling me back to the grasslands.

204
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,840
I come from the herding area,

205
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,679
so I know

206
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,000
kids there can only change their fate

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
by studying.

208
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,879
My grandpa was really upset then.

209
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,200
He didn't want me to go back.

210
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,000
He was just worried about you.

211
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Yeah, I know.

212
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,120
But I didn't know how to convince him.

213
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,679
So I went to Mama Aiyixia.

214
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
She actually wanted me to stay too.

215
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,679
But after she knew I wanted to go back,

216
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,679
she made a special trip to Fuyun.

217
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,080
She talked to my grandpa.

218
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,240
In the end, he agreed.

219
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
So this time,

220
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
I'm thinking

221
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,440
of taking Mama Aiyixia to Fuyun for a few days.

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
My grandpa always misses her.

223
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,799
Alright.

224
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,679
You tell her.

225
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,879
See what she says.

226
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,399
But...

227
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,000
But what?

228
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,240
It's nothing.

229
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,200
Just talk to her.

230
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,120
What do you mean, nothing? What's up?

231
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,200
Nothing, really.

232
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,799
Ming Liang,

233
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,879
I saw you earlier in that restaurant,

234
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,759
running around,

235
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,879
managing things.

236
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,799
It felt off to me.

237
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Didn't Mama Aiyixia say

238
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,320
you were going to be a painter?

239
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,879
Wasn't that your dream?

240
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,440
She's someone who supports her child's dreams.

241
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
How could she let you give up painting

242
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,679
to run a restaurant instead?

243
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,240
Is something going on with you two?

244
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,799
At the restaurant,

245
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,360
I just don't want

246
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,679
her to work too hard alone.

247
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,960
Ming Liang,

248
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,840
in my heart,

249
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
Mama Aiyixia is like my own mother.

250
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,320
She's the same to me.

251
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,320
So to me,

252
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,559
you're like family too.

253
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,080
Like my own little brother.

254
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,759
If anything's wrong,

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
don't keep it from me.

256
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,879
Okay?

257
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
If there's anything I can help with,

258
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,440
please treat me as family too.

259
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,960
Alright?

260
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,279
Mom...

261
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,320
Mom has a brain tumor.

262
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
A... a brain tumor?

263
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,399
I took all my annual leave this time

264
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,679
to spend more days with you.

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,720
Okay.

266
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,720
So many new stores opened.

267
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,080
Yeah.

268
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,720
We're here, we're here.

269
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:09,679
Thank you.

270
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,279
Right here.

271
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,279
Alright.

272
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,559
You’re such an honest kid.

273
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,159
Every time you visit me,

274
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,080
you always bring me here for photos.

275
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,840
I just thought

276
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,759
we could grow old together.

277
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,120
What’s wrong?

278
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,279
Nothing.

279
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,159
You can’t lie, can you?

280
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,159
Is it about your feelings?

281
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,039
You saw right through me.

282
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,720
How are things with your crush?

283
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
It’s just the same.

284
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,799
I like him.

285
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,919
He doesn’t like me.

286
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,200
It’s fine, don’t worry about me.

287
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,279
Persistence pays off.

288
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,320
So one day,

289
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,080
I’ll melt his heart for sure.

290
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,559
It’s just a matter of time.

291
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,559
I’m so great,

292
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,960
how could anyone not like me?

293
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,279
Right?

294
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:06,720
Right.

295
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,960
Whoever marries Mayila

296
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,320
is truly lucky.

297
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,399
Yes, exactly.

298
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,440
We rushed, but we’re still late.

299
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,840
There are lots of guests now.

300
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,240
Ming Liang and the others must be busy.

301
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,279
It’s okay, Mama.

302
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,080
You have me here.

303
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,840
I’ll go in and help.

304
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,080
Why is this door closed?

305
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,360
Let’s go, let’s go.

306
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,799
Mama.

307
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Mama.

308
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,080
Happy birthday!

309
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,840
Happy birthday!

310
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,679
Happy birthday!

311
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,960
Happy birthday, Aiyixia!

312
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,279
Happy birthday!

313
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,799
Thank you, thank you!

314
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,559
Let’s all be happy together.

315
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,080
Yes.

316
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Mama Aiyixia.

317
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,320
Be happy every day from now on!

318
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,120
You...

319
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,320
You’re my little sweetheart.

320
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,440
Aren’t I your sweetheart already?

321
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,120
Yes, yes, yes.

322
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,639
You both are, you both are.

323
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
Let’s sit down then.

324
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,080
Sit, sit, sit.

325
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,480
Sit, sit, sit.

326
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,440
So much delicious food!

327
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,200
Mayila.

328
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,039
These are all the restaurant’s new signature dishes.

329
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Try them all!

330
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,440
Soon, we’ll have no signature dish.

331
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,799
Because every dish is a signature!

332
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,720
Well said!

333
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,840
Well said, well said!

334
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,320
Mama.

335
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,120
I made you longevity noodles.

336
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,720
Thank you!

337
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,440
It looks delicious.

338
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,639
I helped knead the dough too!

339
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,799
You have to eat this in one go.

340
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,480
Don’t break the noodles.

341
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,440
Mama Aiyixia.

342
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,240
Nana.

343
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,240
Who is it?

344
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,679
Nana, Nana’s here!

345
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,200
Happy birthday!

346
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,919
Thank you, thank you!

347
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,240
Be happy!

348
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,440
It’s so beautiful!

349
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,519
Such lovely flowers.

350
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,159
Sit, sit.

351
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,399
Sit, sit, sit.

352
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:03,919
Alright, let’s sit.

353
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,159
Everyone’s here now.

354
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,559
Let’s all sing for Mama

355
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,799
a happy birthday song together.

356
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay, okay, okay!

357
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,320
Happy birthday to you!

358
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,559
Happy birthday to you!

359
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,120
Happy birthday to you!

360
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Happy birthday to you!

361
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,679
Thank you!

362
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,279
Thank you!

363
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,039
Come on.

364
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,039
Let’s wish Aiyixia a happy birthday!

365
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,879
Happy birthday! Happy birthday!

366
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,440
Thank you!

367
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,320
Mama.

368
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,120
No matter how late I come home,

369
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,799
you always leave a light on for me.

370
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Whenever I see the light from afar,

371
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
my hurried steps calm down.

372
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,240
Because I know

373
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,639
Mama is waiting for me.

374
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,720
Mama and the light

375
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,039
always light my way home.

376
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,799
They give me strength to move forward.

377
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:41,919
For the rest of your life,

378
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,399
your son will light the road ahead for you.

379
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,039
And stay by your side,

380
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,720
walking with you.

381
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
Just leave it here.

382
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,440
You still have to travel for work.

383
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,399
Go home and rest early.

384
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:04,919
It’s fine.

385
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,039
Two people can finish faster.

386
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,399
You...

387
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,039
Everything’s packed up.

388
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,440
All done.

389
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,399
Oh, right.

390
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,399
I just found a set of puzzles.

391
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,159
They’re from a previous event.

392
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,080
If you want custom puzzles,

393
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
it’ll take several days.

394
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,679
Take these for now, just in case.

395
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,720
Nana.

396
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,679
With you here,

397
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
I’m truly lucky.

398
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,720
You...

399
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,480
I’ve thought about this for a long time.

400
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,159
I really like my life now.

401
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,680
But I also like your family.

402
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,759
A big family together,

403
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,359
sharing burdens,

404
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,440
and sharing joys.

405
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,440
I want to feel what you feel.

406
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,200
Share in your happiness.

407
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,319
What’s wrong?

408
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,319
Do you regret it?

409
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,400
You picked the right piece.

410
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,599
Yes, yes, that's the one. This piece.

411
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,680
Impressive, impressive.

412
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,640
Here, have some milk tea.

413
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,440
Thank you.

414
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,440
Boss, how many tables are left?

415
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
What's your number?

416
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm number six.

417
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,720
Number six.

418
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,799
Four tables before you.

419
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:18,599
Hello.

420
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,279
Hello.

421
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
I've finished this puzzle.

422
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,599
It's a beaver.

423
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,359
Alright, no problem.

424
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,920
Please wait a moment.

425
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,880
Ankaer.

426
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,799
Get one yogurt zongzi.

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,599
Okay.

428
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,680
Yogurt zongzi.

429
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,519
Alright.

430
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,920
This puzzle can be exchanged for a yogurt zongzi.

431
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,960
Alright, thank you.

432
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,319
The beaver also has a famous nickname.

433
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,960
It's called the engineer of nature.

434
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:39,960
There's an introduction on the back.

435
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
You can take another look.

436
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,440
Alright, sure.

437
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,799
Okay, thank you, thank you.

438
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,640
Engineer of nature.

439
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,559
Really impressive.

440
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,440
It seems

441
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,640
Nana taught you well.

442
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:53,440
Come on.

443
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,519
Milk tea is here.

444
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,200
Our best sellers lately are

445
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,960
peppery stewed fish and barbecue.

446
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,079
But here's the problem—

447
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,759
Most comments on the platform

448
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,000
are about missing out on barbecue.

449
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,000
It's a pity.

450
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,279
The awkward thing now is

451
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,319
every lamb vendor

452
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,039
can't just

453
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,720
serve only us, right?

454
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,400
They can't just supply meat only for us.

455
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,640
Instead of this,

456
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,119
how about

457
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,880
working directly with herders?

458
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,480
That's what I mean.

459
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,759
Think about it.

460
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,200
We use the best flour.

461
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,119
Our morels are top quality.

462
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,160
Why not pick the best lamb too?

463
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,039
Right?

464
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,920
I just had an idea pop into my head.

465
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,160
Let me know if it sounds doable.

466
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,799
Go ahead.

467
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,759
I'll check where we can find herders.

468
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,240
Let's launch a signature dish

469
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,440
called "Lamb from Pasture to Table."

470
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,839
So every bite of lamb our guests eat

471
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,480
carries the aroma of fresh grass.

472
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Sounds great.

473
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,119
Ming Liang.

474
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,519
You find the lamb.

475
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,400
I've got resources.

476
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,599
Try our Fuyun big-tailed sheep.

477
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,839
The 2008 Olympic athletes

478
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,440
ate our lamb, didn't they?

479
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,319
Yes, that's the one.

480
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,200
The plump, plump one.

481
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,680
Exactly.

482
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,240
We can try this.

483
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,759
Internet-famous.

484
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,279
This, this is good.

485
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,000
Internet-famous big-butt sheep.

486
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Sure.

487
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,559
Leave this to me.

488
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,359
I'll find it for you.

489
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,160
I'll connect you with the most reliable herders.

490
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,359
They also want their best sheep

491
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,480
to reach a better market.

492
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,160
If you can work together,

493
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
it's a win-win.

494
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,920
Alright.

495
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:19,960
Let's go check it out.

496
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Yeah, give it a try.

497
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:26,839
Are we there yet?

498
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,279
Yeah, I just arrived.

499
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,440
You must be starving.

500
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,400
Go grab something to eat.

501
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,440
Take a break.

502
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,160
Mom.

503
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Where's Sister Mayila?

504
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,480
She’s exhausted.

505
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,319
She fell asleep on the couch.

506
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,839
What do you need from me?

507
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,519
Please sit down, Mom.

508
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,599
Here's the thing.

509
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,880
Lately,

510
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,200
many people have asked about joining us.

511
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,200
I haven’t agreed to any yet.

512
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,200
But after thinking it over,

513
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,519
I feel it’s time for us

514
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,680
to take a step forward.

515
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
What do you have in mind?

516
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
I’m worried it’ll take too much of your energy.

517
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,640
From a sole proprietorship

518
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,440
to a partnership restaurant business.

519
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,119
So everyone can have shares.

520
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,119
Like Anton,

521
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:19,960
he’s the manager.

522
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,359
He can turn his twenty percent bonus

523
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
into a twenty percent share.

524
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,519
I understand.

525
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,279
You want to secure retirement for Mulati and Bayar.

526
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,759
You want growth for Ankar.

527
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,400
And keep talents like Anton

528
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,039
more committed to staying.

529
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,920
But doing this

530
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,000
will definitely bring risks and pressure.

531
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,039
Nothing is perfect in this world.

532
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,359
If you say so,

533
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
Anton will be even more motivated.

534
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,799
This way,

535
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,599
you can gradually step back from the restaurant.

536
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,839
About this,

537
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,400
Mom votes yes.

538
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,119
Alright.

539
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,000
I want to get this done before going to Fuyun.

540
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,720
Let’s handle it as soon as possible.

541
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,160
Today,

542
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,119
my mom and I have an announcement

543
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,519
about an important decision we’ve made.

544
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,920
We’ll give everyone here

545
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
a share of Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

546
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,839
Why are we splitting shares?

547
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,680
Yeah, why?

548
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,400
Feels like a big hotel now.

549
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Even splitting shares.

550
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:18,599
It’s for the future,

551
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,480
so everyone can be a shareholder of Hong Shiliu.

552
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,839
A what-holder?

553
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,839
Mulati’s dad,

554
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,519
it means boss, like the owner.

555
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,319
Boss.

556
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,400
Bro, you mean

557
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,240
everyone here gets one, right?

558
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,920
My dad and I get separate shares?

559
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,440
I get one too?

560
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,680
Yes, yes, separate shares.

561
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,960
Mama Aiyixia.

562
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,279
Anton.

563
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,400
What do you think?

564
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,000
I—I don’t have any thoughts.

565
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,079
Well,

566
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,480
it’s definitely good for everyone.

567
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,119
Right?

568
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,400
It’s just that

569
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,359
for something this important,

570
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,680
you and Ming Liang

571
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,559
have already discussed it.

572
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,839
We’re all family.

573
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,920
I checked,

574
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,720
from the summer pasture to the Burgen Beaver Reserve

575
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,519
isn’t far.

576
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,279
It’s just an hour’s drive.

577
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,599
You can visit Nana anytime.

578
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,240
I didn’t tell her I was coming.

579
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,519
Why?

580
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,119
Planning to surprise her?

581
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,920
You two make people jealous.

582
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,880
In Kazakh, we have a word

583
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,920
called Soulmate.

584
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,960
Soulmate.

585
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,880
Soulmate.

586
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,960
It means beloved.

587
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,359
But literally,

588
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,000
it means fellow traveler.

589
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:53,960
Just like you and Nana.

590
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:54,640
That’s wonderful.

591
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,640
Beloved.

592
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,720
Let’s go.

593
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,200
I’ll count on you for the lamb.

594
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,480
Help me check

595
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,359
which suppliers are reliable.

596
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,880
I’ll talk to them myself.

597
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Don’t worry.

598
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,240
I’ll take you to meet someone there.

599
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,359
In the pasture,

600
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,119
there’s nothing he can’t handle.

601
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,519
The friend you gave the drone to.

602
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,759
Let me take this call.

603
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:22,440
Okay.

604
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,799
Hello, Teacher Alan.

605
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,319
I just arrived in Fuyun.

606
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:26,880
What’s up?

607
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:30,920
Alright, alright.

608
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
I’ll head over now.

609
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,200
Okay, okay.

610
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,039
Goodbye.

611
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
I need to stop by Morning Dew Kindergarten first.

612
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:39,480
What happened?

613
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:40,880
Well,

614
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,279
Bota just started kindergarten.

615
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,680
She might not be adjusting well.

616
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,119
They say she’s really upset.

617
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,680
She’s been hiding in the tent, won’t come out.

618
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,799
I need to go check on her.

619
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,519
Didn’t they contact her parents?

620
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,559
She’s from a single-parent family.

621
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,359
She only has her dad.

622
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,720
The teacher said they kept calling her dad

623
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,359
but couldn’t reach him.

624
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,720
Back then,

625
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,200
when I was her childcare counselor,

626
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,240
she was really close to me.

627
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,839
So if anything happens at kindergarten,

628
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,039
the teacher calls me too.

629
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,359
Don’t worry.

630
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,599
She should arrive soon.

631
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,400
Hello, Kumila.

632
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,839
Mayila, can you hear me?

633
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,680
Hello.

634
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,599
The child has been crying every day lately.

635
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,480
Kumila, what's wrong?

636
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,359
I think it's because grandma tied the baby's legs.

637
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,160
The baby feels uncomfortable.

638
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,759
She says it's because I use diapers.

639
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,440
The baby just isn't comfortable.

640
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,720
Don't worry, okay?

641
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,119
Um...

642
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,039
I'll come over right now.

643
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm heading over now.

644
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,279
I'll hang up then.

645
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:22,759
Okay, okay.

646
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:23,480
Goodbye.

647
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,119
Kumila and her mother-in-law had a fight.

648
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:27,960
I need to go there first.

649
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,599
Um...

650
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,680
This is my job.

651
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,400
But what about Bota?

652
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,759
Leave Bota to me.

653
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,759
You...

654
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,119
Teacher Alan.

655
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,519
This is my friend Ming Liang.

656
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,079
He'll stay and keep Bota company for me.

657
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,880
Um...

658
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,960
I still have work to do.

659
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,480
I'll finish my work first.

660
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,440
I'll come back once I'm done.

661
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,039
Alright.

662
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,599
I won't go inside.

663
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,920
I'm afraid Bota will see me.

664
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,720
And won't let me leave.

665
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,240
Sorry to trouble you.

666
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:58,839
I'll give it a try.

667
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,759
It should be fine.

668
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,759
Go ahead and get busy.

669
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,319
I'm leaving it to you.

670
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,519
I'm heading out.

671
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,160
Alright, goodbye.

672
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,160
Okay, let's go.

673
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:21,839
Bota.

674
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,599
Would you say something to Teacher Alan?

675
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,720
What hobbies does Bota have?

676
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,759
She likes dancing.

677
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:36,640
Eagle Dance.

678
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,400
Eagle Dance.

679
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,640
My brother taught her.

680
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,880
It's a Kazakh traditional dance.

681
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,160
She gets really happy every time she dances the Eagle Dance.

682
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:53,599
Slow down, slow down.

683
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,400
Dad.

684
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,119
Go slower up ahead.

685
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,160
Did you behave today?

686
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,079
I did.

687
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,039
Hello, Uncle Baheti.

688
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,960
Hello, hello!

689
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,359
Hello, Uncle Baheti.

690
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I'm very sorry, Teacher.

691
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,000
I missed your call just now.

692
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,920
Dad, he's not a teacher.

693
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,839
His name is Ming Liang.

694
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,200
He's my new friend.

695
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,279
Yes, a new friend.

696
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,680
I saw everything just now.

697
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,319
Thank you, new friend.

698
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,720
I'm just helping out for someone.

699
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,440
Mayila couldn't make it because something came up.

700
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,400
So I came to help.

701
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,359
You're Mayila's friend.

702
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,200
You came with her from Urumqi.

703
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,759
Yes.

704
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,599
Mayila asked you to look after Bota.

705
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,920
Mayila has other work to do.

706
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,200
She sent Ming Liang to help.

707
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,839
Then come with me.

708
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,400
Let's go to my house.

709
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,119
I'll treat you to a meal.

710
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Let Mayila find us later.

711
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,440
I've already made plans with her.

712
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,839
She should be here soon.

713
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:36,880
It's fine.

714
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,359
Since you're Mayila's friend,

715
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,720
you're an important guest to me, Baheti.

716
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,519
Meat from the grassland,

717
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,000
It's delicious.

718
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,440
I'll treat you.

719
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Go ahead, goodbye.

720
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:43,720
Come.

721
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:50,599
Jianping.

722
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Jianping, listen to me.

723
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:53,599
No.

724
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:54,599
Boss Liu.

725
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,079
You know me.

726
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,400
You also know

727
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,160
I've succeeded before.

728
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,279
This time, I will definitely make a comeback.

729
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
You know my abilities.

730
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,160
Right?

731
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
The money I owe you,

732
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,480
I'll pay it back very soon.

733
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,559
Very soon.

734
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,359
Very soon.

735
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,680
Everything is under my control.

736
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,240
Alright, don't worry.

737
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,599
Wait for my good news.

738
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,359
Okay.

739
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,200
Okay.

740
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,200
It'll work.

741
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,119
It will definitely work.

742
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,480
It'll work.

743
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,720
It'll blow up.

744
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,720
It'll blow up.

745
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,279
It will absolutely be a huge hit.

746
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,440
Mom.

747
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,160
Mayila and I have arrived in Fuyun.

748
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,920
Don't worry.

749
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:55,599
Okay.

750
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,480
Be careful out there.

751
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,680
Come home early when you're done.

752
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,119
Sister Aiyixia

753
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:15,960
Do you have a moment?

754
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,759
I want to discuss something with you.

755
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:20,880
Go ahead.

756
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,680
It's about the restaurant.

757
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,960
Maybe we should call everyone to discuss.

758
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,480
Okay.

759
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,160
Alright.

760
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,000
Um...

761
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,680
Everyone, can you come out for a bit?

762
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,160
I have something to discuss with you all.

763
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,960
Are you calling us?

764
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,759
Yes, yes, yes.

765
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,720
Coming, coming, coming.

766
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,240
What's up?

767
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,839
Come on, come on.

768
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,039
Take a break, take a break.

769
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:36,519
What's going on?

770
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,720
Old Mu

771
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,200
What do you all think

772
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,599
about how our restaurant is doing now?

773
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,440
It's great.

774
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:51,039
It's all thanks to you.

775
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:51,920
No, no.

776
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,480
I'm not here to take credit.

777
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,839
But honestly,

778
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,200
even though the restaurant is running well,

779
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,240
it hasn't met my expectations.

780
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,640
Not long ago, someone

781
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,680
approached Ming Liang about a partnership.

782
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,200
Starting a chain restaurant.

783
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,920
I think it's a great opportunity.

784
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,440
We handle the quality,

785
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,119
and then

786
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,680
they provide the funding.

787
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,279
Right?

788
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,039
No, no, no.

789
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,960
I don't think Ming Liang would agree.

790
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:22,680
Old Mu,

791
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:23,960
let me finish first.

792
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,359
Okay?

793
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,839
This is just my idea.

794
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,680
We could do more than just food.

795
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,519
We could also run a guesthouse.

796
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,799
We could take over our second floor

797
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,119
and the surrounding area.

798
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,680
Right?

799
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,079
With our abilities,

800
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,880
we can definitely make Hong Shiliu

801
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,839
into

802
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,680
a landmark for all of Urumqi.

803
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,240
Mulati

804
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,400
Have you washed the onions?

805
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,160
You're just standing here.

806
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,720
You handle the onions.

807
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,440
How do I wash them?

808
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,279
I'll wash them, I'll do it.

809
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,279
What do you do all day?

810
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,440
And then, bro?

811
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,200
Anton

812
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,839
I know you have the ability.

813
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,640
You truly care about the restaurant.

814
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,200
Your idea isn't just a fantasy.

815
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,640
Of course it's not.

816
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,680
But

817
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,400
the restaurant is just right as it is.

818
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,440
We don't need to rush.

819
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,319
The restaurant is doing better than expected.

820
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,240
It's good enough if we can keep it up.

821
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,039
Aiyixia

822
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,440
We can't just maintain.

823
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:21,359
We need to look at the world with a growth mindset.

824
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,799
We have to move forward.

825
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,440
Once we walk well,

826
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,000
we should start running.

827
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,680
If you run too fast, you only reach the door.

828
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,440
Walking steadily gets you far.

829
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,799
For big decisions now,

830
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,759
we need to consult Ming Liang.

831
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,759
Let's wait until he's back.

832
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,119
Bayar

833
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:40,960
Bayar

834
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:41,960
Brother Dong

835
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,200
I think it's doable.

836
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:44,960
Tell me about it.

837
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,400
Let me hear.

838
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,119
It's definitely reliable.

839
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,880
Listen to me.

840
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,480
Ankar

841
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,160
Ankar

842
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:51,400
Come here.

843
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,359
Have you cut the potatoes?

844
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:53,960
I'll be right there.

845
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,680
Don't you all have houses in the county?

846
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,640
Why do the kids still stay with you

847
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,679
at the summer pasture?

848
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,000
Can't you see?

849
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,719
The grassland is most beautiful in summer.

850
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,719
The kids love it.

851
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,119
So they must live pretty far apart?

852
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,199
So every day,

853
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,360
I have to take Bota back and forth.

854
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,840
Watching one sheep or a whole flock is the same.

855
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,280
So I just drop them off on the way.

856
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,599
In winter, we stay in the county.

857
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,599
No need to drive then.

858
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,559
This time you came

859
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,239
to visit Mayila's house?

860
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,280
No.

861
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
Mayila said

862
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,360
the lamb in Fuyun is better.

863
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,679
I'm here to buy some.

864
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Come to my place.

865
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,920
We have as much as you want.

866
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:36,920
Aiya! (Oh!)

867
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,039
My family runs a restaurant.

868
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,000
So this time,

869
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,039
I'm looking for a long-term supplier.

870
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,559
What a coincidence.

871
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,239
Our lamb is really delicious.

872
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,280
You'll know once you try it.

873
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,639
Alright, alright.

874
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,880
If you take Bota to Urumqi,

875
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,199
look for a place called Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

876
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,360
It's near Tashan.

877
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,039
Never mind.

878
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,440
Wait a second.

879
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,679
Let's exchange contacts in a bit.

880
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,519
Let me know when you arrive.

881
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,639
Tashan

882
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,400
Is that near Qifang Street?

883
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,760
You know Urumqi pretty well.

884
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,360
I lived there for several years.

885
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,239
What did you do there?

886
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:09,800
Equestrian performances.

887
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,480
So you came back because...

888
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,199
I...

889
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,000
My sister got married.

890
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,239
My brother left for another place.

891
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,400
Only my mother is left at home.

892
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,159
This pasture,

893
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,800
someone has to look after the cattle and sheep.

894
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,639
So you have some regrets?

895
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,679
That's life.

896
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,599
There are always some regrets.

897
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,480
Coming back this time,

898
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,000
I feel more at ease.

899
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,440
Yeah.

900
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,519
Back home,

901
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,639
I do feel more at ease.

902
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:29,760
This is my home.

903
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:31,599
Mom.

904
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,440
Grandma, I'm back.

905
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,119
We have guests.

906
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:35,800
This is my mother.

907
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:36,559
Hello, Auntie.

908
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,480
How are you?

909
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,440
I'm cooking right now.

910
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,599
Is there anything I can help with?

911
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,360
Guests shouldn't have to work.

912
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,239
Go sit in the yurt.

913
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,599
Okay.

914
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,639
Let's go sit in the yurt for a while.

915
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,639
Sorry to trouble you, Auntie.

916
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:47,920
Let's go.

917
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,800
Mayila is here.

918
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:51,840
My car.

919
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,360
Ming Liang.

920
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:58,840
Mom.

921
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,320
Little Bota.

922
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,199
Did you miss me?

923
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:01,920
I did.

924
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,199
Missed me.

925
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:05,280
Wait for me a second.

926
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,320
Wait for me.

927
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,079
Bota.

928
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,800
How many times have I told you not to call her Mom?

929
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,880
She's your teacher.

930
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,440
Let them call her whatever they want.

931
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,280
It's fine.

932
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,920
Bota can call me whatever she likes.

933
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,559
Right?

934
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,280
Say it again.

935
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,599
Mom.

936
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:21,639
Ming Liang.

937
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,000
The person I brought you to meet.

938
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,639
Baheti.

939
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:25,679
Baheti.

940
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,840
Mama Aiyixia's son.

941
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,719
I've told you many times.

942
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,199
Ming Liang.

943
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,440
That painter.

944
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,159
Yes, yes.

945
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,000
He's not just a painter now.

946
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,960
He's also a young restaurant owner.

947
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,800
You could call him an entrepreneur.

948
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,239
Mayila, you're exaggerating.

949
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:38,920
Alright.

950
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,920
You go in and sit first.

951
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
I'll go help.

952
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:41,480
Okay, okay.

953
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,599
Mom, let's go play.

954
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,119
Come on, let's go.

955
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:43,679
Let's go.

956
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,159
Let me carry that for you.

957
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,559
Carrying food.

958
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,400
Let's go.

959
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,960
Come.

960
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,360
Come.

961
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,519
Put this here.

962
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,599
Let me take your little backpack off.

963
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,480
When you first said I’d meet someone,

964
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,159
I thought

965
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,840
it would be a respected old man.

966
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,239
He asked me to buy lamb at his place.

967
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,360
I didn't even dare say yes.

968
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,639
He seems both old and young.

969
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:11,719
It's nothing.

970
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,400
But everyone admires him.

971
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:17,119
So,

972
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,239
people come to him for advice.

973
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,000
Look, Uncle Ming Liang gave me this.

974
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,880
He gave this to you?

975
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,480
It's beautiful.

976
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,079
Let me see.

977
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,280
Look, I gave you this.

978
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:27,440
Do you like it?

979
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:28,880
I do.

980
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,440
No wonder you're always smiling.

981
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,719
How can you not be happy with kids every day?

982
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,159
You're pretty good at this too.

983
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,079
It's not easy.

984
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,280
Back in college,

985
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,039
I worked part-time teaching kids to draw.

986
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,880
That children's art therapy.

987
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,719
Have you heard of it?

988
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,440
I've only heard a little about it.

989
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,320
But I'm not an expert.

990
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,159
If you need,

991
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,239
I can help you find out more.

992
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,079
That would be great.

993
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,239
I've always wanted to learn.

994
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,719
I think it could help with my work.

995
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,079
Child.

996
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,400
Drive them from behind.

997
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:06,119
From behind.

998
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,039
You're here,

999
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,760
but your mind isn't.

1000
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,239
You need to herd the sheep.

1001
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,679
Do it properly.

1002
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,239
Don't let the horses' hooves

1003
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,079
be as restless as your heart.

1004
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,800
Let me get used to it a bit more.

1005
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,599
In a few days, I'll be

1006
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,679
the best herder on this ranch.

1007
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,559
An empty vessel makes the most noise.

1008
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,239
Let's go home.

1009
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,519
Mayila and Ming Liang should go home.

1010
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,280
Let's go.

1011
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:40,960
Let's go.

1012
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,760
Hello, Grandpa.

1013
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:50,639
Ming Liang.

1014
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,840
Mama Aiyixia's son.

1015
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,960
I know, I know.

1016
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,440
You're a great artist.

1017
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,480
How's your mother?

1018
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,599
She's doing well.

1019
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,519
It's good that you're back.

1020
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,960
Mama Aiyixia will be so happy.

1021
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,440
Yes.

1022
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:04,719
Sister.

1023
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,960
My brother, Samuhel.

1024
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,559
Why did you come back?

1025
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,920
Why aren't you working in the city?

1026
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,280
Don't even mention it.

1027
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:15,800
What do you mean?

1028
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:16,880
What are you going to do?

1029
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,519
I'm not going back anymore.

1030
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,559
Not going back?

1031
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,239
What do you mean?

1032
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,119
I...

1033
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:21,639
Just ignore him.

1034
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,800
We don't have men like that in our family.

1035
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,920
You're being too biased.

1036
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,920
You praise her for coming back.

1037
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,880
I came back for this family too.

1038
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,760
Grandpa.

1039
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,960
I can help you herd the sheep.

1040
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,800
And keep you company.

1041
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,239
Sister has relationship issues.

1042
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,480
I can help her with that too, right?

1043
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,119
Don't bring me up.

1044
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,519
I'm Bazarbeck's child.

1045
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,480
I can be silly.

1046
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,320
I can be clumsy.

1047
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,280
But...

1048
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,000
I can't be a slacker.

1049
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,480
Our family's life wasn't easy to get.

1050
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,599
If you slack off again,

1051
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,719
I'll kick you out of the house.

1052
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:53,639
Grandpa.

1053
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:56,519
Sorry for the embarrassment.

1054
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,480
Sorry, kids.

1055
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,599
Let's go.

1056
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,239
Come inside and have a seat.

1057
00:40:59,239 --> 00:40:59,920
Ming Liang, come on, let's go.

1058
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,360
Okay, okay.

1059
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,719
Can I draw this strawberry?

1060
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,840
That would look nice.

1061
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:11,960
Baheti.

1062
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,559
Today, with Mayila...

1063
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,559
The young man who came with her.

1064
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,920
Is he Mayila's boyfriend?

1065
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:25,800
I don't think so.

1066
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,519
They look good together.

1067
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,280
Darn it, I'll go check.

1068
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,800
Draw this, it looks nice.

1069
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,440
Just draw this, kid.

1070
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Look at this.

1071
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,320
Nana.

1072
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,400
You came here to study beavers.

1073
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,039
But ended up as free labor.

1074
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,199
You come every year at this time.

1075
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,519
Just want to leave the little ones

1076
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,000
more food for the winter.

1077
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,400
Xiaole.

1078
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,079
You came late, so you don't know.

1079
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,360
When Nana interned here,

1080
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,360
she almost stayed.

1081
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,760
This is like her second home.

1082
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,239
So, in that case...

1083
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,400
That beaver engineer is your nephew.

1084
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:26,880
That's right.

1085
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,119
I mean,

1086
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,320
let's call it a day.

1087
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,400
We'll finish the rest tomorrow.

1088
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,960
Let me help you carry that.

1089
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,320
Thank you, thank you.

1090
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:37,960
Alright.

1091
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,519
Move a bit faster.

1092
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,679
This may not be half a rainbow

1093
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,760
or half a sunset,

1094
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,760
but it has its own beauty.

1095
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,639
I went there to sketch before.

1096
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:21,440
There's a spot perfect for stargazing.

1097
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,440
Want to go check it out?

1098
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,360
And help me take some photos too?
