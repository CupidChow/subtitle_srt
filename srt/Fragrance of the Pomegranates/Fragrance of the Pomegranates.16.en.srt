1
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,240
Nana, look.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,960
A butterfly.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,040
A butterfly.

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,000
It's so beautiful.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,480
It flew away.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,800
Uncle Ma.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,440
Is that the Kunlun Xiangong
Mom talked about?

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,079
Yes.

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:18,839
It's so beautiful.

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:19,760
Go ahead, child.

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,719
The mountains will send
your longing to your mom.

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,199
Let's go.

13
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,479
Uncle Ma.

14
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,439
Old Ma.

15
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,319
You should go too.

16
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,800
Alright, alright.

17
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,319
Hello.

18
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:42,800
Old Ma.

19
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,360
Buli.

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,840
Old Ma.

21
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,800
I have something I need
your help with.

22
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,199
I have a neighbor.

23
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,919
No, no, not a neighbor.

24
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,280
Buli, don't rush.

25
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,840
Take your time.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,599
Well...

27
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
I have a friend.

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Their family business
ran into trouble.

29
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,120
You know a lot.

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,240
And you know many people.

31
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,199
Can you help me
figure something out?

32
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,800
When Buli called me,

33
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,080
the more I listened,
the stranger it sounded.

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
So I set a little trap.

35
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,120
With one question,

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,960
everything became clear.

37
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,560
Business is like that.

38
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,479
Sometimes it's windy,

39
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,199
sometimes it rains.

40
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,840
It's nothing serious.

41
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,560
That's Uncle Ma for you.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,280
Nothing gets past you.

43
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
You rascal.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,599
You've learned to flatter.

45
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,319
Do you think your Uncle Ma
is getting old?

46
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,879
And useless now?

47
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,280
I didn't mean that,
Uncle Ma.

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
This is twenty.

49
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,840
Any more,

50
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,080
I can't come up with it.

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,280
Take it.

52
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,639
This is...

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,560
Uncle Ma, I can't
accept this money.

54
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,360
Why not?

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,080
Uncle Ma's money

56
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,840
isn't just money.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,560
Old Ma.

58
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,199
You have done us a favor.

59
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,439
This...

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,719
What favor?

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,199
Aisha.

62
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm a police officer.

63
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,479
What I did

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,240
was just my duty.

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,439
What I should do.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,479
You all

67
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,960
always talk about gratitude.

68
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,000
Alright then.

69
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,280
Let me

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,439
repay a favor for once.

71
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,920
This money,

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,120
you have to take it,

73
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,160
whether you want to or not.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,360
The password

75
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,199
is

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,600
0605.

77
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,160
28.

78
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,000
May 28, 2006.

79
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,399
That's right.

80
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,879
That was the day

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,160
I met Ming Liang
on the train.

82
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,560
I saw Ming Liang.

83
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,439
It's been almost twenty years.

84
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
You still come all this way
to help me.

85
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,959
Help our family.

86
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:02,600
I...

87
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,560
It's not just Uncle Ma's wish.

88
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,519
It's our whole family's wish.

89
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,439
Every time they come to Xinjiang,

90
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,319
you and your mom
host them.

91
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,199
My grandson still drinks
the milk

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,920
you send him.

93
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,800
I,

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,279
I've told my son
more than once,

95
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,759
this...

96
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,680
this is the bond
of our generation.

97
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,439
Old Ma.

98
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,319
I'll take it.

99
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,839
Alright.

100
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,920
I need to write an IOU.

101
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,360
See?

102
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,959
You're treating me
like an outsider again.

103
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,319
Business is business.

104
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,879
Otherwise, I won't
accept the money.

105
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,839
Your mom, really...

106
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,639
I'll listen to you.

107
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,360
Mom.

108
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
The restaurant ran into trouble
because of my mistake.

109
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
That's why there was a problem.

110
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:48,879
This money

111
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,079
is borrowed from Uncle Ma.

112
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,079
Uncle Ma.

113
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,759
You and my mom
chat for a while.

114
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,079
Ming Liang has grown up.

115
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,439
A stumble isn't a bad thing.

116
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:10,920
Old Ma.

117
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,000
Are you used to life
in Shanghai?

118
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,879
It's alright.

119
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,040
I'm used to driving around.

120
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,399
Now I'm suddenly stuck at home,

121
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,879
taking care of my grandson.

122
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,879
It feels stifling.

123
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,839
To be honest,

124
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,639
several times

125
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,480
I've thought about
going back to work.

126
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,360
When the kid gets older,

127
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,399
I'll bring him here.

128
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,480
Alright.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,759
Aisha.

130
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,600
How are you?

131
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,199
Your health?

132
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm well.

133
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,639
Being with Ming Liang
and the others,

134
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,519
I'm very happy.

135
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:47,920
Old Ma.

136
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,639
There's something

137
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,560
I meant to write you a letter.

138
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,279
But since you're here,

139
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,839
I'll tell you in person.

140
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,279
Go ahead.

141
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,199
If that day really comes,

142
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,680
and I leave,

143
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,879
I want you to look after
Ming Liang.

144
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,639
Don't let him grieve
for too long.

145
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,519
There are many galleries
in Shanghai.

146
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,399
Lots of opportunities too.

147
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
I want you to

148
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,319
take him with you.

149
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,600
Then I'll be at peace.

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
Aisha

151
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,519
Don't overthink it.

152
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,639
Everything will keep getting better.

153
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,759
Ming Liang, don't worry.

154
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,519
No matter what happens,

155
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,160
I'll always treat him as my own son.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,480
Alright.

157
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,919
I really can't let this go.

158
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,919
I have to bring An Dong back.

159
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,279
I've made such a big mess now.

160
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
I don't even have the face to go home.

161
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,360
Mulati's dad told me

162
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,480
you're going on a long trip.

163
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,080
I figured as much.

164
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,279
With An Dong's skills,

165
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,399
he's determined not to be found.

166
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,200
How will you find him?

167
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,480
I've already contacted his family.

168
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,440
If there's any news,

169
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,639
they'll let me know right away.

170
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
Is it Hatiman?

171
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,080
Say something.

172
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,720
Why are you laughing?

173
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,279
You even know his ex-wife.

174
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,399
Lately,

175
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,360
you've gotten pretty close to An Dong.

176
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,120
I've been so worried.

177
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,960
Don't tease me, okay, bro?

178
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,600
Tease you?

179
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,480
I have nothing better to do?

180
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,080
I'm blaming myself.

181
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,039
When I asked you about opening a new branch,

182
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,279
you just wouldn't tell me.

183
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,960
Maybe in your eyes,

184
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,879
An Dong's words matter more.

185
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,960
It's my fault as your brother.

186
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,559
I let you trust others too easily.

187
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,399
How could that be?

188
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,039
That's not true.

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,399
Sorry.

190
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,320
Stop always saying sorry.

191
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,039
If you really think you were wrong,

192
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,320
then listen to me.

193
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,440
Stay in Urumqi.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,720
Take on the responsibility you should.

195
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,200
But don't be afraid.

196
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,159
We're all here with you.

197
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,080
Just like when we were kids.

198
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,919
Do you still trust me?

199
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,159
Everyone makes mistakes.

200
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,159
No one can promise never to make mistakes.

201
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,840
Besides, you didn't do it on purpose.

202
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,720
Right?

203
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,279
As long as you believe in yourself,

204
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,960
I'll always believe in you.

205
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,159
People who love climbing

206
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,159
love adventure,

207
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,679
dare to take risks,

208
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,279
aren't afraid of trouble.

209
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,120
Treat this challenge

210
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,440
as a climb in your life.

211
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,440
We'll get over it together.

212
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,480
How about it?

213
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:38,399
I'll listen to you.

214
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,200
Tell that brat

215
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
when it comes to mistakes,

216
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,399
compared to his sister,

217
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,919
he really is just a little brother.

218
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,919
He needs to toughen up.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,600
Fight.

220
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,919
There's something I want to ask you.

221
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,039
You have to be honest with me.

222
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,759
The money Mulati's dad took—

223
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,759
where did it really come from?

224
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,360
It's all my parents'

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,639
lifetime savings.

226
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,759
And

227
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,120
from my big brother's side,

228
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,399
we pooled the money together.

229
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,440
Mortgage loan.

230
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,919
First, assess the property's market value.

231
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,159
We need an on-site inspection.

232
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,399
Verify the collateral's condition.

233
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
Check ownership and borrower info.

234
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,919
Issue an appraisal report.

235
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,159
Bank approval sets the final credit limit.

236
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,600
Sorry, sir.

237
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,360
It'll take at least five business days.

238
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,440
The money came from An Dong.

239
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,399
Go settle things quickly.

240
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:27,879
Take a look.

241
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,320
Boss Hu.

242
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,960
Boss Aisha.

243
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,120
Manager Ming Liang.

244
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:58,799
Ming Liang,

245
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,279
to be honest,

246
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,960
I really admire you.

247
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,559
Young and capable.

248
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,559
Talented.

249
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,320
Bold.

250
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,399
The bond between you all

251
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,559
moves me too.

252
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,720
But when it comes to business,

253
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,200
you're still a bit lacking.

254
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,399
But that's okay.

255
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,600
I can teach you.

256
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,080
If our two families

257
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,360
join forces,

258
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:21,000
I guarantee you'll make a fortune daily.

259
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,840
Alright.

260
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,519
See you next time.

261
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,159
Sorry to bother you.

262
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,519
Didn't you say

263
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,919
we were still short a million?

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,279
How did we suddenly get enough?

265
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,559
An Dong gave it.

266
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,799
Where's An Dong?

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,919
Where is he?

268
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,720
The pomegranates are ripe.

269
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,240
Ming Liang

270
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,240
Ming Liang

271
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,519
Hu Dad

272
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,240
Fang Tao clearly came prepared.

273
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,279
He really taught me a lesson.

274
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,279
So, what are you planning next?

275
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,080
I want to sue Fang Tao.

276
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,440
Sue him?

277
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,600
No matter what happens,

278
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,679
I want to give it a try.

279
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:14,799
Alright.

280
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,840
If you've made up your mind,

281
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,519
we'll all stand with you.

282
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,879
We'll fight him to the end.

283
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:24,919
Come on.

284
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,039
The pomegranate juice is ready.

285
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:26,519
Great.

286
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:28,879
Here, have a taste.

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,559
Give it to me.

288
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,200
You do it.

289
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,519
I'll do it, I'll do it.

290
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,440
Alright, alright, you give it to me.

291
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,440
Thanks for your hard work, Hu. Here.

292
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,039
Come, come, come.

293
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,799
Come.

294
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,360
Sit down, sit down.

295
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,559
It's better than last year's.

296
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:39,799
Nice, nice.

297
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,399
Not bad, not bad.

298
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,039
I messed up badly.

299
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,159
I dragged everyone down.

300
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,399
Bayar Mom

301
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,679
Aisha Mom

302
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:46,679
Hu Dad

303
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,960
Dad

304
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,559
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,159
People can't teach everything.

306
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,759
But life teaches you in one go.

307
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,759
Young people, you know.

308
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,200
Who doesn't make mistakes?

309
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,279
After you make a mistake,

310
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,559
just fix it and move on.

311
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,000
You're a good kid.

312
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,399
I think these grapes are good.

313
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,559
If you like them, have a few more.

314
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,639
Talk less.

315
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,279
No,

316
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,039
I mean,

317
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,840
if we can't finish these grapes,

318
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,279
can we make wine out of them?

319
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,399
I'll make it for you.

320
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,799
Let's make a few more barrels this year.

321
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,639
Come on, come on.

322
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,279
Let's have another toast.

323
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:21,799
Cheers.

324
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,399
Bottoms up!

325
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,360
The problem's solved.

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,559
Come back.

327
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,159
You can't avoid us forever.

328
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,920
Ming Liang

329
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,519
If you're seeing this,

330
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,039
it means I failed.

331
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,279
I didn't make it back to this warm room.

332
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,200
All I can leave you

333
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,240
are these words that follow.

334
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,400
Ming Liang

335
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,440
Aisha

336
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,640
Ankar

337
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,480
Mulati

338
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,519
Bayar

339
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,440
Hello, everyone.

340
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,640
Sorry to say goodbye this way.

341
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,160
Today

342
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,640
is my ninety-eighth day at the restaurant.

343
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,799
I'm glad I met you all.

344
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,359
Hello.

345
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,279
My name is An Dong.

346
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,240
If

347
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,680
you still let me call myself that.

348
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,359
I know

349
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,839
nothing I say now

350
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,799
can make up for

351
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,559
the hurt I've caused you.

352
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,519
I suddenly feel so tired.

353
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,519
I want to rest.

354
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,319
Ming Liang

355
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,000
You're smart and capable.

356
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,039
Keep following your own ideas.

357
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,880
You won't go wrong.

358
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,559
Aisha

359
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,480
Hope you recover soon.

360
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,759
Wishing you good health.

361
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:06,920
To the rest of the family,

362
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,920
I wish you all peace

363
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,680
and happiness forever.

364
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,319
You know, An Dong is such a character.

365
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,519
When our pomegranate tree first bore fruit,

366
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,279
he kept asking every day,

367
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,400
"When will the pomegranates ripen?"

368
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,319
"When will they ripen?"

369
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,519
Now they're ripe,

370
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
but he won't come back to eat them.

371
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,119
Do you think

372
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,240
he might do something foolish?

373
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,519
Hey, Ming Liang.

374
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,240
I was just about to call you.

375
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,400
An Dong,

376
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,559
has he contacted you?

377
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,000
He came to see me this morning.

378
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,759
He looked completely drained.

379
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,680
After I sent you the money,

380
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,839
I couldn't find him anymore.

381
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:01,720
Mom

382
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,359
Son

383
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,799
I'll go to Hetian with you.

384
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,359
Mom

385
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,640
I'll go find An Dong first.

386
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,799
See what's going on.

387
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,480
Then you can come over.

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,319
I've been through more than you.

389
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,480
Maybe I can help if I go.

390
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,759
But

391
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,799
your health...

392
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,839
Don't worry about my health.

393
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,960
An Dong's matter is my responsibility.

394
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,079
I should be the one to handle it.

395
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,680
Alright.

396
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,119
Let's go together.

397
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,519
Dear guests,

398
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,559
today our Hong Shiliu Restaurant

399
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,720
is officially open!

400
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,480
We welcome you all to visit often.

401
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,440
Here,

402
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,119
let's wish Hong Shiliu Restaurant

403
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,519
great prosperity.

404
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,240
Best wishes for our grand opening!

405
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,039
Alright.

406
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,319
For three days straight,

407
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,000
everything is half price.

408
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,599
Great.

409
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,880
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

410
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,960
Welcome, welcome!

411
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,240
Welcome, welcome!

412
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,359
Please come inside, please.

413
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,880
Please come in.

414
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,119
Mom

415
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,440
Don't worry.

416
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,039
He definitely won't do

417
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,480
anything to hurt himself.

418
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,279
I've already checked the guesthouses.

419
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,000
He didn't take his phone or luggage.

420
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,799
Is there anywhere else he usually goes?

421
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,799
I've looked everywhere I could.

422
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:52,799
Ming Liang

423
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,559
I have a bad feeling about this.

424
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,880
Is there anywhere in Hetian

425
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,039
that's especially meaningful to you both?

426
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,480
An Dong always has you in his heart.

427
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:04,920
If he really wants to do something,

428
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,039
he might go to that place.

429
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,240
An Dong, look!

430
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,559
It's a Glossy Ibis.

431
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,039
When I was little,

432
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,759
my mom always said there were Glossy Ibises here.

433
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,839
But I never saw one myself.

434
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,559
You came and saw one right away.

435
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,680
You're really lucky.

436
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,880
I wish I could do nothing,

437
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,440
just stay here all day.

438
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,880
Once we've saved enough money,

439
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,039
let's build a house right here.

440
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,519
A big window in the master bedroom.

441
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,759
So every morning when we wake up,

442
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,839
we'll see this lake first thing.

443
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,599
Can I ask you something?

444
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,559
If Ankaer learns from you,

445
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,519
can he ever be like you?

446
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,799
You need someone to support you now.

447
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,519
I want to stand by your side.

448
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,839
Everyone in our restaurant

449
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,480
gives you their heart.

450
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,440
We treat you with all our sincerity.

451
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,640
That's how we all treat you.

452
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,039
Why do you treat us like this?

453
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,440
What kind of person are you?

454
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,519
An Dong

455
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,720
You don't understand what family means.

456
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,599
Winning people's hearts is the hardest.

457
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,720
You won their hearts,

458
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,240
but stabbed them right in the heart.

459
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,079
Do you think by doing this

460
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,519
they'll forgive you?

461
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,039
An Dong...

462
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,480
You brought yourself to this dead end.

463
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:43,799
An Dong

464
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,359
An Dong

465
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,559
What are you doing, An Dong?

466
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:50,720
Where are you going?

467
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,799
Leave me alone.

468
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,400
Let me die.

469
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,000
An Dong

470
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,640
An Dong

471
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:57,880
Let go.

472
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,359
Let go.

473
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,000
An Dong

474
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,200
Does dying solve anything?

475
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:02,799
Does dying solve anything?

476
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,799
Me living just makes you all suffer more.

477
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,960
Let me die.

478
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,079
If you die like this,

479
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,519
we'll feel guilty for the rest of our lives.

480
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,480
I don't deserve it.

481
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,200
I don't deserve your guilt.

482
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,480
Let me die.

483
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,079
Let me die.

484
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:15,559
An Dong

485
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,279
Are you even a man?

486
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,680
You want our whole family

487
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,079
to spend the rest of our lives paying your debts?

488
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,440
Who made you do this?

489
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,079
Why do you want to die?

490
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,799
Why are you doing this?

491
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,799
What gives you the right?

492
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,599
Can you live with yourself after this?

493
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,480
Can you face the people around you?

494
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,559
An Dong, look at me.

495
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Look at me.

496
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,759
I've got a tumor in my head.

497
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,279
The doctors say I don't have much time left.

498
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,359
But I'm still here, aren't I?

499
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,680
You're healthy and well.

500
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,079
Why do you want to take this step?

501
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:09,880
Aisha

502
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,359
I don't deserve it.

503
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
I don't deserve your worry.

504
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,960
I really don't deserve it.

505
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,240
An Dong

506
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,039
I don't deserve it.

507
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,480
Let me tell you something.

508
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,240
Once you join Hong Shiliu,

509
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,039
we're family.

510
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:29,599
An Dong

511
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,720
No matter how guilty you feel,

512
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,599
living

513
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,920
is the only way to fix things.

514
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,200
I can't fix it.

515
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,799
I've looked everywhere for money.

516
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,000
I've knelt before people.

517
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,960
I've bowed my head to them.

518
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,839
I didn't get a single cent.

519
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,160
What are you saying? I can't fix it.

520
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,839
Didn't you ask Hatiman for a million?

521
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:56,799
A million.

522
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,279
It doesn't matter who gave it.

523
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,400
He earned that money himself before.

524
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,559
Just let it be his way of atoning.

525
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay.

526
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,960
As long as nothing happened to him.

527
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,079
Otherwise, he'd get off too easy.

528
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,480
How's everything at the restaurant?

529
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,319
It's good, brother.

530
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,039
Don't worry.

531
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:19,559
Look.

532
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,200
Even Brother Ferman is off today.

533
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,119
He came over just to help us.

534
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,440
You and Aisha are both out.

535
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,519
I thought the restaurant might need help.

536
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,680
So I came as soon as I had time off.

537
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,759
Thanks, brother.

538
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,119
No need to thank me.

539
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,079
I can't really help much.

540
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,079
I'm just here for a free meal.

541
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:34,759
By the way—

542
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,839
About Aisha—

543
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,839
She's been running around outside.

544
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,519
Make sure she gets some rest.

545
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,559
I'll treat you to a drink when we're back.

546
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,200
We'll head back once we're done here.

547
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,759
Ming Liang.

548
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,839
Um...

549
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,279
It's fine, it's fine.

550
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,119
Don't worry.

551
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,559
There's Yueyue,

552
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,480
Guangtian,

553
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,039
and your father Hu is here too.

554
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,039
When they're not busy,

555
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,720
I ask them to help at the restaurant.

556
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,519
Aisha finally got to visit Hotan.

557
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,200
Take her out and have some fun.

558
00:25:58,839 --> 00:25:59,200
Alright.

559
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,480
Let's leave it at that for now.

560
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,039
Goodbye.

561
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,519
Didn't you say the restaurant would be packed?

562
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,799
Why is it so quiet?

563
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:11,480
Usually at this hour,

564
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,319
it's completely full.

565
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,240
Outside too—

566
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,839
there's always a crowd waiting.

567
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,200
How could this be?

568
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,160
With weather like this—

569
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,079
no wind, no rain—

570
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,599
where did all the customers go?

571
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,200
Hope to see you again next time.

572
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,599
Okay.

573
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,279
Is number fifty-eight here?

574
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:30,839
Here, here, over here!

575
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:31,759
Please come inside.

576
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,480
Alright.

577
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,039
How about—

578
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,359
I head back to Hong Shiliu first.

579
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,279
I know Fang Tao pretty well.

580
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,440
I know what he's up to.

581
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,400
If I can help with anything at the restaurant,

582
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,079
I'll do my best.

583
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,000
And I'll definitely pay back the money.

584
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:53,960
The mistakes I made—

585
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,799
I'll take responsibility.

586
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,279
But—

587
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,880
Whether I can go back—

588
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
that's up to you.

589
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,799
Of course you have to go back.

590
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,720
You still need to manage the restaurant.

591
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,039
You made such a big mess.

592
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,319
The debt isn't paid off yet.

593
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,400
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

594
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,559
And that kid Ankar—

595
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,440
He used to be so cheerful.

596
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,839
Now, because of this,

597
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,720
he can't even lift his head.

598
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,119
You have to take responsibility.

599
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,160
Help him stand tall again.

600
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,559
Sister Aisha,

601
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,119
I'm An Dong's ex-wife.

602
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,039
When it comes down to it,

603
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,079
I'm the one who let you all down.

604
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,359
Child,

605
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,799
What does this have to do with you?

606
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,039
Here's the thing—

607
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,920
Actually, a long time ago,

608
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,640
I heard her talk about our Hong Shiliu.

609
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,839
Back then, she told me

610
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,920
there's a small restaurant in Urumqi

611
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,079
with really amazing food.

612
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,599
It's called Hong Shiliu.

613
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,799
How did you know about me?

614
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,799
My mother is Parida.

615
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,119
Mother Parida.

616
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
When I left, you had just been born.

617
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,079
You didn't even have a name yet.

618
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,640
I really didn't expect this.

619
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,799
Sister Aisha,

620
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,400
Thanks to your support all these years,

621
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,880
my mother could teach apprentices for free.

622
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:24,519
She helped more young people learn a craft.

623
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,279
She also passed down her handmade Atlas silk skills.

624
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,319
and kept the tradition alive.

625
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,400
You kindly helped us,

626
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,599
but I dragged you into trouble.

627
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,279
I'm so sorry to you.

628
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,799
No need to apologize.

629
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,559
This isn't your fault.

630
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,319
Now that we've talked it out,

631
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,119
we're even more like family.

632
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,359
Family needs trust.

633
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,400
We have to support each other.

634
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,440
And allow mistakes.

635
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,079
I want to visit Mother Parida.

636
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,319
Some things—

637
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,599
what must be faced

638
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,279
still needs to be faced.

639
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,319
I'll take you there.

640
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,519
Get in the car.

641
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,079
I'll go too.

642
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,200
Mom.

643
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,559
Maybe you shouldn't go.

644
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,759
In your condition—

645
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:16,960
if Mom sees you,

646
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,480
she might get upset and fall ill.

647
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,200
Mom.

648
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,880
Mom.

649
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:44,960
Look,

650
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,799
who's here.

651
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,680
Guess who I brought.

652
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,359
Who?

653
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,880
Aisha.

654
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,319
My stubborn girl—

655
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,039
finally decided to come back.

656
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,680
Child,

657
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:36,119
you've had a hard time out there alone.

658
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,799
Mom.

659
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,039
Mother Parida.

660
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,680
This is my son, Ming Liang.

661
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,279
Ming Liang.

662
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,759
Grandma Parida.

663
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,000
Child,

664
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,799
my grandson.

665
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,079
You go back first.

666
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,799
I'll stay with my mom and Grandma Parida for two more days.

667
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,240
Alright.

668
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:22,720
Um...

669
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,519
No need to see me off.

670
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,640
The car will be here soon.

671
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,839
About the restaurant—

672
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:34,680
I'll do my best.

673
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,599
You and Aisha—

674
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,079
don't worry either.

675
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,119
Keep this IOU with you.

676
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,319
If taking this piece of paper

677
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,039
can make you feel a bit better,

678
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,799
then I'll accept it.

679
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:03,880
But

680
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,119
money can be repaid,

681
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,599
but if you hurt someone's heart again,

682
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,720
it can't be fixed.

683
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,759
When I go back,

684
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,920
I'll apologize to each of them.

685
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,279
Especially to Ankar.

686
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,359
Whether he accepts you

687
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,599
is up to you.

688
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,440
You two talk first.

689
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,480
I'll go check on my mom.

690
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,680
How is Aisha's illness?

691
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,640
Is it serious?

692
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,319
Brain tumor.

693
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,119
It's pressing on her optic nerve.

694
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,319
She might lose her sight.

695
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,799
Don't tell Mom about this.

696
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,279
Don't tell Parida either.

697
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,359
Aisha

698
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,319
doesn't want others to worry.

699
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,079
You know she's this sick,

700
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,200
yet you still treat her this way.

701
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,279
What can I even say to you?

702
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:19,680
This is the card you gave me before.

703
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,440
There's a bit of interest left.

704
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,279
Not much, though.

705
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
Just take it for now.

706
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,000
The moment you jumped into the lake,

707
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,039
the old An Dong in my heart

708
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,000
was already gone.

709
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,880
Let the past stay in the past.

710
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,039
Live well from now on.

711
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,559
I'll live my own life, too.

712
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,680
Okay.

713
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,200
I will.

714
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,640
I thought you'd refuse like before.

715
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,039
Not willing to accept it.

716
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,079
Back then,

717
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,679
I thought I could do everything.

718
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,480
Never asked for help.

719
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,039
Never owed anyone.

720
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,840
Looking back now,

721
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,280
I was too arrogant.

722
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:23,960
Living in this world,

723
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,000
how could anyone not need help?

724
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,599
Admitting you need help

725
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,000
is also a kind of courage.

726
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,480
That's right.

727
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,760
I'm leaving.

728
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,360
So you called me

729
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,159
just to ask if I got the card?

730
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,159
Not really.

731
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,039
I just wanted to tell you

732
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,559
everything's been sorted out.

733
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,519
Don't worry.

734
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,679
Alright, I know.

735
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,679
Still mad?

736
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,199
Mom and I still have things to do here.

737
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,480
It'll be a few days before we return.

738
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,639
Take good care of yourself.

739
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,920
Don't get so busy you forget yourself.

740
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,440
Some things

741
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,519
I'll tell you in person when I'm back.

742
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,239
Okay, I know. I'm hanging up.

743
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,000
The wind and sand in Hotan are strong.

744
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,320
Remember to look after Aisha.

745
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,000
And yourself, too.

746
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,960
Nana,

747
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,039
his personality—

748
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,079
you know how he is.

749
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,199
Making him take your money

750
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,719
is like asking for his life.

751
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,679
But he can't be like this forever.

752
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,239
If he wants to keep going,

753
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,239
he has to get past that hurdle.

754
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,559
Atlas silk here is especially famous.

755
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,199
Next time we come,

756
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,920
we must find a chance to see it well.

757
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,559
That's a beautiful drawing.

758
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,800
Is she your girlfriend?

759
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,599
Yes, Hatiman.

760
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,119
This pattern

761
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,679
isn't the traditional Atlas silk.

762
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,920
I just looked at these designs

763
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,960
and pieced them together.

764
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,960
I think this way

765
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,280
the colors match better.

766
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,480
It suits her temperament more.

767
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,199
No wonder you're an artist.

768
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,360
I tried before, too,

769
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,599
wanted to change the patterns.

770
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,480
But when I drew them myself,

771
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,840
they always felt a bit off.

772
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:41,920
It's really beautiful.

773
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,079
Ming Liang,

774
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,280
why not use this pattern

775
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
to weave a scarf

776
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,320
for your girlfriend?

777
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,760
My father

778
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,840
used to make Atlas silk too.

779
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,719
The token he gave my mother

780
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,159
was an Atlas silk scarf.

781
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,719
My mom said

782
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,679
it was the most beautiful Atlas silk she'd seen.

783
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,280
Because it had Dad's love.

784
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,440
Make one just for her—

785
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,079
an Atlas silk scarf.

786
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,599
She'll definitely love it.

787
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,840
I should make her a scarf.

788
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,000
As an apology.

789
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,239
Did you mess up?

790
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,920
I did what I thought was good for her,

791
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,960
but ended up hurting her.

792
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,239
Is it about money?

793
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,199
You don't want her to share the burden?

794
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,800
Ming Liang,

795
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,880
when a girl

796
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,599
is willing to stay with you

797
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,920
through your hardest times,

798
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,400
that's your good fortune.

799
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,880
Don't feel embarrassed about it.

800
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,840
Keep this kindness in your heart.

801
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,400
Respond in the way she hopes.

802
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,880
Answer her love for you.

803
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,400
That's the greatest respect for her.

804
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,719
Don't be like An Dong,

805
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:20,199
doing things his way for others.

806
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,960
Sis,

807
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,199
your phone.

808
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:27,559
Hello?

809
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,280
Aizizi?

810
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,400
What's wrong?

811
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,559
Secretary Xu isn't here.

812
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,000
The TV's broken again.

813
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,880
I can't fix it either.

814
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,800
I'll go take a look.

815
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,800
Calm Grandma Aman down

816
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,400
so she doesn't go out looking for people.

817
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:44,559
Alright.

818
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:45,760
Hatiman,

819
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,000
I'll go with you.

820
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,440
See if I can help.

821
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:49,920
Okay.

822
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,679
Secretary Xu

823
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,519
Take a break.

824
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,639
Have some tea.

825
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,400
Grandma

826
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,280
He's not Secretary Xu.

827
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:10,960
What?

828
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,920
He's not Secretary Xu.

829
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:13,880
He's my relative.

830
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,000
His name is Ming Liang.

831
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,880
Secretary Xu can't find a partner.

832
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
It's getting more confusing.

833
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,960
Grandma is getting old.

834
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,719
Her hearing and sight aren't good.

835
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,280
She mistook you for Secretary Xu.

836
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,920
Thank you.

837
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,320
How much longer?

838
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,119
It's done.

839
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,639
Aman

840
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,719
Aman

841
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,559
Let's play house.

842
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,360
What am I playing today?

843
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:45,920
I'm the mom.

844
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,280
You play the dad.

845
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,039
I don't want to be the dad.

846
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
But only the dad is left.

847
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,599
Then I'm not playing.

848
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,960
Me neither.

849
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,239
Who wants to play with you?

850
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,280
I'll go call.

851
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,679
Aman, Aman

852
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,000
Aman

853
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:06,880
Let's go.

854
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,320
Secretary Xu really has a lot to handle.

855
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,119
That's for sure.

856
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,519
Aman's grandma's son and daughter-in-law

857
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,760
are all working out of town.

858
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,760
Only the old and the young are left at home.

859
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,000
Secretary Xu comes here every few days.

860
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,280
Last time

861
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,199
Good thing he found the fridge broken.

862
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,679
The leftovers inside had gone bad.

863
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,559
He brought Aizezi

864
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,360
and cleaned up all afternoon.

865
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,559
Now

866
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,199
even Aman's homework

867
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,440
is tutored by Secretary Xu himself.

868
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,079
You can tell

869
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,440
Grandma really likes Secretary Xu.

870
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,360
Yes.

871
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,119
This Secretary Xu

872
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,000
is quite interesting.

873
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,119
His age

874
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,320
is about the same as yours.

875
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,920
When he first arrived

876
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,920
he couldn't get used to the food or the place.

877
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,000
You could tell he was a scholar.

878
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,039
He didn't look like he'd suffered.

879
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,280
Everyone felt distant from him.

880
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,159
But unexpectedly,

881
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,880
in just a few months,

882
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,719
he blended right in with us.

883
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,639
For big or small matters,

884
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,840
everyone wants to go to him.

885
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,880
He takes care of villagers' homes

886
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:17,400
and also applies to superiors

887
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,360
for funding for the cooperative.

888
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:21,199
It's not easy.

889
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,280
The cooperative

890
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,159
is facing some trouble?

891
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,960
Why apply for funding?

892
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,280
Nana

893
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,239
There's something I want to tell you.

894
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,000
Did you tell Xu?

895
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:42,159
Isn't he stationed in the village?

896
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,639
He supports an Atlas silk cooperative.

897
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:46,360
I saw him post

898
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,440
about promoting Atlas silk scarves.

899
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:52,159
I wanted to buy one for all the moms.

900
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,480
But I ended up saying too much.

901
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,239
I mentioned your relationship.

902
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,960
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

903
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,360
Why don't you update

904
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,159
our latest status now?

905
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,079
That's what I'm worried about.

906
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,280
You two right now,

907
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,320
your love boat is still shaky.

908
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,679
I'll help shield you

909
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,079
from outside waves.

910
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:17,800
You really are

911
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,159
more proactive than the person involved.

912
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,639
When he comes back from Hetian,

913
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,360
I'll help you beat him up.

914
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:24,800
Don't feel sorry for him then.

915
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:28,199
They're both in Hetian.

916
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,639
Do you think they'll run into each other?

917
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,800
Probably not.

918
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:31,880
Hetian is so big.

919
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,199
What are the odds?

920
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,280
Sister Hatiman

921
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,199
Sister Hatiman

922
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:38,360
Sister Hatiman

923
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,480
Xu Lai
