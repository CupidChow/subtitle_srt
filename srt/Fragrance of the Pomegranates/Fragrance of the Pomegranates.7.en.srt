1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,360
Grandma Laili this year

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,519
Why doesn't she make her own
flower hat anymore?

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,839
Grandma's getting old.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,400
Her eyesight is failing.

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,160
Her health isn't good either.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,119
This is for Mom to wear

7
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,280
from now until she's one hundred.

8
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,159
That's right.

9
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,039
Really.

10
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,879
Now the heat is just right.

11
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,719
The aroma is coming out now.

12
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,639
That's right.

13
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,879
You're not just guessing, are you?

14
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,840
Try it yourself.

15
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
Dad, I can't say exactly what's good.

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,680
But taste it yourself.

17
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
This really is delicious.

18
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,759
You should stop eating.

19
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,280
Go slice the potatoes.

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,879
It's potatoes, potatoes, potatoes
every day.

21
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,639
That's good.

22
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,120
It's just missing a little something.

23
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,879
YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT NAOMAOHU TOWN.

24
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
TOTAL DISTANCE: 525 KILOMETERS.

25
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,800
TIME ELAPSED: SIX HOURS SIXTEEN MINUTES.

26
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,159
YOU ARE AMAZING.

27
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,159
My old back...

28
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,039
Hey, Mingliang.

29
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,520
I've arrived.

30
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,360
Let Ayi Xia know.

31
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,079
Don't worry.

32
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,399
We're almost there too.

33
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,040
What?

34
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,439
Why did you all come?

35
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,600
It's such a long way.

36
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,759
Why go through all this trouble?

37
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,959
Ayi Xia is still sick.

38
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,079
We're here to support you.

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,639
The guesthouse is already booked.

40
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,560
I'll send the address to your phone soon.

41
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,040
Let's meet directly there.

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Alright, alright.

43
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,160
Mingliang.

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,319
Sorry for the trouble.

45
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,040
Well, see you soon then.

46
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,480
Anton.

47
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,920
Come, come, come.

48
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,800
Please, have a seat.

49
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm watering the flowers.

50
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,480
Come, come, come.

51
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,600
Come, come, come.

52
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:14,839
Please sit.

53
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,160
Sit, sit, sit.

54
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,519
Yes.

55
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,199
No.

56
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,439
Have a cup of coffee.

57
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,240
These days,

58
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,319
whatever you want to eat,

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,160
just order anything.

60
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,000
Old Mu.

61
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,560
When have you ever seen me
drink coffee?

62
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,720
Don't be so nice to me.

63
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,920
It makes me uncomfortable.

64
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,079
Just say what you want to say.

65
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,480
Well...

66
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,319
How about this—

67
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,639
Let's each ask the other a question.

68
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,040
Then we'll call it even.

69
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,160
Alright.

70
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,000
What's your question?

71
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,800
That Lapizi (dried chili peel)
you stir-fried—

72
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,399
it really was missing a bit of heat.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,480
But your beef was especially tender.

74
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,360
How did you do that?

75
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,839
Well...

76
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,560
Um...

77
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,920
When I marinate it,

78
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,519
I add a little scallion water

79
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,720
and some egg white.

80
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:38,959
That's all.

81
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,959
No.

82
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,839
You didn't mention the key part.

83
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,639
You and your sharp tongue...

84
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,519
You silly girl!

85
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,319
For Li Guangtian, you don't even
want your mom!

86
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,879
I want to see

87
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,879
how many heads this Li Guangtian has.

88
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
You silly girl!

89
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,879
What kind of person did you find?

90
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,120
He's even older than her dad.

91
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,319
You're going to drive your old mom
crazy!

92
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,279
My leg...

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,839
Where's Bayar?

94
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,720
Not here yet.

95
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,959
Can't reach her by phone.

96
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,959
Why don't you go up and rest first?

97
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,519
I'll send the password to your phone.

98
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,639
I'll go look for her again.

99
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,959
Okay, don't worry.

100
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,000
Ayi Xia Mama,

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,959
we'll head up first.

102
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,519
How did I not think of that?

103
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,560
Yeah.

104
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,240
Tajikistan lemons

105
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,959
are so fragrant and sweet.

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,879
They go perfectly with Yanqi Lapizi.

107
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,399
Right.

108
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,639
So how did you come up with

109
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,639
putting this lemon juice

110
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,160
into the beef?

111
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,519
Well,

112
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,639
when I sliced lemons to soak in water,

113
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,519
I accidentally poured it into the beef.

114
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,200
The beef was so good,

115
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,360
I couldn't bear to throw it out.

116
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,960
Then Bayar

117
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,120
secretly kept it from me.

118
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,879
Kept it from you?

119
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,639
Yes, kept it from me.

120
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,159
Didn't throw it away.

121
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,759
Right.

122
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,759
After the dish was cooked,

123
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,399
the flavor was really different.

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,879
Every time we mention this dish,

125
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,799
Bayar is so proud.

126
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,039
Really impressive.

127
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,840
To put so much effort

128
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,039
into the ingredients,

129
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,360
and study them so deeply.

130
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,919
Let me tell you,

131
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,159
no matter how times change,

132
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
you'll always make signature dishes.

133
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,279
I'm convinced.

134
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,200
Alright.

135
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,639
Go ahead and ask.

136
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
I want to ask,

137
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,559
your taste buds—

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,200
are they natural or trained?

139
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,519
Are you asking for Ankar?

140
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,120
No.

141
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,279
Ankar couldn't ask

142
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,840
such a sophisticated question.

143
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,200
I want to know,

144
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,159
if Ankar learns from you,

145
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,039
can he be like you?

146
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,320
That depends on Ankar

147
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,320
and how much effort he puts in.

148
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,519
Yes.

149
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,440
I do have

150
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,879
a bit of talent

151
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,960
when it comes to food.

152
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
But as you can see,

153
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,399
to keep my taste sharp,

154
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,799
things like coffee,

155
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,960
strong tea,

156
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,279
I avoid all strong-flavored drinks.

157
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,159
Can Ankar

158
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,639
do that?

159
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,840
I'll call Ankar.

160
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,639
Ankar!

161
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,639
Ankar!

162
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,080
Ankar!

163
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
You haven't practiced in so long,

164
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,440
your arms and legs are rusty.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,480
The new rookies are catching up to you.

166
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,480
Can you handle it or not?

167
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,000
Can you not say that about me?

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,159
Where would I find the time?

169
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,360
Let me tell you,

170
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,000
a master came to the restaurant.

171
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
He's even tougher than my dad.

172
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,200
That's great!

173
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,919
Strict teachers make great students.

174
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
That's what I thought too.

175
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,519
I thought with his guidance,

176
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,600
I could surpass my dad.

177
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,600
But now he just has me chopping veggies

178
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
can't even touch the wok.

179
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
See? See?

180
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,519
What's wrong, Master?

181
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,519
Is it here?

182
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,440
No, it's not.

183
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,240
Here?

184
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,320
No.

185
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,240
Here.

186
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,480
It's nothing serious.

187
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,080
Just a minor ankle sprain.

188
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,679
A few days' rest and you'll be fine.

189
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,080
That's good.

190
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,799
Doctor,

191
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,799
is there anything to watch for in her diet?

192
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Keep it light.

193
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,200
Your mom looks in good spirits.

194
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,960
She'll be fine.

195
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,080
Doctor, you've got it wrong.

196
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,200
This child isn't mine.

197
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,480
This young man is great.

198
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
I got hurt,

199
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,360
he brought me to the hospital.

200
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,600
I think he's

201
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,480
so patient,

202
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,840
he really seems like your son.

203
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
I wish I were that lucky.

204
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,960
Our silly girl at home—

205
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,080
I have no idea where she's off to.

206
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,240
Young man,

207
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,679
thank you.

208
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,320
You see,

209
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,440
I've taken up so much of your time today,

210
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,320
and now I have to trouble you to take me home.

211
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,840
It's no trouble.

212
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,799
I'll only be at ease once you're home.

213
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,480
What a shame.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,120
My girl just got me a new one last month.

215
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,799
Auntie,

216
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,600
are you and your daughter

217
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,679
having a disagreement?

218
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,120
My silly girl, whom I raised with such care,

219
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,399
grew up so beautiful.

220
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,720
And yet, behind my back,

221
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,320
she found a boyfriend older than her dad.

222
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
When I saw that man,

223
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,840
I got furious right away.

224
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,120
I didn't even watch the road.

225
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,600
And ended up getting hit.

226
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,399
See?

227
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,600
If I hadn't run into you today,

228
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,399
I don't know what would've happened.

229
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,679
Thank you, thank you.

230
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,720
Auntie,

231
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,080
I think,

232
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,080
looks matter in finding a partner,

233
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,279
but the heart is more important.

234
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,080
Maybe your daughter's boyfriend

235
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,679
is really kind-hearted,

236
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,399
or has other good qualities.

237
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,200
Forget it, forget it.

238
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
With a guy like that,

239
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,720
even if he has great qualities,

240
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
I still wouldn't agree.

241
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,399
Actually,

242
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,399
to be honest,

243
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,159
I've had a similar situation lately.

244
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,840
My girlfriend's mom

245
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,600
doesn't approve of us either.

246
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,480
Because of this, mother and daughter

247
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,879
have been upset with each other.

248
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,320
Honestly, I

249
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
feel pretty bad about it.

250
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,080
That mother-in-law of yours

251
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,600
must've been kicked by a donkey.

252
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,919
She's really confused, huh?

253
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,840
You're such a good young man,

254
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,559
what's there not to like?

255
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,720
I think,

256
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,320
parents everywhere worry for their kids.

257
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,720
As a mother,

258
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,960
she must have her own concerns.

259
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,600
If my silly girl

260
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,480
were half as sensible as you,

261
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:22,879
I'd laugh in my sleep.

262
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,879
I'd wake up smiling.

263
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,200
Young man,

264
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,080
keep it up.

265
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,159
Win your mother-in-law's approval soon.

266
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,399
I believe in you.

267
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,559
Auntie is waiting for your wedding candy.

268
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,320
Thank you, Auntie.

269
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,360
Mingliang,

270
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,240
Gulinare,

271
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,480
What's going on, Bayar's mom?

272
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,879
What happened?

273
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,720
It's hard to explain in a few words.

274
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,919
Slow down, slow down.

275
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,879
It's fine, it's fine.

276
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,399
Mingliang,

277
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,200
thanks to this young man,

278
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,759
he even brought me home.

279
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,759
Thank you so much.

280
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,519
Thank you, thank you.

281
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,120
No problem, no problem.

282
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,200
It was nothing, Auntie.

283
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,600
The doctor said

284
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,840
Auntie is fine,

285
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,480
just needs a couple days of rest.

286
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,519
And for the next few days,

287
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,559
eat light meals,

288
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,480
avoid strenuous activity.

289
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,320
Alright, alright.

290
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,080
Auntie,

291
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,440
my girlfriend is still waiting for me.

292
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,320
I'll head out now.

293
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,360
Wait, wait.

294
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,720
If you have time

295
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,919
to go to Urumqi,

296
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,720
we have a restaurant there.

297
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,120
Come by for a meal sometime.

298
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,200
Let Auntie treat you well.

299
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,679
Thank you so much.

300
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,600
Bayar's mom,

301
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,679
after all this talk,

302
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,759
we never told him our restaurant's name.

303
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,440
I was so silly.

304
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,080
Well,

305
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,960
our restaurant is called Hong Shiliu.

306
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,440
That's right.

307
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,000
Um,

308
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,559
online,

309
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,519
Hong Shiliu.

310
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,879
Yes, what's up?

311
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
You know our restaurant?

312
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,399
You've eaten there before?

313
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,519
No, no, I haven't.

314
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,519
I...

315
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,799
I must've

316
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,519
seen it online.

317
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,120
See, see?

318
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,919
Our restaurant is a bit famous.

319
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Hey, young man,

320
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,799
all this time,

321
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,080
I still don't know your name.

322
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,960
Can you leave me

323
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
my phone's broken,

324
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,559
so give me your number.

325
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,159
Mingliang, help me write down his number.

326
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:11,600
Alright, alright.

327
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,840
Bayar's mom,

328
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,720
Yueyue just called my mom.

329
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,600
Go check what's going on.

330
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:17,960
Right.

331
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,519
Aisha is waiting for you inside.

332
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,120
She's really anxious.

333
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,080
Aisha's here?

334
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,480
Then leave your number for me.

335
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,320
Alright, I'll leave it.

336
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,440
Thank you, young man.

337
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,240
Thank you.

338
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,159
Slow down, slow down.

339
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,039
It's fine, it's fine.

340
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,879
Right here.

341
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,200
Why aren't you more careful?

342
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,720
You did a good deed,

343
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,000
why act like a thief?

344
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,080
No,

345
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,000
I, uh...

346
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Li Guangtian.

347
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,600
Bro.

348
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,919
He's got decent character, right?

349
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,360
Otherwise he wouldn't have ditched us

350
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,120
to help my mom.

351
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,639
At least you remember she's your mom.

352
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,519
Strangers care more than you do.

353
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,679
He's not really a stranger.

354
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,240
But not family yet.

355
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,240
Go ahead, talk.

356
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,759
Why let her have a secret relationship?

357
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,680
I've discussed it with Yueyue.

358
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
We don't want to get married too soon.

359
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,119
So...

360
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,839
My brother asked you,

361
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,039
just be honest with him.

362
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,039
Bro,

363
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,200
I just don't want things tense with Mom.

364
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,119
That's why I've been putting it off.

365
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,200
Li Guangtian can only go along with me.

366
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
His work and family are urging him to marry.

367
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
He's almost thirty now.

368
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,200
If you don't bring it up this time,

369
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,519
what will you do?

370
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,720
Just keep letting her decide?

371
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,440
Are you forcing the family to compromise?

372
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,720
That's a bit much to say.

373
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,319
I'm the one at fault.

374
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,319
I shouldn't let Yueyue bear all the pressure.

375
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,599
Aunt Bayar worries we're too far apart.

376
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,680
She thinks it won't last.

377
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,079
I can travel to Urumqi every week.

378
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,119
I'll keep at it until Aunt agrees.

379
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,319
No matter how long it takes.

380
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,000
I'll keep going until she approves.

381
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,799
No need to promise me.

382
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,640
It's your life to live.

383
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,359
Just know the path ahead.

384
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,680
Your mom, for you,

385
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,000
drove all that way alone.

386
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,759
You know her health.

387
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,440
Just listen to her when you get back.

388
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,799
Wait until she's calmed down.

389
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,599
Then we'll talk about meeting.

390
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,359
Also...

391
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,200
Because of you two,

392
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,960
she left my mom alone on the grassland.

393
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,920
Of course I'm worried.

394
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,200
I'm holding you responsible for that too.

395
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,839
And Gulinare,

396
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,079
for you two,

397
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,119
borrowed a car from a colleague.

398
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,599
I don't care about the gas.

399
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,960
You owe Gulinare a meal.

400
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,200
Did you hear me?

401
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,200
Gulinare,

402
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,920
You can still laugh?

403
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,720
What about Li Guangtian taking my mom to the hospital?

404
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,680
Are you bringing it up for credit?

405
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,960
No.

406
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
Let her find out herself later.

407
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:05,559
How about this—

408
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,039
Let's go to the supermarket.

409
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,480
Buy things Aunt Bayar likes.

410
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,200
Once things are settled with Yueyue,

411
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,759
let's quickly

412
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,680
arrange a meeting.

413
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,000
My brother is the best.

414
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,559
Thanks, bro.

415
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,200
If you want to thank someone,

416
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,920
thank your own kindness.

417
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,000
Just speaking plainly—

418
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,160
Today, Hu Yue and I should thank you.

419
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Thinking of facing it alone,

420
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,359
dealing with Mom's barrage,

421
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
I still feel nervous.

422
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,119
Sorry for the trouble.

423
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,720
What are you saying?

424
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,559
Exactly.

425
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,799
Does it still hurt a lot?

426
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,440
No, it doesn't.

427
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,400
Does it hurt when I press here?

428
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,759
Is it still very painful?

429
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,200
No, it's fine.

430
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,400
I'll get something to eat.

431
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,839
I'll boil some hot water.

432
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,119
Go comfort your mom.

433
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:36,960
Don't stay upset.

434
00:20:59,359 --> 00:20:59,960
Mom.

435
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,160
You still remember you have a mom?

436
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,759
I thought you sprang from a rock.

437
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,119
Let me tell you—

438
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,799
about this matter.

439
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,119
Mom,

440
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,079
I know you're angry.

441
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,720
Say whatever you want.

442
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,440
I'm listening.

443
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,720
What's wrong with you, silly girl?

444
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,640
Would your mom ever hurt you?

445
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,640
You never listen to anything I say.

446
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,039
In one ear—

447
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,200
out the other.

448
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,920
Alright, alright.

449
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,200
I'm really tired.

450
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,279
I want to rest a bit.

451
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:11,960
You can go.

452
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,039
What's wrong with you?

453
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,720
I'm the injured one, and I'm fine.

454
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
But you're crying.

455
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,039
Why are the calluses on your feet thicker?

456
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,640
Didn't I say not to wear heels?

457
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,720
You walk around the restaurant every day.

458
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,559
Don't your feet hurt from all that?

459
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,519
Your mom, the rose of the front hall,

460
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,359
has to dress up beautifully every day.

461
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,599
Greeting guests in the front hall.

462
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,559
Besides,

463
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,680
you said you have calluses now.

464
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:52,759
Can it still hurt?

465
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,240
Now you care about your mom.

466
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,160
Mom.

467
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,839
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,480
I shouldn't have hidden my relationship.

469
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,480
I shouldn't have blocked you.

470
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,559
I was just afraid you'd be angry and sad.

471
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,039
And never talk to me again.

472
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,200
I was afraid I'd lose my resolve.

473
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,039
and give up on this relationship.

474
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,440
Yueyue,

475
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,480
the day we argued,

476
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,000
you stomped and told me

477
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,799
I've controlled you too much since you were little.

478
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,319
Later, I thought about it.

479
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,880
You were right.

480
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,960
You're both grown up now.

481
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,680
From now on,

482
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,480
let's discuss things together.

483
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,880
Mom needs to learn

484
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,359
to really listen to you.

485
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,200
and respect you.

486
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,440
Mom,

487
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,160
I'll tell you everything from now on.

488
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,240
I won't avoid things anymore.

489
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,279
Actually,

490
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,759
Li Guangtian and I broke up four years ago.

491
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,720
But we didn't stay apart.

492
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,359
He said,

493
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,279
except for breaking up,

494
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,759
he'd accept any kind of relationship.

495
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,519
He's willing to wait with me.

496
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,640
Until you agree.

497
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,039
Mom,

498
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
just meet him once.

499
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,160
If you meet him

500
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,720
and really don't like him,

501
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,200
then I'll do as you say.

502
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,519
Is that okay, Mom?

503
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,480
Thank you for everything.

504
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,680
Brother Mingliang

505
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,960
Yueyue said Aunt agreed to meet me

506
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,039
Is your profile picture a beaver?

507
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,640
Yes

508
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,079
Yueyue took it

509
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,039
Yueyue took it

510
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
She insists this beaver looks like me

511
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,720
Yueyue is great at taking photos

512
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,759
She always captures really interesting shots

513
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,559
I remember once

514
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,880
She caught two sparrows fighting over a bug

515
00:25:59,119 --> 00:25:59,680
And another time

516
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
She even snapped a little squirrel

517
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,160
hiding a nut in a kid's hat

518
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm no good at photography

519
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,279
I always make Yueyue look bad in photos

520
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,160
What's wrong?

521
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,799
I think I know why Yueyue likes you

522
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:12,920
Why?

523
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,680
Figure it out yourself

524
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,920
Time to get going

525
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,559
Let's go

526
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,000
Okay

527
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,559
I'll go pick up Director Wang first

528
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,720
That's not quite fair

529
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,960
Ankar does have some talent

530
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,720
What talent does he have?

531
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,279
He's just a bit clever

532
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,200
How can you talk about your own kid like that?

533
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,880
He doesn't seem like my child at all

534
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,680
If he were half as steady as Mingliang

535
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,480
I wouldn't nag every day

536
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,839
Let me tell you

537
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,559
You can't compare people like that

538
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,480
At least you know to come back, right?

539
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,640
See?

540
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,200
His personality

541
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,480
is wilder than a wild camel

542
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,400
So now you've got an attitude, huh?

543
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,920
Old Mu, Old Mu

544
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:58,839
Look

545
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,599
He hasn't even finished cutting one potato

546
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,680
And he's already disappeared

547
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:14,720
You, you

548
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,680
Still drinking a beverage

549
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,160
Look

550
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,680
Wipe it clean

551
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,359
Best not to touch it

552
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:22,960
Beverage

553
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,799
Just look at you

554
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,119
You've cut quite a lot

555
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,440
Looks like you've practiced well

556
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,279
But you should say something

557
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,920
Just say something

558
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,519
Your dad wouldn't get so mad

559
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,160
Right?

560
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,160
It's fine to drink beverages

561
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,880
Just don't get addicted

562
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,720
It does affect your taste

563
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,480
The restaurant will count on you in the future

564
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,960
Stop joking

565
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,440
I'm not Brother Mingliang either

566
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,519
I'm not cut out for this

567
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,960
Where's Guangtian?

568
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,440
He thinks these gifts aren't formal enough

569
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,799
So he bought fresh flowers too

570
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,720
They're being delivered right now

571
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
The person arriving is what matters most

572
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,920
My mom's upstairs getting anxious

573
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,000
Can't you tell?

574
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,880
Getting nervous

575
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:28,960
Yueyue

576
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,480
You take the director upstairs first

577
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,960
Don't let the director wait here

578
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,039
That's a good idea

579
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,160
If I go up

580
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,640
There are three benefits

581
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,279
First

582
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,359
I've been through this

583
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,519
I have experience

584
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,319
Second

585
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,079
I'm a leader, more or less

586
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,759
Even if your mom is difficult

587
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,480
She won't give me a hard time

588
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:48,599
Third

589
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,839
I'm good at talking

590
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,480
When I go in front of your mom

591
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,359
I'll talk up Guangtian's good points

592
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,519
I'll set things up for him

593
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,240
So when he comes again

594
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,359
He won't feel any pressure

595
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,119
Right, right

596
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,440
Director, thanks for your effort

597
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,039
No need to thank me

598
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,960
Everything you told me this afternoon

599
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
I remembered it all

600
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,759
I promise your mom

601
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,720
will definitely be satisfied with Guangtian

602
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,480
Alright

603
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,920
Is that okay?

604
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,759
You all go up first

605
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,480
Let's go

606
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,039
Okay, let's go

607
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,720
I'll wait here

608
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,920
Let's go, Director

609
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,519
Leave it to me then

610
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,200
You stay here

611
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,480
Let's go

612
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,200
Hello, Auntie.

613
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,160
Who are you calling Auntie?

614
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,160
Who do you think is your Auntie?

615
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,000
She looks older than me.

616
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,519
I just thought you were an elder.

617
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,599
I'm so happy today.

618
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,000
To finally meet you in person.

619
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,480
Hu Yue.

620
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,519
For Auntie.

621
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,480
No.

622
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,039
Let me introduce myself to your mom.

623
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,359
I'll do the introduction.

624
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:54,960
Shut up.

625
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,200
Is this your place to talk?

626
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Then I'll introduce myself.

627
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,720
Enough.

628
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,079
Since everyone is here today,

629
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,480
I'll just be direct.

630
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,720
Mingliang.

631
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,920
Here he comes.

632
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,559
Let's go, let's go.

633
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,279
We've been waiting for you.

634
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:10,759
Come on.

635
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,319
Bro.

636
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm still a bit nervous.

637
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,640
The charge has sounded.

638
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,599
No matter how nervous, you have to go.

639
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Do you remember what to say?

640
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:18,799
I remember, I remember.

641
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:19,839
When you see Auntie later,

642
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,039
I'll pretend not to know her at first.

643
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:21,759
Act surprised.

644
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,680
Then...

645
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,720
Then, then...

646
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,640
No more "then."

647
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,319
Just act surprised.

648
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,519
The rest, Yueyue and I will handle.

649
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:27,880
Okay.

650
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,440
Let's go.

651
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,759
Marriage is about living together.

652
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,119
It's not just playing house.

653
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,720
It's a lifetime commitment for two people.

654
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,400
He can't just mess around.

655
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:36,960
Right.

656
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,279
Mess... mess around?

657
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,559
No, I didn't mess around.

658
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,680
Auntie, you're absolutely right.

659
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,519
Love and marriage,

660
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,119
are very serious matters.

661
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,680
That's why I came here specially.

662
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,400
I just want to put your mind at ease.

663
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,519
Like this?

664
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,640
This is supposed to reassure me?

665
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,960
Auntie, what's wrong with the way I look?

666
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,160
These two are such a good match.

667
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,680
That lamb used the wrong dip.

668
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:07,839
Can it taste good?

669
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Can it really taste good?

670
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,400
Lamb.

671
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,119
Hasn't the food not even arrived yet?

672
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:16,960
Ayi Xia.

673
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:17,880
Nana.

674
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,279
Let's go.

675
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,400
We're not eating this meal.

676
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,960
Mom.

677
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
Didn't we agree already?

678
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,000
Agree on what?

679
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,200
Is this what you call "agreed"?

680
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:26,759
Well...

681
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,119
She's just quick-tempered.

682
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,960
Sit down, let's talk calmly.

683
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,640
Talk about what?

684
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,759
Don't be like this.

685
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,720
Mom.

686
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,519
The food will be served soon.

687
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,640
Can we eat first, please?

688
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:36,599
If you want to eat, go ahead.

689
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,359
I'm not eating.

690
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,200
Sorry, sorry.

691
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,200
Sorry for being late.

692
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,039
I'm late.

693
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:46,799
Young man.

694
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:47,920
Why are you here?

695
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,000
Auntie.

696
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,519
How come you...

697
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,240
Guangtian.

698
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,720
Watch what you say.

699
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,400
Yueyue's mom's temper is hard to handle.

700
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,000
Wait a second.

701
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,279
What did you just call him?

702
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,279
Guangtian.

703
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,400
Guangtian.

704
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,880
He's Li Guangtian.

705
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,559
No.

706
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,480
He's Li Guangtian.

707
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,519
Who is he?

708
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,440
This is Guangtian's boss, Director Wang.

709
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,880
Yes.

710
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,119
Darn it, darn it, darn it.

711
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:19,960
Um...

712
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,000
Director Wang...

713
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:21,920
Sorry.

714
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,759
Um...

715
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:23,200
Let's talk calmly.

716
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,680
No.

717
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Sorry, sorry.

718
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,799
That silly girl confused me completely.

719
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,799
Sorry about that.

720
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:28,319
Come, come.

721
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,519
Director, please have a seat.

722
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,519
I... I'll stay standing for now.

723
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,200
I'm a bit confused.

724
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,039
What's going on here?

725
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,839
Director Wang.

726
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,000
Auntie must have misunderstood earlier.

727
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,599
She thought you were me.

728
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,559
Yes, yes.

729
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,200
My kids are all grown up.

730
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,039
Um, um...

731
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,160
Sorry, Director.

732
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
It's all a big mix-up.

733
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,960
Please, sit down.

734
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,400
It's all because of that silly girl.

735
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,440
She didn't explain it clearly.

736
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,799
Come, come.

737
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,519
Sit down, sit down.

738
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,200
What a mess this is.

739
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:45,960
Old Mu.

740
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,720
I'm not blaming you for today.

741
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,119
But you really were wrong.

742
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,240
How could you compare your own child

743
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,720
to someone else's like that?

744
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,720
I've said this

745
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,200
more than once before.

746
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,279
Why was he so angry this time?

747
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,960
Kids,

748
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,839
they're young,

749
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
they all have pride.

750
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,719
If you compare them like that,

751
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,280
he

752
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,639
can't save face.

753
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,239
Right?

754
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,400
Besides,

755
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,760
he's been doing well lately.

756
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,480
Look at how he sliced those potatoes.

757
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,960
They're so even and thin.

758
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,000
Don't worry.

759
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,880
I'm keeping an eye on his knife skills.

760
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,400
I'll make sure he practices well.

761
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:31,599
Old Mu

762
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,559
The mushroom Mingliang sent back

763
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,159
Is it soaking now?

764
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,480
It's soaking in the kitchen.

765
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,239
Should I go get it?

766
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,400
Yes, yes, it's about time.

767
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,199
Okay, okay, let me check.

768
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,000
Hello?

769
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,719
I'm anxious too.

770
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,880
But don't rush me.

771
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,360
If you keep pushing,

772
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,159
you'll mess things up.

773
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,280
It won't help anyone.

774
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:00,960
I know.

775
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,360
And also,

776
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,119
don't call me directly anymore.

777
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,360
Wait for my update.

778
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,079
Come on, have a drink.

779
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,159
Sorry about that.

780
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,360
You're the one this afternoon

781
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
that Bayar kept praising, Guangtian.

782
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
She said if Huyue could find

783
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,440
a young man like you,

784
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,360
even if you work at the power station,

785
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,199
she'd accept it.

786
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,599
Right, Bayar?

787
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,559
Let me say a few words.

788
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,639
First,

789
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,360
I owe you an apology.

790
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,280
I've been calling you "aunt" all day,

791
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,400
so I'll call you "big sister" instead.

792
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,840
Alright.

793
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,320
I really need to honestly

794
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,480
introduce Guangtian to you.

795
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880
This young man,

796
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,320
he's a graduate from HIT.

797
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,119
He could've chosen anywhere.

798
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,440
You don't know,

799
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,360
several companies in the southeast

800
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,440
tried to recruit him.

801
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,239
They fought over him.

802
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,559
It was a real scramble.

803
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,599
But Guangtian

804
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,840
insisted on choosing our power station.

805
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,880
That shows this young man

806
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,159
has vision

807
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,280
and courage.

808
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,079
Director Wang

809
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,880
You're exaggerating.

810
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,599
Let me ask you,

811
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,119
last year, a new energy company in Shenzhen

812
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,119
tried to recruit you, right?

813
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,360
Four hundred thousand a year.

814
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,960
Why didn't you go?

815
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,519
See, Guangtian

816
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,639
insisted on choosing Xinjiang.

817
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,400
He chose to eat sand on the Gobi.

818
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,079
Big sister,

819
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,440
how many young people nowadays

820
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,239
can be like Guangtian,

821
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,800
willing to endure hardship?

822
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,480
Auntie,

823
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,760
for those of us studying new energy,

824
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,159
working here

825
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,000
and learning top international technology

826
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,519
is a real blessing.

827
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,559
You may not know,

828
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,800
we use

829
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,039
the most advanced tower-type solar thermal power generation technology.

830
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,039
Simply put,

831
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:53,840
we use

832
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,360
a distributed control system

833
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,920
with high-precision solar tracking algorithms

834
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,280
and dynamic multi-target coupling control strategies

835
00:36:59,360 --> 00:36:59,800
to achieve

836
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,679
the safe operation of 14,500 heliostats.

837
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:02,800
See, see,

838
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,800
this kid is so genuine.

839
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,320
You know,

840
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:06,719
once he talks about his field,

841
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,079
he just can't stop.

842
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,239
He goes on and on.

843
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,360
Old Hu was the same back then.

844
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,840
Talked endlessly about work.

845
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:17,800
Yueyue,

846
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,480
you really resemble your dad when he was young.

847
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,360
Mom,

848
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,280
do you think Bayar's mom is wavering?

849
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,000
Young man,

850
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,800
why do you insist on staying in Hami?

851
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,960
Actually,

852
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,519
I came here for my grandpa's wish.

853
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,639
I grew up with my grandpa.

854
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,039
He always told me

855
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,000
Hami is his second home.

856
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,960
He said

857
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,559
the sunset on the Gobi is like molten gold.

858
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,400
The poplar trees stand for a thousand years.

859
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,320
You can't see these in Shandong.

860
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,639
They're nowhere to be found.

861
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,480
My grandpa,

862
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,760
Your grandpa

863
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,599
was in the Corps?

864
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:06,480
Yes.

865
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,360
In recent years,

866
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,400
my grandpa's legs haven't been good.

867
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,000
Otherwise, he'd still be talking about

868
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,199
coming back to visit.

869
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,159
So when I heard

870
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,159
Hami was building a molten salt power station,

871
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,360
I didn't hesitate.

872
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
I sent in my resume.

873
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
When I arrived here,

874
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,760
I became just like my grandpa,

875
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,280
falling in love with this place.

876
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:29,800
Alright then.

877
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,880
Young man,

878
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,760
I understand your situation.

879
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,320
But

880
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,800
I have one more question.

881
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,480
Auntie, please ask.

882
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,480
Do you plan to spend your whole life

883
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,480
here on the Gobi?

884
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,960
Auntie,

885
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,199
I understand your concern.

886
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,119
But the Gobi

887
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,280
always needs someone here.

888
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,119
Big sister, this way, this way.

889
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:24,760
Director Wang

890
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,440
I'm really sorry this time.

891
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,760
No need to say that.

892
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,639
You didn't eat well?

893
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,400
Thank you, thank you.

894
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,880
Alright.

895
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,960
Careful, your foot's hurt.

896
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:31,679
Okay, okay.

897
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,679
Take care, walk slowly.

898
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,760
Did I mess things up?

899
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,519
If Bayar's mom doesn't agree now,

900
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,119
what will you do?

901
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,760
I don't know what to do either.

902
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,840
But I definitely won't give up on Yueyue.

903
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,800
If I could give up,

904
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,360
I would've done it four years ago.

905
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:02,679
Just wait.

906
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,000
Yueyue's worried about you for four years.

907
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,559
It's time you felt the same way.

908
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,360
Why did you change your mind again?

909
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,519
You took the initiative to help them.

910
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Well, you moved me.

911
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,960
I got impulsive without meaning to.

912
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,480
Seeing everyone worry about Yueyue today,

913
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,960
I suddenly felt

914
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,280
love isn't just between two people.

915
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,960
Looks like we've reached an agreement.

916
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,920
Sort of, I guess.

917
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,079
By the way—

918
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,480
You sent those morel mushrooms, right?

919
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:49,639
You're so busy with work,

920
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,599
yet you still think about the restaurant.

921
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,519
Thank you.

922
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,960
No need to thank me.

923
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,679
I've heard it too many times today.

924
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,960
I want to check out the area near the power station later.

925
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,519
I'll go with you.

926
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,840
Don't get impulsive this time.

927
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,760
Things here aren't sorted out yet.

928
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,599
We can't do this without you.

929
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,719
Do you—do you want something to drink?

930
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,159
I'll get it.

931
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,119
No need.

932
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,440
There's nothing I want to drink.

933
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,840
So what do you want?

934
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,480
I'll go buy it.

935
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,119
When I was in Jiangbulake,

936
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,880
I really wanted a Xuehua Liang.

937
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,480
But I left in a rush and missed it.

938
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:31,599
Maybe next time.

939
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,079
Gulinare
