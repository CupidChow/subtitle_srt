1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,919
Aisha Mom

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,599
The pretty pomegranate blossoms
were blown down by the wind.

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:08,960
What should we do?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,119
We can make Pomegranate Blossom Preserve.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Who can help me?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,800
Me! Me!

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,599
Let's see who picks up the most.

8
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,079
I picked up more than you.

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,960
I picked up more, I picked up more.

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,320
I picked up the most.

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,120
The petals can make sweet preserve.

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,079
Pomegranate trees are wonderful.

13
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,600
Dry the pomegranate peel and boil it.

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,200
It can even cure tummy aches.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,399
Mom

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,479
What can pomegranate leaves do?

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,880
They can treat my little rascal's wounds.

18
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,840
A few days' rest will do you good.

19
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,159
Wait until your body

20
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,680
is as rosy as a pomegranate blossom.

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,960
Then I'll fire up the stove again.

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,159
Murat

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,599
It's not just closing for a few days.

24
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,520
I've already contacted Xiao Liu.

25
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,280
What's wrong, Aisha?

26
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,919
What are you really planning?

27
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,960
Business hasn't been good these two years.

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,439
That's what I've been thinking.

29
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,400
Let's wait a bit longer.

30
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,759
I'll find you all good jobs first.

31
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,719
But you still found out about my illness.

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,680
Aisha, you underestimate me.

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
Everyone on this street knows

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,240
I'm one of the top chefs here.

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,919
Many restaurants are fighting to hire me.

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,120
All I have to do is nod.

37
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,199
Exactly.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,800
You think

39
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,360
I'm not the best rose in the front hall?

40
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,639
Let me tell you,

41
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,680
that four-star hotel up front

42
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,960
has asked me so many times to be their supervisor.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,919
I was this close to having that gold-trimmed

44
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,960
badge hanging around my neck.

45
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,719
I just didn't want to go.

46
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,319
I can't leave Hong Shiliu and Aisha.

47
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,080
Me too, Aisha Mom.

48
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,400
If my dad hadn't thought climbing was unreliable,

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,360
and made me learn to be a chef,

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,680
I'd already be a climbing blogger

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
with millions of followers.

52
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,639
Xiao Liu said

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,479
the transfer fee and first year's rent
can be two hundred thousand.

54
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,280
If you rent out the whole restaurant,

55
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,400
where will you live?

56
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,520
I'll move to the second floor,

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,199
Ming Liang's old studio.

58
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,759
When this place first opened,

59
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,199
you and Murat were here.

60
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,280
So this money should go to you.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,120
Ankar gets some too.

62
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,000
No way, no way.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,280
No, no, no.

64
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,280
About this,

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,159
my mom has already arranged it.

66
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,120
Don't refuse it anymore.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
If you don't take it,

68
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,960
she won't be at ease.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,479
What?

70
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,120
What's wrong?

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,680
Hong Shiliu is closing.

72
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,800
Aisha Mom

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,920
Let me do it, you rest.

74
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,399
You've been tired all day.

75
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,519
I've been sitting in the office all day.

76
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,399
I need to move around.

77
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,079
Okay.

78
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,800
What's wrong?

79
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,279
I think I saw Gulinare.

80
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,879
Mom

81
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,959
That's about enough.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
Let's finish the rest tomorrow.

83
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,120
Let's finish this first.

84
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,560
You always said being a chef
got in the way of your training.

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,399
That's why you didn't get your coach license.

86
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,720
No more excuses now, right?

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,879
Yeah.

88
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,120
I've finally become just an ordinary person.

89
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,079
Isn't it nice to be ordinary?

90
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,800
Of course.

91
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,800
Bro, you're here.

92
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,920
Let's do it together.

93
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,519
I'm not training today.

94
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,399
I came to ask you to take me to see

95
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,639
Murat Dad's new job.

96
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
Don't tell him I said anything.

97
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,279
Nice stir-fry, Old Mu.

98
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,720
Thank you, thank you.

99
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,399
This is my specialty dish.

100
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,680
You think you can use my stove
for your specialty?

101
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,040
No matter how good you are,

102
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,839
you still have to follow hotel rules.

103
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,279
Newcomers start with prepping ingredients.

104
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,439
We all started this way.

105
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,000
Hu Dad is on night shift again.

106
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,879
You don't have to whisper.

107
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,800
That's my mom.

108
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,000
Even if a thief came in and carried her off now,

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,839
she wouldn't notice.

110
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,439
How did she get so tired?

111
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,279
Isn't she a supervisor at the hotel?

112
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,199
You've already figured most of it out.

113
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,439
I won't hide it from you.

114
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,959
She's a cleaning supervisor at the hotel.

115
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,199
She has to work night shifts,

116
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,079
and do all the dirty, tiring jobs
others avoid.

117
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:04,759
What?

118
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,319
My dad and I both told her not to go.

119
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,160
We said we don't need her salary.

120
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,560
But she insists.

121
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,079
She says spending her own money
makes her happy.

122
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,079
Don't tell Aisha Mom.

123
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,639
Or I'll be totally doomed.

124
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,519
Gulinare

125
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,720
Just now I was tidying up.

126
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,879
My hands were full.

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,679
By the time I came out,
everyone had already left.

128
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,639
If I hadn't seen your adorable

129
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,840
wild animal bookmarks,

130
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,000
I almost couldn't guess
who gave them to me.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,559
A friend teaching at Xin Medical
recommended the book.

132
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,799
It explains how to care for
cancer patients.

133
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,440
What to eat, what to drink.

134
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,200
And how to help families
manage their emotions.

135
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,360
Thank you.

136
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,440
No need.

137
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,639
Have you eaten?

138
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,840
Come sit with my mom for a while.

139
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,039
Let me show you my skills.

140
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,080
Okay.

141
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,440
Let's go.

142
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,840
This is my signature dish.

143
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,559
I learned it from Murat's dad
for a long time.

144
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,559
Sit down, please.

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,240
I remember you don't eat scallions.

146
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,919
So I left them out.

147
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,919
Cilantro is on the side.

148
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,759
Add it yourself if you want.

149
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,480
Mom.

150
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,759
You two eat and chat.

151
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,960
I'll keep tidying up.

152
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,399
Let me finish the closure notice first.

153
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,039
Then post it up.

154
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,440
Look.

155
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,399
He's really thoughtful.

156
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,759
He knows what you can eat

157
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,759
and what you can't.

158
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,200
You taught him well.

159
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,440
When I was little, I came here
with my parents.

160
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
What we liked and disliked,

161
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,200
You remembered it all so clearly.

162
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,080
After Amir passed away,

163
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,080
his old comrades

164
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,879
often came to support my restaurant.

165
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,080
Your dad came most often.

166
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,519
Back then, you were always so busy.

167
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,360
Now you can finally slow down.

168
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,879
Let's go travel, then.

169
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,279
Let's start with Altay.

170
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,440
Let's just do it.

171
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll make a full Xinjiang
travel guide for you.

172
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,559
You'll have a great time.

173
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,919
Nana, how can I praise you enough?

174
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,320
You're so thoughtful.

175
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,279
I remember one year

176
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,799
Ming Liang kept asking for

177
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,559
a box of thirty-six colored crayons.

178
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,000
I didn't get around to buying it.

179
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,759
You were so little then,

180
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,360
but you ran upstairs yourself

181
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,519
carrying a big box

182
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,879
with thirty-six colored crayons inside.

183
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,919
Ming Liang loved it.

184
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,519
He talked about it every day.

185
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,519
Nana gave me these crayons.

186
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,000
Nana gave me these crayons.

187
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,039
Time really flies.

188
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,360
Look.

189
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,399
Isn't this the crayon drawing
you gave me?

190
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,519
Isn't that you on the far right?

191
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,519
I don't really remember
giving Ming Liang crayons.

192
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,399
But I do remember

193
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,279
when my mom was sick as a child,

194
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,759
he painted me a Crane of Courage
watercolor.

195
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,600
Then he left.

196
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,759
Didn't want Aisha to get too tired.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
This doesn't look like a closure notice.

198
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,600
Looks more like an opening.

199
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,519
I wrote a version before,

200
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,039
very formal, in black print.

201
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,519
It was too dull.

202
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,360
Doesn't match Hong Shiliu's spirit.

203
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,879
It's been thirty years.

204
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,159
Every bit is everyone's hard work.

205
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,639
Even if we have to close,

206
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
I want to do it with style.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,600
Yes.

208
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,879
Thinking of the restaurant
brings back wonderful memories.

209
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,600
Everyone here

210
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,759
did homework, ate, and played together.

211
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,000
We thought it could stay
beautiful forever.

212
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,120
But when you look back,

213
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,360
you realize many precious things

214
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
slowly slip away with time.

215
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,799
You can't hold on, even if you try.

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,759
I won't chase it anymore.

217
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,519
I'll just draw a new one.

218
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,559
What if fate

219
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
doesn't want Hong Shiliu to close?

220
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,159
Gulinare

221
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,360
Tell me,

222
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,639
what if I take over the restaurant?

223
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,519
I've traveled all over
these past years.

224
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,600
But home still feels best.

225
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,320
It's nice here.

226
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,440
But young people should focus
on their careers.

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,120
If you're tired, come back and rest.

228
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,279
Go out again when you're ready.

229
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,279
Actually, I think Urumqi

230
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,919
has developed quite well
these years.

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,600
The admission results are out.

232
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,000
Mom.

233
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,600
Let's sit and rest for a bit.

234
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,519
Are you worried I don't want to go?

235
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,399
My application was rejected by the mentor.

236
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,399
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

237
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,159
That's why I never told you.

238
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,159
How could you think of your mom like that?

239
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,399
If it doesn't work, try again.

240
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,159
The mentor said I'm not ready yet.

241
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,200
Let's just keep learning and observing.

242
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,480
These past few days,

243
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,000
I've reached out to some friends.

244
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,360
They also recommended someone to me.

245
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,879
A local agent.

246
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,000
He seems quite interested in my work.

247
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,240
I plan to meet him first.

248
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,840
If I can sign a contract,

249
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,639
I could become a freelance artist.

250
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,399
Don't worry about money.

251
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,600
On the path of being an artist,

252
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,279
Even if Mom isn't capable,

253
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,399
I'll still support you.

254
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,840
You've already given me so much, Mom.

255
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,720
I'm back.

256
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,840
Ming Liang is here.

257
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,759
Uncle Adili.

258
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,759
Hello, Ming Liang.

259
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,360
Adili wants to take over our restaurant.

260
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:48,879
Yes.

261
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,240
Xiao Liu.

262
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,360
I haven't missed any introductions, right?

263
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,440
No, no, no.

264
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,080
We've been neighbors for decades.

265
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,440
Hong Shiliu Restaurant.

266
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,559
I know it very well.

267
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,279
Aisha's character—

268
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,360
is absolutely trustworthy.

269
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,399
My heart,

270
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,120
I keep it all inside.

271
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,759
It's just...

272
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,000
What's wrong?

273
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,759
Look,

274
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,000
this pomegranate tree—

275
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,399
can we move it somewhere else?

276
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,519
I was thinking,

277
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,080
to connect the restaurant

278
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,639
with the backyard.

279
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,639
Then,

280
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,399
we could set up many tables here.

281
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,639
You know,

282
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,399
these past few years,

283
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,039
the restaurant business is tough.

284
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,600
If I had another way,

285
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,759
I wouldn't ask for this, right?

286
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,000
Uncle Adili,

287
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,039
let's discuss the transfer again.

288
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,559
Sorry about that.

289
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,519
Alright.

290
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,240
You can talk it over again.

291
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,279
We'll head out now.

292
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,120
Let's go.

293
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,919
Take care.

294
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,400
Mom.

295
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,480
This pomegranate tree sapling

296
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,039
was brought by Dad's comrade

297
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,720
all the way from Shandong.

298
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,519
You and Dad planted it together.

299
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,359
Here.

300
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,279
Let's give some to Bayar's mom

301
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,759
and Murat's dad to try.

302
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,559
Okay.

303
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,880
Mom, Mom, let's go.

304
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,640
Mom.

305
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,519
Should we wait for other offers?

306
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,400
Enough, let's not talk about it.

307
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,759
In business,

308
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,279
everyone wants to earn as much as possible.

309
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,559
I'll call Nana's dad.

310
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,559
Move the tree to the cemetery.

311
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,559
It can keep Amir company.

312
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,279
Why are you closing down?

313
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,680
As soon as I heard the news,

314
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,279
I rushed over after unloading.

315
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:39,759
Mom.

316
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,160
This is your Uncle Zhao.

317
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,000
He drives for the China-Europe freight train.

318
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,079
Hello, Uncle Zhao.

319
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,839
I'm Ming Liang.

320
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,680
Hello, hello, hello.

321
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,680
Please, have a seat.

322
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,920
Murat's dad often mentions you.

323
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,920
He says you're the best driver in Xinjiang.

324
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,720
You often travel to Khorgos.

325
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,799
Every time you return to Urumqi,

326
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,079
the dish you crave most is

327
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,680
Mom's Signature Pilaf.

328
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,119
It's been fourteen years.

329
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,200
I've gotten used to it.

330
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,319
If I miss it...

331
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Have some tea first.

332
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,039
And some dried fruit.

333
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,519
The pilaf will be ready soon.

334
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,759
Big sister.

335
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,000
Aren't you closed?

336
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,920
Open or not,

337
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
if you want to eat,

338
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,519
come anytime, I'll cook for you.

339
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,839
You look like a true artist.

340
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,720
You'll definitely get the contract.

341
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,079
Stay calm.

342
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,559
Don't feel pressured.

343
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,160
Mom.

344
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,440
Let's go.

345
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,519
Go ahead.

346
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,480
Hello?

347
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,920
Hello?

348
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,599
Engineer Li.

349
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,599
Is this Hong Shiliu Restaurant?

350
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,000
This is Aisha.

351
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,000
Can you come move the tree this evening?

352
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:42,559
Hello?

353
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,319
Can you hear me?

354
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,000
Is tomorrow okay?

355
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,039
I'm busy today.

356
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,079
Boss.

357
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,680
We're also rushing to meet our deadline.

358
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,000
Tomorrow has its own tasks.

359
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,480
As long as someone is at your restaurant.

360
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,400
You come tomorrow.

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
You've already scheduled with them.

362
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,559
It's not good to be late.

363
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,559
You go ahead.

364
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,880
Mom.

365
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,759
Don't worry.

366
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,839
Stop worrying.

367
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,759
Go on.

368
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,519
Hello?

369
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,319
Hello?

370
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,200
Boss, are you listening?

371
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:13,720
Hello?

372
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,000
Engineer Li.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,880
I'm here.

374
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:17,880
Come on.

375
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,920
By the way,

376
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,000
it's a thirty-year-old tree.

377
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,319
Bring a few more helpers.

378
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,799
Boss, don't worry.

379
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,279
A thirty-year-old tree.

380
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,720
It should be fine, Mr. Ming Liang.

381
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,319
This is Suoguang.

382
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,480
The best offer so far
for a new artist.

383
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,839
It's the best terms
we've ever offered.

384
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,759
I think this clause means

385
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,000
my works

386
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,759
will all belong to you.

387
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,519
That's right.

388
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,920
If Professor Dario approves you,

389
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,559
I see great potential in you

390
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,240
and want to help you become

391
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,440
the most famous young artist
in Xinjiang.

392
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,240
Perfect timing.

393
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,680
Pour a drink for our great artist.

394
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,920
But back to the point,

395
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,039
if you really go abroad,

396
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,559
the price—

397
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,039
I can offer even more.

398
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,680
Thank you.

399
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,160
I don't get you.

400
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,960
Why would you pass up
such a great chance?

401
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,680
You know,

402
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,799
you just—

403
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,000
Sorry, sir.

404
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,319
Sorry.

405
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:32,680
How come you—

406
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,640
You can't even pour a drink?

407
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,440
Get your Pete over here.

408
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,440
Sorry, sir.

409
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,039
Go.

410
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,920
Just now, I—

411
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,880
You go out first.

412
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,480
I'll handle this.

413
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:45,440
Honestly...

414
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,920
How about I take over
the restaurant?

415
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,759
I can't sign this contract.

416
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,759
What do you mean?

417
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,000
Why not?

418
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,359
Do you think there's
something wrong with it?

419
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,440
The contract is fine.

420
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,960
But I just realized
a few things.

421
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,400
My mother

422
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,240
with my uncle and aunt

423
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,480
ran a small restaurant together.

424
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,519
They cooked,

425
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:31,880
handled the cash,

426
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,079
and served tea and water.

427
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
Everyone who works hard
for their life

428
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
deserves respect.

429
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,759
Not to be insulted
by arrogance and rudeness.

430
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,000
My number is on there.

431
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,799
If your phone really has an issue,

432
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,279
I'll compensate you.

433
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,039
Master.

434
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,759
These are trees
over thirty years old.

435
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,519
Be extra careful
when you work.

436
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,160
Sure, don't worry.

437
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,000
Go easy.

438
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,599
Master, are we moving?

439
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,319
Are we moving?

440
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:57,680
Be careful.

441
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,440
Don't break the roots.

442
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,279
Okay, okay.

443
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,519
Everyone, be careful.

444
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,559
Okay.

445
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,680
One root got cut.

446
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,039
Is it okay?

447
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,279
I told you to be careful,
be careful!

448
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,519
Pay attention, everyone.

449
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,039
That's a thirty-year-old tree.

450
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,039
Okay, okay.

451
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,079
Come on, get ready.

452
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,960
Lift.

453
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,079
Wait.

454
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,200
Wait.

455
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,279
We're not moving the tree.

456
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,279
The restaurant won't close.

457
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,000
From now on, I'll run
this restaurant.

458
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,160
You have to do
what you should do.

459
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:40,720
Mom.

460
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,759
I think what I'm doing now

461
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,160
is exactly what I should do.

462
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:50,119
You never really wanted
to run a restaurant.

463
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,480
You've worked so hard
for your art for years.

464
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,359
If you don't keep going,

465
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,279
won't you regret it?

466
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,720
After I take over the restaurant,

467
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
I'll still keep painting.

468
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,759
Calm down first.

469
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,799
Or you'll regret it.

470
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,839
I don't understand art.

471
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,960
You don't understand
running a restaurant.

472
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,079
Look.

473
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,480
You drew this
when you were six.

474
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,240
It was pouring rain that day.

475
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,799
I didn't want you
to go to class.

476
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,680
But you told me,

477
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,720
Mom,

478
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,039
I don't want to miss class.

479
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,119
We braved the heavy rain

480
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,960
and made it to art class on time.

481
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,319
And this one—

482
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,839
You drew it at ten.

483
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,279
There was a boy
three years older than you.

484
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,519
He always bothered you
while you painted.

485
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,200
You got so mad,
you fought him.

486
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,039
Ended up with a bruised face.

487
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,759
And this one—

488
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,359
You painted this at fifteen.

489
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,960
You even won a big prize
in the region.

490
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
You finally made it out.

491
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Why come back
to work in the kitchen?

492
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:58,400
Mom.

493
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,680
If I don't take over
Hong Shiliu now,

494
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,240
I'll regret it forever.

495
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,039
Murat's father—

496
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,720
he loves cooking so much.

497
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,519
But now he's forced

498
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,400
to chop and wash vegetables.

499
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,920
Bayar's mother—

500
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,200
she's cleaning for others.

501
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:28,720
Ankar—

502
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,279
without the restaurant,

503
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,799
he's lost his drive
for climbing.

504
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,440
And you—

505
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,960
I saw you alone

506
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,599
facing the empty restaurant.

507
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,519
That lost silhouette—

508
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,920
it hurt me like needles.

509
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,319
Enough, let's stop talking.

510
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,440
It's settled.

511
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,119
But Mom,

512
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,400
my heart feels like
it's filled with something.

513
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,440
It's completely full.

514
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,279
It's this pain,

515
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,119
these real people and stories—

516
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,720
they're the root of my art.

517
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,680
They're the soul of my painting.

518
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
When I see you all well,

519
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
I can create art
with real life in it.

520
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,480
So, Mom,

521
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,000
taking over Hong Shiliu

522
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,240
isn't just for you,

523
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,519
it's for everyone.

524
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,079
It's also for myself.

525
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,759
When I was little,
you always protected me.

526
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,240
Now it's my turn
to step forward.

527
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,920
Come on, come on, come on.

528
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,759
Everyone, gather around.

529
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,960
Bring the chairs over here.

530
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,880
Today is a new beginning.

531
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,519
Son, take a photo of us.

532
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,079
We'll paint a new family portrait later.

533
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,000
Okay, Mom.

534
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,680
Brother needs you now.

535
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,000
Coming, bro.

536
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,880
Murat, Dad.

537
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,759
Hong Shiliu is reopening.

538
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,119
We still need an experienced chef.

539
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,640
Would you like to come back?

540
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,240
Bayar, Mom.

541
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,559
Let's go home.

542
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,400
You'd better draw it exactly the same.

543
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,079
Then I can make a transition video.

544
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:18,920
Wait.

545
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,319
No need to make it identical, right?

546
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,599
I was little back then.

547
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,960
I was sitting on Dad's lap.

548
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,599
You can sit on your dad's lap now.

549
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,000
I don't want to.

550
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,160
You think I want to hold you?

551
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,920
It's great to have the whole family together.

552
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,000
Come on, turn a bit this way.

553
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Come.

554
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,920
Is that okay?

555
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:37,680
Good.

556
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,920
Ready.

557
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,519
Quick, quick, quick!

558
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,839
For our restaurant to grow better,

559
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,480
I think we shouldn't rush to open.

560
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,119
Let's review the issues first.

561
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,279
Solving problems makes things easier.

562
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,920
So, does anyone have ideas today?

563
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,680
Feel free to share.

564
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:17,799
Let me go first, then.

565
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,200
Okay.

566
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,839
Today's customers—

567
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,480
Young people like certain restaurants.

568
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:23,799
When they go out to eat,

569
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,039
it's not just about the food.

570
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,160
What are they after?

571
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,079
They're after the atmosphere.

572
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,920
That vibe.

573
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,839
They like to check in, get inspired.

574
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,279
Pretty tablecloths—

575
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,920
Ming Liang painted them all.

576
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,880
Ming Liang painted these?

577
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,039
Why isn't our restaurant making money?

578
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,759
It's because the dishes are old, not special.

579
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,759
This brat could drive all the customers away.

580
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,000
The classic dishes can't be changed.

581
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,759
That's Hong Shiliu's foundation.

582
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,720
But we need new dishes too.

583
00:33:58,759 --> 00:33:59,640
Ankar will handle it.

584
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:00,200
Alright.

585
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,559
That's great.

586
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,599
Even good wine needs promotion.

587
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,360
We still need marketing and exposure.

588
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,599
I know.

589
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Online promotion, attracting customers—

590
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,800
It's expensive.

591
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,199
So I thought of a way to promote

592
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,159
and boost sales at the same time.

593
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,840
Start delivery service.

594
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,840
Ankar.

595
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,280
Move this light a bit forward.

596
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,519
Check it.

597
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,679
Our goal this month

598
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,039
is to avoid any losses.

599
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,000
Ming Liang, bro.

600
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,599
You're way too cautious.

601
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,639
Easy for you to say.

602
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,440
At the start,

603
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,159
we can't take big steps.

604
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,320
Let's open soon!

605
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,320
I believe our restaurant will be a hit.

606
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,039
Ming Liang.

607
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,519
Is this machine broken?

608
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,199
Why isn't it responding at all?

609
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,360
It can't be broken.

610
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,920
I've tested it several times.

611
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,079
See, the paper comes out.

612
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,840
I've tried everything.

613
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,199
No one's ordering.

614
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,360
Look now—

615
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,800
It's mealtime.

616
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,800
Our restaurant's customers

617
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,159
are still the regulars.

618
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,599
Not a single new customer.

619
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,760
New machines need time to adjust.

620
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,519
New customers need luck too.

621
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,000
Look at this pomegranate tree—

622
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,760
doesn't it bloom and bear fruit slowly?

623
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,920
Don't rush.

624
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,360
You have a new delivery order.

625
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,679
Please handle it promptly.

626
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,760
Coming.

627
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,719
Coming, coming!

628
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,559
Who's here?

629
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,599
One Signature Pilaf.

630
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,679
One cold noodles.

631
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,480
Alright.

632
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,280
Let's go, let's go!

633
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,280
It's mealtime again.

634
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,679
We've even finished cleaning up.

635
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,000
Usually, when we go pick up a package,

636
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,320
it takes fifteen minutes by car.

637
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,800
Where nearby can we even find

638
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,039
a restaurant that delivers food?

639
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,000
Good food is worth the wait.

640
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,480
Here it comes, here it comes.

641
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,760
Come on, come on, hurry up!

642
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,360
First day our own restaurant does delivery.

643
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,079
Too bad we missed the first order.

644
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,760
I have to say, the packaging is fancy.

645
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,000
Of course it is.

646
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,760
Wait a second.

647
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,800
Your delivery fee is so expensive.

648
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,039
It's enough for a whole meal.

649
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,559
Impressive.

650
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:10,800
Signature Pilaf.

651
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:11,880
Hey, slow down.

652
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,800
No one's taking it from you.

653
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,480
Here.

654
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,239
Workaholic, never eats properly.

655
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:17,840
Is that so?

656
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,960
There are side dishes too.

657
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,280
That one's tasty as well.

658
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:22,960
Alright, alright.

659
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,400
Very soon, almost ready.

660
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,039
Boss, is order nine ready?

661
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:25,760
It's almost overdue.

662
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,639
Coming, coming.

663
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,719
Waiter!

664
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,480
When will my spicy chicken be served?

665
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,199
I'll go ask.

666
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,960
I've waited so long my eyes are popping out.

667
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,039
Please wait, just a moment.

668
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:33,840
Within five minutes.

669
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
As soon as possible, please.

670
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,119
Thanks for understanding, goodbye.

671
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,679
Ming Liang, now the delivery orders

672
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,079
and dine-in orders are all mixed up.

673
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,119
Which should we do first?

674
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,639
Is order nine ready?

675
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,920
Is order nine ready?

676
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:43,920
Almost done.

677
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,280
Do the overdue orders first.

678
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,880
Okay.

679
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,280
Ankar.

680
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,760
After you finish chopping,

681
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,480
make three Signature Pilafs.

682
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,280
Coming right up.

683
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,920
Alright, alright.

684
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,079
Here it comes.

685
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,159
Sorry about that.

686
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,320
Your spicy chicken is still cooking.

687
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,599
We prepared a free

688
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,559
deluxe Signature Pilaf for you.

689
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,599
Lamb leg, dried apricots, raisins—it's all in there.

690
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,280
Kid,

691
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:11,599
you must be tired from deliveries.

692
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,159
Have some milk tea.

693
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,960
Warm up your stomach.

694
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,679
The money deducted for overtime,

695
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,239
we'll cover it for you.

696
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:17,880
Thank you, Auntie.

697
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,199
Judging by this,

698
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,639
you just started delivery, right?

699
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,440
First day.

700
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,559
When I first started delivering,

701
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,119
I was just as flustered.

702
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,079
It gets better with time.

703
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,039
Alright.

704
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:26,639
Okay.

705
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,880
When I was little, an elder once told me

706
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,679
the Crane of Courage is a brave spirit of the plateau.

707
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,239
Every year, they endure the toughest migration.

708
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,119
They fly over the Tianshan Mountains,

709
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,960
across the Sea of Death, the Taklamakan Desert,

710
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,800
and over the Kunlun Mountains.

711
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,679
Ming Liang,

712
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,320
stay here with Gulinare.

713
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,239
I'll go find the doctor

714
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,760
and ask about Gulinare's mom.

715
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,559
Okay.

716
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:03,119
Good kid.

717
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,480
The Crane of Courage can overcome any hardship.

718
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,599
Gulinare's mom

719
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,800
can overcome any hardship too.

720
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,079
How has Aisha been these days?

721
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,559
The restaurant reopened.

722
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,679
Mom's mood is much better.

723
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,039
Thanks for caring.

724
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,360
It's what I should do.

725
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,320
When my mom passed away,

726
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,239
you all were there for me.

727
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,960
We can all overcome any hardship.

728
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,679
Hey, Yueyue.

729
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,440
Gulinare.

730
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,360
I've finished the Crane of Courage section.

731
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,119
Let me know if anything needs fixing.

732
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,679
You haven't rested yet.

733
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,719
Go get some rest.

734
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,639
I'll take a look now.

735
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,880
Let's talk tomorrow during the day.

736
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:30,719
Alright.

737
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,920
Mwah, beautiful Gulinare.

738
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,079
Mwah.

739
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,880
In a few days, Gulinare

740
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,320
will give a speech about protecting the Crane of Courage.

741
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,760
I've made several versions of the slides.

742
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,559
We still feel something's missing.

743
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,440
Can you give some advice,

744
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,480
or

745
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,440
should I do it?

746
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,559
So straightforward!

747
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,960
Are you

748
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,000
helping me,

749
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,199
or helping Gulinare?

750
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,920
Stop joking around.

751
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,559
Send the materials over quickly.

752
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,440
These requirements are pretty high.

753
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,639
Low standards would be an insult to you.

754
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,760
I'll send them to you.

755
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,280
What's wrong?

756
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,880
It's not what you wanted?

757
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,320
This

758
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,960
This is way better than I expected.

759
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,239
Surprised? Didn't see that coming, right?

760
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,639
The colors, the composition—

761
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:52,800
And the way the text fits in.

762
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:53,760
Pretty good, huh?

763
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,039
Did you spend money on this?

764
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,599
Do I look like someone who pays to fix things?

765
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,679
Just think about it.

766
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,960
Someone around me can make presentations,

767
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:05,119
has taste and an art background,

768
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,199
and looks—

769
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,039
Most importantly, it's free.

770
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,400
Guess who it is.

771
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,679
Ming Liang.

772
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,400
That's right.

773
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,360
It's him.

774
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,599
He's super enthusiastic.

775
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,800
I hadn't even finished talking,

776
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
and he agreed to help us right away.

777
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,599
Okay, I get it.

778
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,559
He's the best.

779
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,119
Look how happy you are.

780
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,400
It's almost time for the speech, right?

781
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,559
Stop staring, let's go.

782
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:30,840
It's three o'clock.

783
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,159
I really need to hurry.

784
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,440
Hello, everyone.

785
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,920
I'm Sister Gulinare.

786
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,199
What I do is—

787
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,119
I work in wildlife conservation.

788
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,800
I work in wildlife conservation

789
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,239
because when I was little,

790
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:47,679
I rescued an injured Crane of Courage.

791
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,960
That's how I learned the story of the Crane of Courage.

792
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:51,960
So, what's the story of the Crane of Courage?

793
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,119
Ming Liang.

794
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:55,280
You're here.

795
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,880
Ming Liang.

796
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,679
We're almost out of potatoes and yellow carrots.

797
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,440
Are we running low on onions too?

798
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,239
Yeah, get some onions as well.

799
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,559
And some red and green peppers.

800
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,639
Also, grab some mushrooms.

801
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,199
Okay.

802
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:12,519
It's our first time doing takeout.

803
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,880
So I'm a bit—

804
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,920
The market is really close.

805
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,760
I'll be back soon.

806
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,679
You guys handle other stuff first.

807
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:20,800
Sorry, sorry.

808
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,960
Slow down, watch your step.

809
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,559
Okay, okay.

810
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:23,239
Boss.

811
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,920
Is order eighty-nine ready yet?

812
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,679
It's done, it's done.

813
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:26,159
Here you go.

814
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,440
Look, this is—

815
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,920
our farewell moment with the Crane of Courage.

816
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,280
It's still hard to let go, isn't it?

817
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,800
After all, we've been with them

818
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,039
for such a long time.
