(Brewing Love)

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,039
(This is a work of fiction.)

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,078
(Scenes with child actors and animals were filmed...)

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,079
(under production guidelines along with experts.)

14
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:46,590
- What are you doing? - Are you all right?

15
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,460
Yes, I'm fine.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,590
You're not fine.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,630
You're...

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,929
not fine.

19
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:05,969
Excuse me.

20
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,010
Do explain.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,709
Sorry.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,510
Your mood's a bit...

23
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,219
What about my mood?

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,489
Never mind. I apologize.

25
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:24,430
Why do I always go so far?

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,239
Thank you, sniper lady.

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,239
I'm not a sniper.

28
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:39,039
Then what are you?

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,480
Someone who sells alcohol.

30
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:44,849
Happy birthday.

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,649
Thanks to you, I got to...

32
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,650
Well...

33
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,689
I...

34
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,689
I should go on my way.

35
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:57,489
Bye.

36
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,589
Bye, sniper lady.

37
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,829
Bye.

38
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,309
Hey.

39
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,310
(Episode 2)

40
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:23,780
The sniper lady... Didn't she say your name?

41
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,989
I'm pretty sure she said "Yoon Min Ju."

42
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,020
Did she?

43
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,030
That's not important.

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,289
I thought...

45
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,930
she looked really sad.

46
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,669
- Something must be wrong. - What?

47
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,669
I couldn't tell.

48
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,938
What? Are you worried about her?

49
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:43,840
What are you saying? Why would I be?

50
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,168
I feel whatever other people feel,

51
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,779
so this is an everyday thing.

52
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,649
You know what I'm saying, don't you?

53
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,909
I didn't say anything.

54
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,080
Why are you making such a fuss?

55
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,120
Where does a six-year-old learn to say that?

56
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,289
You usually turn a blind eye and pretend you don't notice.

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,189
You pretend not to feel anything when you do...

58
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,860
and don't get involved.

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,930
Why did you approach the sniper lady?

60
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,900
I don't know either.

61
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,668
When did you get so sharp?

62
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,039
Roundabout when I turned four?

63
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,069
Granny.

64
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,600
Why are you sleeping out here?

65
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,609
Did you have dinner?

66
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,610
I did. It's late.

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,310
Let's go to bed.

68
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,610
- Oh, dear. - Let's sit up.

69
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,220
One, two. Here we go.

70
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,389
What?

71
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,089
Is something wrong?

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,100
My branch is out of business.

73
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:58,910
Don't worry.

74
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,979
There will be a solution.

75
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,139
And I'll find it.

76
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,009
- Do you believe in me? - I do.

77
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,019
Let's go to bed.

78
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,990
Let's go to your bedroom. One, two.

79
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,990
There we go.

80
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,758
- Sleep well. - Go to bed.

81
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,569
I will. Shall I turn this off?

82
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,730
Yes.

83
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,240
I love you.

84
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:45,420
Are you all right?

85
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,889
You're not fine.

86
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,259
You're...

87
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,329
not fine.

88
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,129
He spoke as if he knew.

89
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,799
Get a grip, Chae Yong Ju.

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,339
Who cares how you feel?

91
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,709
My gosh.

92
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,610
Should I see a doctor?

93
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:15,350
No. Let's handle the urgent stuff first.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,568
(Jisang Liquor)

95
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,938
- Are we really out of business? - What happens now?

96
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,669
I just joined the team.

97
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,910
What do I do?

98
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,079
Let me go inside.

99
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,050
Yong Ju. He's the Director of Marketing at the head office.

100
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,389
Hello.

101
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,560
He has an offer for you.

102
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:01,600
(Branch Manager Nam Yong Cheol)

103
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,500
Join our Marketing Team.

104
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,199
I can't.

105
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,639
What? You refuse?

106
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,279
You don't want to keep this branch open?

107
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,910
Is there a way to do that?

108
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
(Naro Beer)

109
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,850
Win over...

110
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,719
brewery master Yoon Min Ju.

111
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,458
And create a new product.

112
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,829
Impress the chairman and this place will come right back to life.

113
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:36,660
Everyone says you're the best at finding people.

114
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,300
We'll provide everything you need.

115
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:41,670
What do you say? Can you do it?

116
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,610
What is he saying?

117
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,610
What?

118
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:51,579
I'll do it.

119
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,180
I swear to get Yoon Min Ju.

120
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,959
(Brewing Love)

121
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,560
(I give my life to be Jisang's best!)

122
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,379
Ms. Chae.

123
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,220
You won't visit the wholesalers and store owners?

124
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,519
They'll be upset to hear you went to Seoul...

125
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,259
without saying goodbye.

126
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,889
I won't be able to leave if I say goodbye.

127
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:42,629
It's best to keep farewells short.

128
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,378
You punk.

129
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:56,210
Chairman.

130
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,850
Hello, everyone.

131
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,049
So you're really leaving?

132
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,659
You heard already?

133
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,759
Look after yourself.

134
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,629
You must.

135
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:18,929
I will.

136
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,039
Eat well and on time.

137
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,798
You're too thin.

138
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,269
Who, me? I'm not.

139
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,879
If you're in any trouble,

140
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,309
call me.

141
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,549
I'll be right there.

142
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,220
Yes, sir.

143
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,019
Goodbye.

144
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Bye.

145
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:01,980
It's my first day.

146
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,879
What's most important on the first day?

147
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,350
The team dinner.

148
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,049
What do we eat?

149
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,350
Meat!

150
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
Darn, I'm hungry.

151
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,259
What's all this?

152
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:27,099
Why would you go through all this trouble?

153
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,139
Take a seat.

154
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:32,009
It's your first day at a new job. Don't forget your breakfast.

155
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,909
Don't let them intimidate you.

156
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,210
It's not like this is my first job ever.

157
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,779
You burned them all.

158
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,950
What if you get robbed with your eyes wide open?

159
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,049
You may have been born and raised in Seoul,

160
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,619
but your base was in a provincial city...

161
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,490
as well as your place of work.

162
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,389
Grandma, would I let anyone live after robbing me?

163
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,528
I'd either pluck the thief's arm or leg.

164
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,059
You and your choice of words.

165
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:02,899
I'll be late.

166
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,110
At least finish your meal.

167
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,809
You practically drank the rice down.

168
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,179
Don't be intimidated.

169
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,220
I'm Mad Dog Yong Ju.

170
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:21,019
As if that's something to be proud of.

171
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,689
A new caregiver will come by starting today.

172
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,330
Eat the meal she serves on time.

173
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,029
- Got it? - Fine.

174
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,469
If your head hurts when you're alone,

175
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,870
call for an ambulance right away.

176
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,069
It'll be faster to call paramedics than me.

177
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,039
- Got it? - Just get going.

178
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,178
You know you have to open your phone and press one.

179
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,210
Why you...

180
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,480
All right. I'll get going. I love you!

181
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,690
(Jisang Liquor)

182
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,179
Yong Ju.

183
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,949
Look at you, Mr. Kang.

184
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,519
You look different now that you're in Seoul.

185
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,590
Don't I look neat?

186
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,829
Why didn't you stay back in Busan?

187
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,990
You know the hardships ahead.

188
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,029
Of course I should be here too.

189
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,500
We're a 2-for-1 deal.

190
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:39,169
I go where you go.

191
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,340
Thanks, Beom. Let's go.

192
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,669
Being called by my name took me by surprise.

193
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,649
(Jisang Liquor)

194
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Sweet!

195
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,288
This is the new zero-sugar edition.

196
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,759
Please tell us what you think.

197
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,799
Are these all for free?

198
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,340
(Jisang Liquor)

199
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,240
(Sparkling liquor, Beer)

200
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,580
How can drinking beer be a job?

201
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,190
What are you staring at?

202
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,019
Hello, sir.

203
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,889
It was a long commute, wasn't it?

204
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,529
Follow me.

205
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,699
From what I hear,

206
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,768
we hit a roadblock...

207
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,769
because Yoon Min Ju won't talk to us.

208
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,809
He turns down meetings once he hears it's us.

209
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,879
You'll need to figure out a way to get through to him.

210
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,009
Yes, sir. We'll come up with a strategy.

211
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,149
Unbelievable.

212
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,419
The Planning Team went to see him today as well.

213
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,418
Do so yourselves by the end of this week.

214
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,090
Report to me once you have a date and time.

215
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,889
Yes, sir. We'll go to him right away.

216
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:12,758
- What? - Right now?

217
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,389
- Right now? - Yes, right now.

218
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
At this very moment.

219
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,610
- One, two. - What the...

220
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,080
One, two.

221
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,049
This is your village chief.

222
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,789
This afternoon,

223
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,830
I propose we gather to discuss...

224
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,899
the One and Only Hop Beer Festival...

225
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,629
which is our village's largest event.

226
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,330
Come if you can.

227
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,269
It's always the same people who plan the event,

228
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,279
so be present at the meeting if you're not drowning in work.

229
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,379
Can't one get some sleep around here?

230
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,850
Since when has anyone been serious about planning it?

231
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,490
Is there something else at play?

232
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:20,690
Something's fishy.

233
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,740
Darn, that hurts.

234
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:31,439
(Village Chief)

235
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,009
It can't be helped if you're too busy,

236
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,579
but there are some people who choose not to participate...

237
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,750
despite having a lot of time to spare.

238
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,990
I won't name names.

239
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,019
I doubt he's talking about me.

240
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:51,460
I'm not talking about the young man who brews beer.

241
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:53,190
All right.

242
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:56,360
Enjoy your lunch, and I'll see you later.

243
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,668
Why... Why me?

244
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:01,939
- Being around a lot of people... - All right, then.

245
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,298
drains my energy.

246
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:06,370
That will be all.

247
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:10,940
Ah Reum.

248
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,049
If Yoon Min Ju doesn't meet us today, we'll quit.

249
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,250
My thought exactly.

250
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,549
There's so much rejection we can take.

251
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:21,319
We should at least try today...

252
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,919
and give up if we can't succeed.

253
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,029
(It's a match!)

254
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,428
(Lee Sang Jin, 31)

255
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:30,929
Hold on. You're still going on weekly blind dates.

256
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:32,429
Do you still mean it?

257
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,199
Will you quit your job after marrying?

258
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,799
Yes, and that'll happen in one year.

259
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,839
You're a true J personality. You have everything mapped out.

260
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,908
(Lee Sang Jin, 31)

261
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:42,340
You can retire early if you want to,

262
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,009
so why keep at this job?

263
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,250
To get a higher grade.

264
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,819
Being on the Planning Team of a major company...

265
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,250
will grant me a better grade with matchmaking services.

266
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,549
I must maintain a high grade to marry a man of that level.

267
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,259
Why are you this desperate to marry?

268
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,360
I don't get it at all.

269
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,659
My life has been planned up to my marriage,

270
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,500
and I must proceed.

271
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,999
The fact that you're still going on blind dates...

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,029
means you haven't found the one.

273
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,230
Maybe you have too high standards.

274
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,269
Very, to be exact.

275
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,269
But I'll never compromise.

276
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,880
Just see what perfect man I eventually marry.

277
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,710
Boss, check me out.

278
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:23,019
Aren't I strong?

279
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,390
I have push carts for that.

280
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,990
Seriously.

281
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,460
You're the merciless type.

282
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,730
Just so you know, compliments get me dancing.

283
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,599
That reminds me.

284
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,269
I heard Jisang Liquor came by while I was absent.

285
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,200
I guess I forgot to tell you.

286
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,799
The business proposal is on the shelf.

287
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:44,700
It seemed decent.

288
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,480
I'm not interested.

289
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,579
If they come by in my absence again, turn them down.

290
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,079
Sure.

291
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,019
When will you talk casually to me?

292
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,680
Aren't you older?

293
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,250
Did we ever agree to talk casually?

294
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,759
Aren't we best friends?

295
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,529
Then why did you introduce me to your family?

296
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,999
- My family? - Photo.

297
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
(Me?)

298
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,569
Meow.

299
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,609
I'm off to the town hall.

300
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,849
Only if you say it casually.

301
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,589
He's a savage at ignoring people.

302
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,299
Nice. I absolutely love it.

303
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,500
(Uilhan Brewery)

304
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:56,609
Finally, I get to meet you. You must be CEO Yoon.

305
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,079
I'm Bang Ah Reum of Jisang Liquor's Planning Team.

306
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,980
I've been trying to reach you by call or text.

307
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,720
Do you perhaps recall?

308
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:10,819
You should talk to me.

309
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,130
My boss...

310
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,829
isn't a fan of interacting with other people...

311
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,369
and tends to draw a line.

312
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,200
Move.

313
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,308
You've been calling nonstop,

314
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,380
so I guess we should talk.

315
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:31,750
Shall we sit over there?

316
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,779
(Uilhan Brewery)

317
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,019
That's odd.

318
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,130
Goodness. He'll soon turn them down.

319
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,269
Hang in there, Ms. Beautiful Bang.

320
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,849
Chae Yong Ju said she'd be here too.

321
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,349
Where is she and why isn't she here yet?

322
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:14,349
Hello.

323
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,118
I'm Chae Yong Ju of Jisang Liquor. We talked on the phone.

324
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,259
Goodness.

325
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,890
Hello.

326
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,099
- My gosh. - Goodness.

327
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,829
This really wasn't necessary.

328
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:25,429
It's nothing much.

329
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,700
We wanted to thank you for putting this together for us.

330
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,369
Goodness.

331
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,309
As if this will keep me alive for that much longer.

332
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,210
Anyway, did CEO Yoon suddenly drop dead?

333
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:40,279
- Just a second. - Go ahead.

334
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,419
The call cannot be connected.

335
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,220
- Transferring to voicemail. - Is he brewing that phone of his?

336
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,130
He is always hard to reach.

337
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,028
That's why I contact him by broadcasting messages...

338
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:57,900
even though we live in a world of smart devices.

339
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:00,630
We can wait. It's fine.

340
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,240
Go ahead.

341
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,309
By the way, I don't know what deal you're trying to make with him,

342
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,279
but he'll be tough to persuade.

343
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,910
Meanwhile, he'll mercilessly shoot your proposal down.

344
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,220
(Jisang Liquor)

345
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,690
Won't we at least get to meet him today?

346
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,460
I'll make it happen.

347
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,098
Mr. Yoon, name your terms...

348
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:30,700
and we'll meet as many as possible.

349
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,200
My terms?

350
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,369
Yes, lay them out for us.

351
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:43,339
I would like to brew my beer within the boundaries of my brewery.

352
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,008
That means it won't be possible to mass-produce my beer...

353
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:48,618
in a way major liquor corps would...

354
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:51,250
and sell them all across the country.

355
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,990
Would that be okay?

356
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,759
That's...

357
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:01,859
I'm afraid...

358
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:16,640
I apologize for offending you.

359
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:19,450
Gosh, no.

360
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:21,278
You saw wrong. I wasn't offended at all.

361
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,819
Your boss probably forced you here,

362
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,589
but now that I'll decline any offer.

363
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:27,990
I have business to attend to and must get going.

364
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,920
Have a safe trip back.

365
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,200
I hope you feel better on the road.

366
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,029
It's not like that.

367
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,170
Take care, Mr. Yoon.

368
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,500
Take care.

369
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,068
Did it seem that obvious?

370
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:49,380
No. You were smiling the entire time.

371
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,750
I'm excellent at hiding my expressions,

372
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:54,480
so that's something.

373
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,059
Unbelievable.

374
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,028
Him?

375
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:09,298
Being a master brewer...

376
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,000
makes him think he can do whatever he wants.

377
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,670
Darn.

378
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,339
Seriously.

379
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,569
Why won't he leave my sight?

380
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,250
(Fate)

381
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,230
What?

382
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,960
Why is there a car from Jisang Liquor here?

383
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,109
We will brew another beer that plays to your strengths.

384
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:58,410
I need to get Yoon Min Ju on board today.

385
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:02,150
Yoon Min Ju...

386
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,349
Yoon Min Ju...

387
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:10,660
Yoon Min Ju...

388
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,069
Yoon Min Ju...

389
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,339
- Pink bear? - The sniper?

390
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,180
You said my name that day as well.

391
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:36,819
Did I?

392
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,720
Are you CEO Yoon Min Ju?

393
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:44,819
Yes.

394
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,490
This is definitely more comfortable. Nice.

395
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:51,328
Did you just get here?

396
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:54,099
Why come so early and not swing by tomorrow?

397
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,740
He sees himself as the man of the hour.

398
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,309
They're from the major liquor corp Jisang Liquor.

399
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,579
They begged me to let them see you,

400
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,980
and you know I can't turn people down.

401
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,279
I yield to power and authority even more.

402
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,390
I'll leave you to it, then.

403
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,920
Sir, we have more to talk about.

404
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,099
Do you work at Jisang Liquor?

405
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,329
Yes.

406
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,869
That's why you said my name.

407
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,839
You're CEO Yoon Min Ju, the brewer of Naro Beer.

408
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,700
I guess you can say fate brought us together.

409
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,409
Why don't we sit down and talk?

410
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,509
No.

411
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,779
I have nothing more to say to Jisang Liquor.

412
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,750
I already turned down your colleague's offer.

413
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:42,779
Then...

414
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,818
We work at the same company,

415
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:47,018
but our proposals are completely different.

416
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:48,119
If you can read this...

417
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:51,089
Mr. Yoon?

418
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,200
Forget it.

419
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:01,630
Mr. Yoon.

420
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,569
Please...

421
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,670
Mr. Yoon.

422
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:06,640
I know you're busy,

423
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,740
so how about you spare me five minutes?

424
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,349
What's so desperate this time around?

425
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,029
You must've talked to the Planning Team,

426
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,829
- but I'm from the Marketing Team... - Look.

427
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:38,730
The name is Chae Yong Ju.

428
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,769
Ms. Chae Yong Ju,

429
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,940
why are you going to such an extent?

430
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,508
Of course I should.

431
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,048
I can do and be good with anything...

432
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:53,809
if that means you'll talk to me.

433
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,549
Why do you keep saying you're all right?

434
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,189
We're here to suggest we brew...

435
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,450
a different beer that isn't Naro Beer.

436
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,788
Without hurting the brand...

437
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,460
you established with the village people,

438
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,729
I will have your brewery and our company...

439
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,829
benefit from each other.

440
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,868
When I first tasted your beer,

441
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:15,538
I noticed how delicate and clean the flavors were.

442
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,500
- So... - I said you weren't okay.

443
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,539
Back then and even now, you are not okay.

444
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,609
Are you upset?

445
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:29,579
As if.

446
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:33,019
I said this to your colleagues,

447
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,619
but I will never do business with Jisang Liquor.

448
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,599
You can hear my proposal first and then decline.

449
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:48,599
I'm desperately asking you.

450
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,099
Would that be too much to ask?

451
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,979
Yes.

452
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,109
(New Beer Joint Project Proposal)

453
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:01,480
Being able to see that desperation...

454
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:04,220
makes it even harder.

455
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,859
See a doctor.

456
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,130
Thank you.

457
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,069
How did you know?

458
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,009
What?

459
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,140
What the...

460
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,150
Yong Ju.

461
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,450
What?

462
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:40,720
The village chief was easily persuaded.

463
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:43,119
Did CEO Yoon leave?

464
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,578
Why did I put those slippers on her?

465
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:06,750
Why did I overreact?

466
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,660
These aren't my feelings.

467
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:25,970
These aren't my feelings. Don't be confused.

468
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,099
Focus on yourself, Yoon Min Ju.

469
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,990
- Mr. Yoon, are you okay? - Goodness.

470
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Darn, that startled me.

471
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,130
I'm all right, but your face is too close.

472
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:01,400
Oh, right.

473
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:05,839
Why do I lose control whenever I'm with her?

474
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,740
This should be the last time I see her.

475
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,750
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine.

476
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:18,349
I appreciate your concern.

477
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,489
I'm just glad you're okay.

478
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,789
Then, as of this moment,

479
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,190
I'll block you.

480
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,099
You'll do what?

481
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,730
What was that?

482
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,700
What... But...

483
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,200
Mr. Yoon?

484
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
What the...

485
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,980
He rejected you big time.

486
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:49,578
But all I did was show concern.

487
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:51,279
He'll block me?

488
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,450
That was him challenging me, wasn't it?

489
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,589
Cheers.

490
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,669
I feel like we get along.

491
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,798
Same here. You should be the boss instead.

492
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,799
Goodness.

493
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,098
I'm loved by ladies all across the country.

494
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,439
I have a lovable personality.

495
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
Don't I know it.

496
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:14,769
Our boss at the brewery...

497
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,839
is too fussy.

498
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,578
I'm wasting my breath talking about it.

499
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:19,880
Cleanse it.

500
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:30,619
Boss, come and have snacks with us!

501
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,460
Don't.

502
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:33,828
What on earth?

503
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,159
He must be experiencing a storm of emotions again.

504
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,459
Tell me about it. He's been fine for a while,

505
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,099
so I wonder what happened.

506
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,200
So much for talking smack about him.

507
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:47,140
You must've bonded seeing how you took his side and not mine.

508
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,039
What? When did I do that?

509
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,338
Our relationship is strictly business.

510
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:54,149
Exactly. Our relationship is only based on our paychecks.

511
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,180
- Now, drink up. - Right.

512
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,090
These aren't my emotions.

513
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,360
Focus only on me.

514
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,369
To be honest, I'm confused.

515
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,800
I don't know if the agony is mine...

516
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,670
or someone else's.

517
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:30,610
She was the one in distress,

518
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,409
but it's now eating away at me.

519
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,110
So,

520
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,150
are the feelings mine or someone else's?

521
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,710
Yoon Min Ju locked himself up in his house.

522
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:06,050
What did you do to make him that way?

523
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:07,848
When he goes into that space,

524
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:09,920
it's hard to tell when he'll get out.

525
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,219
He's like a bear that crawled into a cave.

526
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:14,289
Even the threat of a fire won't get him to leave.

527
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,920
Hold on.

528
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:18,590
What's that smoke?

529
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,860
- Is something burning? - What?

530
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,059
Is it really a fire?

531
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:27,570
Toast, get him out of there.

532
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,440
But I don't know how to get to the second floor.

533
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,198
There aren't any stairs inside the house.

534
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:35,009
I know that, but still.

535
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,210
Please calm down. I'll check on him.

536
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,209
Is there a way? Please help him.

537
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,678
Nothing should happen to our boss.

538
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,178
Chan Hwi, you carry that around, right?

539
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:45,420
Don't tell me you'll...

540
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:19,619
What was that?

541
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,460
Are you all right, Mr. Yoon?

542
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,170
What... How are you here?

543
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,340
They were scented candles! What a relief.

544
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,238
Mr. Yoon,

545
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,940
I apologize for any inconvenience I caused.

546
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:23,250
What? Who apologizes while hanging from a rope?

547
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,480
Will you accept my apology?

548
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,550
I will, so get back down.

549
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,619
It's dangerous, so get down already.

550
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,260
Since you accepted my apology,

551
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,989
please accept this as well.

552
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:36,929
What?

553
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,630
I'm unblocking your block.

554
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,329
Unblock me!

555
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:49,138
Goodness me. That's like a scene from a movie.

556
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:50,980
- She's not your average girl. - My gosh.

557
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,309
She sure is impressive.

558
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,259
Just this one thing.

559
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,500
I'll only say what I can promise you.

560
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,460
I will never...

561
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:16,269
do wrong by this place or your beer.

562
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,269
Instead, let's brew a new kind of beer.

563
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,969
Together. You and us.

564
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,980
No, I won't do that.

565
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:28,549
I saw that you were okay, so I'll get going for now.

566
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,949
Don't ever come back here. Okay?

567
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,050
Please call me if you want to talk.

568
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,019
I'll await your call.

569
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,099
No, this can't be.

570
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,739
Those aren't the eyes of someone who'll await my call.

571
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:59,280
I saw a lunatic in her.

572
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,480
I met the wrong woman for sure.

573
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,989
This can't be.

574
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,130
Excuse me.

575
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,000
Hold up.

576
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,110
Just let her leave for today.

577
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,710
She may seem all right,

578
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,510
but something is clearly bothering her.

579
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:53,869
This is huge, I give you that.

580
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,039
She was able to drag him out of his cave.

581
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,769
Even the demigod would be impressed.

582
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:04,840
- Shall we get going? - What?

583
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,710
- But... - Chan Hwi,

584
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:09,380
can you clean this up and also what's on the roof?

585
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:17,420
But...

586
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:19,119
Hold on a second.

587
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,799
Do not let her in if she ever comes back.

588
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,460
I don't want to see her again. Got it?

589
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,099
- Maybe. - Maybe.

590
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:32,869
But...

591
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,079
Are you leaving already? You should've sat down with him.

592
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,579
An ordinary method won't work. I need to change my strategy.

593
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,119
As expected from you.

594
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:50,689
Yong Ju. After we join hands with Yoon Min Ju,

595
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,090
let's head straight to Busan.

596
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,130
Of course. We've got many lives to save.

597
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,529
- You're crazy cool. - Goodness.

598
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,999
Let's stop by the supermarket on our way.

599
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,800
You should eat something.

600
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,239
Shall we do that?

601
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:11,280
(A fly)

602
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,059
Do you not have iced Americano?

603
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,489
Do you think we do?

604
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,260
It doesn't seem like it.

605
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,268
Right? In this day and age,

606
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:37,599
it's absurd that a supermarket doesn't have that America-something.

607
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:39,738
The owner of this place...

608
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:42,939
was born without a single wit.

609
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,840
I thought you were the owner.

610
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:47,780
The owner's name is Kim.

611
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:50,379
He's nothing close to a smart person.

612
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,279
If I were the owner,

613
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,948
this place would've already beat all supermarkets, even in Seoul.

614
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:56,988
Let's see.

615
00:41:56,989 --> 00:42:00,828
A French modern-style display on this side...

616
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:02,658
will wow the customers...

617
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:04,328
and make them...

618
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:07,328
pinch their cheeks to make sure it isn't a dream.

619
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:08,829
(A fly)

620
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,369
What?

621
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:15,809
Why do I see our company car over there?

622
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,610
Is it the Marketing Team?

623
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:44,300
She must be the new manager of the Marketing Team, right?

624
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,340
I heard she was a legend in Busan.

625
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,510
Little did I know she was pretty, too.

626
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:52,578
That celebrity. She looks a lot like that one celebrity.

627
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:53,579
What's this?

628
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,510
Why are you all smiles, or is it just my imagination?

629
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,480
I bet we'll get along well.

630
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,949
Goodness.

631
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,730
Are you fleeing for refuge?

632
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,670
I'm starving.

633
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,849
Gosh.

634
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:35,349
Hi.

635
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,559
I'm Section Chief Bang Ah Reum from the Planning Team.

636
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:39,489
Oh, I see.

637
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:42,559
You had a meeting with CEO Yoon Min Ju, right?

638
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,199
Can we talk for a minute?

639
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:48,500
Sure. Of course.

640
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,879
As you may have understood from the meeting, CEO Yoon...

641
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,808
doesn't want to sign a contract with us.

642
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:03,019
Clinging to him won't do us any good.

643
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,919
We will know that only after we try until the end.

644
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,289
But you see, he's rejecting Jisang Liquor as a whole.

645
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,218
Why don't we wrap it up here...

646
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:13,388
and persuade each of our directors to put an end to this?

647
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:16,030
This is just a battle of pride between our directors.

648
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,428
Let's not get caught in the crossfire.

649
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:20,529
Even if we do, it won't hurt me at all.

650
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,800
I've got a high skeletal muscle mass.

651
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,739
Stop. I'm sorry.

652
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:31,840
Does this mean the Planning Team is giving up?

653
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:35,408
We're not giving up. I'm proposing we act rationally...

654
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:37,849
and think of an alternative plan to save time.

655
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:41,489
But I haven't done anything to think of an alternative plan.

656
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,489
I will secure Yoon Min Ju.

657
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,019
No matter what.

658
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,799
Well, if that's what you wish to do.

659
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,360
We've done everything possible.

660
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,670
All right. It's now our turn to do our best.

661
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:59,039
Great.

662
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:04,939
Ah Reum.

663
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,179
The Marketing Team's manager is the first person...

664
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:08,980
I've drifted apart with so quickly.

665
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:12,919
She's clearly a young oldie not even modern medicine can fix.

666
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,118
Gosh, I never want to get close to her.

667
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,259
What's this? Where did that bright smile of yours go?

668
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,229
Had I been that manager's direct junior,

669
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,659
I would've quit ages ago.

670
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,099
I have a bad feeling about her.

671
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,309
What's with them?

672
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,050
Why is everyone telling me I can't do it?

673
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:46,320
It's making me want to succeed.

674
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:50,760
Yong Ju.

675
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,190
Your eyes could kill.

676
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,630
CEO Yoon isn't easy to deal with, right?

677
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:04,070
He's a very hard guy to persuade.

678
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,940
Yes, you're right.

679
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:08,839
It's all thanks to you that we could meet CEO Yoon.

680
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,840
Gosh, don't mention it.

681
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:14,509
- I was born as a very nice man. - I see.

682
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,948
Take this supermarket for example.

683
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:17,779
It's not mine, but I'm taking care of it...

684
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,448
since the owner is out of the country.

685
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:22,189
Is that so? Then, we should get...

686
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,518
Since we're on the topic,

687
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:27,288
the supermarket owner Kim...

688
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:28,629
is such a selfish man.

689
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,198
It's that time of the year.

690
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:32,698
The busiest season in our town.

691
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:34,268
We need to harvest hops, brew beer,

692
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:35,368
and prepare for the festival.

693
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:36,899
But that jerk Kim...

694
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,409
had to go on an overseas trip right now.

695
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,308
Then, the town must be short-handed.

696
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:48,849
Don't get me started. If only I had ten arms, you know?

697
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,619
All right.

698
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,689
Why don't I work here starting tomorrow?

699
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:55,750
What?

700
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,159
That would help me out loads.

701
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:00,928
It certainly would.

702
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:02,759
Girl, stop it.

703
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,960
This is great. Really.

704
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:10,400
Okay.

705
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:14,939
(Jisang Liquor)

706
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,808
- Mr. Kang. - Yes?

707
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:19,109
Did Ms. Chae really go alone?

708
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,409
- Yes. - My goodness.

709
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,448
Anyone can tell there's no chance of succeeding.

710
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:25,749
Isn't she going too far?

711
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,948
Come on. Don't worry.

712
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:31,320
Ms. Chae never takes back her words.

713
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,760
I'm sure she already has the town wrapped around her little finger.

714
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:37,059
She's brilliant.

715
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:39,329
The ace of the Busan branch.

716
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,170
Chae Yong Ju is different.

717
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,869
She's super cool.

718
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:46,268
Please, Chief.

719
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:49,439
Just this once. Please.

720
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,609
What? Come on, Chief.

721
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,880
- Go away. - How come?

722
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:56,719
Just once!

723
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,650
Really.

724
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:03,018
Yesterday, you told me to come at any cost.

725
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:04,460
And here I am.

726
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,189
I guess you didn't hear the news.

727
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,230
What news?

728
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,500
The news that this town is off limits to Chae Yong Ju.

729
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:15,829
Sorry?

730
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:26,079
I read a text message that...

731
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:31,480
Chae Yong Ju from Jisang Liquor will work here starting today.

732
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:34,320
Who agreed to it?

733
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,848
- It wasn't me. - Who was it?

734

Come clean and ask for mercy.

735
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:41,630
You know you can't fool me, right?

736
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Chief?

737
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,929
You see, as the village chief,

738
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,038
I suffer from this disease where I lose myself...

739
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:54,669
when I spot youngsters who can help us out.

740
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,538
An extra pair of hands is always good.

741
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:57,579
Don't you agree?

742
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,279
Stop smiling, and agree to it.

743
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,780
- I'm sorry. - How can you...

744
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,718
No. I will never let Ms. Chae Yong Ju...

745
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:07,689
into my boundary.

746
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,989
She's prohibited, okay?

747
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,519
Stop her.

748
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,259
One way or another.

749
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,388

752

That's the story behind it.

753
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:31,238

756
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,619
But today, I will surely clear all of these hurdles...

757
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,389
and stand before Yoon Min Ju.

I'm sorry.

772

Just leave, okay?

773
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,019
I didn't expect the chief to take such an action.
