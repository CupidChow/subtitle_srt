(Uilhan Brewery)

00:00:02,395 --> 00:00:04,896
(1. Malting, 2. Malt milling, 3. Mash tun, 4. Hopping)

00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:10,166
(Kim Se Jeong)

(Brewing Love)

11
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:35,225
(This is a work of fiction.)

12
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:36,225
(Scenes with child actors and animals were filmed...)

13
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:37,225
(under production guidelines along with experts.)

14
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,505
Can you at least tell me...

15
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:22,304
why you're treating me like this?

16
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:24,475
- Why are you suddenly... - She told us the reason.

17
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:29,715
What on earth did you tell them...

18
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:32,415
I told them the reason you came here.

19
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:33,715
What?

20
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:40,494
Shouldn't you hear my side too?

21
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:41,525
Forget it!

22
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:43,625
We know what you're scheming.

23
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:45,235
We have nothing to hear.

24
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:46,494
There's nothing to hear.

25
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:47,795
- Yes. - That's right.

26
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:49,235
- What's the point? - Right?

27
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:51,436
- Why... - Stop it. That's enough.

28
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:52,876
Just a moment.

29
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:58,245
The cause of all this is Jisang Liquor, then.

30
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:00,546
Right? Here's the conclusion.

31
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,316
Don't confuse the villagers anymore.

32
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:06,486
You both can leave.

33
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:08,425
Right now.

34
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:09,556
- Mr. Yoon. - Mr. Yoon.

35
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:13,725
What's up with him?

36
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:19,735
Boss. Why kick out Chae Yong Ju too?

37
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:27,675
(Brewing Love)

38
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:31,006
(Episode 4)

39
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,286
He shouldn't have been nice.

40
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:46,556
He shouldn't have been kind.

41
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:50,566
Oh, shoot. Salt got in my eye.

42
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:58,135
You're a mess, Chae Yong Ju.

43
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:10,686
I told you not to whip yourself.

44
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:12,216
It's too early.

45
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:15,686
Just a moment.

46
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:21,626
Leave it.

47
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:25,066
Hurt me or heal me. Stick to just one.

48
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:32,806
Before we do that,

49
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:34,806
come over to my place.

50
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,716
Mr. Yoon, I'm done...

51
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:44,145
I got myself in order.

52
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,186
He must really love photos.

53
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,895
Does he bump into corners that much?

54
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:07,075
Eat at your convenience.

55
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:20,385
Are you the owner of this house?

56
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:22,325
Hello.

57
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:26,426
Hey.

58
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:28,895
What's the matter with your owner?

59
00:04:31,465 --> 00:04:33,835
He shouldn't be so nice right now.

60
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:36,936
He's too nice for no reason.

61
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:43,176
Where did he go?

62
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:53,316
Can I come in?

63
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:58,186
You already came in.

64
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:04,426
Are you all right?

65
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:06,765
Yes, thanks to you.

66
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:11,736
I'm sorry I can't pick...

67
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:13,905
between hurting and healing.

68
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,205
To me, the villagers are most important.

69
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,785
I was like a lonesome island,

70
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:24,416
and this is the first place I settled at.

71
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:26,885
Thanks to them.

72
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:31,756
(4 years ago)

73
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:35,066
(Baegok-ri Village Hall)

74
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:48,135
Do you think we'll eat you?

75
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:55,985
Did you zip up your mouth? Why won't you speak?

76
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,215
Are you keeping your distance because you're from Seoul?

77
00:05:59,715 --> 00:06:01,985
We go there once or twice a year.

78
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,085
- Yes. - It's nothing.

79
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:10,166
Will you come in?

80
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:15,465
I'd like to host a village festival...

81
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:18,876
like our neighboring village did.

82
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:23,145
We barely do any farming because we lack young folk.

83
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:27,176
Peaches, apples, cucumbers, deodeok.

84
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,885
The neighbors did their festival around almost everything we grow.

85
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:33,584
What festival could we possibly do?

86
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:34,585
Right.

87
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:38,226
I called you all here so we could put our skulls together and think.

88
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:40,325
Speak up.

89
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:57,575
Oh, gosh...

90
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:59,145
What a disaster.

91
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:11,256
Hey, how about...

92
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:14,256
How about beer?

93
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,866
I planted some hops.

94
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,835
Other countries host hop festivals.

95
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:24,765
You could actually speak?

96
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:28,445
We get to hear your voice at last.

97
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,274
I like your voice,

98
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,015
but what did you say you planted?

99
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:36,345
Hops are used to give beer its scent.

100
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:40,816
You could say it's like a beer tree.

101
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:42,955
- A tree of beers? - A beer tree?

102
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:46,895
Do people know about beer trees?

103
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:48,965
- Right. - Yes.

104
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:51,025
- If it's for a festival... - Well...

105
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:53,765
Too bad if they don't.

106
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:56,866
That's it?

107
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:58,106
What's that?

108
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:00,305
Shouldn't we at least ask three times?

109
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:02,705
You're not at all like us.

110
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:06,816
Hey, Yoon...

111
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,585
Young Man Yoon.

112
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:11,986
CEO Yoon.

113
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,155
What should we call him?

114
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,195
- Is the work doable? - It's easy.

115
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:26,795
(A fly)

116
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:27,834
Block.

117
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:30,806
Leave it alone. It's our first customer today.

118
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:32,305
Come this way.

119
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:33,404
(A fly)

120
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:36,376
If you sit down here, I'll bring you a drop of beer.

121
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:38,746
(In My Name)

122
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:42,015
Sir. Are you open?

123
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:43,915
We are which is why you came in.

124
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,155
Sit over here.

125
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:46,685
Cheers.

126
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:52,795
- It's really nice. - Honestly. It's awesome.

127
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:57,126
CEO Yoon. Keep them coming.

128
00:08:57,565 --> 00:08:59,894
So we can make money. I'm good at this now.

129
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:02,735
"In My Name." My name is Sook Ja.

130
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,206
What's your name?

131
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:07,635
I'm Young Ja, the richest person in the world.

132
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:08,976
What does that mean?

133
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,945
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

134
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:12,975
Take your pick.

135
00:09:12,976 --> 00:09:14,814
- Three of this, please. - Okay.

136
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,085
If you haven't eaten yet,

137
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:17,644
we have cheeseburgers and...

138
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:20,086
- People are actually coming. - Yes.

139
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:21,985
- It's nice. - Thank you.

140
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:23,356
- Here you go. - Thanks.

141
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:28,024
It's good fun to make money.

142
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,496
- It is. - Smell it.

143
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:32,336
This is the smell of hops.

144
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:35,605
- Mr. Yoon. - CEO Yoon!

145
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:37,634
You're looking good.

146
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:39,375
- Is the work doable? - Yes.

147
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:40,435
CEO Yoon.

148
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:49,086
Oh, my gosh.

149
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,456
It's really getting my back.

150
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:57,425
This is paradise.

151
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:00,025
CEO Yoon.

152
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:02,966
I thought I made beer on my own.

153
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:05,435
Before I knew it, the villagers...

154
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:08,395
had my back.

155
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,135
For their sake at least, I can't quit and pack up.

156
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:20,346
You can't.

157
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,116
Those who trust and rely on you.

158
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:24,846
You must protect them.

159
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:27,356
Do we have to do all this?

160
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:30,684
- Is this... - Beom.

161
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:33,125
You can't stick it here. It must go here.

162
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:34,155
My gosh.

163
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:38,495
You're doing well.

164
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,565
You're doing well.

165
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:42,305
Sitting here...

166
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:45,876
strangely reminds me a lot of my old branch.

167
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:47,775
A large company might think...

168
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:50,246
this place is insignificant.

169
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,376
But we all put everything into it.

170
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:54,616
And I have a duty to protect them.

171
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:09,996
The village festival's coming up. I have to go.

172
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:26,315
I can't stop him after that speech.

173
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:31,616
Should I just give up?

174
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:37,785
I can't.

175
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:40,096
Not yet.

176
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:49,206
"Unlimited beer?" "Festival?"

177
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,135
Why didn't they call me?

178
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:56,475
No festival is complete without toast.

179
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:57,875
Oh, dear.

180
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:59,446
What a shame.

181
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:02,645
Isn't it fun?

182
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:04,914
- Cheers. - Cheers.

183
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:05,915
Cheers.

184
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:12,425
There you go.

185
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,925
- Thanks. We'll have fun. - Thank you.

186
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:24,006
I can't leave like this.

187
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:26,236
I want to explain myself to the villagers.

188
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:28,106
They got me very wrong.

189
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,506
I can't leave like this either.

190
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,616
Can I have a word?

191
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:46,025
What did you tell the villagers?

192
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:48,126
I didn't say much.

193
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:50,394
I only shared facts about the profit...

194
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,164
the merger would bring.

195
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:53,165
"Facts?"

196
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,565
Did you tell them the hidden fact about the merger?

197
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:00,534
That as soon as the merger's final,

198
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,846
Naro Beer will become Jisang's Naro.

199
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:05,305
The pub, hop field, even the festival.

200
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,544
Everything they worked for four years...

201
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:09,716
to build up will become Jisang Liquor's.

202
00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:12,115
To lose ownership means...

203
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:15,525
they can no longer call the fruits of their labor their own.

204
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:18,794
You're threatening to take even the time...

205
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:20,425
the villagers put their all into.

206
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:23,525
The real hidden meaning of a merger...

207
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:27,596
is to squash the efforts of a whole village with capital.

208
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:29,105
Did you tell them that too?

209
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:31,866
You can tell everyone that hidden meaning,

210
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:33,836
but in the end capital always wins.

211
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:35,375
They can't help...

212
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,405
but notice the post-merger profit.

213
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:40,076
You call it a merger,

214
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,576
but what happens afterwards?

215
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:44,346
When did a large corporation ever keep the original staff?

216
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:46,684
Yes, they keep everyone on at first.

217
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:49,655
But they barely last 2 or 3 years.

218
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:52,325
The villagers will be sent to work...

219
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:54,596
at other Jisang factories.

220
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:57,465
Where would they go? They lived here all their lives.

221
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:58,765
They'll all resign.

222
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,696
Back in 2022 Jisang bought out...

223
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:02,665
a Jeolla Province soju plant.

224
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:05,005
All the existing staff left within a year.

225
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:06,206
Am I wrong?

226
00:14:06,435 --> 00:14:09,405
Ms. Chae. Why are you so emotional?

227
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:11,675
Go and tell them yourself.

228
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:14,675
Tell them I'm deceiving and using them.

229
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:16,715
Tell them Jisang's being a tyrant.

230
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:19,055
You can tell them what I'm doing like I told them about you.

231
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:22,256
No. I won't do that.

232
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:24,525
Why not?

233
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:26,555
Because belittling an opponent...

234
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,625
is just too easy a way out.

235
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:30,496
It's way too easy.

236
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:32,795
Ms. Bang.

237
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:35,366
Have you ever lost something...

238
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:39,305
you tried to protect with your name?

239
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:44,606
Goodbye.

240
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:50,086
It really sucks.

241
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:54,486
I don't want the villagers to feel that.

242
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:10,434
Yes! I should just die!

243
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:13,575
I deserve to die. Why do I bother living?

244
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,904
I'm totally useless.

245
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:18,746
I'm the scum of the earth.

246
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:21,446
I ordered beer for the beer festival...

247
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:23,445
and told them to deliver it next week.

248
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:26,884
Why do I bother to eat breakfast every morning?

249
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,784
What should I do now?

250
00:15:28,785 --> 00:15:30,684
You should be ashamed.

251
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:33,955
Did you swap your brain for a block of taffy?

252
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:35,524
You're our village chief?

253
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:39,635
What beer festival has no beer?

254
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:43,404
I'm sorry, okay? Will you let go of me?

255
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:47,205
I need to be able to move if I'm going to drown myself somewhere.

256
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,235
Let him go.

257
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:51,376
You moron. What should I do with you?

258
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:52,975
We promised unlimited beer,

259
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:55,884
and we don't have enough beer.

260
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,314
Aren't there lots of people...

261
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,655
who want other beers and not ours?

262
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:01,314
- There are lots. - Right?

263
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:03,684
Where can we go to order beer...

264
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:05,996
and have it delivered?

265
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,024
We live so far in the countryside...

266
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:10,564
that we only get one shipment a week!

267
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:13,736
Let's do the best we can with what we have left.

268
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:17,006
Chief, make some calls and see if anyone can supply us.

269
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,435
I'll get all the beer in the brewery.

270
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:21,976
So...

271
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:26,275
where is the person who can help me?

272
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:30,285
I have to man this place.

273
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:32,655
I'll help.

274
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:35,155
It's urgent.

275
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:42,826
Me too. I'm here.

276
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:44,795
- Toast. - Toast.

277
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:46,565
Where did you come from?

278
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:48,966
Hello.

279
00:16:50,236 --> 00:16:52,736
If you don't mind me asking, I'd like your help.

280
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:09,285
Oh, gosh.

281
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,236
Thanks.

282
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:29,646
Where did Yong Ju go when we need her brute force?

283
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:31,976
She's not even picking up.

284
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:34,775
Did she go to Seoul?

285
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:39,486
Beom, did you see the file I sent?

286
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,686
Get the director's signature and come right over.

287
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,156
Yes, it's urgent. Hurry.

288
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:44,656
(Product Order, Miscellaneous, Please approve ASAP.)

289
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:47,996
Got it. Okay, approved.

290
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:50,166
Got it.

291
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:54,396
Yes. Nice.

292
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,854
Yong Ju. How long has it been?

293
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:16,755
You're so hard to reach.

294
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:18,426
We'll talk later. Let's go inside.

295
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:28,496
This is all alcohol?

296
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:31,534
This is my paradise.

297
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:32,575
There he is.

298
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:35,375
What could be so urgent?

299
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:37,905
We're here to collect some products for an event.

300
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:38,906
What?

301
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:43,916
This should be enough.

302
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:47,084
Thank you.

303
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,515
- See you. - Go on. Bye.

304
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:50,585
There's no time. Let's hurry.

305
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:54,095
(Fate)

306
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,705
Yong Ju.

307
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:05,165
If we offer this to bargain with Yoon Min Ju,

308
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,535
he might sign with us, right?

309
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:08,375
We have an advantage, right?

310
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:10,575
- No. - No?

311
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:12,645
It's not a "might."

312
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:14,445
He'll definitely sign with us.

313
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,446
The villagers will want it.

314
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:18,216
Mr. Yoon...

315
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:23,426
He won't be able to refuse.

316
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:26,025
Yes. We won.

317
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:27,956
Let's get there quickly.

318
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:31,896
- Oh, no. - Are you okay?

319
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:33,936
- What is it? - Where does it hurt?

320
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:37,206
Oh, gosh.

321
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,506
What should we do?

322
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,275
Hang on. Where are we?

323
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,146
Stop, Beom. Hit the brakes.

324
00:19:57,956 --> 00:19:59,555
- Are you all right? - Yes.

325
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:01,055
Let's get out.

326
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:06,896
Are you all okay?

327
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:11,034
- Are you okay? - Did you call...

328
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,405
for help or your insurance provider?

329
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:14,136
Oh, right. The beer.

330
00:20:16,305 --> 00:20:17,345
No?

331
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:19,006
Excuse me.

332
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:26,916
How's the beer? Oh, no.

333
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:32,656
No. After all I did to get it.

334
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,765
Darn it. There goes our chance with Yoon Min Ju.

335
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:39,666
We should transfer the injured to the hospital first.

336
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:42,335
Sorting this situation out will take some time.

337
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,835
Think. Calm down.

338
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:49,805
Calm down.

339
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:54,374
If you're in any trouble, call me.

340
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,186
I'll be right there.

341
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:08,824
It's me. What is it?

342
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:11,425
Chairman. Do you mind helping...

343
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:13,996
Send me the address. I'll be right there.

344
00:21:15,236 --> 00:21:16,564
- Are you all right? - Yes.

345
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:17,666
Yes, I'm fine.

346
00:21:17,765 --> 00:21:19,905
Is there anything else we can help with?

347
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:21,175
We're fine as well.

348
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:22,406
- Thank you. - No problem.

349
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:26,246
What is that?

350
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:39,225
Guys. Get out and sort things out at once.

351
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:40,355
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

352
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:43,696
- Thank you very much, Chairman. - Wholesale is loyalty.

353
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:49,466
It's my time to pay you back for all the help I received from you.

354
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,735
Chairman...

355
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:52,636
Call me anytime.

356
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:56,476
I still have enough power to help you. Got it?

357
00:21:57,506 --> 00:22:01,215
- You saved Jisang Liquor, Chairman. - Goodness, punk.

358
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,715
It's all thanks to Yong Ju for all her support until now. You know?

359
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:05,716
Chairman...

360
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:07,686
Thanks.

361
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:11,324
Stop clinging onto me, big guy.

362
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:14,896
You two should go. Leave this place to me.

363
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:18,094
- Okay. Get in. - Thank you.

364
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:19,265
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

365
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:22,295
- I'll call you later. - Okay.

366
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:25,166
- Drive safely. - Yes, sir.

367
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,805
- Thank you, Chairman. - No problem.

368
00:22:27,976 --> 00:22:30,746
- I'll get in touch. - Off you go. All right. Be careful.

369
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:33,476
Get driving, guys.

370
00:22:34,615 --> 00:22:35,676
Good.

371
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:38,085
Have a safe trip.

372
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:47,854
If it's beers from the Chairman,

373
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:50,496
making a deal with Yoon Min Ju won't be that hard.

374
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:55,834
- Beom. - Yes, Yong Ju?

375
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:58,506
- Let's not make a deal. - What?

376
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,236
How come? It's a golden opportunity.

377
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:05,646
Making a deal using a weak point is the same as acting high-handed.

378
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:08,015
And we know very well how that feels.

379
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,146
If CEO Yoon signs the contract,

380
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,085
I want him to do it voluntarily.

381
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:16,886
Out of his own will and not for someone else's sake.

382
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:19,025
But this is our last chance.

383
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:23,595
If that's what you say is right, I'll trust you.

384
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:25,166
Thanks.

385
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:29,936
The villagers will love it, won't they?

386
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:32,305
Including CEO Yoon.

387
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:37,104
Stop. Drop me off right here.

388
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:38,544
I need to make a short detour.

391

This is the last batch.

392
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:55,095
Thanks to you, I can make it to the festival on time.

393
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:56,925
I'm really grateful.

394
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,995
If you proceed with an M and A with our company,

395
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:01,035
you won't need to go through all this trouble.

396
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:04,935
You know, right? The villagers are hoping for the M and A.

397
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:06,205
I do.

398
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:07,675
What Ms. Chae...

399
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:10,706
is trying to do is take you away from Uilhan Brewery.

400
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,374
If you leave Uilhan Brewery,

401
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,345
the villagers will suffer the damage.

402
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:19,146
Hold on. I know Yong Ju well.

403
00:24:19,315 --> 00:24:21,715
She won't cause damage to the village.

404
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:24,986
It's just her current situation.

405
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:27,354
To save the Busan branch,

406
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:29,155
Yong Ju took the lead in getting CEO Yoon to...

407
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:31,264
Stop right there. Doesn't that mean...

408
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:34,864
Ms. Chae is adamant about the contract...

409
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:36,666
simply for the Busan branch?

410
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:38,935
That's a bigger problem.

411
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,635
If her goal is to return to the branch,

412
00:24:40,636 --> 00:24:42,334
she'll turn a blind eye once the contract is signed.

413
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:44,845
CEO Yoon will get thrown away after being used.

414
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:49,315
That wasn't what I meant. Why are you taking it that far?

415
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:54,015
CEO Yoon. You just heard directly from Ms. Chae's friend.

416
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:58,555
Please think about whether Ms. Chae is a trustworthy person.

417
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:03,226
I should.

418
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:05,226
Thank you for the advice.

419
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,865
Shall we get going?

420
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:18,906
Yong Ju...

421
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:26,656
We'll head over first.

422
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:45,006
Do you believe I'm the type to do such a thing as Ms. Bang said?

(Uilhan Brewery)

424
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:52,045
Do you have nothing more to say?

425
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:57,716
I see.

426
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:03,125
CEO Yoon.

427
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:12,726
Do you mind listening to my story one last time?

428
00:26:18,605 --> 00:26:22,206
It is indeed true that the Busan branch's life...

429
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:23,805
depends on our contract.

430
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:27,075
It is my main purpose.

431
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:31,114
However, because of that main purpose,

432
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:35,156
I have no intention of using you or the villagers.

433
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,525
I know very well that...

434
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:40,824
this place is your everything,

435
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:43,595
just as the Busan branch is my everything.

436
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:47,666
That must be why staying here...

437
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:51,436
has made me curious about what kind of beer we'd make.

438
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:55,575
In other words, I want to work with you until the very end.

439
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:58,446
These are my true feelings.

440
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:03,085

You do know, don't you?

Whether I'm being sincere or not.

444
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:18,466
So, I hope you see me...

445
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:21,335
as who I am.

446
00:27:39,886 --> 00:27:41,656
What are we supposed to do with just these?

447
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:44,824
Good grief.

448
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:46,795
- Over here. - Hey.

449
00:27:47,696 --> 00:27:49,665
Is that everything from the brewery?

450
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,195
- Yes. - Oh, no.

00:27:57,035 --> 00:27:58,864
Are there no wholesale stores you can get in touch with?

- Goodness. - Just forget it.

458
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:08,775
Like I would. I'll keep calling. And lower your voice.

459
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:10,745
But there's no beer...

460
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:12,445
- in a beer festival. - That's what I mean.

461
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:13,455
- I'll continue to ring them. - It's ridiculous.

- What? - Why are you signing it with her?

492
00:29:38,305 --> 00:29:40,534
Did you not hear Ms. Bang's story?

493
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:42,906
- It's what I want to do. - Good.

00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:25,995
You can give me beer instead.

548
00:33:25,996 --> 00:33:28,034
Let's go to the brewery right this instant.

549
00:33:28,035 --> 00:33:29,896
- All of a sudden? What? - Hurry.

550
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:31,906
I'm sorry.

551
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:34,005
It's because of the part-time paycheck.

552
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:35,976
- Goodness. - Let's go.

553
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:39,406
- Oh, my days. - Try some of this, too.

554
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:54,926
You've drunk way more than your paycheck.

555
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:58,364
I gave it my best shot at acting so you could rest.

556
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:00,695
But why are you still here?

557
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:02,396
Go inside and sleep.

558
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:06,105
That's the very reason I can't let you drink alone.

559
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:14,215
Drink slowly, will you?

560
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:16,446
Appreciate the aroma of it as well.

561
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,625
The gentle scent of the hops is really nice.

562
00:34:27,596 --> 00:34:29,455
It's very interesting...

563
00:34:29,656 --> 00:34:33,125
how the taste and aroma of beer change according to the hops.

564
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:38,536
Hops...

565
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:43,375
barely take up one percent of the whole composition of beer.

566
00:34:44,176 --> 00:34:46,245
But that decides the flavor of the beer.

567
00:34:46,676 --> 00:34:49,846
Hence why beer is also called hop's juice.

568
00:34:50,616 --> 00:34:51,886
I see.

569
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,486
Sensitivity...

570
00:34:58,986 --> 00:35:00,826
is quite similar to hops.

571
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,696
I believe people have a sense of sensitivity.

572
00:35:07,995 --> 00:35:10,766
Depending on how much hop is in a beer,

573
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:13,676
the beer tastes rich or light.

574
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:18,475
Well, some like rich beers while others hate them.

575
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:21,315
It's a difference in taste.

576
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:23,716
So I also think...

577
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:27,415
the sensitivity of a person...

578
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:31,025
decides their personality.

579
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,295
I'm talking too much, aren't I?

580
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:41,196
No. Not at all.

581
00:35:44,636 --> 00:35:46,136
The strange thing is,

582
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:49,136
nobody complains that the beer is a defect...

583
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:52,446
despite the strong aroma from too much hops.

584
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:55,846
Neither do they put the disposal sticker on it.

585
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,415
But to people,

586
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:05,156
they're branded like a defect.

587
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:10,225
Here's an example.

588
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:13,125
With a single phrase, "This person is quite sensitive,"

589
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:18,205
that person gets categorized as unordinary.

590
00:36:20,676 --> 00:36:22,335
Then, who came up...

591
00:36:24,545 --> 00:36:26,006
with the standard of ordinary?

592
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:33,955
I'm talking too much.

593
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:39,555
Since earlier, you've been caring about...

594
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:41,795
how you're talking too much.

595
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:43,966
Isn't your hobby blocking people?

596
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:47,036
How careful of you.

597
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:54,236
I heard people who couldn't help but block others...

598
00:36:54,806 --> 00:36:58,875
were those who truly cared about them.

599
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:02,216
Am I right?

600
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:10,016
We're out of beer. I'll be right back.

601
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:22,136
This one is for me, right?

602
00:37:23,335 --> 00:37:24,335
Yes.

603
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:27,236
All right.

604
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:31,375
Let's pour.

605
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:34,275
She understands me...

606
00:37:35,915 --> 00:37:37,145
as who I am.

607
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:41,716
I'm going to bed first.

608
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:43,184
Okay. Get a good rest.

609
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:45,826
I'm going to finish all of those before going to bed.

610
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:49,995
By the way, where are you going to sleep?

611
00:37:50,326 --> 00:37:52,295
You can use the ladies' hideout...

612
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:55,664
I'll take care of it. Now then, go inside and rest.

613
00:37:55,665 --> 00:37:57,104
- Go now. - Wait.

614
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:58,536
Go inside.

615
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,536
- Hey... - Go.

616
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,104
- Goodnight. - Sleep indoors.

617
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:04,176
I will.

618
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:07,616
Don't drink everything.

619
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,815
I will. Bye.

620
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:17,286

Blows again

We will overcome

- We all have it rough. - One can train...

- not to be timid. - We all have it the same,

Come on. Let us buy it in Seoul too.

650

This is the best beer I've ever had.

656
00:42:34,145 --> 00:42:35,345

729
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:23,394
(Brewmaster CEO Yoon Min Ju)

730
00:47:23,395 --> 00:47:26,035
You'll probably be most curious about our factory,

731
00:47:26,036 --> 00:47:29,006
so I called ahead. Shall we?

732
00:47:30,705 --> 00:47:31,745
Together.

733
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:35,946
- Us all? - Don't ask.

734
00:48:22,426 --> 00:48:23,454
So tell me.

735
00:48:23,455 --> 00:48:26,326
How does it feel to be at Korea's largest brewery?

736
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:27,665
Well...

737
00:48:32,335 --> 00:48:34,475
The filter is huge.

738
00:48:35,576 --> 00:48:38,045
No way! What a spot.

739
00:48:38,346 --> 00:48:41,475
If I stick a straw in this tank, beer will come out...

740
00:48:42,076 --> 00:48:45,216
pouring!

741
00:48:45,815 --> 00:48:47,045
He's silly.

742
00:48:47,756 --> 00:48:49,185
Just silly.

743
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,624
Hello, sir.

744
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:00,165
I'm Chae Yong Ju, the team leader of the new beer task force.

745
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:03,495
This is CEO Yoon Min Ju, our new partner and brewmaster.

746
00:49:04,065 --> 00:49:05,435
You're on the younger side.

747
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:07,406
- Sir? - Whatever.

748
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:10,805
Here, we don't condone sloppy work...

749
00:49:10,806 --> 00:49:13,275
even though the chairman got you this job.

750
00:49:13,946 --> 00:49:15,176
Do you hear me?

751
00:49:19,745 --> 00:49:22,786
Of course. I have no intention of being sloppy anyway.

752
00:49:25,455 --> 00:49:26,525
Sure.

753
00:49:33,326 --> 00:49:37,196
That charisma.

754
00:49:46,506 --> 00:49:47,506
A team dinner?

755
00:49:49,616 --> 00:49:51,814
It's our first day being on this task force.

756
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:53,986
Shouldn't we eat out as a team?

757
00:49:55,216 --> 00:49:57,016
Raise your hand if you agree.

758
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,825
It can be a burden to some,

759
00:49:59,826 --> 00:50:01,524
so let's agree on another date and time.

760
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:03,895
- I wouldn't mind a drink. - Nice.

761
00:50:04,056 --> 00:50:05,125
Ah Reum,

762
00:50:05,565 --> 00:50:07,895
- what has gotten into you? - What?

763
00:50:09,196 --> 00:50:11,205
How about this, then?

764
00:50:11,536 --> 00:50:13,705
We'll stay for just two hours.

765
00:50:14,036 --> 00:50:16,935
- Only until sundown. Two hours. - Two hours?

766
00:50:17,006 --> 00:50:18,006
Sure.

767
00:50:29,656 --> 00:50:33,426
There's something I wanted to challenge CEO Yoon with.

768
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:37,394
I honestly don't get what makes you so great as a brewmaster...

769
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:40,425
that had the chairman himself order us...

770
00:50:40,426 --> 00:50:41,596
to make a deal with you.

771
00:50:41,895 --> 00:50:44,164
No way. People like him exist.

772
00:50:44,165 --> 00:50:46,105
A youngster who rudely speaks his mind.

773
00:50:48,576 --> 00:50:51,645
I challenge you to a beer tasting competition.

774
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:54,516
What do you say? Doesn't it sound like fun?

775
00:50:55,616 --> 00:50:56,645
I'm in.

776
00:50:57,116 --> 00:50:58,616
You're in?

777
00:51:00,386 --> 00:51:03,084
All right. Here are ten glasses of domestic and imported beer...

778
00:51:03,085 --> 00:51:05,655
that can be easily obtained.

779
00:51:05,656 --> 00:51:07,855
Get over eight of them right and...

780
00:51:07,955 --> 00:51:11,826
Strike that. Get more than seven, and you get my stamp of approval.

781
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,625
Okay.

782
00:51:22,736 --> 00:51:23,736
What?

783
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:26,006
Hold on. Are you going to guess all ten at once?

784
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:28,875
Maybe it's because he's confused.

785
00:51:33,315 --> 00:51:35,855
Let's do this. Will he succeed or not?

786
00:51:36,156 --> 00:51:38,156
- The bet is 50 cents. - I bet on him failing.

787
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:41,826
Even a gifted brewmaster couldn't possibly guess them all.

788
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,774
Tasting different beers back to back...

789
00:52:01,775 --> 00:52:03,446
is how you identify their unique flavors.

790
00:52:04,145 --> 00:52:05,915
One to three were brewed by major companies in Korea.

791
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:07,585
Beer number one.

792
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:09,986
It's the beer that dominates beer sales in Korea.

793
00:52:10,556 --> 00:52:12,655
It has a clean finish compared to the other two,

794
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:14,826
but the aroma of the hop isn't as strong.

795
00:52:15,395 --> 00:52:17,794
The carbonation is moderate,

796
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:19,596
and it mixes well with soju.

797
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:22,335
At ABV of 4.4 percent, this is Baekmok Liquor's Tenns.

798
00:52:24,506 --> 00:52:25,806
That is correct.

799
00:52:26,105 --> 00:52:27,136
Beer number two.

800
00:52:28,176 --> 00:52:30,104
No explanation is needed.

801
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,774
An intense level of malt.

802
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:33,975
The mouthfeel is soft and creamy.

803
00:52:34,775 --> 00:52:37,016
It's not as popular as Tenns,

804
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:39,085
but it has loyal fans.

805
00:52:40,045 --> 00:52:42,616
It must've been stored a while ago though.

806
00:52:43,085 --> 00:52:44,455
It's not as fresh as it should be.

807
00:52:45,156 --> 00:52:47,625
At ABV of 4.8 percent, this is Jisang Liquor's Likey.

808
00:52:48,955 --> 00:52:50,096
That's another one.

809
00:52:51,025 --> 00:52:52,124
Beer number three.

810
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,795
At ABV of 5 percent, this is The Shot.

811
00:52:53,995 --> 00:52:55,064
Beer number four.

812
00:52:55,065 --> 00:52:56,935
At ABV of 4.8 percent, this is Feelit.

813
00:52:57,736 --> 00:52:59,406
Realrein. Europa.

814
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:01,036
Fresh Gravity.

815
00:53:01,205 --> 00:53:03,406
The Barley. Only Malt.

816
00:53:05,006 --> 00:53:07,946
And beer number ten is dubbed the queen's beer.

817
00:53:08,915 --> 00:53:09,975
It's QueenB.

818
00:53:11,645 --> 00:53:12,815
How is this possible?

819
00:53:13,846 --> 00:53:14,886
No way.

820
00:53:18,855 --> 00:53:21,395
Did I get any of them wrong? I doubt it.

821
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:23,656
- No way. - Unbelievable.

822
00:53:23,926 --> 00:53:26,665
Rather than a brewmaster,

823
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:28,866
you're an MCB.

824
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,165
A man crazy for beer.

825
00:53:38,846 --> 00:53:41,676
Didn't you have faith in me? That's what it seemed like.

826
00:53:41,915 --> 00:53:44,116
I have absolute faith in you now.

827
00:53:44,716 --> 00:53:47,545
That hypersensitivity of yours is a gift!

828
00:53:50,116 --> 00:53:53,225
I've rarely had people tell me it was a gift.

829
00:53:54,185 --> 00:53:55,225
Up top.

830
00:53:58,995 --> 00:54:00,225
That was incredible.

831
00:54:02,096 --> 00:54:03,196
Wasn't it incredible?

832
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:05,935
No way.

833
00:54:12,745 --> 00:54:13,806
Seriously.

834
00:54:17,846 --> 00:54:20,545
Don't you think you've all been drinking too much?

835
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:25,585
I'm just as talented, you know.

836
00:54:25,886 --> 00:54:26,886
Sorry?

837
00:54:27,185 --> 00:54:29,725
- I'm gifted at darts. - That's out of the blue.

838
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:33,025
Then, let's go head to head.

839
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:35,795
Loser suffers a blow to the head.

840
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,236
Okay. Bring it on.

841
00:54:38,665 --> 00:54:41,676
Mr. Kang, please don't.

842
00:54:52,946 --> 00:54:54,216
Couldn't you cut him some slack?

843
00:54:55,315 --> 00:54:56,386
What on earth?

844
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:11,906
Take that!

845
00:55:18,846 --> 00:55:20,645
I'm actually better at arm wrestling.

846
00:55:20,846 --> 00:55:22,774
Come on. I doubt that.

847
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:23,974
Anyone can tell he'll win.

848
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:25,945
How about we call it a day?

849
00:55:25,946 --> 00:55:27,215
You'll get hurt at this rate.

850
00:55:27,216 --> 00:55:29,116
Yong Ju, don't baby me.

851
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:34,056
Guys, release your grips a bit.

852
00:55:34,525 --> 00:55:37,326
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

853
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:54,744
Who on earth is this man?

854
00:55:54,745 --> 00:55:55,745
Beats me.

855
00:55:55,915 --> 00:55:58,846
A fool who's good at everything.

856
00:56:01,616 --> 00:56:04,085
One last game. Play one last game with me.

857
00:56:05,926 --> 00:56:08,826
What else am I good at?

858
00:56:09,355 --> 00:56:12,065
That's right. We'll see who can stay underwater longer.

859
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:19,236
- Staying underwater? - Yes.

860
00:56:19,366 --> 00:56:21,704
- That's enough. The end. - Yong Ju, don't stop me.

861
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:23,835
I'm known as the seal of Busan.

862
00:56:23,975 --> 00:56:26,145
You say that because you haven't seen a professional diver.

863
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:40,155
Because of you, he has a bump on his forehead.

864
00:56:40,156 --> 00:56:41,695
That's enough.

865
00:56:41,696 --> 00:56:43,656
I warned you to back out.

866
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:45,195
Is there anything you're actually good at?

867
00:56:45,196 --> 00:56:46,196
It has been way more...

868
00:56:46,197 --> 00:56:47,795
- than two hours. - Don't hit him so hard.

869
00:56:48,136 --> 00:56:49,164
- Sure. - Unbelievable.

870
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:50,465
That's enough.

871
00:56:50,466 --> 00:56:52,236
I proved my case.

872
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,335
I had fun.

873
00:56:58,275 --> 00:56:59,506
It was a long day, everyone.

874
00:56:59,745 --> 00:57:02,415
I'll head home first, then.

875
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,015
- Sure. - Get home safely.

876
00:57:04,016 --> 00:57:05,485
- Thanks. - Did you catch a cab?

877
00:57:05,486 --> 00:57:06,585
I did.

878
00:57:06,745 --> 00:57:08,755
- I'll get going too. - Good night.

879
00:57:08,756 --> 00:57:09,955
- Have a good night. - Night.

880
00:57:13,786 --> 00:57:15,524
- Look how late it is. - Get going.

881
00:57:15,525 --> 00:57:16,995
I'll get going.

882
00:57:18,826 --> 00:57:20,525
Mr. Yoon, where are you headed?

883
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:21,766
Well...

884
00:57:24,495 --> 00:57:27,335
I probably should stop by a pharmacy first.

885
00:57:30,176 --> 00:57:31,306
It serves you right.

886
00:57:31,745 --> 00:57:33,545
That's what you get for not listening to me.

887
00:57:35,315 --> 00:57:36,346
Unbelievable.

888
00:57:38,685 --> 00:57:39,946
- Here. - Thanks.

889
00:58:02,506 --> 00:58:03,935
Did I or did I not...

890
00:58:04,775 --> 00:58:06,576
forbid you from losing your temper?

891
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,345
It wasn't like that.

892
00:58:08,346 --> 00:58:10,975
I wanted to show people what I was good at.

893
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:15,315
Unbelievable.

894
00:58:26,266 --> 00:58:27,295
Hold on.

895
00:58:28,295 --> 00:58:30,665
Don't tell me you're burning hot.

896
00:58:31,605 --> 00:58:33,065
You are on the warmer side.

897
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,705
He has a crush on her.

898
00:58:43,016 --> 00:58:45,846
This'll take time to heal. I can't believe you.

899
00:58:46,616 --> 00:58:48,756
Kang Beom likes Chae Yong Ju.

900
00:58:50,256 --> 00:58:51,786
I doubt you're sick though.

901
00:58:52,426 --> 00:58:53,525
These...

902
00:58:54,256 --> 00:58:55,556
aren't my feelings.

903
00:58:56,355 --> 00:58:57,495
These aren't mine.

904
00:58:58,266 --> 00:58:59,495
Don't be confused.

905
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,036
Focus on yourself, Min Ju.

906
00:59:03,136 --> 00:59:04,236
Focus.

907
00:59:06,065 --> 00:59:07,466
Why is it suddenly raining?

908
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:10,036
We should take shelter.

909
00:59:17,076 --> 00:59:18,116
What's with him?

910
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:20,346
- Head there first. - Sure.

911
00:59:55,915 --> 00:59:56,986
Shall we get going?

912
01:00:07,525 --> 01:00:08,596
Am I wrong?

913
01:00:12,165 --> 01:00:13,366
Are these emotions...

914
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:15,435
mine?

915
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:11,695
(Brewing Love)

916
01:01:11,696 --> 01:01:14,065
I was thinking about holding a workshop.

917
01:01:14,795 --> 01:01:16,035
You said you'd take care of it...

918
01:01:16,036 --> 01:01:17,366
if we needed to be together.

919
01:01:17,795 --> 01:01:19,164
That time is now.

920
01:01:19,165 --> 01:01:22,636
Let us go fishing, then.

921
01:01:22,835 --> 01:01:24,735
We need to do a job together.

922
01:01:24,736 --> 01:01:25,745
Get moving.

923
01:01:25,946 --> 01:01:27,045
Ding-dong-deng.

924
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:30,116
- Did you fall for me? - Don't be ridiculous.

925
01:01:30,576 --> 01:01:31,644
But you did.

926
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:32,815
Do I like her?

927
01:01:33,645 --> 01:01:36,156
Am I actually feeling my own emotions?

928
01:01:37,256 --> 01:01:39,386
They're mine. I'm sure of it.
