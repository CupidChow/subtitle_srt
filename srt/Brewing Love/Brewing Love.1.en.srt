00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,128
(Scenes with child actors and animals were filmed...)

(Episode 1)

16
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:48,769
Mr. Lee, where are you?

17
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:50,209
Hurry up, will you?

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,579
Come on. A single truck won't be big enough...

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,849
to load all the beers there.

20
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,750
- It'll take a moment. - Don't forget the cash.

21
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:59,278
I'm in a rush and practically giving these away.

22
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:01,750
I'm well aware of that. Why else would I be risking my life?

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,819
Are you sure Jisang doesn't know about this?

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,018
If Mad Dog Yong Ju comes by, it'll be over for us.

25
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,090
I know that,

26
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,288
so get here before she does.

27
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,159
Sure thing. Hang tight.

28
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:13,869
I won't be long.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,470
Mr. Lee, that was fast.

30
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,470
(Special Task Force)

31
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,879
(Special Task Force)

32
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:31,950
That was fast, wasn't it?

33
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,580
Goodness.

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,720
Ms. Chae.

35
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,360
Ms. Chae,

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,859
what brings you by this early? And in a wing truck of all things.

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,599
You're asking as if you don't know.

38
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:47,330
Well, I don't.

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,970
Then allow me to explain in person.

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,670
According to the Liquor Tax Act, manufacturers...

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,669
cannot make direct sales to small business establishments...

42
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,840
and supermarkets.

43
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,809
That's why wholesalers...

44
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,450
lay a bridge between those two parties.

45
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,950
- Like yourself. - Right.

46
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,148
But that dear wholesaler...

47
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:08,819
received beer on credit...

48
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,218
and is selling it to small businesses at a discount...

49
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:14,929
while planning to take off without paying the manufacturer.

50
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,860
No wonder I had to come here at the crack of dawn.

51
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,360
Well,

52
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:22,969
I would've paid if I had the money.

53
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,600
Search me, why don't you?

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,200
I don't have a single penny.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,439
As if I don't know you have it rough.

56
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,268
That's why I supplied beer for a year...

57
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,640
without taking payment first.

58
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,510
- Mr. Park. - Hold on a second.

59
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,050
You see, I...

60
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,149
Well, hold on.

61
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:52,029
Darn it.

62
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,110
What...

63
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,279
Oh, no.

64
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,419
Must you take it this far?

65
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,320
I'm doomed anyway, so what's there I won't do?

66
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,760
I have nothing to lose.

67
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,760
Get lost in your wing truck while I ask nicely.

68
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,699
- Mr. Park. - Get lost, darn it!

69
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,760
Get lost.

70
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,499
Why you... Get lost.

71
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,309
Are you all right?

72
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,119
That serves you right for coming at me.

73
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,420
Darn.

74
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,589
Yes, Mr. Lee. I'm heading out there right now.

75
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,399
Darn it. Mr. Lee!

76
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,330
Why are you just standing out here when...

77
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,040
- Whatever. Let's move the beer. - How?

78
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,839
I can't get my trucks in here.

79
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,640
Don't whine. We don't have much time.

80
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,640
Jisang Liquor is already here.

81
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,879
Darn it.

82
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,189
You! Move your cars.

83
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:23,920
I already have an agreement with Ms. Chae.

84
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,359
Ms. Chae...

85
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,888
(Jisang Liquor)

86
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,428
(A few hours ago)

87
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:30,590
Thanks for coming this early in the morning.

88
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,058
I bet Mr. Park is cooking something today.

89
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:34,368
I'm getting a bad feeling.

90
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:37,169
He still won't get the best of us when we have Ms. Chae in our corner.

91
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,770
- What's there to worry? - You're right.

92
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,339
Wholesalers always give you a headache.

93
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,340
Don't give all wholesalers a bad name, Mr. Kang.

94
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,139
During our worst times,

95
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:47,709
it's the wholesalers...

96
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,309
who buy our beer promising us they'll sell them.

97
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,949
Mr. Park and Mr. Lee are the rotten apples.

98
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,220
She's absolutely right, you punk.

99
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,319
Let's get this over with and grab some breakfast.

100
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,259
Sounds good. All right.

101
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,229
- Let's go! - Let's go!

102
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,659
(Back to a while ago)

103
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,730
Mr. Park.

104
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,770
The sun is out.

105
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:14,739
Let's wrap this up.

106
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:17,238
Pay us back until the end of the month,

107
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,639
or we'll press charges.

108
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,308
You can be punished by imprisonment for up to ten years...

109
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,049
or by a fine of under 20,000 dollars.

110
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,650
- You know the drill. - Yes.

111
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,780
Mr. Park and Mr. Lee who we call family.

112
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,948
Have another good day.

113
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:30,220
- Sure. - Thank you.

114
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,389
I'm Chae Yong Ju.

115
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:49,009
Gosh, don't.

116
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:52,040
- We'll have ours, ma'am. - Sure thing.

117
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:53,739
Here.

118
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,550
There you go.

119
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,849
Finally, we were able to take care of Mr. Park and his co-conspirator.

120
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,949
Good job, everyone.

121
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,520
Shall we fill our glasses?

122
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,198
Selling our product...

123
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,800
- That is a job half-done. - That is a job half-done.

124
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,399
How do we complete our business?

125
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,008
- By collecting the bill. - By collecting the bill.

126
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,110
(Pop)

127
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,610
I'm sorry, but I'm not one to drink soju.

128
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,550
Who pops open a beer bottle...

129
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
with a spoon?

130
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,759
He joined us from another division...

131
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,988
and doesn't know any better. I'm sorry.

132
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:42,329
- I should've educated him. - It's all right.

133
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:44,230
Hey, new recruit.

134
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:47,030
Many open bottles with spoons,

135
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,139
but people like us who brew and sell liquor...

136
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,869
only open them with bottle openers.

137
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:57,539
Why? When a spoon is used,

138
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,309
bottles can easily be chipped...

139
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,280
which turns them into scrap.

140
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,710
Hold on a second.

141
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:05,579
Unbelievable. This one's chipped. Sir?

142
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,249
It is our duty...

143
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,989
to make sure they can be recycled.

144
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,720
To us, 13 cents isn't chump change.

145
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,489
You punk.

146
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,530
Isn't that what Ms. Chae said when you joined the company?

147
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,869
Beom, you're all grown up.

148
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,429
That was years ago.

149
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,869
I'm no longer the youngest member of this team.

150
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,808
I'm an assistant manager now.

151
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,239
Has it been that long already?

152
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,749
Either way, welcome to the world of liquor!

153
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,789
(Brewing Love)

154
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,758
(Grilled tofu, Kongguksu)

155
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,328
You were this big when I first saw you.

156
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:55,399
Is that the infamous black special ops uniform...

157
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,368
that Ms. Chae wears...

158
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,039
when she goes out to collect payment?

159
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,069
- I can't believe it. - Fetching, right?

160
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,709
- It's killer. - It's pretty.

161
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,479
I heard it was Ms. Chae who had this beer...

162
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,579
rank second in sales in Busan.

163
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,379
She worked her butt off with all the guys here.

164
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,689
Up until six years ago,

165
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,160
all we wanted was for people to try our beer just once.

166
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,730
But that's tougher than you think.

167
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,259
You see, people stick to what they usually drink.

168
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,170
They rarely try a different brand.

169
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:31,370
We were calling it quits since there wasn't a solution.

170
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,910
However, there was one person who wouldn't give up.

171
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,419
Hello, I'm here to promote Likey.

172
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
It's delicious. Please try it.

173
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:47,920
Thank you.

174
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,589
Yong Ju, this is something we should do together.

175
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,859
She did everything in her power.

176
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,300
Don't just stand there.

177
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,169
Hello, I'm here to promote Likey.

178
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,328
She made it happen one way or another.

179
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,140
This is a hangover relief that pairs well with Likey.

180
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,469
- Thank you. - Thank you.

181
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,369
Hello, I'm here to promote Likey.

182
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,240
- Please try it. - We present Likey.

183
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:11,979
- Goodness. - No way.

184
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:13,578
We're promoting Likey!

185
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,509
There are no duds.

186
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,308
- There. 2 bottles! - There. 2 bottles!

187
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,050
People only drank liquor sold by Baekmok Liquor,

188
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,318
but that's how Jisang was able to catch up.

189
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:22,349
Yes!

190
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,688
Sir, my goodness.

191
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,619
- What happened? - Sir.

192
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,990
Yong Ju, you're here.

193
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,929
- You must be busy, so thank you. - Ta-da.

194
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:34,699
Switch the products to Likey.

195
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,698
- That's right. - This is what the chairman likes.

196
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,199
- All of them. - You won't believe it.

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
Just do it.

198
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,339
All that's left...

199
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,979
is to rank first in sale.

200
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:47,849
Mr. Kang, aren't you coming?

201
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:49,478
Sorry?

202
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,510
- Let's go. - Sure.

203
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,579
- Come on. - Right.

204
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,420
I see you all left your drinks untouched again.

205
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:58,219
Here you go.

206
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,959
But there's more to the business than just sales.

207
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,799
Bottles must be constantly sold and in bulk...

208
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,760
for the liquor and money to circulate.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,199
Since we couldn't make that happen,

210
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,169
wholesalers started to take the liquor on credit,

211
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,300
not pay us back,

212
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,939
and run.

213
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,409
That gave birth to the legendary Lady in Black.

214
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,579
(Lady in Black at High-speed)

215
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:07,760
(Special Task Force)

216
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,229
Mad Dog Yong Ju?

217
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,500
It's really her.

218
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,140
Darn.

219
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,780
Take it, okay?

220
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,699
- Okay. - That's when we learned...

221
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:47,098
how Ms. Chae always delivers...

222
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,000
when dressed in black.

223
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:52,000
She's hardcore.

224
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:54,140
Hardcore.

225
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,469
Did you hear about the HQ liquor team?

226
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,670
No.

227
00:11:57,671 --> 00:12:00,009
The chairman is paying the team a visit...

228
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,349
to deliver an order.

229
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,779
The chairman will visit in person?

230
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,780
- Yes. - No way.

231
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:07,319
Isn't that the same as a four-star visiting a base?

232
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,949
- That gave me goosebumps. - Exactly.

233
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,660
It's the first in ten years.

234
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,630
Last night, the chairman's secretary ordered...

235
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:17,290
the Planning Team and Marketing Team to prepare a meeting...

236
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,630
which has them on high alert.

237
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:20,500
That's horrendous.

238
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,000
Both teams will be getting any sleep.

239
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,599
But why is he paying them a visit?

240
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:27,199
(Naro Beer)

241
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:32,309
Who is it?

242
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:38,020
Who is Yoon Min Ju, the brewer of this beer?

243
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,828
(Step 1: Pour milled malt into mash tun)

244
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,029
(Mash tun: A vessel designed...)

245
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,300
(to optimize glucose concentration of barley)

246
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,229
His name is Yoon Min Ju.

247
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,068
He became certified by graduating...

248
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,929
from the Brewmaster course at VLB in Germany.

249
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,370
For four years, he has been running his own brewery...

250
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,170
in Yangjin of South Chungcheong Province.

251
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,540
His hops are grown and his pub downtown is run...

252
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,910
by people in the village he hired.

253
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,280
That's 934g.

254
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,289
In 2021, he first released...

255
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,089
his craft beer "In My Name."

256
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,390
In short, it's called Naro Beer.

257
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,229
The beer is currently only known to people in that region.

258
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,910
Why can't we brew beer like this?

259
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,550
If you can't, have him join us.

260
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,990
Buy the rights to Naro Beer...

261
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,559
or develop a new beer together.

262
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,959
By any means necessary,

263
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,490
have him join us at Jisang.

264
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,359
Yoon Min Ju.

265
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,599
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

266
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,949
An emergency meeting has been called.

267
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:51,479
Gather in my office.

268
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,870
Wait. Where's Bang Ah Reum?

269
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:17,640
Well...

270
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,140
You know how she values her lunch hour.

271
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,609
- We'll discuss it first and... - Seriously?

272
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,120
As if we'll come up with anything without her.

273
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,449
Call her.

274
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,890
Have her back at the office.

275
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,620
Yes, sir.

276
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,149
(Bootlicker)

277
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,120
I'm sorry, but I'm still on my lunch break.

278
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,030
Please take a look.

279
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:21,839
(The one who will always take my side)

280
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:25,510
Let's begin.

281
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,780
Sure. Ms. Bang Ah Reum.

282
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,578
Section chief at Jisang Liquor's Planning Team.

283
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,120
(Section Chief Bang Ah Reum)

284
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:35,319
You reside in Hanan-dong...

285
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:39,390
and own a building, two cars,

286
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,589
and two convenience stores.

287
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:43,890
The cash you have is...

288
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,300
Is that enough to be Grade A?

289
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,609
We'll get back to you after verifying your identity.

290
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:58,609
Are there certain things you look for in a husband?

291
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,750
I...

292
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,980
only care about one thing.

293
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,919
That's all I'm looking for.

294
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,780
Which is...

295
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,419
Perfection.

296
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,230
Just that. That's all I want.

297
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:56,899
(Hwi's Toast)

298
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,068
(It's actually...)

299
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:00,770
(Chungcheong Province)

300
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:02,638
(Where there's a will, there is a way.)

301
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:05,309
Sebastian, shall we embark on our journey again?

302
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,139
All right!

303
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:15,089
(Hwi's Toast)

304
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,059
(Hwi's Toast)

305
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,359
(Uilhan Brewery)

306
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:31,129
(Uilhan Brewery)

307
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:38,339
Hello?

308
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,609
Isn't anyone here?

309
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,389
Yes, this is it.

310
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,800
What the...

311
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,270
You startled me.

312
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Hello.

313
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,250
You made this, didn't you?

314
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,579
It's nothing weird.

315
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,780
I sell toast sandwiches from my truck,

316
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,319
and I fell in love with your beer after having it at a pub yesterday.

317
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,559
I came across your brewery while on the road, so I dropped by.

318
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,129
I'm not some weirdo.

319
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,730
Okay, fine.

320
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,139
I lied about randomly passing by.

321
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:41,240
I sought out this place.

322
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,308
Can you give me a job?

323
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:45,510
You can pay me with your beer.

324
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,720
Are you one to draw lines?

325
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:57,919
Is that a no?

326
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,960
It's just that I love your beer.

327
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,059
"Maybe working here will get me all the beer I want."

328
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,730
I only came by with that innocent thought in mind.

329
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:11,069
I can't work here full-time,

330
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:13,899
but I'll come the second you need me.

331
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,149
Why aren't you saying anything?

332
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,559
Like I said, I'm not a weirdo.

333
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,589
- I know that. - Exactly.

334
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,760
What? You know that? Really?

335
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,559
But even I thought I was being weird.

336
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,230
Why is he so handsome?

337
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:22,710
Oh, my.

00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,040
I'll call you when I need your help.

340
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,480
Sorry?

341
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,950
Oh, awesome! I never thought this would work out!

342
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:33,479
You're so cool.

343
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,190
That's my thing!

344
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,049

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,190
No taking back!

I'm Oh Chan Hwi.

348
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,760
Please, call me later.

349
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,869
Wait.

350
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:57,409
Can I get an advance for beer?

351
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,279
I just want to send a few bottles...

352
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,109
to my sister who lives in Busan.

353
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,220
Chae Yong Ju!

354
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,929
Why? Did you hurt yourself?

355
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,529
Just a little bit.

356
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,368
You're so careless.

357
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:28,908
You're a former special force. Don't be such a crybaby.

358
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:29,939
I didn't.

359
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,139
I'm totally fine. Gosh...

360
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,908
Surely, you got our company's product?

361
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:37,180
You're a true salesperson to the bone!

362
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,419
Does the company ever acknowledge your loyalty?

363
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,348
Tell them you want a raise!

364
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:43,618
That's my job. I do what I have to do.

365
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:45,260
I wouldn't be able to do that.

366
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,628
But at least you look good.

367
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:50,559
Yes, at least I make ends meet.

368
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,930
- What's that? - I brought you a present.

369
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,168
I was in Chungcheong Province today,

370
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:00,839
and I found an incredibly-tasting beer.

371
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,539
Did you even buy a glass?

372
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,608
I knew you were sometimes a little crazy.

373
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:08,409
No, the guy who brews this beer isn't normal.

374
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,980
At first, he drew a strict line between us.

375
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,250
- Here you are. - Oh, my.

376
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:19,389
By the way, how will you drink it?

377
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,089
- I'll drink it as is. - Wait a second, then.

378
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:30,329
Here.

379
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,439
(Uilhan Brewery)

380
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,200
Poor into this special glass and then, drink it.

381
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,939
If you drink it without a glass,

382
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,839
you can't fully savor the flavor because it's trapped inside.

383
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,050
I see.

384
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:45,379
Yes, if that's what you recommend.

385
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,849
By the way, we haven't met before,

386
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,190
but you gave me beer, a glass, and even a job.

387
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,659
Why? How could you possibly trust me?

388
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:01,599
No particular reasons. You seem to be a good guy.

389
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,440
Oh, I'm touched by your words.

390
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,500
I didn't even give off my charm,

391
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,669
but have you already noticed mine?

392
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,349
I have a keen sense of figuring out people.

393
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,308
Gosh.

394
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:21,780
He recognized my good personality at once.

395
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,989
Perhaps I was unintentionally giving off my charms.

396
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,389
Shut it before I hit you.

397
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,430
Okay.

398
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:32,159
Anyway,

399
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,869
he was surely a strange person.

400
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:39,639
I felt as if he was seeing through me.

401
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,010
Gosh, I can't explain this feeling.

402
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,940
"Man, I already know everything."

403
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:49,180
That was what his eyes were telling me.

404
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,980
Gosh!

405
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:57,690
This tastes unbelievably good!

406
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,289
This one should be our company's!

407
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,158
Tell me who made this again!

408
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,959
Brewmaster Yoon Min Ju!

409
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,930
"In My Name, Yoon Min Ju?"

410
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,029
Gosh...

411
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,030
(Naro Beer)

412
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,669
What the heck are you doing from the early morning?

413
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,109
But...

414
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:56,279
You really drive me crazy.

415
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,808
You'll burn to death under the scorching sun...

416
00:25:57,809 --> 00:25:59,449
if you act the fool like that.

417
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,618
I mean, you may die!

418
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:03,190
Start working already! Hurry up!

419
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,790
But I'm the boss.

420
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,898
I envy you so much.

421
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:19,200
No one gives a darn about what you do or don't do.

422
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,440
But I have two jobs, you know?

423
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,470
Time is gold,

424
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,980
so stop fooling around now.

425
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,109
I'm not the one wasting time talking.

426
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,480
What?

427
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:39,019
He should speak louder if he wants to say something.

428
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,519
Leave him alone.

429
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,658
He wants to say something to you, hoping you won't hear it.

430
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,529
Then, why did he say it?

431
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,760
Anyway,

432
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,899
- it's not my thing. - Me neither.

433
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,398
(A bug)

434
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:54,470
Gosh.

435
00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:56,569
Block!

436
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:59,838
That "block" again?

437
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,179
Why is he fussing over such a little bug?

438
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,509
- Right? - Goodness.

439
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,019
No one would share affection with him.

440
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,648
He's actually a poor guy.

441
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:11,520
What are you talking about?

442
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,388
- He's a boss in the end. - Oh, I see.

443
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:16,960
Ladies, you are also blocked for five minutes.

444
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:20,800
- What nonsense! - What rubbish!

445
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:25,869
Oh, she finally came.

446
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:28,639
The queen has finally arrived.

447
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,510
- Let me see. - Gosh.

448
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,389
Jjuan is such a blessed girl.

449
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:51,158
How could one get such a good husband?

450
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:52,229
You simply can't.

451
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,559
You couldn't find anyone even when you're over 50.

452
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,169
Hello.

453
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,609
I'm late.

454
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,210
Sorry.

455
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:05,979
Why didn't you get more sleep...

456
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,638
- and come tomorrow instead? - Stop!

457
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:11,148
Stop fooling around.

458
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,520
My love will literally come tomorrow!

459
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,449
No, forget what I said!

460
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,558
Why are your lips out so long again?

461
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,490
You could even hang clothes on them.

462
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:24,889
Jjuan!

463
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,499
- You look so bright today. - What?

464
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,328
In what sense?

465
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:32,030
How can one interpret this face like that?

466
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,439
CEO Yoon, you are...

467
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,709
such a good mind reader!

468
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,539
A mind reader and not a chicken sexer?

469
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,239
Are you kidding me?

470
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,108
Shall we start working now?

471
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:45,009
This way. Slowly.

472
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,619
Slowly. Relax.

473
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,019
Oh, your legs are so long.

474
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,818
You jumped over it at once.

475
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:53,159
Now it's time to wear this hat.

476
00:28:54,059 --> 00:29:00,530
Where is my sweet husband who will help me wear my hat?

477
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,030
He left...

478
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,829
for a new life.

479
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,540
Let him be.

480
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,108
Didn't they say they were busy? When will they start working?

481
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:14,809
Let's have one together. In 1, 2, 3. That's it.

482
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,710
I'm the only one working.

483
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,399
Here it comes.

484
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,970
- Darn. - I will drop it there.

485
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,270
- Let's work together... - Be careful.

486
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,368
It's already 11am.

487
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:46,079
Let's go for lunch now...

488
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,010
and start again when the sun goes a bit down.

489
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,519
- Whenever the times... - Whenever the times...

490
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,220
- Gosh. - Guys,

491
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:58,750
we'll have lunch at home.

492
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,419
Enjoy your meals.

493
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,859
Enjoy and eat as much as you want.

494
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,299
Let's go back.

495
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,460
Darn.

496
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:11,669
(- Let's go and eat lunch. - Ok, let's go.)

497
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,638
(- Enjoy your meal. - See you.)

498
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:16,209
(Enjoy your meal and see you later.)

499
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,339
Let's go.

500
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,849
They suck all my energy.

00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,280
I love this quietness so much.

503
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,250
Who's it?

Hello. This is Bang Ah Reum from the Planning Team...

506
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:17,500
- of Jisang Liquor. - "Hello."

507
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,828
- Jisang Liquor... - As I couldn't reach you,

508
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm leaving you a message.

509
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,368
- We would like to visit you... - Jisang Liquor?

510
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:24,210
in person to make you a great offer.

511
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,379
- Will you be available? - I'm sorry. My answer is no.

512
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480

00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,059
Fine. Do whatever you want.

(17th Village Chief of Baegok-ri, Very Nice Man)

516
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:55,398
Hi, everyone.

517
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:57,169
Long time no see.

518
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,540
But I see myself every day.

519
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,879
Let's get to work! Come on, let's work.

520
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:10,118
What do you think you're doing?

521
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,858
Why are you sitting between a husband and a wife?

522
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:15,290
In our village, public displays of affection are not allowed.

523
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,690
What kind of law is that?

524
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,459
So you can do whatever you want because you're the village chief?

525
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,499
Yes, I can!

526
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,529
And you too, Jjuan.

527
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,168
You must follow our village's policy.

528
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:24,300
Understood?

529
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:27,300
What's wrong with you? Is there a funeral today?

530
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,470
Why do you say that? She looks happy today.

531
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,909
- Yes. - Right?

532
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:35,578
My gosh, I get it. Marrying Kim would be like...

533
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,279
going to a funeral for a beautiful girl like her.

534
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,878
It would be a funeral that never ends.

535
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:39,979
- What are you talking about? - My gosh.

536
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,848
That's not true! No.

537
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:43,148
My love, don't listen to him.

538
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:45,819
Think of him as a barking dog.

539
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:48,019
Get away from her. Separate!

540
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,089
- Right now! - What?

541
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:51,930
You're so loud.

542
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,399
How did you learn to say that?

543
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,040
I guess you're trying to be a native English speaker.

544
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,309
What?

545
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:06,109
I'm no native speaker. Mr. Yoon here is the native speaker.

546
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,440
Didn't you say you went to a beer school abroad?

547
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:11,609
Was that in Germany? Hello!

548
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:13,419
Is that so?

549
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,148
Then if you speak any German or whatever they speak over there,

550
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:19,220
say something in their language. Come on, show us.

551
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,489
What?

552
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,929
Why was he born with a mouth if he's never going to talk?

553
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,959
Let him be.

554
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,299
I bet his mouth didn't want to be born on his face either.

555
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,668
It was just stuck with that face.

556
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:31,069
His mouth did nothing wrong.

557
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,069
Mr. Yoon.

558
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:36,510
Be honest. You can hear everything, right?

559
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,349
Yes. I can hear you...

560
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:46,419
well.

561
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,249
We know that you can hear us.

562
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,389
Why would you wear a headset? You'll just get a heat rash.

563
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:54,359
My goodness.

564
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,558
It's already 6pm. You all should go home.

565
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,898
- You should all leave. - My gosh.

566
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,529
What's wrong with you? You're always so punctual.

567
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,828
It's like you're a machine.

568
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:05,200
A machine without a heart!

569
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:08,240
And it's taking longer for us...

570
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,740
to warm up to a machine. Okay?

571
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:15,409
What? We finished that in the blink of an eye.

572
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,549
- We finished that. - Yes.

573
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,550
Should we go?

574
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:18,608
- Shall we? - Let's go.

575
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:20,219
- Yes. - Yes.

576
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,319
Good work.

577
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:43,470
- You get that, right? So... - Hey.

578
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,839
- I was on my way to see you. - What?

579
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,879
- You can just tell me. - My gosh.

580
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:54,519
Goodness. You look good.

581
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:57,319
Well, I was just...

582
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:01,219
You know, earlier today, there were other people.

583
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,030
The village chief and the ladies were there.

584
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:05,129
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

585
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,899
Well, the thing is that we have to...

586
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,830
- You should go. - What?

587
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,838
Weren't you going to tell me...

588
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,999
you guys were traveling to her hometown?

589
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:17,810
Can you see the future?

590
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,410
No way.

591
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,010
I could tell that she was in a good mood all day today.

592
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,679
She's always happy when it's time to visit her family.

593
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,409
My gosh, I knew it.

594
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:30,519
You read my wife's mood the best in this village. Seriously.

595
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,760
My mother-in-law's birthday is coming up soon.

596
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,728
But without us,

597
00:35:36,729 --> 00:35:38,458
you'll be short-staffed when there's so much to do here.

598
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:39,660
What will you do?

599
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,398
It's the busiest time of the year.

600
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,430
My gosh.

601
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,600
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

602
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,539
My goodness. Thank you.

603
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:52,439
And here. Have a safe trip.

604
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:55,780
What? My goodness. Oh, my!

605
00:35:56,379 --> 00:35:59,419
Thank you. We'll use it well.

606
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:01,479
Here, take it.

607
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,120
Thank you.

608
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,588
Right. Here you go.

609
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:08,459
Put them in the fridge and share them with the others.

610
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:10,990
Gosh, don't turn it down. It's fine!

611
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,129
- Gosh, you didn't have to. - Thank you.

612
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,530
We'll get going then.

613
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,529
- Go inside. - I'll see you guys go.

614
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,830
No, go inside.

615
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:32,850
My gosh.

616
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:52,640
I'm done with my day now.

617
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:54,139
Our day isn't over yet!

618
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,108
Our day is just beginning now!

619
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:58,169
- Let's go! - Yes!

620
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,779
- Cheers! - Let's drink it.

621
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,379
- Yes! - Go!

622
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:03,749
- Cheers. - Cheers.

623
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,819
One more bottle!

624
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,859
- One more bottle! - One more bottle!

625
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:14,319
I must go.

626
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,188
You two enjoy it.

627
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:17,929
- Just one more drink. - Come on, Yong Ju.

628
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,759
- Let's just have 1 more drink. - Just 1 more drink.

629
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,800
This is it for me. Bye.

630
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,229
See you.

631
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,870
Bye!

632
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,039
This is it for me.

633
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,839
She's so cool. She knows when to call it a night.

634
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,478
- Beom. - Yes?

635
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:36,878
I heard she was single.

636
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,280
Does she live with her parents?

637
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:41,479
I'm not sure.

638
00:37:42,149 --> 00:37:44,550
I did hear her talk to her grandmother once.

639
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:47,120
But she never talked about her parents.

640
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:49,359
I'm sure they're fine.

641
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Grandma.

642
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:17,319
She must have fallen asleep while waiting for me.

643
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:23,129
All right.

644
00:38:51,189 --> 00:38:52,289
My gosh.

645
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,760
She didn't have dinner again.

646
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,660
She just had to scoop up some rice to have dinner.

647
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:04,800
She could've done that.

648
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,530
It's Min Ho's birthday today.

649
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,240
Darn it. I'm always bumping into things.

650
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,410
Hey, don't give me that judgmental stare.

651
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:27,079
I just have a lot on my mind.

652
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,478
When my mind is preoccupied,

653
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:30,950
I sometimes can't see these sharp edges.

654
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,160
Okay? Got it?

655
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:36,019
If you got it, say...

656
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,289
something.

657
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,240
Hey, Min Ho.

658
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,080
Today is my birthday. You're really not coming?

659
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,479
I'm not sure. I'm still thinking.

660
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:00,419
Come. You have to come.

661
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:03,050
If you don't come, I'll get upset.

662
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,419
I'm going to get mad at you.

663
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:10,359
Fine. Okay. I'll be there.

664
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:12,589
Did you eat?

665
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,628
(Hwi's Toast)

666
00:41:15,629 --> 00:41:17,370

667
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,639
(Brewmaster Yoon Min Ju)

668
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,669
The brewmaster?

669
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:26,939
Hey, it's the brewmaster! Do you need a part-timer?

670
00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:29,310
Yes. Well,

671
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:31,810
it's not a job for the brewery.

672
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:35,050
Do you like cats by any chance?

673
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,089
Cats?

674
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:43,129
(Hwi's Toast)

675
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,899
Are you sure he wouldn't mind if we just showed up at his brewery?

676
00:41:50,669 --> 00:41:52,939
You said he wouldn't return your calls or texts.

677
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:54,938
We must do everything we can to contact him.

678
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:56,538
That way, the management won't blame us.

679
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:58,768
We need to confirm whether or not he's interested in working with us.

680
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:01,339
If he's not, it'd be better to end it fast for everyone's sake.

681
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,249
Let's come back before the sun goes down.

682
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,749
Okay.

684
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:29,499
Hello.

(Uilhan Brewery)

686
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:33,339
Oh, right.

687
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,039
Let's sit there.

688
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:38,010
Okay.

689
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,918
He's different from what I had in mind.

690
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:44,149
I thought he would be sensitive and picky. Right?

691
00:42:53,729 --> 00:42:55,760
So what brings you here?

692
00:42:56,669 --> 00:42:58,628
I've been trying to contact you. I'm Bang Ah Reum...

693
00:42:58,629 --> 00:43:00,600
from the Planning Team of Jisang Liquor.

694
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:04,010
Bang Ah Reum...

695
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,240
Ah Reum as in "beautiful?"

696
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,879
Sure.

697
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:13,050
I came all the way here...

698
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,019
to make you a great offer.

699
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,649
Mergers and acquisitions.

700
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,289
This is a great opportunity.

701
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:27,700
Yes. It's a great opportunity.

702
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,669
I'm sure it will be great if you join us.

703
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,300
Sure. Okay.

704
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:36,810
I'll tell him to think about it once the owner comes back.

705
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:38,839
Pardon?

706
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,109
Aren't you Mr. Yoon Min Ju, the CEO?

707
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,909
From what I know, he runs the brewery alone.

708
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,649
Oh, me?

709
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:47,319
I'm Oh Chan Hwi. It's my first day as his part-timer.

710
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,850
Darn it.

711
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,060

00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:27,478
Hey, Baekmok. This is our turf.

718
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:28,648
How dare you cover our poster with yours?

719
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:31,049
Dear me. I guess you're from Jisang.

You guys are forever ranked second.

00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,689

00:45:45,229 --> 00:45:46,839
I'm sorry, sir!

724
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:48,898
(Hwadon)

725
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:50,369
One of your guys and a guy from Baekmok...

726
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,339
got into a huge fight over putting up the posters.

727
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:53,779
Come on. Let me run my restaurant.

728
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,378
I told you many times not to fight here.

729
00:45:55,379 --> 00:45:57,478
Just give me a minute. Hold on.

730
00:45:57,479 --> 00:45:59,509
Have you lost your mind? Who do you think you are?

731
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,280
Do you think you can handle us all by yourself?

732
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,019
I'm not alone.

733
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:24,269
Where's your team manager?

734
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:28,310
Gosh, I'm sorry about that.

735
00:46:28,879 --> 00:46:32,410
My guys were so motivated to work. So they must've covered yours.

736
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,949
I'll make sure this never happens again.

737
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,789
Let's wrap this up here.

738
00:46:39,149 --> 00:46:40,919
Hey, bring some drinks.

739
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:03,309
Please play by the rules in the future.

740
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,350
Sure.

741
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,248
By the way, I hope there is indeed a future.

742
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:12,720
I'm hearing some bad things about your company.

743
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,660
Excuse me.

744
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:20,300
Hello. What's this about?

745
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,969
Yong Ju! Our Busan branch is finished!

746
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:24,970
What?

747
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,970
You know what? I'll make sure...

748
00:47:57,229 --> 00:48:00,700
I see him become the chief of staff no matter what.

749
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,839
You'll make my unfulfilled dream come true, right?

750
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,689
Anyway, a lot of people came.

751
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:24,930
Can't you be punctual at least?

752
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,499
You're here. It must've been a long drive.

753
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,769
He's your son. Don't be so formal.

754
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,169
I thought this was his birthday party.

755
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,510
But it seems you need these flowers more than him.

756
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,280
You retired a long time ago.

757
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,280
Do you still think you're a two-star general?

758
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,780
How dare you?

759
00:48:57,129 --> 00:48:58,160
Come out.

760
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,370
How dare you glare at your father?

761
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,970
How rude!

762
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:14,080
Do you still go around and read people's minds?

763
00:49:14,439 --> 00:49:15,839
I can't read people's minds.

764
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,350
I don't have supernatural powers. I'm just sensitive.

765
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:22,648
Besides, there are a lot of people who are just as sensitive as me.

766
00:49:22,649 --> 00:49:24,619
If this is about the panthers again or whatever, just forget it.

767
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,720
It's empaths!

768
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,259
It means hypersensitive people.

769
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,589
Nonsense.

770
00:49:31,089 --> 00:49:32,259
You're making a big fuss...

771
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,458
for being sensitive like a mental patient.

772
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:34,759
You're just weak.

773
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,998
Moreover, it's not an illness.

774
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,229
I told you not to treat me like I'm mentally ill.

775
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,699
I've never heard of these hypersensitive people...

776
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,739
called empaths.

777
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,439
Do you know why?

778
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:45,309
"You're not manly. You're not active."

779
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,978
"You're timid. You won't have any friends."

780
00:49:46,979 --> 00:49:48,338
"You can't even work with other people."

781
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:49,779
Because of people like you who try...

782
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,280
to mold people's personalities to fit your needs,

783
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,579
many conceal their true selves like sinners.

784
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,350
- Yoon Min Ju! - Everyone is different!

785
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,249
And that's normal.

786
00:50:00,419 --> 00:50:01,759
Why do you always make me...

787
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,160
compare myself to others for being different?

788
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:10,300
You never change.

789
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,629
You're still as authoritative as ever.

790
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
What?

791
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,709
(Ministry of National Defense)

792
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,829
Salute to the commander.

793
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,260
- Salute. - Salute.

794
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,129
Salute.

795
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,240
At ease.

796
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,749
It's okay.

797
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,350
What took you so long?

798
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,220
I'm sorry.

799
00:51:37,149 --> 00:51:38,319
Do you want to get out of here?

800
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:41,160
Let's go.

801
00:51:42,089 --> 00:51:43,089
There.

802
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,419
Mr. Nam. Say that again.

803
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,249
It's as I said on the phone.

804
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:17,260
The head office will shut down our Busan branch...

805
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,929
and merge it with another South Gyeongsang branch.

806
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,330
I think they'll let go all our boys too.

807
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:25,069
What should I do?

808
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:28,038
Why so suddenly?

809
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:29,768
The business is struggling, they say.

810
00:52:29,769 --> 00:52:32,509
On top of that, there's this beer called Naro Beer,

811
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:35,539
and the chairman himself wants to sell that brand.

812
00:52:35,979 --> 00:52:37,550
To carry out that order,

813
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,580
the only option is to shut down the Busan branch.

814
00:52:41,649 --> 00:52:42,649
What the...

815
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:48,760
You know...

816
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,600
You know the madness we've been through.

817
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,129
Baekmok Liquor had full control of Busan.

818
00:52:58,399 --> 00:53:00,839
Despite that, we worked together,

819
00:53:01,169 --> 00:53:04,439
and got this far after six years of crazy hard work.

820
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:05,970
Shutting down...

821
00:53:08,379 --> 00:53:09,439
They'll shut us down?

822
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:12,709
Give me a little more time.

823
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,648
We can overtake Baekmok Liquor.

824
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,319
I can do it, Mr. Nam.

825
00:53:16,379 --> 00:53:18,249
I begged and pleaded already.

826
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:20,689
The people high up decided already.

827
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:23,220
They cut us off.

828
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:27,459
What the heck...

829
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,439
Do you remember this spot?

830
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,510
I liked...

831
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,749
what you said to me that day.

832
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:04,129
I got the money Mr. Choi owed us.

833
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,200
Why do you work so hard?

834
00:54:06,729 --> 00:54:07,839
To get promoted?

835
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,769
Shouldn't I work hard at my own job?

836
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:15,839
Yong Ju.

837
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,010
You really...

838
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,680
did so well.

839
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,760
No. I can't give up like this.

840
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,359
I must do everything I can.

841
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:38,069
- Doesn't this look fun? Shall we? - Yes.

842
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:39,898
I'm sorry about earlier.

843
00:54:39,899 --> 00:54:41,140
One corn dog, please.

844
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,209
- Here you go. - Thanks.

845
00:54:46,209 --> 00:54:47,240
Doesn't it look good?

846
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:50,979
Yes.

847
00:54:51,609 --> 00:54:53,550
- Nice. - Gosh.

848
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,549
- I want to play. - Okay.

849
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,649
Go ahead.

850
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:59,990
Let go.

851
00:55:00,249 --> 00:55:01,760
- Hey. - Hooray.

852
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:04,330
Well done.

853
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,209
(Whac-A-Mole)

854
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:32,688
What are you? You're huge.

855
00:55:32,689 --> 00:55:33,819
(Play to win!)

856
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,359
You like teddy bears?

857
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,600
No. A man doesn't like teddy bears.

858
00:55:41,859 --> 00:55:44,100
I just noticed how big it was.

859
00:55:47,399 --> 00:55:49,199
You can't fool me.

860
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,069
- You're wrong. - I'm right.

861
00:55:52,169 --> 00:55:54,339
Min Ho. It's okay to like them.

862
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:56,439
What's wrong with liking teddy bears?

863
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:59,580
Don't worry about what Dad thinks.

864
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,450
You can like whatever you like.

865
00:56:02,149 --> 00:56:03,180
Okay?

866
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,148
Shall I win that for you?

867
00:56:05,149 --> 00:56:07,720
Isn't he the best big brother ever?

868
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,318
If you want to win one of the big ones,

869
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,560
you must score over 700 points in one go.

870
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,260
That's not too easy.

871
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,300
- Over 700 points? - Yes.

872
00:56:21,939 --> 00:56:22,970
Min Ho.

873
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,740
That doesn't sound easy.

874
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:27,879
I really wanted it as a birthday present.

875
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,129
Can you refill the magazine?

876
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:52,499
Sure.

877
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,569
Hi, kiddo.

878
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,209
You want that bear?

879
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:07,919
Oh, sorry.

880
00:57:11,919 --> 00:57:14,120
Don't you want that as a birthday present?

881
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,890
I want it.

882
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:22,060
You want it? Then you must have it.

883
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:26,899
I really need to shoot something right now.

884
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:36,539
Shall we?

885
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,889
On top of that, there's this beer called Naro,

886
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:27,700
The chairman himself wants to sell that brand.

887
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,898
To carry out that order,

888
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:32,569
the only option is to shut down the Busan branch.

889
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,600
Where did I hear that name?

890
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:41,310
In My Name.

891
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,709
In My Name.

892
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:48,620
In My Name.

893
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:57,830
In My Name.

894
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:09,140
Yoon Min Ju...

895
01:00:30,649 --> 01:00:31,649
What are you doing?

896
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:33,589
Are you all right?

897
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:37,589
Yes, I'm fine.

898
01:00:41,729 --> 01:00:42,899
You're not fine.

899
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,269
You're...

900
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:53,169
not fine.

901
01:01:35,419 --> 01:01:38,120
(Brewing Love)

902
01:01:38,419 --> 01:01:40,818
Win over Brewmaster Yoon Min Ju.

903
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:43,318
I swear to get Yoon Min Ju.

904
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:45,029
I'm Bang Ah Reum from Jisang Liquor's Planning Team.

905
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:47,059
I'll reject whoever comes.

906
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,929
I'll block you, Ms. Chae.

907
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:51,029
You'll block me?

908
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,629
Stop her. Do whatever it takes.

909
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:54,939
Chae Yong Ju.

910
01:01:55,069 --> 01:01:56,839
CEO Yoon's tough to get, isn't he?

911
01:01:56,939 --> 01:01:59,339
He's hard to get every single day.

912
01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:00,910
I'm unblocking your block.

913
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,140
Unblock me!
