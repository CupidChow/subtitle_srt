This is the office of the business that Baekmok Liquor hired...

33
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,055
to write malicious comments online?

34
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,914
They terrorize people online,

35
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:05,955
so who am I to sit out the crack down on terror?

36
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:08,555
I didn't know that such a business existed.

37
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:11,325
How did you find out about this place?

38
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:13,395
Min Ju's ex-girlfriend...

39
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:15,165
is the team leader of Baekmok's marketing team.

40
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:16,594
Did you hit her?

41
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:19,205
- I bet you did. - Don't be ridiculous.

42
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:22,004
She spilled the beans the second Min Ju asked.

43
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:24,004
It put me in a combative mood, and I love it.

44
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:28,214
Min Ju will be waiting, so let's get this over with.

We're from Baekmok Liquor.

One that involved tarnishing Jisang Liquor's reputation.

50
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:48,795
Oh, right. You're a client of ours.

51
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:51,135

63
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,814
I'm off to see Ah Reum!

64
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:39,314
I shouldn't have let her leave.

65
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,314
I should've made her stay.

184
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:53,144
Congratulations on fully selling the first batch of Together!

185
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:55,014
- Cheers. - Nice!

186
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:57,184
(Ddobong Fried Chicken)

187
00:10:58,385 --> 00:10:59,785
I don't think we ordered enough.

188
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,525
- Can we have the menu? - Wait.

189
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:03,124
This is more than enough.

190
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,795
Not when there are this many people.

191
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,964
- Have this. - Are you good?

192
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:20,405
- Is it good? - Yes!

193
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,514
- It's good. - Right?

194
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:27,544
- Yes. - No way.

195
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:28,813
Look at these generous portions.

196
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,314
Fried chicken and beer go together the best.

197
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,125
Could there be more to happiness?

198
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,194
Yong Ju, there's still the most important task left.

199
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:38,564
The Busan office.

200
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,824
- It won't close. - Of course not.

201
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,664
The branch manager of the Busan office...

202
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:43,934
will be at the head office tomorrow.

203
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:46,165
I will have the director finalize our agreement.

204
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:47,665
Don't you worry.

205
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:50,905
I'm finally going back to Busan.

206
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,245
You're coming too, right? Of course you will.

207
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:10,024
That was some hard work we did.

208
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:11,594
Cheers, everyone!

209
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,733
Cheers.

210
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,864
- Cheers. - Right.

211
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:18,005
Cheers!

212
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:51,464
Let me see. Why aren't you in a good mood?

213
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,604
What? I'm totally fine.

214
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:59,005
I know it was rough, Yong Ju.

215
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:02,714
The others did all the heavy lifting.

216
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,813
Nothing's cooler...

217
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:10,084
than telling yourself that you did a great job.

218
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:14,694
- Is that so? - Yes.

219
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:25,635
Good work.

220
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:32,305
You did great, Chae Yong Ju.

221
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,285
Come here.

222
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,954
You did great.

223
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,064
I did great.

224
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,333
(Jisang Liquor)

225
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:02,834
Could the air be more refreshing at the office these days?

226
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:07,175
Maybe it's because I don't have to see Director Yeom.

227
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,844
No, wait.

228
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,684
Maybe it's because Together is seeing an upward trend in sales.

229
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:18,184
I owe this all to you, Yong Ju.

230
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:21,555
That was fine work from my beloved junior.

231
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:23,954
- Who is he calling his junior? - What?

232
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,895
- Sir. - Yes?

233
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:34,204
It's about time you dealt with the closing of the Busan office.

234
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:38,203
Will you keep our doors open like you promised?

235
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:42,145
Come on. Of course. I'm a man of my word.

236
00:14:43,145 --> 00:14:45,584
I already informed the company president,

237
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:49,614
and he's well aware of the good work Ms. Chae did.

238
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:53,824
So don't you worry about a thing.

239
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:57,354
Thank you. Thank you so much.

240
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,925
I have one more favor to ask.

241
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:03,964
- Shoot. - Assistant Manager Kang Beom.

242
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:07,833
Could he be reassigned to the Busan office?

243
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:08,905
Why?

244
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,405
Wouldn't it be nice for him to work with you?

245
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:14,204
Don't tell me...

246
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:17,675
you're also going back to Busan.

247
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,114
Absolutely not.

248
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:22,613
You're now Ms. Chae of the Marketing Team here.

249
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:24,055
You're one of my people.

250
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:25,723
We have so much to do...

251
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:30,094
Isn't that something Ms. Chae should decide?

252
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,124
I'll believe that this matter will be handled well...

253
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,995
and head back to Busan.

254
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,464
Then...

255
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,204
I'll show him out.

256
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:49,844
Do you have some time to spare?

257
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:51,444
Of course.

258
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:54,414
- Can we talk? - Sure thing.

259
00:15:54,415 --> 00:15:55,515
Come on.

260
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:03,395
How does it feel to have sold all the beer? Good?

261
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,665
Yes, I guess.

262
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:11,035
I thought I'd be over the moon,

263
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:15,204
but the emotions hit me more calmly.

264
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:21,645
I did everything I could and that was it.

265
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:22,974
Of course.

266
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:28,184
Remember when you came to our office for a job interview?

267
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:31,785
Do you know why I hired you when experience in the military...

268
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,425
was all that you had on your resume?

269
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:36,224
Beats me. I had always been curious about that.

270
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:39,224
No one seemed as desperate as you did.

271
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:43,333
Others said they'd do their best...

272
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,005
and work hard.

273
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,434
But do you know what you said to me?

274
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:51,805
You said you'd get the job done no matter what.

275
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,344
You said doing your best was always there by default...

276
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:57,844
and that there was no choice when it came to...

277
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,214
making something happen or not.

278
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,614
The only option was to make it happen.

279
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:06,055
That...

280
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,624
was how desperate you were.

281
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:11,624
To be honest,

282
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:14,225
I used you.

283
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:19,005
Back then, I needed someone who was really desperate, like you.

284
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:21,735
So, Yong Ju.

285
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:26,045
From now on, you can do anything and everything you want.

286
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,104
In life, there comes a time...

287
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:31,245
when you feel like you can leave with no regrets.

288
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:35,055
When you feel like you've given your all here,

289
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:38,324
you'll embark on a new journey.

290
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,854
You can leave and find a new path.

291
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:44,653
If you realize that you were really happy here,

292
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:46,124
you can always come back.

293
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,235
So, try to find that new path.

294
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,234
Not something you have to do out of desperation.

295
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:56,374
I want to see you...

296
00:17:58,074 --> 00:17:59,975
doing something that makes your heart sing.

297
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:04,574
Thank you, sir.

298
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,344
But...

299
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:10,215
I'm worried about Beom.

300
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,555
He followed me and moved to Seoul, you know.

301
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:17,653
I should stay by his side until he can transfer to Busan...

302
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:18,995
I object.

303
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:20,924
What? Beom.

304
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:23,794
Hey, you scared us. When did you get here?

305
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:24,795
Yong Ju.

306
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,864
I like you.

307
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,535
- What? - My goodness, Beom.

308
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,644
What's with you? We're family here. This is awkward.

309
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,515
I respect you and like you.

310
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:37,745
It's both.

311
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:40,613
Well, I'm not confessing my feelings to you...

312
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:43,215
to try and come between you and Mr. Yoon like a weasel.

313
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:46,824
I wish the two of you nothing but happiness.

314
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,295
That's why I'm telling you how I feel.

315
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,195
As for Mr. Yoon, I admit that he's a real catch.

316
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:58,064
So, I give up with no hard feelings.

317
00:18:58,334 --> 00:18:59,935
As if they'd let you meddle in their relationship.

318
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:01,634
Come on, sir.

319
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:05,445
I'm supposed to look very cool as I'm saying this now.

320
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,745
My goodness.

321
00:19:06,904 --> 00:19:08,874
As of today, I'm done...

322
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:11,074
being glued to you.

323
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:14,144
I can take care of myself,

324
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:15,715
so just...

325
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:18,015
do what you need to do.

326
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:25,765
I'm sorry, Beom.

327
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:28,535
Actually, no.

328
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:31,295
Thank you, Beom.

329
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:35,374
Hearing you call my name like that makes my heart flutter.

330
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:39,245
Anyway, I'm off.

331
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,144
My gosh, Beom.

332
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,114
Are you crying?

333
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:50,114
I'm off too.

334
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,055
Wait, Beom!

335
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,255
Is there anything you want to eat?

336
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:01,265
Really?

337
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:14,844
I think you're worried about something.

338
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:21,914
Is it that obvious?

339
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:26,624
I catch these things very quickly.

340
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:35,064
Do you know what Mr. Nam said to me today?

341
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:39,604
He said I could go ahead and do what I wanted.

342
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,504
I swore loyalty to Jisang Liquor for the rest of my life.

343
00:20:44,505 --> 00:20:46,445
When I heard him say that I could leave the company...

344
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:49,074
How should I put this?

345
00:20:50,844 --> 00:20:52,114
I felt...

346
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:54,515
You know, strangely enough...

347
00:20:57,285 --> 00:20:58,424
You felt okay?

348
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:03,755
Yes.

349
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:05,664
I did.

350
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:08,965
I guess...

351
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,404
I've really given my all.

352
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:17,035
So, I guess you've made up your mind.

353
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:20,904
Yes.

354
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,344
But I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do.

355
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:26,844
I've made up my mind for now,

356
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,055
but I might have a change of heart tomorrow.

357
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,465
I suppose there's a right time for everything.

358
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:47,265
I should've let myself be passionately in love...

359
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:50,535
and encouraged myself to really figure out what I wanted to do.

360
00:21:50,805 --> 00:21:51,944
I feel lost like a teenager.

361
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:54,144
I never felt this way even when I was a teen.

362
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:59,785
It's a good thing that you're going through this.

363
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,985
I think this is the right time for you to go through this.

364
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,185
You think so?

365
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,824
You know, I always thought I was very decisive.

366
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:15,064
So, I have no idea why I'm so hesitant now.

367
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:17,465
I feel like I have no clue as to what to do.

368
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,664
I'm never like this, you know.

369
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:21,775
I'm very good at my job.

370
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:24,235
It's because you've never really thought about yourself...

371
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,404
or what you want to do.

372
00:22:29,844 --> 00:22:31,984
As for your job, you've garnered enough experience...

373
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:33,485
and skills through trial and error.

374
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:37,285
But you've never really faced yourself or your true needs,

375
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:40,384
so you feel lost and confused now.

376
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:46,495
But even feeling lost and confused like that is part of you.

377
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:53,634
And that's the Chae Yong Ju I love.

378
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,144
What if I can't snap out of the confusion...

379
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:05,945
and end up falling apart?

380
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:12,124
Then we'll fall apart together, holding hands.

381
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:16,924
We'll take some time off and recharge.

382
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:18,965
We'll enjoy a good cup of coffee together too.

383
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,364
That sounds nice.

384
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:47,924
What? Rao!

385
00:23:49,124 --> 00:23:50,324
You're here already?

386
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:52,364
It's only 7am now.

387
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,435
Come on, Yong Ju. I always come to work this early.

388
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:56,994
I need this time for self-development.

389
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:58,864
Really? I had no idea.

390
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,034
What is this?

391
00:24:01,035 --> 00:24:02,403
Are you planning to get a new job too?

392
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:03,475
You too?

393
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:06,444
No. I meant, you.

394
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,404
- I was talking about you. - I see.

395
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:11,745
Isn't it something you always think of?

396
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,984
If you get an offer for a better position,

397
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,045
you have to take it.

398
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:16,314
Really?

399
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:19,984
I've never even thought about it.

400
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:23,154
You're too loyal to the company.

401
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,094
I do have the tendency to be like that.

402
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,495
Go on and study.

403
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:33,664
Wait, Yong Ju.

404
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:40,205
I thought the idea of "working hard" would be the same for everyone.

405
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,314
But you taught me that it was not the case.

406
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:46,084
Compared to you, I'm not really a hard worker.

407
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:49,185
It was a pleasure...

408
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,414
working as your teammate.

409
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:58,255
What's with you?

410
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,265
- Thanks, Rao. - Keep up the great work.

411
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:12,505
- Should we go for lunch now? - Sure, sounds good.

412
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:13,904
- Let's go. - Yes, let's go.

413
00:25:14,174 --> 00:25:16,114
Yong Ju, let's go and have lunch.

414
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:18,785
I'm not hungry. You go ahead.

415
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:20,014
Enjoy your lunch.

416
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:22,215
- You should come with us. - Come and eat with us.

417
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,985
- Don't skip lunch. - Enjoy your lunch!

420
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:53,485
Thanks.

421
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:04,424
I support you.

422
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:08,025
- What do you mean? - No matter what you decide,

423
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:10,495
I will support your decision.

424
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:16,735
Why don't we become friends?

425
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:20,805
The kind of friend who runs to be with you when you need a friend.

426
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:24,874
I'd like that.

427
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:26,914
I'm a fast runner.

428
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,055
Nice.

429
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:34,854
Chae Yong Ju.

430
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:37,295
You're pretty.

431
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:40,864
Pardon?

432
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:44,634
I don't know why, but hearing it always cheers me up.

433
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,644
Thank you.

434
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,174
You're pretty too.

(Letter of Resignation)

436
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:19,134
Hello?

437
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:21,904
Yes!

438
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,174
Yes, sir.

439
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:27,174
Right. Together is getting great feedback.

440
00:27:27,305 --> 00:27:29,215
That's right. Oh, I didn't even do much.

441
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:33,314
It's all thanks to your incredible foresight, sir.

442
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:35,485
Yes, thank you.

443
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:37,114
Yes, I'll do my best!

444
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,955
That was the chairman. He called me first.

445
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:47,664
Hey, Ms. Chae.

446
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:50,964
We should keep the momentum going and develop other new products too.

447
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:53,265
Actually, hold on. We should...

448
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:58,173
make Yoon Min Ju our official brewmaster.

449
00:27:58,174 --> 00:27:59,305
What do you think?

450
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:03,644
You're due for a promotion, Ms. Chae.

Chae Yong Ju.

453
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,955
I thought long and hard before making this decision.

454
00:28:17,324 --> 00:28:20,594
No, no way. I will not accept this.

455
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:22,935
I can't accept this. I will not.

456
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,765
Come on. We're on a roll.

457
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:27,705
Mr. Na.

458
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,035
Please accept my resignation letter.

459
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:34,275
Those eyes.

460
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:40,614
Fine, let me at least hear your reason.

461
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,455
I feel like myself only when I'm working.

462
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,685
Outside of work,

463
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:49,055
I really don't know who I am.

464
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:52,055
So, I want to find myself.

465
00:28:54,864 --> 00:28:55,935
Thank you for everything.

(Jisang Liquor)

467
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:15,515
I'll be off, then. You don't need to walk me out.

468
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,055
Bye.

469
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,295
- Bye. - Thank you for everything.

470
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:36,275
What? Why do you all look so sad as if you'll never see me again?

471
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:38,904
It is sad to think that we'll never see you again at work.

472
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,074
I still find it so hard to believe.

473
00:29:41,644 --> 00:29:43,344
Chae Yong Ju is leaving Jisang Liquor?

474
00:29:44,674 --> 00:29:47,245
I'm going to call you all the time.

475
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:51,055
- I'll walk you to your car. - Hold on.

476
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:53,055
You must never be clingy when you say goodbye.

477
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,985
I'm totally fine,

478
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:56,995
and we'll stay in touch,

479
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:59,664
so you have no reason to be sad. All right?

480
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:03,295
Bye, guys.

481
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:07,834
Bye.

482
00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:30,594
Min Ju.

483
00:30:34,495 --> 00:30:35,965
I'm unemployed now.

484
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:55,714
- Yong Ju. - Yes, sir.

485
00:30:55,715 --> 00:30:57,084
Got it. I'll give it a try.

486
00:30:57,185 --> 00:30:58,883
Hello, I'm here to promote Likey.

487
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:00,524
It's delicious. Please try it.

488
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,294
You need to pay what you owe before you run away,

489
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:04,854
- Mr. Park! - Mad Dog Yong Joo?

490
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:06,725
Why do you work so hard?

491
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:08,524
Shouldn't I work hard at my own job?

492
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:11,195
We're shutting down the business.

493
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:12,805
I'll get Yoon Min Ju on board, no matter what.

494
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:14,005
Mr. Yoon.

495
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:17,974
How about you spare me five minutes?

496
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:20,445
Let's brew a new kind of beer.

497
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,015
Together. You and us.

498
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:26,643
I will sign the contract with Ms. Chae.

499
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:29,284
Welcome to Jisang Liquor.

500
00:31:29,285 --> 00:31:30,785
- Finally! - Let's do this!

501
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,184
At last, it's ready.

502
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,923
Good job, Ms. Chae.

503
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:38,094
You too, Mr. Yoon.

504
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,094
And the gold award winner is Uilhan Brewery.

505
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,834
Why can't the beer be transported today?

506
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:47,764
This batch of beer will be dumped.

507
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:50,704
Ms. Chae, don't try to carry the burden alone.

508
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:52,133
Let us help you.

509
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:53,444
We're a team.

510
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,505
My point, exactly. We're a team!

511
00:31:55,604 --> 00:31:58,573
Congratulations on fully selling the first batch of Together!

512
00:31:58,574 --> 00:31:59,614
- Cheers. - Nice!

513
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,505
It's all over now.

514
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:31,314
It's not over.

515
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:35,015
You're starting a new chapter of your life.

516
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:04,574
He's coming out.

517
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:05,984
- Hello. - Hello.

518
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,285
- Are you here for the class? - Yes.

519
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:10,715
- Come on in. - Finally, we're here.

520
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:12,954
It was so hard to book this one-day class.

521
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:15,924
It really was. Can you open up more days?

522
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:17,795
And they're all such small classes.

523
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:20,025
I like how it is now.

524
00:33:20,424 --> 00:33:22,364
I can only take on what I can handle.

525
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:23,935
Come inside.

526
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,134
(Uilhan Brewery)

527
00:33:34,775 --> 00:33:37,045
All right. Today, we'll brew ale.

528
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:38,674
Shall we get started?

529
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:51,195
All right. Now, we're going to cool it down.

530
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:52,725
We'll use this chiller.

531
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:57,234
Using a chiller like this helps it cool down fast...

532
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,965
and prevents bacterial growth.

533
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:01,604
Like this. One moment, please.

534
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,403
Move it up and down like this while keeping up the pace...

535
00:34:07,404 --> 00:34:08,404
to cool it down quickly.

536
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:10,344
This helps prevent bacterial growth.

537
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:12,914
- Do you want to try it? - Me?

538
00:34:12,915 --> 00:34:13,915
Yes.

539
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:19,383
- Just do this? - Yes.

540
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:20,685
Move it up and down. Slowly.

541
00:34:21,524 --> 00:34:22,725
You're good.

542
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,895
As I said earlier...

543
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:26,265
Inside the chiller, there's something cold...

544
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:32,634
Wait a second.

545
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,644
When did you arrive? It will end shortly.

546
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,705
Oh, really?

547
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:46,685
Wait. Are you jealous now?

548
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:48,685
Not at all!

549
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,284
It's freezing. Why is it so cold?

550
00:34:54,285 --> 00:34:57,354
I felt this summer would never end, but suddenly it's getting too cold.

551
00:34:57,355 --> 00:35:01,194
Did you have to roll up your sleeves and be sexy, saying "Bounce it?"

552
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:03,194
Please. That's why?

553
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,495
Don't go anywhere. I'll be back shortly.

554
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:10,035
Do you think I have too much time to spend on whatever?

555
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:23,415
Gosh.

556
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:39,304
Isn't it hard to lead the class?

557
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,903
I mean, meeting people itself.

558
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:43,574
Don't worry. I only do what I can handle.

559
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:44,774
And most importantly,

560
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:47,205
I get refreshed soon after.

561
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:48,504
Whatever.

562
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:51,875
What? Oh, wait.

563
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:56,585
Father, please!

564
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:01,585
- Yes, father. - Are you busy?

565
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:03,725
Yes, too busy.

566
00:36:04,024 --> 00:36:05,554
Hello, father!

567
00:36:05,555 --> 00:36:07,364
Yong Ju! You were with him.

568
00:36:08,964 --> 00:36:11,864
It's nothing important but about the pasta...

569
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:15,565
I made it the same way you taught me.

570
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:17,634
It actually tastes strange.

571
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:21,245
I guess you missed something. How about taking a look at it again?

572
00:36:21,674 --> 00:36:24,614
No way! I followed exactly the same way.

573
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:29,855
Why don't you come over here and show me how to make it?

574
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:32,984
Furthermore,

575
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:35,055
I miss you too.

576
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:37,395
Sorry?

577
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:41,225
I mean, I haven't seen Yong Ju for a while as well.

578
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,693
I miss you too!

579
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:47,534
I'll come to you with him as soon as possible. I miss you.

580
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:49,164
You should also cook for me!

581
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,504
Yes, Yong Ju. See you soon!

582
00:36:55,975 --> 00:36:57,015
Hang up now.

583
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:00,145
Don't grumble saying I always hang up early.

584
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:01,884
I got it.

585
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:08,455
Did you hear what he just said?

586
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:11,754
He's never said he missed me before.

587
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:14,323
He's also changed a lot.

588
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:15,463
Let's set the date now.

589
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:17,694
I want to eat his pasta so much!

590
00:37:18,134 --> 00:37:19,835
Why don't we also eat something now?

591
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:21,435
I see.

592
00:37:21,904 --> 00:37:22,935
Gosh.

593
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:25,133
- There's something we should do. - Please.

594
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:28,674
No, Min Ju. We should eat now instead of this.

595
00:37:37,915 --> 00:37:40,023
Dad, I'm hungry.

596
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,324
It's almost done!

597
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:46,995
Min Ho you sweetie, be ready to enjoy the meal.

598
00:37:49,024 --> 00:37:52,065
Let's see. Here we are.

599
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,964
Nice!

600
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:56,134
Here.

601
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,004
This is for Mom, and this is for Min Ho.

602
00:38:00,174 --> 00:38:03,514
The former two-star general broke a sweat...

603
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,144
cooking pasta!

604
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:06,884
Cooking is much harder!

605
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:10,884
This pasta makes me totally exhausted!

606
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,154
Min Ho. Please try it. What do you think?

607
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,254
How's it?

608
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:25,294
It tastes good.

609
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:31,605
But your face says the opposite.

610
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,274
Tell me frankly. It's okay.

611
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:36,915
It tastes bad.

612
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:39,444
Really?

613
00:38:40,714 --> 00:38:42,714
Is it that bad?

614
00:38:42,884 --> 00:38:44,984
But I still like it!

615
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:47,454
Because you cooked it for me.

616
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:48,524
Goodness!

617
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,395
Thanks!

618
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,125
Enjoy as much as you want!

619
00:38:54,924 --> 00:38:55,995
Okay.

620
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,805
Oh, and...

621
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,903
How about I get a face treatment?

622
00:39:04,904 --> 00:39:06,773
- What? - I've heard...

623
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:10,644
there was a treatment called a facelift that tightens your face.

624
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:12,543
You hated that kind of treatment before!

625
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:14,184
You've never had once whenever I asked you to do.

626
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:19,015
I mean, I went out with Min Ho to get him a toy.

627
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:21,954
But the assistant called me Grandpa.

628
00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:22,955
Gosh.

629
00:39:22,956 --> 00:39:26,225
Gosh, I was so disappointed.

630
00:39:26,424 --> 00:39:28,764
I'm not that old, aren't I?

631
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:30,363
You aren't yet!

632
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:32,133
I should dye my hair...

633
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:34,934
and trim it now and then.

634
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:36,004
Seriously?

635
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:39,944
Then, I'll book the entire week for you!

636
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:44,074
Okay. Let's go!

637
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:48,614
What a surprise. I don't believe it!

638
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:17,515
You've never returned home since then?

639
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:23,384
No, I never went back.

640
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:26,555
I even saw my family outside.

641
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:30,895
Congratulations on your return.

642
00:40:35,864 --> 00:40:38,435
Would the door lock password be the same?

643
00:41:12,065 --> 00:41:13,564
Everything is the same.

644
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:15,734
She must've waited for you every day.

645
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,875
It's so clean.

646
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:20,074
Aren't you hungry?

647
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:22,745
Wait a second. I can cook for you.

648
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:25,944
- Yes. - Is there anything in the fridge?

649
00:41:45,165 --> 00:41:47,065
I guess you usually set the table at home.

650
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,234
You look so natural.

651
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:50,805
You forgot since I was way too cute,

652
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:52,733
but I'm the first kid among the five.

653
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:56,174
I fed up and raised all of them.

654
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:58,315
I'm the oldest brother!

655
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,214
- Brother? - Yes, "brother."

656
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:10,694
It's done. Come here already.

657
00:42:11,594 --> 00:42:12,964
Please, say it again.

658
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:15,824
Come over! The soup is already getting cold.

659
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,565
I got it.

660
00:42:23,935 --> 00:42:25,504
I loved hearing you say that.

661
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,774
I can say it every day.

662
00:42:35,214 --> 00:42:36,245
Let's eat.

663
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,375
What's this?

664
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:02,944
Is that for me?

665
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:05,674
No, it's for me.

666
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,214
Don't guys usually prepare the diamond rings?

667
00:43:13,154 --> 00:43:14,725
I'll buy my own ring.

668
00:43:15,555 --> 00:43:16,555
Pretty, right?

669
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,794
If you put that on, you'll really have to marry me.

670
00:43:19,324 --> 00:43:21,194
This is your last chance. Run when you still can.

671
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:24,134
Three, two, one. Time's up.

672
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:30,875
That's a strange proposal.

673
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:33,305
Fine. I like it.

674
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:42,444
What's this?

675
00:43:43,614 --> 00:43:46,113
My gosh. When did you prepare this?

676
00:43:46,114 --> 00:43:47,185
Oh, my.

677
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:58,863
What's this?

678
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:00,134
(Resident Registration Card, Oh Chan Ran)

679
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:04,134
- What's this? - Look closely.

680
00:44:05,504 --> 00:44:08,044
"Oh Chan Ran."

681
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:11,875
Mr. Oh Chan Ran?

682
00:44:12,745 --> 00:44:14,844
Yes. That was my old name.

683
00:44:15,344 --> 00:44:17,084
I changed my name when I got discharged from the military.

684
00:44:17,085 --> 00:44:18,654
I was hoping a new name...

685
00:44:19,555 --> 00:44:21,355
would make me feel reborn.

686
00:44:22,884 --> 00:44:25,824
Then perhaps, I would be able...

687
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:29,424
to forget about those nightmares.

688
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,535
That's a pretty name.

689
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,504
- "Chan Ran." - Right?

690
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:40,574
I liked my name too.

691
00:44:41,205 --> 00:44:42,944
For a guy who took someone else's life,

692
00:44:43,944 --> 00:44:45,274
that name sounds too vibrant.

693
00:44:48,614 --> 00:44:50,355
Only my family remembers this name.

694
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:54,555
Well, you're my family now.

695
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,995
So you should remember that.

696
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,733
- Gosh, a retirement ceremony? - Goodness.

697
00:45:12,734 --> 00:45:14,104
- It's going to be a big occasion. - Hey.

698
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:16,773
- Yes, that's it. - You're here.

699
00:45:16,774 --> 00:45:19,244
- My goodness. What's all this? - You look good.

700
00:45:19,245 --> 00:45:20,713
Hey, you too. You look great.

701
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:22,514
Well, you know... Were you going for the BTS look?

702
00:45:22,515 --> 00:45:24,015
- This? Yes. - Yes.

703
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,384
- I'm a member of ARMY. - That suits you.

704
00:45:34,824 --> 00:45:37,064
How do I look? Today is an important day,

705
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:38,335
so I want to look my best.

706
00:45:45,004 --> 00:45:47,375
You look beautiful. You're just perfect.

707
00:45:49,574 --> 00:45:51,274
Okay. Let's go.

708
00:46:08,024 --> 00:46:09,024
- Hello. - Hello.

709
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,565
- Aren't they a sweet couple? - Are they getting married?

710
00:46:11,794 --> 00:46:13,765
- How beautiful. - Hello.

711
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:15,535
Hello.

712
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,934
Welcome,  Yong Ju and Min Ju.

713
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:19,633
You guys are the last ones to show up.

714
00:46:19,634 --> 00:46:22,304
They must think this ceremony is for them.

715
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:25,244
- Hey! You guys better separate. - My goodness.

716
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:26,613
Don't you know our village prohibits couples...

717
00:46:26,614 --> 00:46:27,843
from showing physical affection outside their homes?

718
00:46:27,844 --> 00:46:30,383
Do you think you're living in Hollywood?

719
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:33,284
This is Baegok-ri. Come on!

720
00:46:33,285 --> 00:46:35,383
Why are you bullying them? They look good together.

721
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:38,654
- We can do the same thing now. - My gosh. This is so annoying.

722
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:41,294
Are you sick?

723
00:46:42,665 --> 00:46:44,035
There they come.

724
00:46:46,194 --> 00:46:48,864
- What is this? - What are they doing?

725
00:46:49,035 --> 00:46:50,133
Why are you doing that?

726
00:46:50,134 --> 00:46:51,734
My gosh, come on.

727
00:46:58,145 --> 00:47:00,713
No! This isn't right. What is this?

728
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:02,315
- What is this? - What?

729
00:47:02,815 --> 00:47:03,815
- Let me check the microphone. - Okay.

730
00:47:03,816 --> 00:47:04,954
One, two, three, four.

731
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:08,184
- Yes. I'm Young Ja. - I'm Sook Ja.

732
00:47:08,185 --> 00:47:09,954
We would like...

733
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:12,454
to thank you all for coming to our very own retirement ceremony.

734
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,364
Thank you.

735
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:19,733
We're throwing this party to talk about our hardships...

736
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:21,764
and how diligent we've been in life.

737
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:24,573
Right. We're throwing this party on our own dime.

738
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:25,734
- I see. - Okay?

739
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:27,874
As soon as our retirement ceremony is over,

740
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:30,444
we'll begin our trip to travel the world.

741
00:47:31,074 --> 00:47:33,543
We worked two jobs and were so diligent with our lives.

742
00:47:33,544 --> 00:47:34,584
So I guess our hard work paid off.

743
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,244
- Aren't you envious of us? - I am!

744
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:38,684
- I am. - Could you take us too?

745
00:47:38,685 --> 00:47:41,055
- You guys get to go to Vietnam. - Right.

746
00:47:42,225 --> 00:47:44,593
A long speech at events like this is bound to be boring.

747
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:46,923
So we're going to keep our speech short. You go first.

748
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:49,323
- You go first. - Come on. Just do it.

749
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,395
My gosh.

750
00:47:51,495 --> 00:47:54,764
We'll keep it short, but still meaningful.

751
00:47:54,765 --> 00:47:58,403
We're not rushing or anything to catch our flight.

752
00:47:58,404 --> 00:47:59,504
Okay?

753
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:04,214
We all have our own battles in life.

754
00:48:04,774 --> 00:48:08,044
No one knows how difficult tomorrow's battle...

755
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:09,585
will be.

756
00:48:09,815 --> 00:48:14,555
But I hope you will certainly be happy at least today.

757
00:48:15,855 --> 00:48:16,924
That's it.

758
00:48:20,225 --> 00:48:21,225
That's right.

759
00:48:21,226 --> 00:48:23,494
Fruits aren't the only ones that have ripening seasons.

760
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:28,204
Let's pay attention to the ripening season of our lives.

761
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,804
- Okay? - Okay!

762
00:48:30,805 --> 00:48:31,835
That's it.

763
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,543
That's it.

764
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:35,644
- We know it's not much. - Okay.

765
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:37,415
But do enjoy the food.

766
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:39,574
- Are you ready? - Ready.

767
00:48:43,114 --> 00:48:44,954
- Have a safe trip! - Safe travels!

768
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,884
- All right. Take care. - Have a nice trip.

769
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,794
- I'm so envious. - Be safe!

770
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:53,923
- Have a fun time! - We're leaving!

771
00:48:53,924 --> 00:48:55,265
Have fun!

772
00:48:56,765 --> 00:48:57,835
My gosh.

773
00:49:01,835 --> 00:49:03,674
- Mr. Kim? - Yes?

774
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:06,074
You know that we have unfinished business.

775
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:08,574
Yes. What do you say?

776
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:11,714
Should we stir up a bloodbath here in Baegok-ri?

777
00:49:31,065 --> 00:49:32,934
Rumor has it that...

778
00:49:32,935 --> 00:49:36,774
you're running for village chief in the upcoming election.

779
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,475
If what I'm hearing is true, that will put me in a tight spot.

780
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:44,614
Too bad. Yes, you heard right.

781
00:49:46,544 --> 00:49:48,014
Here's what you have to know about me.

782
00:49:48,015 --> 00:49:50,054
Even my name is Lee Yi Jang.

783
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:52,414
I was born to live up to my name and become the village chief.

784
00:49:52,415 --> 00:49:55,653
So I served as chief for three terms in Baegok-ri.

785
00:49:55,654 --> 00:49:58,854
That means Baegok-ri is me,

786
00:49:58,855 --> 00:50:00,693
and I am Baegok-ri.

787
00:50:00,694 --> 00:50:04,334
I dumbed it down enough for you. I wonder if you understood that.

788
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:08,034
My gosh. What are you talking about? Come on.

789
00:50:08,035 --> 00:50:10,534
Hey, wasn't serving as chief for three terms...

790
00:50:10,535 --> 00:50:12,474
enough for you?

791
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:14,474
If you have any sense of decency,

792
00:50:14,475 --> 00:50:17,443
you ought to pull yourself out of the running.

793
00:50:17,444 --> 00:50:19,543
Wait. Right.

794
00:50:19,544 --> 00:50:22,943
I heard you had already sold off all your decency at the market.

795
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:23,955
What did you say?

796
00:50:25,915 --> 00:50:29,653
A young man ought to be the village chief.

797
00:50:29,654 --> 00:50:32,624
I was born a month later than you. Didn't you know that?

798
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,823
What are you talking about?

799
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:38,764
Village chiefs these days have to be good at English.

800
00:50:38,765 --> 00:50:42,034
You must be able to talk to immigrant workers.

801
00:50:42,035 --> 00:50:44,105
That's what's expected of a village chief these days!

802
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:49,004
- You... - Why you...

803
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:53,784
What's this?

804
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:55,015
(Candidate for the 18th Village Chief)

805
00:50:56,015 --> 00:50:57,383
(Jjuan)

806
00:50:57,384 --> 00:50:58,384
Honey?

807
00:51:01,285 --> 00:51:03,955
Is there a law that says I'm not allowed to run for chief?

808
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:07,565
I'm the youngest one in this village.

809
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:10,693
I'm the best English speaker in this village.

810
00:51:10,694 --> 00:51:13,294
It's me. I'm perfect for this position.

811
00:51:15,765 --> 00:51:19,004
You married such an ambitious woman.

812
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:20,975
I...

813
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:00,174
- What's that? - Here.

814
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:04,213
You brought me flowers.

815
00:52:04,214 --> 00:52:07,285
My gosh. Your next chapter will finally begin.

816
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:09,455
Congratulations.

817
00:52:09,955 --> 00:52:10,955
Thank you.

818
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,055
What do you say? Should I give you a tour?

819
00:52:13,495 --> 00:52:14,524
Yes.

820
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:18,035
What's this?

821
00:52:19,165 --> 00:52:21,035
The first step of my next chapter...

822
00:52:21,435 --> 00:52:22,935
is a bottle shop that specializes in beer.

823
00:52:23,404 --> 00:52:26,503
I'm going to buy beer from small breweries...

824
00:52:26,504 --> 00:52:28,805
across the nation like yours and sell their beers at my shop.

825
00:52:29,444 --> 00:52:31,645
I will fill the shop with beers I love.

826
00:52:32,044 --> 00:52:34,245
I'll introduce their beers and sell them too.

827
00:52:34,614 --> 00:52:36,114
You know I can sell anything.

828
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,483
And on one side of the wall, I'll display some records.

829
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:41,824
Then I'll play songs I love every day.

830
00:52:42,324 --> 00:52:46,523
Then can my beer have a presence in your bottle shop?

831
00:52:46,524 --> 00:52:48,395
Well, I'm sorry.

832
00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:50,124
So many breweries already want a spot in my shop.

833
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,634
But your brewery will be my first supplier.

834
00:52:54,765 --> 00:52:57,234
I should have a meeting with the bank next week for a loan.

835
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:00,805
Oh, my. Things are moving so fast.

836
00:53:01,274 --> 00:53:03,745
Is there anything I can help you with?

837
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:07,245
I'll do this on my own. You just root for me. Okay.

838
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:09,145
Okay.

839
00:53:09,984 --> 00:53:11,484
I'm rooting for you.

840
00:53:16,424 --> 00:53:17,424
I can't wait.

841
00:53:22,895 --> 00:53:25,565
It started off with Naro Beer but ended with Together.

842
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:30,374
I've tasted every single beer in my shop...

843
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,874
and carefully selected only the best.

844
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:34,073
I can assure you of the quality.

845
00:53:34,074 --> 00:53:35,705
Especially the beer on the top shelf.

846
00:53:43,415 --> 00:53:46,955
Your grandmother would have been happy if she were here now. Right?

847
00:53:47,154 --> 00:53:48,225
My grandma?

848
00:53:49,754 --> 00:53:51,924
She would've said, "Good job."

849
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,065
Good job.

850
00:53:56,225 --> 00:53:57,265
Thank you.

851
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:03,004
They should be here by now.

852
00:54:06,935 --> 00:54:09,645
Yong Ju. I'm here!

853
00:54:12,145 --> 00:54:13,915
- Cheers. - Cheers.

854
00:54:17,015 --> 00:54:20,253
Beom. How are you settling back in Busan?

855
00:54:20,254 --> 00:54:21,354
You look good.

856
00:54:21,355 --> 00:54:23,424
Yong Ju. I'm no longer an assistant manager.

857
00:54:23,484 --> 00:54:25,254
I'm a section chief.

858
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:33,805
Who pops open a beer bottle with a spoon?

859
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:38,475
Hey, new recruit. Many open bottles with spoons,

860
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:40,375
but people like us who brew and sell liquor...

861
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,714
only open them with bottle openers.

862
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:47,144
Why? When a spoon is used,

863
00:54:47,145 --> 00:54:49,384
bottles can easily be chipped...

864
00:54:50,114 --> 00:54:52,455
which turns them into scrap.

865
00:54:52,815 --> 00:54:54,324
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

866
00:54:54,685 --> 00:54:56,625
Gosh, look at you!

867
00:54:57,424 --> 00:54:59,555
- I'm proud of you. - Congratulations.

868
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:02,265
Wait.

869
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,634
Why the long face?

870
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,274
He seems down.

871
00:55:12,504 --> 00:55:14,173
Rao. What's wrong?

872
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:16,844
- Things are tough these days. - Why?

873
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:24,254
Sir.

874
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:27,654
I don't think this is fair.

875
00:55:28,424 --> 00:55:29,725
I know I'm new here,

876
00:55:29,855 --> 00:55:31,424
but I got the job because I passed the recruitment process.

877
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:35,324
I don't understand why I have to make coffee runs like this.

878
00:55:37,395 --> 00:55:39,765
You kept saying that it wasn't fair.

879
00:55:40,134 --> 00:55:41,534
So I accompanied you a few times...

880
00:55:41,535 --> 00:55:42,935
even when I passed the recruitment process too.

881
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,435
(Jisang Liquor)

882
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:49,943
That little...

883
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:51,515
- You deserved it. - Poor you.

884
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:53,245
Have a drink.

885
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:55,415
Young people these days can be quite stubborn.

886
00:55:58,185 --> 00:56:01,455
We have a problem! I'm serious. This is bad!

887
00:56:01,824 --> 00:56:03,383
Could you please help us?

888
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:05,024
- Here. - We don't have much time.

889
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,254
- What's this? - What...

890
00:56:12,065 --> 00:56:13,963
I see. You got her parents' blessing.

891
00:56:13,964 --> 00:56:15,904
Good for you. Congratulations.

892
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:18,774
So Ah Reum's mother was against the marriage, right?

893
00:56:18,935 --> 00:56:22,944
Don't you know me? I'm none other than Oh Chan Hwi.

894
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:31,355
Mother, how about a toast?

895
00:56:35,254 --> 00:56:37,294
Mother, good morning.

896
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,565
Mother, would you like a bite?

897
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:56,404
My gosh, that's impressive. So you won her over with your toast?

898
00:56:57,174 --> 00:56:58,943
We thought getting their blessing would be the end of it.

899
00:56:58,944 --> 00:57:00,475
But there are so many things we have to prepare.

900
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,114
I can't plan the wedding on my own.

901
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,214
What's the point of planning anything...

902
00:57:04,285 --> 00:57:05,515
when he can't keep up?

903
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:10,594
Ms. Beautiful Bang is quite upset.

904
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:11,855
Please cut her some slack.

905
00:57:11,955 --> 00:57:14,125
She has her plate full with the wedding and work.

906
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:15,394
She's quite tired.

907
00:57:15,395 --> 00:57:18,863
Ah Reum. You said you would resign once you got married.

908
00:57:18,864 --> 00:57:21,835
Oh, that? There's a guy I have to support now.

909
00:57:23,035 --> 00:57:24,205
That's not important.

910
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:26,674
Guess who the new director of the Planning Team is.

911
00:57:29,944 --> 00:57:31,214
(Planning Team Director Kim Tae In)

912
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:35,614
My gosh. I can't believe he became a director.

913
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:38,585
My gosh. I can't just sit back and watch.

914
00:57:39,015 --> 00:57:42,654
I'm next. I'll be the youngest and the first female director.

915
00:57:42,855 --> 00:57:44,395
That's what I'm going to do.

916
00:57:44,824 --> 00:57:47,664
- Oh, my. - My gosh. I love your spirit.

917
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:49,794
Right. How are you guys?

918
00:57:50,765 --> 00:57:51,765
Us?

919
00:57:51,964 --> 00:57:54,963
- We're so in love. - I love you more.

920
00:57:54,964 --> 00:57:56,003
- I love you more. - No, I love you more.

921
00:57:56,004 --> 00:57:58,835
- I love you more! - My gosh. Okay.

922
00:57:59,274 --> 00:58:01,904
- Come on. - What?

923
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:04,515
Min Ju. Marriage is all about making choices. Okay?

924
00:58:04,844 --> 00:58:06,815
Seriously. There are so many things you have to choose.

925
00:58:07,044 --> 00:58:08,284
Look at the wedding invitation.

926
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:10,344
We had to choose the paper, color, style, and whatnot.

927
00:58:10,884 --> 00:58:12,955
Talk while folding them. Don't slack off.

928
00:58:14,254 --> 00:58:15,254
Okay.

929
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:22,464
By the way, why are we taking a picture?

930
00:58:22,824 --> 00:58:24,234
Why are you asking? It's nice.

931
00:58:24,464 --> 00:58:26,793
It makes no sense that we don't have a single group photo.

932
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,105
Right. That's not cool.

933
00:58:28,165 --> 00:58:29,935
Photos will be the only things we'll have left later.

934
00:58:30,305 --> 00:58:31,705
Min Ju. Hurry.

935
00:58:32,205 --> 00:58:33,975
Okay. The timer is on. We have ten seconds.

936
00:58:42,614 --> 00:58:45,315
I, in my name. Min Ju, in his name.

937
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:48,154
And for you, live your life in your name.

938
00:58:48,455 --> 00:58:51,724
To beautiful and vibrant us.

939
00:58:51,725 --> 00:58:52,754
- Cheers. - Cheers.

940
00:58:57,835 --> 00:58:59,963
(Thank you for watching Brewing Love.)

941
00:58:59,964 --> 00:59:02,305
(Special thanks to Lee Duk Hwa for his appearance)

942
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:32,435
