Gosh. I'm fine.

Grandma.

He...

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,590
is hurting more over my ordeal than me.

(May she rest in peace.)

22
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,659
I guess everyone has a story that can't be told.

I don't.

Where's Yong Ju?

27
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,909
- Will she be all right? - Of course.

28

Didn't you see her earlier?

Only today...

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,560
did I realize how awkward I sounded while crying.

33
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,629
I couldn't recognize myself.

34
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,759
When we cry,

35
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,830
we find it hard to focus.

36
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,039
Because while crying,

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,340
our minds wander off...

38
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,509
thinking we don't have time for this.

39
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,138
When we laugh,

40
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,479
we do so while thinking how hilarious it is.

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,219
That's why when you cry, you should cry your heart out.

42
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:59,150
Hearing that...

43
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,620
brings me to tears again.

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,930
Go ahead and cry.

45
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:06,460

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,580
Ms. Beautiful Bang, your house is huge.

49
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,719
It's so big that I don't even know who's actually home.

50
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,520
Look.

51
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,560
Our house is the only one with the lights out.

52
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,888
We're a family of three,

53
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,689
but I hate how I have to enter a house that's dark.

54
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,228
I lived here for over 20 years,

55
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,699
but it still doesn't feel like home.

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,069
Do you think I'm being a spoiled brat?

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,900
- That's what others think. - No.

58
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,539
Not feeling at home in your own house?

59
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,009
That's sad.

60
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,509
Hold on.

61
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Ta-da.

62
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,120
I turned the lights on for you today.

63
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:14,600
Oh Chan Hwi.

64
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,769
I'm no longer interested in men with secrets.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,110
I keep picturing the future these days.

66
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,839
Buying furniture with you...

67
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:33,509
and having breakfast with you every day.

68
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,649
Like that, I keep seeing you in my future.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,319
What's your take on that?

70
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,259
I...

71
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,829
To be honest,

72
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:52,899
I don't even know what my own future holds.

73
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:00,939
Got it.

74
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,050

Why are you not your boastful self today?

78
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,920
Is it because it's your first time in this kind of neighbourhood?

79
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,459
Likewise.

80
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,300
Sure.

81
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,060
Gosh. What on earth?

82
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:59,800
Look here, mister.

83
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,699
This isn't a place where you can randomly park your truck.

84
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,970
What is this nonsense?

85
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,869
I'm sorry. I'll move it right away.

86
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,910

87
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,079
I apologize.

88
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,378
The neighbourhood was nice, so I stopped to look around.

89
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,379
Unbelievable.

90
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,949
Run along, then.

91
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,620
Who in this neighbourhood would eat this kind of food?

92
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,089
What will people think?

93
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,620
Of course. They don't go well together.

Yes.

I think she's been having a hard time...

99
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,628
picking herself back up after the funeral.

100
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,060
I called her a few times earlier, but she didn't pick up.

101
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:05,869
Why would you call her...

102
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,328
when I'm leaving her alone despite us being joined at the hip?

103
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,999
More people can be joined to her at the hip, you know.

I used to play with the hoop back in the day.

116
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,918
Ms. Chae, I wonder...

117
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,450
if you've even tried rolling this hoop before.

118
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,620
It's a first for me,

119
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,089
so I don't know how it should be done.

120
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,830
Seriously? You haven't done this before?

121
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:47,559
Goodness me.

122
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,460
I should probably give you a leg-up.

123
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,600
How about I literally hop instead? Like this.

124
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,268
- Is this how you roll it? - That's right. There you go.

125
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,769
Hook it like that.

126
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,370
Guys, get ready.

127
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,340
You go first.

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,820
- Nice! - Hey!

130
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,320
It's this way.

131
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,620
Over here. Why are you going that way?

132
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,388
Did I cross the finish line too soon?

133
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,059
- Of course not. - No way. You did great!

134
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:21,159
- Nicely done. - Why did he head that way?

135
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,398
- This wasn't the plan. - Darn. I think it all went wrong.

Of course not. Don't say that too soon.

What...

157
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,830
Did I smash too many of them?

158
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,768
Who suggested this anyway?

159
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,069
You did.

160
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,999
As if. It was him.

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,908
- No, it was him. - You brought this up first.

162
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:40,369
I only suggested a game of roll the hoop.

what we can do to put Chae Yong Ju in a better mood.

At times like this, physical activities work wonders...

169
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,559
that don't require any thinking.

170
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,669
Ms. Chae was hanging in there. She's a tough one.

You're wrong.

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,439

176
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,279
Are you crying?

Meanwhile, my tear glands have been closed off.

178
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,820
Actually, they're operating again.

179
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,888

180
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,090
You too?

181
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,459

All right. Bring it.

185
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,939
Spin the hoop.

186
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,570
You have to walk while spinning the hoop.

187
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:48,340
How is this a challenge?

188
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,210
I told you this was a bad idea.

189
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,649
- Let's have fruit punch. - My gosh.

190
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,320
Come inside for some fruit punch.

191
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,620
I'm having fruit punch.

192
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,319
- Let's have fruit punch. - Fruit punch.

193
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,960
- Come on. - Yes, fruit punch it is.

194
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,360
Then, I'll get us some beer.

195
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,470
This will be the last time you suggest a sports event.

196
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,869
- Fine. - Got it.

197
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,069
That's right. No more sports events.

198
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,908
Who suggested it in the first place?

199
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:21,439
- How are you so bad at sports? - We had fun though.

200
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,709
What about this was fun?

201
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,249
- But... - You couldn't smash a single tile.

202
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,080
Says the expert at rolling the hoop.

203
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,149
I meant that I had done it before as a boy.

204
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,730
- Good for you. - What?

205
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,730
Cry some more. Just cry your eyes out.

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,769
These aren't emotions you can hold back.

207
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:47,570
I lost my parents and eldest brother.

208
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,369
I've lost most members of my family,

209
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,209
but I still haven't gotten used to it.

210
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,240
Exactly. That's why one should cry.

211
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,110
Cry and cry some more.

212
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,349
Then, a day of laughter will come,

213
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,980
and then you'll have an appetite again.

214
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,389
Those days will come.

215
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,320
Your heart needs to feel the pain.

216
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,340
Where did Yoon Min Ju go?

217
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,639
He only left to get some beer.

218
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,679
Goodness.

219
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,590
Look at you. You know how to cry now.

220
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:43,120
So what? Didn't you tell me to cry my eyes out?

221
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:45,889
Do you want me to hold you?

222
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,528
How can you say that like it's no big deal?

223
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,699
What if the others see you?

224
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,070
- What about it? - My gosh!

225
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:00,439
Fall into his arms if he's offering.

226
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,809
Who cares if we see you? What about it?

227
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:06,979
Why reject his offer when you want it too?

228
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,278
Couples from the old storybooks...

229
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,179
would be more open with their affection.

230
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,219
What are you talking about?

231
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,320
Why would I be in his arms when it's hot outside?

232
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,360
I'll cool off a bit.

233
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,028
She was in the Special Forces hunting down terrorists,

234
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,000
but when it comes to dating...

235
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,898
I say that she's never had a real boyfriend before.

236
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:28,940
I agree.

237
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:32,308
Boss, your hair will turn gray while waiting for her to give in.

238
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:33,740
I'll keep waiting then.

239
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,908
I'm fine just being next to her...

240
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,110
- You liar. - That's a lie.

241
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:47,090
Why couldn't you tell him that you wanted it?

242
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,090
This is due to a lack of practice.

243
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:52,190
How can I express my feelings...

244
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:54,759
when I don't know how to do it?

245
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,259
Love?

246
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,070
I only have experience loving my country and fellow soldiers.

247
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,269
Why is it so darn hard?

248
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:05,309
Darn it.

249
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,019
So tell me.

250
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,360
- Are you having fun? - Sorry?

251
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,389
You seem to be getting along with those on the TF team.

252
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,829
You haven't been reporting back to me...

253
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,330
because Chae Yong Ju told you not to!

254
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,370
Are you here with a delivery?

255
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,940
- We'll get going first. - Sure.

256
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:42,839
I'm here to make a delivery...

257
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,408
and to see Ms. Beautiful Bang in the process.

258
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,080
Ah Reum is currently...

259
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,779
getting an earful from our director.

260
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:51,990
What?

261
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,250
Darn.

262
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,019
- Can you deliver this for me? - What?

263
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,229
Is that the director's office?

264
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,759
No, it's this way.

265
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,430
Are you going to barge in there?

266
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,140
That's the power of love.

267
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,470
Bang Ah Reum.

268
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,640
You're a member of the Planning Team.

269
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,710
You're Bang Ah Reum of the Planning Team.

270
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,239
You were put on the TF team...

271
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,439
so that you could stop Chae Yong Ju...

272
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,210
from developing the new beer.

273
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,009
That's your job!

274
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:25,019
About that...

275
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,819
You can talk to Ms. Chae.

276
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,019
Hey.

277
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,489
Did you think I'd just sit at my desk...

278
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,690
if you didn't report to me?

279
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,859
I can stop the new product from being launched without you.

280
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,529
I just wanted to give you a chance.

281
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,440
Although, you did nothing but let me down.

282
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,400
- What do you mean... - Forget it. Get out.

283
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,009
Ta-da!

284
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:57,420
- Chan Hwi is here. - Why are you here?

285
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,789
- Did you hear everything? - Yes.

286
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:08,759
You got chewed out.

287
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,430
Can't you pretend you heard nothing?

288
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:14,569
I don't want to. I'm going to run away with you.

289
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:17,170
It must've ruined your day. Let's just run away now.

290
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:20,740
This darn company. I'm sick of this.

291
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,108
- Aren't you? - As my boyfriend,

292
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:25,379
shouldn't you have barged in looking like a tough guy to protect me?

293
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,009
I can't even protect myself.

294
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,819
The director...

295
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,789
scares me.

296
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,019
- Let's run away. - You'll have to wait.

297
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,019
I still have hours until I can clock out.

298
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,430
Hey, what are you doing? You're at work.

299
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,569
Hello, Chief.

300
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,009
Oh, look who's here.

301
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,609
- Is your leg okay? - Yes.

302
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,440
Oh, who is he?

303
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,108
You know, the man who got trapped in the mountain...

304
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:01,519
when there was a landslide.

305
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,849
Right, the YouTuber.

306
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,318
My goodness. Do you know how worried we all were that day?

307
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,588
Yes, that's why I came to thank you in person today.

308
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,730
You didn't have to bring anything.

309
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,528
- Anyway, take a seat. - Okay.

310
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,759
- Yes, you can sit here. - Over here, right?

311
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,229
The injury must've been quite serious.

312
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,200
- Talk. I'll bring you a drink. - Okay.

313
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,490
The last time I was here,

314
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,359
one of the ladies in the neighbourhood asked me...

315
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,329
what the toast truck was doing here. She said it was very out of place...

316
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,900
and that it was embarrassing.

317
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:53,700
I thought about it,

318
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,240
- and she was right... - What is that lady's problem?

319
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,609
That is total nonsense.

320
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,269
Who was this lady?

321
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:02,910
Ah Reum.

322
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,980
- Mom? - "Mom?"

323
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:08,880
Who might you be?

324
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,980
You look familiar.

325
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,119
The toast guy?

326
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,818
Mom, don't tell me you're that lady. Are you?

327
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:16,859
Hey, Toast.

328
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,589
Why are you holding my daughter's hand?

329
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,259
This is...

330
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,200
- He's my boyfriend. - Have you lost your mind?

331
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:27,299
Be quiet. Stop spewing such nonsense.

332
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,269
Go home!

333
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,109
What if the neighbours gossip? How embarrassing.

334
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,269
Hey! You need to leave now.

335
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,548
- Go. Go inside. - Mom, it hurts!

336
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,910
Hey, seriously. Hurry up and go inside.

337
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,789
My gosh. This is so embarrassing.

338
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,990
Hey! What are you, a rebellious teen?

339
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,359
Are you pulling an antic like this to get my attention?

340
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,960
I said nothing when you went on about getting married.

341
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,798
You're a smart girl,

342
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,399
so I thought you'd bring home a perfect guy...

343
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,700
because you wouldn't want to lose to me.

344
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,269
But what? That toast guy?

345
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,700
Are you kidding me?

346
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,170
How could you date such a good-for-nothing?

347
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,568
Watch what you say.

348
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,308
His name is Oh Chan Hwi. We're the same age and...

349
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,640
Like I care.

350
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,150
Hey, I couldn't even afford to buy myself a bag.

351
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,390
Colour? Design? Why would it matter?

352
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:19,989
It was a hand-me-down,

353
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,019
so I was just grateful that there were no holes in the bag.

354
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,788
I couldn't tell if it was a knockoff or authentic,

355
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:25,359
so people laughed at me. You know what that's like?

356
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,990
I didn't want you to experience that kind of humiliation,

357
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:30,430
so I made sure you were always surrounded by expensive,

358
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,299
pretty things from luxury brands while raising you.

359
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,869
That is how I raised my daughter.

360
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:37,399
And what? You're dating that toast guy?

361
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,710
You still don't get the difference between authentic and fake.

362
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,309
Chan Hwi is more authentic and amazing than anyone else I know.

363
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:44,108
You're embarrassed by me...

364
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,109
when I don't live up to your expectations.

365
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,249
But Chan Hwi...

366
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,779
always tells me that I'm beautiful no matter the circumstances.

367
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,649
Even when I feel like a big ugly mess,

368
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,220
he tells me that I look pretty.

369
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,989
How old are you?

370
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,089
You'd still fall for such a smooth-talking poser?

371
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,130
Sweet words do not put food on the table!

372
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,230
You're clueless because you've been living too comfortably!

373
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,069
You're at it again.

374
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,400
Mom!

375
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,368
I've never once felt comfortable while living with you.

376
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,400
Do you know that?

377
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,940
I would've introduced you to Chan Hwi sooner,

378
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,970
had I known you'd show this much interest.

379
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:18,339
Do you even know how long it's been since you last touched me?

380
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,450
Mom.

381
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,390
I'm actually glad this happened.

382
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,259
That brat...

383
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,759
I'm so embarrassed.

384
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,069
You're pretty.

385
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,339
I'm really embarrassed right now.

386
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,849
You...

387
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,579
You're so beautiful.

388
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:53,109
Yes, let's not get married.

389
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,740
My mom is right.

390
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,680
You're too good for my family.

391
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:03,019
You're from a wealthy family.

392
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,789
And you received so much love growing up.

393
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,359
Why would you want to marry into such a dysfunctional family?

394
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:23,769
This is me protecting you.

395
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,109
Run away.

396
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:53,099
Stop eating and feed your skin instead.

397
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,200
You're eating everything.

398
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,038
Whether I'm feeding my skin or my mouth,

399
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,009
it doesn't matter because I'm the one soaking it up either way!

400
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,579
I really didn't think I'd be able to handle...

401
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,150
this thing called life without my grandma.

402
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,849
But...

403
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:16,619
I'm not alone.

404
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,059
Can I...

405
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,359
call you ladies my aunties?

406
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,630
What?

407
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,900
We've been waiting for you to call us like that.

408
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,199
I didn't think it'd happen until our next life.

409
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm Auntie Sook Ja.

410
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,869
Call me Auntie Young Ja.

411
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,380
Aunties!

412
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,809
Thank you.

413
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,618
You know this is all thanks to our boss' hard work, right?

414
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:43,619
Oh, boy.

415
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,818
Boss is such a handful.

416
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:48,819
He is!

417
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,740
Yong Ju might come across as strong, but she's very tenderhearted.

418
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,969
I'll have water ready.

419
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,469
If she cries again, have her drink water...

420
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,578
If you're going to do this,

421
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,609
why don't you just sleep next to her?

422
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:15,880
Love, my love

423
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,348
You really are killing us here.

424
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,519
Please take good care of her.

425
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,789
He tries not to show it,

426
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,400
but he must be very anxious now.

427
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,059
Don't make him wait any longer.

428
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,670
You'll waste all the precious moments if you wait.

429
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,440
Believe me.

430
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,379
- Goodness. - Is she sleeping?

431
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,319
Hey, Yong Ju. Wake up.

432
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,980
Yes, good.

433
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,150
Jjuan is in trouble.

434
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,990
- What? - Look.

435
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
She's so hot.

436
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
She married a guy and ran off with his money.

437
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:04,758
She ran away just a month after coming to Korea.

438
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,768
I guess she's been hiding here.

439
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:07,798
- What is this place? - Isn't she a celebrity?

440
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,268
- She works at a brewery. - The brewmaster is hot.

441
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:11,499
Are they a couple?

442
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,038
A hundred percent. I bet all my money.

443
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,768
Let's boycott Naro Beer.

444
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,308
- We're boycotting Naro Beer! - We're boycotting Naro Beer!

445
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:17,538
- We're boycotting Naro Beer! - Here's something more shocking.

446
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:18,909
- Is he really her husband? - Husband?

447
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,650
- They do not look like a couple. - I'm getting goosebumps.

448
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:22,349
Shouldn't someone tell him?

449
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,190
Where is Jjuan now?

450
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:29,920
The moment I first saw Jjuan, I knew...

451
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,288
she'd seduce him and take his everything.

452
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:33,289
Exactly.

453
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,758
Kim is a fool.

454
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,699
He's too nice. Don't even get me started.

455
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,130
This is why they say old sayings are never wrong.

456
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,399
You must be careful who you interact with!

457
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,699
- That's right. - I hear...

458
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,669
people want to boycott Naro Beer.

459
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,239
- What are we going to do? - What will you do about this?

460
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,539
Don't do this!

461
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:51,479
Must you flock here and cause all this fuss...

462
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,910
just because of some comments on the Internet?

463
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,650
If you have time for this, go home, wash your feet, and sleep.

464
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,880
Please leave now!

465
00:27:58,019 --> 00:27:59,048
- Go! - Hey!

466
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:01,018
- Leave! - What will you do?

467
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,019
Leave now, please!

468
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:08,758
I uploaded the video because I thought Jjuan was very pretty.

469
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:11,499
I didn't think it'd cause something like this. I'm really sorry.

470
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,670
Gosh, listen.

471
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:17,440
We're just like any other ordinary married couple.

472
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,269
I don't understand what's happening all of a sudden.

473
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,279
I'm so frazzled now.

474
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,579
This is all my fault.

475
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,249
Hey, that's not true. Why would you say that?

476
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,979
As a YouTuber,

477
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,348
I sure know what to do when something like this happens.

478
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:33,150
You shouldn't just ignore it and let it slide.

479
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:35,018
This has sparked many people's interest,

480
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:37,460
and the viewers have the right to know. Right?

481
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,288
Just tell me everything,

482
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:41,089
and I'll upload a new video with all the facts.

483
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:43,559
Thank you. Okay.

484
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,230
But you know, we feel so awkward in front of this camera.

485
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,469
I don't know how I can talk in front of...

486
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,470
Jjuan.

487
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:53,069
Why did you run off with your ex-husband's money?

488
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,349
- Oh, boy. - What are you doing?

489
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,119
This is quite an effort you're making to talk some nonsense.

490
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:07,819
"The right to know?" What exactly do you mean by that?

491
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,689
Don't think you can cover up your mistake with some fancy words.

492
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,028
What are you talking about?

493
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:15,598
I'm just trying to help them. I came with good intentions.

494
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,529
Who will benefit the most from this?

495
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,430
Your video view counts. Am I wrong?

496
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,900
In my eyes, you're having fun now.

497
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,009
Their pain gives you pleasure.

498
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,240
You're the owner of the brewery.

499
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,410
Be honest. You must be upset too.

500
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,808
What if you have to shut down your brewery because of this?

501
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,219
Oh, my goodness.

502
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,379
- I'm really sorry. - We're sorry.

503
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,789
Don't bow your heads, you two.

504
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,359
You did nothing wrong.

505
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,789
I know you two are in love, and that's why you got married.

506
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,129
Love? She might be just trying to use him.

507
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,359
How would you know?

508
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,599
Scammers would do anything to scam you.

509
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,369
I know they're in love. I could tell at a glance.

510
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,569
I guess you've never seen anyone in love.

511
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:00,609
Come on.

512
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,108
(3 years earlier)

513
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,309
- Hey! - No.

514
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,778
You knew you couldn't get pregnant, so you should've told me.

515
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:10,149
Do you know that this is a marriage fraud?

516
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,220
I told you from the get-go...

517
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,990
that I was infertile.

518
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,858
I don't understand what you're saying!

519
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:18,019
You said it didn't matter.

520
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,789
That you loved me.

521
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,059
And it didn't matter at all.

522
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,930
That everything would be fine as long as I came to Korea.

523
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,999
That's why I came.

524
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,768
Go back to your country.

525
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:29,839
No!

526
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,339
What am I supposed to do if you just leave like this?

527
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:36,609
Darn it!

528
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,720
No one here will take your side.

529
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:44,519
No one even understands what you're saying.

530
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,519
Don't be pathetic. Just go back to your country.

531
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,019
This never happened.

532
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:49,589
No...

533
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,930
- No, don't leave me... - Hey!

534
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,900
What are you doing?

535
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:12,079
There, you got a little taste of Baegok-ri's iron fist!

536
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,980
She has someone right here. I'm on her side.

537
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,380
What are you going to do? I understood everything she said.

538
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,019
How could you do this to a woman?

539
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,750
Are you okay?

540
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,420
As a Korean, I apologize.

541
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,490
Please just think of this as bad luck.

542
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:04,859
I will help you with anything, no matter what.

543
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:07,069
Oh, no.

544
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
My gosh.

545
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,039
I'm fine.

546
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:17,579
I'm okay.

547
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:20,349
Thank you.

548
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,390
(Kim's Supermarket)

549
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,960
My goodness.

550
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,170
Seriously, why do you keep coming here?

551
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,640
If people see us together, they'll gossip.

552
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,809
They'll think...

553
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,278
I'm holding you hostage or something.

554
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,279
Oh, boy.

555
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:57,849
This is...

556
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:02,519
Why are you always here?

557
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,960
When we are together, people look at us...

558
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,129
Kim Soon Gwan.

559
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,430
(Kim Soon Gwan)

560
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,869
Come down, my cheeks.

561
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,140
No, this isn't right. I shouldn't smile.

562
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,009
Don't do this. Come down, cheeks.

563
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,220
I think you have a good chance at this.

564
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,789
I have a good chance at what?

565
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,289
Forget it if I got the wrong idea.

566
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,359
My goodness. I'm so busy right now.

567
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,069
(Kim's Supermarket)

568
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
Hey.

569
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,068
Did you come outside to wait for her?

570
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,839
This is wrong.

571
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:57,910
It is a grave sin.

572
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,710
Yes, it's a sin. All right?

573
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,988
What? When did I write her name like this?

574
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,960
I could go to jail for this.

575
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,229
How did I even do this? Oh, dear.

576
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,630
Why don't you pluck up your courage and tell her?

577
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,300
Hey, seriously.

578
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,368
You show up like this every day...

579
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:26,940
and confuse me. Why are you doing this?

580
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,038
Also, it's not like we have the kind of relationship...

581
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:32,009
where we share our personal feelings.

582
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,679
I think the two of you feel the same way about each other.

583
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,019
I'm not the type to meddle in someone else's love life,

584
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:42,018
but it'd be such a shame not to do anything about it.

585
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,219
My goodness.

586
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,788
Forget it if I'm wrong.

587
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:45,989
You keep pushing me like this.

588
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,089
Don't do this, seriously.

589
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,558
I can't sleep when my mind wanders.

590
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:55,840
And more, what do you mean by "you two are on the same page?"

591
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,599
I couldn't even see her face for the last couple of days.

592
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:03,539
From where I stand, she went back to her homeland.

593
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,250
Did she?

594
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:10,480
- I don't think so. - What?

595
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,949
Over there.

596
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,530
I know very well...

597
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:24,860
that expressing yourself frankly is not easy.

598
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,800
But how about making a move?

599
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,570
Maybe, it's her, who is waiting for the moment to come.

600
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,070
Do you agree?

601
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:34,809
Then, please.

602
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,788
- Oh, sorry. - Darn, you!

603
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:50,388
Even a snail would be faster than you!

604
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:52,018
All the elderly have been waiting!

605
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,989
What the heck are you...

606
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:55,689
doing?

607
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,960
Today is a good day. So, please, stop picking a fight.

608
00:35:58,699 --> 00:35:59,769
Step aside.

609
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,070
This way.

610
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,839
Who are you?

611
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,010
Is she a celebrity? What brought you lady to such...

612
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,238
a lowly place?

613
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:11,409
Everyone.

614
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,519
We're going to be married soon.

615
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:20,590
She's still not good at speaking Korean.

616
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:24,820
So, please, look after her.

617
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,530
Please, introduce yourself to all.

618
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,339
Nice to meet you. I'm Jjuan.

619
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,739
- What? - Jjuan.

620
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,768
- I guess she's not a Korean. - I see.

621
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:43,610
Please, call her Jjuan!

622
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:49,380
Why should I make an excuse for our love?

623
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,119
"A fraudulent marriage"?

624
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:53,789
What a crap!

625
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,659
Cut the crap!

626
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:01,459
Whenever I'm with her,

627
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,730
an ordinary day without any special events is...

628
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,630
special to me.

629
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,699
I even hoped time would stop.

630
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,670
I was so thankful for everything.

631
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,738
It all looked so shiny and precious.

632
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:17,980
When I'm with her,

633
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,780
what people call nothing special...

634
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,150
turns into joy and happiness.

635
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:25,079
That's why we married.

636
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:26,449
You got it?

637
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,389
Didn't you say you liked me?

638
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:10,099
Did I? When? I couldn't have said that.

639
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,699
He...

640
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,369
is hurting more over my ordeal than me.

641
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,499
I hate to see that. Why step back again?

642
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,939
Don't make him wait any longer.

643
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,768
You'll waste all the precious moments if you wait.

644
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:23,780
I even hoped time would stop.

645
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,679
I was so thankful for everything.

646
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,019
It all looked so shiny and precious.

647
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:43,860
You know, I have something to tell you.

648
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:45,329
Yes?

649
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,178
I never knew this word made me this nervous!

650
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:58,809
Wait. I'll find my courage.

651
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,889
It makes me even more nervous than a high-altitude drop!

652
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,360
Yes. I feel it too.

653
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,860
I love you.

654
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:51,260
I love you, Yoon Min Ju.

655
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,010
I have...

656
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,409
loved you...

657
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,349
for every single moment.

658
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,820
(Uilhan Brewery)

659
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:47,389
Sweetie.

660
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,788
You're recently indifferent to me.

661
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:55,829
I may become sullen, then!

662
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,530
Don't be obsessed.

663
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,300
We agreed to have a casual fling only.

664
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,670
What's going on?

665
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,869
I don't know.

666
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:11,109
But why isn't Yong Ju coming?

667
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,679
Maybe, she's still not over it.

668
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,649
I'm worried that something happened to her.

669
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,019
Don't worry. She will come back full of vigour.

670
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,719
Hello, guys!

671
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:24,920
I'm sorry that I worried you all.

672
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:26,860
And thanks for waiting.

673
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:30,029
So, we don't have time to waste...

674
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,730
on new product development.

675
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:36,500
From now on, it's time to start again!

676
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,739
- Yes! - Yes!

00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:41,909

(The 4th sample)

679
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:44,840
(The final evaluation)

680
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,409
(Uilhan Brewery)

681
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:53,889
It tastes much better than the third sample.

682
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,019
But it still lacks the body.

683
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:47,940
- Hey! - Yes!

684
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,179
Wait a minute.

685
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,179
You wore blush.

686
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,679
You got a new lipstick.

687
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:01,320
You bought everything new.

688
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,320
How did you recognize that?

689
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:05,090
Who are you trying to impress?

690
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,099
What about me? Do you recognize something about me?

691
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,869
I really don't know.

692
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:24,379
Come on. Are you serious?

693
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,809
You really don't notice anything?

694
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,848
Your glasses! It's your glasses!

695
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:30,879
I got it right!

696
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,979
Yes, it's your glasses. That's it, right?

697
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,590
Come on. You should easily recognize that I'm wearing different glasses.

698
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,219
- Wait, so it's not your glasses? - Come on.

699
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:41,530
I trimmed my bangs a bit.

700
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:42,889
How would I know that?

701
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:46,368
- So you wanted to go somewhere. - Yes.

702
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:47,369
Where are we going?

703
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:49,099
Yes!

704
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,639
Security on all fronts.

705
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,339
Security on all fronts? We're on a date.

706
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,380
Go!

707
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,750
Gosh, she didn't even make a sound when she took off.

708
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,260
Oh, my. What do I do?

709
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:14,630
That stings.

710
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,359
- Gosh. What was that? - Come on.

711
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,029
- Are you okay? - I'm sorry.

712
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,099
- I'm sorry. - Let's go.

713
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,328
- What was that? - I'm sorry.

714
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,239
- I told you to duck. - What were you doing?

715
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,639
- You should've fired more quickly. - Come on.

716
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:27,210
Eyes front.

717
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,039
- Quickly! - Well...

718
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,809
What are you doing?

719
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:38,980
Well, it looks like we don't have to look ahead anymore.

720
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,949
You killed them all.

721
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:45,760
It's already over?

722
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,558
You can't treat this game like a real battle.

723
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:52,630
Isn't this how you play this game?

724
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,670
This is not going to be easy.

725
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,219
- We had so much fun today. Right? - Yes.

726
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:15,820
Get home safely.

727
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,158
Right! I must have spilled some food on my shirt during our meal earlier.

728
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:22,690
I must wash it. I really should.

729
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,360
At my house?

730
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,130
- Yes. This is my favourite shirt. - What?

731
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:29,369
Should I turn on the TV?

732
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:39,179
Did you have a good trip to the...

733
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:42,448
I mean... Should we have some fruits?

734
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:43,579
Yes, that sounds good.

735
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,949
Right on.

736
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:48,550
Why are you acting so awkward all of a sudden?

737
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,719
It's like you've never had a guy over late at night.

738
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,359
My gosh, no.

739
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,300
Come on. Gosh, don't be silly.

740
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,000
You're right. So what?

741
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:07,539
What do you want to eat? What kind of fruit do I have?

742
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,940
Why are you going in there?

743
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,519
I'll help you discover...

744
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,920
everything that you like.

745
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:23,719
To make up for the time you spent not being yourself,

746
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,829
I'm going to find everything you like.

747
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,760
- What? - Oh, right.

748
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,699
There's a TV show I wanted to show. I must watch it.

749
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:35,869
You're not going home?

750
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:38,239
I'll go after the show.

751
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:42,639
Why do you want to watch a TV show now?

752
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:48,110
What about the fruit?

753
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,519
Oh, right! Yes. The fruit.

754
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,219
Do you want pears? You know what? I'll figure something out.

755
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:58,259
(3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent...)

756
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,530
Are you guys done?

757
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:02,190
- Yes. - Yes.

758
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:04,929
Let's take a look. One, two, three.

759
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:09,329
(11 percent, 9 percent, 5 percent)

760
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,669
That's interesting. We organically divided into three groups.

761
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,369
Five percent, nine percent, and eleven percent.

762
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:36,360
Nice.

763
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:42,629
- My gosh. - How is it?

764
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,639
It's great.

765
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,670
- It went well. - Nice.

766
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,469
What? What's this?

767
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,900
Coffee. You like nutty coffee.

768
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,139
Thanks.

769
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,309
You're really not leaving? Aren't you busy?

770
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:25,380
I'm busy. There's so much stuff I have to do.

771
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,210
Okay.

772
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,110
How beautiful.

773
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,210
You didn't bring an umbrella, right?

774
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,849
I knew it. So I came.

775
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,550
Let's go.

776
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,829
My gosh. There are so many different records here.

777
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,900
I can't believe this is here.

778
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:58,869
I'm so excited. I love it.

779
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,238
What? They have this one too?

780
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:03,779
I listened to this all the time when I was in school.

781
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,710
No way. What's this doing here?

782
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,679
No way. I listened to this over 100 times. I'm not kidding.

783
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,250
- Really? - Yes.

784
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:12,980
You like songs like this too?

785
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:14,949
This is amazing.

786
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,989
What did you just do? Come on.

787
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:24,460
People are watching!

788
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:29,199
What?

789
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:34,210
("Everything I Love Will Make Me Cry")

790
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,550
("Your Name, Youth" by Movning)

791
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,510
(Music Notebook)

792
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,808
My gosh. You don't have to hold it.

793
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,349
I'm pretty good at riding a bicycle.

794
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:17,919
You said you were sad that you didn't have anyone...

795
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,179
to hold your bike when you were little.

796
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,288
You didn't forget anything I said.

797
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:22,420
I remember everything.

798
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,119
Come on.

799
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,659
One, two, three.

800
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,558
- There you go! - Let go!

801
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:32,929
- Gosh. - Yes!

802
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:37,670
I'm so good at this!

803
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:39,570
Come back now.

804
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:54,320
You made a really nice soup.

805
00:51:58,619 --> 00:51:59,690
What's that?

806
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,190
Here.

807
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,159
What? What is it?

808
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,268
What? It's so cute!

809
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:08,400
Have you heard that we should make sure...

810
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:10,539
our everyday items are pretty to look at?

811
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:12,069
I'm not sure.

812
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,968
But what's the point if we use them every day?

813
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,570
I really like that idea.

814
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,638
Even when we drink water,

815
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:20,449
it would be great if we could smile while looking at a pretty cup.

816
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:24,718
Is that so?

817
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,289
It's about knowing what puts you in a good mood.

818
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,018
It's not about liking something in general.

819
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:31,820
Instead of just saying, "I like this song,"

820
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,658
say "I like listening to a song..."

821
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:38,000
"while having coffee in a pretty cup."

822
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:39,659
Like that.

823
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,739
Let's find ten things you particularly love.

824
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:48,210
We'll do it together.

825
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,010
- Fine. We'll do it together. - Yes.

826
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,219
When did my room get so pretty?

827
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,530
Grandma.

828
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,760
I've never had this feeling before.

829
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,929
I find myself looking in the mirror often these days.

830
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:51,699
I quite like myself.

831
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,739
I look pretty.

832
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:56,469
Funny, isn't it?

(Final sample)

834
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,250
All right. At last,

835
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,159
we have the final samples of our three beers.

836
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,589
Gosh, please! With the hope that...

837
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,589
our beers will be loved by the consumers,

838
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,659
let's name our beer.

839
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,960
- Okay. - Okay.

840
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:21,928

(Beer Naming)

843
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:47,729
Why are there so many beers in Korea?

844
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,288
All of our names overlap. And the good ones are already taken.

845
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:52,259
It should be easy to say but leaves an impression.

846
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,829
An eye-catching name people can remember right away.

847
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,900
Can you think of a name like that?

848
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,639
I'm low on sugar.

849
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,139
Here.

850
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,960
My gosh.

851
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:26,760
Goodness. That's nice.

852
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,400
Gosh, I feel awake now.

853
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,909
- All right. Let's keep trying. - Okay.

854
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,639
Yes. Let's just go with 1, 2, and 3.

855
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:38,510
They're a set already.

856
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:41,010
A set?

857
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,250
I see.

858
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:44,118
They vary in both colour and alcohol content,

859
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:45,280
but they're on the same team.

860
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,518
Doesn't this remind us of us?

861
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:48,590
"Us?"

862
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,119
Hold on.

863
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,098
(Together)

864
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,130
What do you think?

865
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,198
The word, "together," already has such a powerful meaning.

866
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:06,768
It suits the theme of our beer. Don't you think so?

867
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:10,169
It represents us, but it still embraces these three beers.

868
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,308
- Together. - Together sounds great!

869
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:14,809
- Hey, I love it! - That's a great name.

870
00:56:15,449 --> 00:56:18,149
- The inspiration came from me. - What a surprise.

871
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,219
Good one.

872
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,719
- That was totally me. - My goodness.

873
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:39,340
All right. Let's begin.

874
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:41,869
Okay.

875
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,218
Right.

876
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:57,288
Then if the internal evaluation goes well,

877
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,888
will our product launch right away?

878
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:01,489
No. The final boss has to give us a green light.

879
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:02,989
The chairman.

880
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,360
I thought the chairman was going to attend this meeting too.

881
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,198
Yes. But his overseas meeting couldn't be rescheduled.

882
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:10,969
So he will taste the beer tomorrow separately.

883
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,098
The chairman must give us the final confirmation...

884
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:14,709
before our new product can launch.

885
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,808
But we can't overlook the internal evaluation either.

886
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:19,479
My gosh, today's evaluation will be really important.

887
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,110
Gosh, I'm nervous.

My gosh, this is nice.

00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:07,788
- Really? - This is great.

901
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:09,158

908
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:42,559
We did it.

909
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,699
Beer ought to be gulped down like this.

910
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,539
All right. Could you fill it up?

911
00:58:57,309 --> 00:58:58,538
You heard the man.

912
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:01,880

914
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:29,409
I can't believe this.

915
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,840
This can't be true.

920
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:20,729
This is our last chance to stop the new product launch.

921
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,589
It will be difficult to launch the new product.

922
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:23,629
I will submit our beer...

923
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,530
to an international blind beer competition.

924
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:27,968
I'll be your family, Ms. Beautiful Bang.

925
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:29,999
Do everything with me.

926
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,868
Doesn't everyone carry a secret in life?

927
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:36,670
Do you think you can live with someone like me?

928
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,239
I'm only going to look at the man in front of me.

929
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:42,809
The man who had worked hard to get to where he is now.

930
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:44,980
I'll only be looking at you, Yoon Min Ju.
