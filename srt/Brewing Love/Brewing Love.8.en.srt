(Brewing Love)

(This is a work of fiction.)

12
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,071
(Scenes with child actors and animals were filmed...)

13
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:37,103
(under production guidelines along with experts.)

14
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:36,301
Didn't you just say you liked me?

15
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:39,002
Me? When? I wouldn't say that.

16
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,302
Then was it a mistake?

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,742
A mis... A mistake is...

18
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:51,382
No.

19
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:52,983
At least...

20
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:56,183
what happened just now was...

21
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,892
I really meant that.

22
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:04,492
It's fine, then.

23
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,332
- But... - I get it.

24
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:10,762
You're not yet sure how you feel.

25
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:14,072
Take the time you need to think.

26
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:16,942
I'm pretty good at waiting.

27
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:19,542
And...

28
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:24,813
There's something I really wanted to say.

29
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:29,322
Thank you for saving my life.

30
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:31,653
And...

31
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:36,123
I'm sorry you had to save my life.

32
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:41,632
I'll stick close to you and make up for the guilt.

33
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,873
So keep me close...

34
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,672
and let me wait.

35
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,682
Well, do whatever you want.

36
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:58,653
Stay close or not, it's up to you.

37
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:03,852
Let's get back before it gets dark.

38
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:06,792
I brought a tent.

39
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:11,363
What on earth are you...

40
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:14,862
I packed a tent.

41
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:17,333
- A ten... - A tent.

42
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:20,433
What exactly are you imagining?

43
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:22,942
Me?

44
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:27,112
I'm incapable of imagining anything.

45
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:30,243
My MBTI says I'm extremely intuitive.

46
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:32,352
No, am I sensory?

47
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,162
This looks tasty.

48
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:50,562
Yes. There's a lot to eat.

49
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,033
Here you go.

50
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,971
- What? - You're taking the leg?

51
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:59,113
- What the... - Thank you.

52
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:01,842
- Hey. - You all did great today.

53
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,142
You're so cheeky.

54
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,612
That's a no thanks from me. Darn you.

55
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:08,782
Is the person who called for help all right?

56
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,652
It was a young man in his 30s.

57
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,052
He sprained his ankle a bit.

58
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,962
That's fortunate. Why did he come all the way here and get hurt?

59
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,662
It was quite an eventful day.

60
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:21,192
- Good job, everyone. - Let's drink.

61
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:24,162
- Cheers. - Cheers.

62
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,572
What's the matter?

63
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:32,811
We have some tasty chicken so why won't any of you eat?

64
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:36,242
Ms. Chae went looking for CEO Yoon...

65
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,282
and she's not back yet.

66
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:40,713
- I'm dead worried. - Darn it.

67
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:43,681
No. Why worry?

68
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:45,952
I vote that wherever CEO Yoon goes,

69
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,262
Chae Yong Ju will find him and bring him back.

70
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:53,292
Is that your vote? I vote ten times that she'll do it.

71
00:04:53,362 --> 00:04:55,203
Will you wait?

72
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:57,362
Wait up.

73
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,802
Hey. I was really hungry.

74
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:02,471
- Hey. - They're back.

75
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:03,703
She found him.

76
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:05,311
You found him.

77
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:07,372
- Come and sit down. - Yes, join us.

78
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:10,811
- You're back. - Take a seat.

79
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,253
- Were you eating? - Yes.

80
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:14,982
This looks good.

81
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:20,092
- It's really good. - Yes.

82
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:22,822
- What is this? - It's a famous place.

83
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,292
I just love the portions too.

84
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:33,372
- It's good. - Jot down their number.

85
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:35,642
- Here. - Let's eat.

86
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:36,943
Yes, sure.

87
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:38,943
- Go on. - Eat up.

88
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,921
No, I have a top.

89
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:55,692
You don't have to give me yours.

90
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:58,463
- You might catch a cold. - You don't have to...

91
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,393
What a dreadful sight.

92
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,133
Hey.

93
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:05,773
Oh, dear.

94
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,472
There's a mosquito.

95
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,713
Are you saying you don't care if we get bitten?

96
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,181
- It got me already. - Oh, dear.

97
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,823
I donated enough blood to save a life just now.

98
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,492
- Spit on it for me. - Shall I put this here?

99
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:28,362
Here you go.

100
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:30,562
Well...

101
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:38,431
Since when did the boss...

102
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,642
join us to eat as if he didn't mind?

103
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:45,212
Why don't you switch to beekeeping?

104
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:48,182
Honey drips from your eyes when you look at a certain someone.

105
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:51,912
You seem to have the wrong idea. There's nothing...

106
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,283
We're nothing at all.

107
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,522
Why are you overreacting?

108
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:59,351
We're just colleagues. That's all.

109
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,221
Yes. That's what she says we are.

110
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,692
I see.

111
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:05,731
Let's say that's what you are.

112
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:07,562
Not you too, Jjuan.

113
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:09,361
Say something.

114
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,101
There really isn't anything... We're nothing at all.

115
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:14,842
How about we just drink?

116
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:17,602
- Yes. - Sure. Congratulations.

117
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:22,942
You can't be so sweet and kind in the open.

118
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,852
Now you gave everyone the wrong idea.

119
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:28,551
- You said you'd wait. - Yes. I am waiting.

120
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,883
We wait under each other's noses.

121
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:34,492
That look. It's banned.

122
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:39,432
Right now, I feel... So confused.

123
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:42,333
I have no choice but to do that.

124
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,232
You're blocked.

125
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,843
Okay. Then... It can't be helped.

126
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:01,283
Are you sure you won't regret blocking me?

127
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:04,552
Yes. I don't regret.

128
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:06,852
- Are you sure? - Yes.

129
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,062
You're blocked!

130
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:24,343
(Brewing Love)

131
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:40,792
What the heck is this?

132
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:46,332
It's just me.

133
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,662
Oh Chan Hwi.

134
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:54,003
Why are you... Did you sleep here?

135
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:02,243
You don't remember?

136
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,513
Darn it.

137
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,952
Go.

138
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,363
Don't go?

139
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,863
Go.

140
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:22,702
Don't go.

141
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:25,633
Go.

142
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:30,273
Don't go?

143
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:32,412
Don't go?

144
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:36,312
I shouldn't go.

145
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:41,952
Wait.

146
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:45,822
Don't wait.

147
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:49,692
Wait. Don't wait.

148
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:53,462
Wait.

149
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:56,102
I should wait.

150
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:58,432
I'm pretty sure I saw...

151
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:03,342
Ah Reum receive a guy's profile from a matchmaking company.

152
00:10:03,873 --> 00:10:05,613
She has a date tomorrow.

153
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:10,013
What would you think of a guy who showed up to mess it up?

154
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:11,642
Would I be a loser?

155
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:15,253
I told Yong Ju clearly that I'd wait.

156
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,422
She needed time to think.

157
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,123
But...

158
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:22,192
what would you think of a guy who can't wait?

159
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,091
- Would I be a loser? - Should I just go?

160
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,431
Should I just not wait?

161
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:29,102
I shouldn't go, should I?

162
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:30,763
I should wait, shouldn't I?

163
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:35,171
What if the guy she meets is a real catch...

164
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:38,643
and they fall for each other and things go really well?

165
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,243
What then?

166
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,243
What if she keeps me waiting?

167
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:44,882
What if she needs forever to think?

168
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:48,883
What if she tells me to wait for 1, 2, 3, 4 months?

169
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,452
What if she says no then?

170
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,993
What then?

171
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,493
I hate Bang Ah Reum.

172
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,922
I hate Chae Yong Ju.

173
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:03,003
Yes. Chae Yong Ju's worse.

174
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,103
Hey. That's not true.

175
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:12,373
Will you wait?

176
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:16,212
I should wait.

177
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:20,153
- Will you go? - I shouldn't go.

178
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:22,523
You liar.

179
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:32,662
What am I doing here?

180
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:38,003
She looks even more beautiful today.

181
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:43,171
We saw each other's profiles and details.

182
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:44,643
We shouldn't waste time.

183
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:48,542
I heard you're a practical and reasonable person.

184
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:52,181
To someone whose goal is marriage,

185
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:54,513
timing and conditions are more important than love.

186
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:57,623
I love you.

187
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,692
Right.

188
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:03,821
The couple manager said you and I were quite similar...

189
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:06,692
and that we'd suit each other and I think so too.

190
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:11,133
You seem to fit all the conditions I require in a woman.

191
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:14,473
How do you like me?

192
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:17,773
I'm a man with many secrets.

193
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:21,072
I found...

194
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,983
I ripped it up.

195
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:25,783
Make a wish and blow it out.

196
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:31,052
Let me date Oh Chan Hwi.

197
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:35,292
Fine, then.

198
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,292
What's your favorite food?

199
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:40,393
I heard you had a strict diet.

200
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:55,143
- Toasties. - What?

201
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,143
Toasties. They're my favorite.

202
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,782
Shall we wrap this up? I have another date.

203
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:02,922
Another date?

204
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:06,821
You scheduled two dates in one day?

205
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:08,993
- Well... - You're rejecting me?

206
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:13,763
Hey. You're an A minus and I'm an A plus.

207
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:17,301
I agreed to go below my grade because I couldn't stand girls...

208
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,972
who bragged about their families and you have zero manners.

209
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,332
I apologize for that.

210
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,143
I'll settle the bill.

211
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:25,373
Hey!

212
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:28,582
"Hey?"

213
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:31,442
"Hey?"

214
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:37,822
Shall we go see the ocean?

215
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,733
Yes.

216
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,202
Where's the ocean?

217
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,273
Where's the ocean?

218
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:05,212
Ocean. Where are you?

219
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,283
Give me your hand.

220
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:29,643
I think you're a grade A with many pluses.

221
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,903
How dare he call you an A minus?

222
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:37,311
Will this come off?

223
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,812
Hey. Ms. Beautiful.

224
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,353
It's not the time to say things like that.

225
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:45,052
Things were so romantic.

226
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:49,322
What if it doesn't come off?

227
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:56,962
Shall we date?

228
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,013
Why won't you respond?

229
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,783
- You don't want to? - No. I do want to.

230
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:22,562
I was shocked. That's why.

231
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,263
I'm all about logical judgments,

232
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:33,033
so to me, this decision is pretty impulsive.

233
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:35,672
But I don't want to have regrets.

234
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:45,143
Yes!

235
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:52,052
Ocean! We're a couple!

236
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:16,842
Chae Yong Ju!

237
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:18,912
Focus.

238
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:33,132
No, I have a top.

239
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,903
- You might catch a cold. - You don't have to...

240
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:37,903
Goodness.

241
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:42,342
Well, I'm worried, that's all.

242
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:45,773
If we meet again today, he'll be excessively kind.

243
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:49,812
If he were to give me his shirt in front of everyone again,

244
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,753
that would make me feel too uncomfortable.

245
00:16:56,822 --> 00:17:00,723
No. Chae Yong Ju, focus on your job.

246
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:04,322
Draw the line and keep him blocked.

247
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:07,432
"I'd rather you not get too close."

248
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,102
Say that. That's it.

249
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,773
I look too much like a black marker.

250
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:17,142
What?

251
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:20,542
You don't like any of your clothes?

252
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:25,952
It's not that. I was looking for something new.

253
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:28,483
Yes. You should buy some clothes.

254
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:30,983
I wanted to say that long ago.

255
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:33,193
- Buy something bright. - Should I?

256
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:35,892
My hair's boring too, isn't it?

257
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:37,821
Yes, it is.

258
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:41,493
Go to a hair salon and a department store this weekend.

259
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:45,203
For once, you're saying just what I like to hear.

260
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:48,202
You wanted me to say that? Why?

261
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:51,601
I don't know why, but it's oddly pleasing to hear.

262
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:52,673
What?

263
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:58,042
- I'm off. - Don't be intimidated.

264
00:17:58,612 --> 00:17:59,683
Let's go.

265
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,081
- See you. - Bye.

266
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,183
Don't come outside.

267
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:08,693
(Fate)

268
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:21,301
Rao, thanks for driving.

269
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:23,102
It's my job.

270
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:24,442
Is it?

271
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:27,041
Why isn't Ah Reum here yet?

272
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,773
Neither is Chan Hwi.

273
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:30,283
There's Chan Hwi.

274
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:33,652
(Hwi's Toast)

275
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:39,892
Hi.

276
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:45,663
- Hey. - Hey.

277
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,562
Why would he drive you?

278
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,792
Sweetie.

279
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:50,631
- The... - Crazy...

280
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:51,703
Punk.

281
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,172
Ah Reum and I are together!

282
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:57,203
(The Crazy Punk)

283
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:59,242
He's at it again.

284
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:01,541
Why say that? Ms. Bang will feel uncomfortable.

285
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,243
I'd be sick of him already.

286
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,341
He shouldn't take his jokes too far.

287
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:07,812
It's true. We're dating.

288
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:10,852
What?

289
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,222
If you're being threatened, blink twice.

290
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,591
You need to rethink this.

291
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,332
Did you get drunk and...

292
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,902
It so happened.

293
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:27,772
What?

294
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:30,173
Ms. Beautiful Bang asked me out.

295
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:35,812
Why?

296
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:39,612
(Uilhan Brewery)

297
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,052
Mr. Yoon.

298
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,022
Did you hear the shocking news?

299
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:50,121
About Chan Hwi and Ms. Bang?

300
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,522
I don't get it.

301
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,631
But how do you know already when we just found out?

302
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:57,332
I'm quick to notice stuff.

303
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:01,203
I can tell right away who likes whom.

304
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,872
Hello.

305
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:10,513
- Oh, so how is your father? - Right.

306
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:13,183
I should've started with that.

307
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:16,652
Thank you so much for your help.

308
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:20,953
The surgery went well and he was moved to the general ward.

309
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:24,763
After my father fainted like that,

310
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:27,493
I wondered why bad things kept happening to me.

311
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,401
I blamed myself as if...

312
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,003
it were because I was useless.

313
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:34,473
Rao.

314
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,902
Once we move the beer to the fermentation chamber,

315
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:40,013
our job is done.

316
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,312
The fermenting process is left to the beer.

317
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:46,311
That's why sometimes, even though we did...

318
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,552
the exact same thing, we must throw out a whole batch of products.

319
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:50,723
That's because...

320
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,892
it's a process we can't control.

321
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:57,362
It didn't go wrong due to anyone's fault.

322
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:01,693
So try not to blame yourself too much.

323
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:03,533
Mr. Yoon.

324
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:06,302
Can we be sworn brothers?

325
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:09,072
- Let's get the samples. - I'll help you set up.

326
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,273
I think we can do without you.

327
00:21:14,713 --> 00:21:16,442
Can't I come...

328
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,743
(Uilhan Brewery)

329
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:21,013
Why does it feel like he's blocking me?

330
00:21:23,322 --> 00:21:26,422
Because of the price point, to make the second sample,

331
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:29,162
I took out the premium ingredients and focused on a light taste.

332
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:33,362
The second sample definitely tastes more like a mass-produced beer.

333
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,101
I would be widely accepted and the aroma's not too strong.

334
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:38,601
It's a good thing that everyone could like it,

335
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:40,302
but that could be a weakness too.

336
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:42,131
It doesn't have a distinct feature.

337
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:44,003
It's good from a cost point of view.

338
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:45,472
Cost is the most important to me.

339
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:48,871
But taste-wise, I like the first one.

340
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,783
The second one is better to mix soju with.

341
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:52,651
Koreans love somaek...

342
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,412
that's easy to drink.

343
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,151
Youngsters these days...

344
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:58,381
don't drink that much somaek like in the past.

345
00:21:58,382 --> 00:22:01,352
They want to drink something premium even if it's just one glass.

346
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,263
I like the first one more.

347
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:07,163
First one and second one. It's a 50-50.

348
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,602
Honestly, it's a fact that both...

349
00:22:12,102 --> 00:22:15,402
the first and second ones don't taste new.

350
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:19,473
The critical point is to find if it's in any way better...

351
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,312
than the classic beers already on the market.

352
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:26,253
But nothing comes to mind.

353
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:29,983
We're running out of time.

354
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:45,933
Keep your style, will you?

355
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,703
Aren't you a director?

356
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:50,901
Being so neat...

357
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,743
makes you look cold.

358
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,912
Is the new product development going as planned?

359
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:58,013
Yes.

360
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,183
Of course. It's sailing smoothly.

361
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:04,022
Ms. Chae isn't just doing her best.

362
00:23:04,023 --> 00:23:05,722
She's risking her life on it.

363
00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:08,352
Come to think of it, I'm blessed with good people.

364
00:23:08,523 --> 00:23:10,361
My senior guides me forward.

365
00:23:10,362 --> 00:23:11,963
My junior supports my back.

366
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:16,062
Maybe you wouldn't know since you've got no connections.

367
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:17,862
Sorry.

368
00:23:29,013 --> 00:23:30,142
That little...

369
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:34,652
He's no match for me.

370
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,292
Chae Yong Ju.

371
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,822
What progress have you made with the new product development?

372
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:44,392
Forget it. Come to the office at once.

373
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:46,263
What? I've got no connections?

374
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:49,933
As if he has a lot of connections!

375
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,801
Seriously. He only got promoted...

376
00:23:52,802 --> 00:23:54,401
by pouring drinks and currying favors!

377
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:55,473
How dare you...

378
00:23:58,542 --> 00:23:59,642
Calm down.

379
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:03,183
(Planning Team Director Yeom Jang Goon)

380
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:06,082
(Planning Team Director Yeom Jang Goon)

381
00:24:12,023 --> 00:24:14,423
Right. How's the new product development going?

382
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,162
Did you get any news from Bang Ah Reum?

383
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,121
Ever since Ms. Chae stormed in,

384
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:19,733
Bang Ah Reum stopped giving reports.

385
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,162
You should've still checked in with her.

386
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:24,033
Must I even give you such orders?

387
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,432
I'm sorry.

388
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,503
I can't let the Marketing Team run wild any longer.

389
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:30,003
I will cut off all of their luck and connections.

390
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:31,901
How...

391
00:24:31,902 --> 00:24:34,112
I'd rather see the new production development fail...

392
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:36,142
than let the Marketing Team Director succeed.

393
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:39,142
That'll play more favorably to me.

394
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,602
What do you think? Is this good enough?

395
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:02,571
I'll try harder.

396
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:05,402
No.

397
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:07,611
Trying harder isn't enough.

398
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:09,012
Show them what you've got.

399
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:12,412
The chairman is waiting for it night and day.

400
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:15,882
Bringing you here must be worth something.

401
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,852
You Marketing Team Manager.

402
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:21,552
Listen. At this rate,

403
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:24,223
saving the guys in Busan will be hard.

404
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:27,493
Don't you agree?

405
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:33,703
We'll settle on a concept fast and report it to you.

406
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,542
I'm back.

407
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:46,483
Did you have dinner?

408
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:50,652
Teach me how to record audio on this phone.

409
00:25:50,923 --> 00:25:52,352
Right now? But why?

410
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,852
Don't ask. I just need to know how to do it.

411
00:25:56,592 --> 00:25:58,192
If you're tired, I'll ask the caregiver.

412
00:25:58,193 --> 00:25:59,892
No. Take a seat.

413
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,102
- Look. - Okay.

414
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:04,702
- Go into this app. - Okay.

415
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:07,132
See this red button? Give it a touch.

416
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,301
- Say "hi." - Hi.

417
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,743
After that, touch the button next to do it.

418
00:26:13,142 --> 00:26:15,473
Save, and that's it.

419
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,683
Got it.

420
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:21,983
Grandma.

421
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:25,283
I'm so busy that we can't spend much time together.

422
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:28,052
- You get bored, right? - No way.

423
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:30,562
Life is really fun right now.

424
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:32,963
What is it? What fun are you having?

425
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:36,003
Watching you.

426
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:39,203
Watching you is the most entertaining.

427
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:41,673
Me? What's there to watch about me?

428
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:43,973
- I'm the same every day. - You've changed.

429
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:47,213
You've changed a lot.

430
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,612
Really?

431
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:58,082
I need a story.

432
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:00,552
A story.

433
00:27:01,193 --> 00:27:02,621
At this rate,

434
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,963
saving the guys in Busan will be hard.

(CEO Yoon Min Ju)

436
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,812
No.

437
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:22,443
Stop relying on him.

438
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:24,782
Bear it alone. Chae Yong Ju.

439
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:26,382
You were the best at bearing it alone.

440
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:29,253
No! Hang up!

441
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:37,561
(CEO Yoon Min Ju)

442
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:41,692
(CEO Yoon Min Ju)

443
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,962
- Hello? - Hi.

444
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:45,003
I called the wrong number.

445
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,672
You went to the office in such a rush.

446
00:27:47,673 --> 00:27:48,932
Is something going on?

447
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,272
No. Everything is fine.

448
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:54,541
The higher-ups are extremely interested in our beer development.

449
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:57,783
It was like giving them a report. Don't worry too much.

450
00:27:57,983 --> 00:27:59,112
Is that so?

451
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:02,311
I'll think about the concept more.

452
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:04,423
All right. I'll see you at our next meeting.

453
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:10,463
Isn't she acting tougher than usual?

454
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:18,232
Did the higher-ups scold you?

455
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,361
(Did the higher-ups scold you?)

456
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:21,602
As the manager, you have to hide it from your teammates.

457
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,342
I hope you're not enduring it by yourself.

458
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:28,513
I would run to you to comfort you if you were close by.

459
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:32,913
Should I head over...

460
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:34,453
right now?

461
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:42,923
Right?

462
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,892
I'm overdoing it, right?

463
00:28:45,463 --> 00:28:47,062
I know, okay? I know.

464
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,801
But these are my honest feelings.

465
00:28:51,802 --> 00:28:52,933
So what?

466
00:28:57,503 --> 00:29:00,243
Yes. I know I'm waiting.

467
00:29:01,443 --> 00:29:03,612
I shouldn't pressure her either.

468
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:07,453
But how much longer do I have to wait?

469
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:14,992
Cheer up!

470
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:16,523
(CEO Yoon Min Ju: Cheer up!)

471
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:24,433
Don't laugh.

472
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:26,802
Seriously.

473
00:29:27,102 --> 00:29:29,502
How did Oh Chan Hwi and Bang Ah Reum hook up so fast?

474
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:32,302
How did they figure out their feelings that easily?

475
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:36,882
Yoon Min Ju? Yes, he's a nice person.

476
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:40,283
I want to protect him.

477
00:29:42,812 --> 00:29:44,582
And yes, he gives me butterflies.

478
00:29:44,822 --> 00:29:48,923
But love? I'm not sure if I love him.

479
00:29:49,963 --> 00:29:51,522
Isn't love like that?

480
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:55,763
Like the heart pounding like thunder?

481
00:29:56,132 --> 00:29:59,602
Or like make my hair stand on end?

482
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:03,142
My feelings don't go that far.

483
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:07,342
As if I had ever thought about these things.

484
00:30:13,652 --> 00:30:15,213
This and that.

485
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:21,423
All of them give me a headache.

486
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,033
(3rd Sample)

487
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:31,533
Beer developers are incredible.

488
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:33,933
They must've drank tons of beer.

489
00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:37,503
You now realize how hard it is to create a new beer, right?

490
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,172
What shocks me is the lack of decisions...

491
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,013
we've made despite all of our meetings.

492
00:30:44,783 --> 00:30:46,453
Will we make it in time?

493
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:49,622
- My head hurts. - We have to.

494
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:51,852
One way or another.

495
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,223
All right.

496
00:30:55,023 --> 00:30:56,193
- Here you go. - What are those?

497
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:01,391
Here.

498
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:05,163
Are you giving us coffee in a bowl?

499
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:07,131
You wanted a bowlful of coffee for your hangover.

500
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,433
Why are you complaining?

501
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:10,743
I love the size of it.

502
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:15,173
Guess what the villagers here say when they drink Americano.

503
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:19,713
This is what killed Royal Noble Consort Hui.

504
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,982
What? I make my coffee with a pod machine.

505
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:27,352
Are you looking down on us, Toast?

506
00:31:27,693 --> 00:31:30,621
I only drink Yirgacheffe coffee.

507
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,693
What you're drinking is hand-drip coffee.

508
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,632
To think I'd drink hand-drip coffee in the countryside.

509
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,361
It's all thanks to our boss.

510
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:40,432
We were offered different kinds of coffee.

511
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,002
To find our coffee taste,

512
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:44,142
he brewed us new coffee every day.

513
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:47,841
Finding our old ladies' tastes seemed ridiculous at first.

514
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:50,943
But we understood after drinking different coffees.

515
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:53,913
It was quite nice.

516
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:56,453
Right?

517
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,723
It's a lifetime of homework to find my own taste.

518
00:32:00,993 --> 00:32:03,821
Isn't the iced Americano right up Chae Yong Ju's alley?

519
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,092
Yes, it suits my taste.

520
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,463
Taste?

521
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,203
Let's meet up at the brewery.

522
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:17,473
(Respecting...)

523
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:22,572
(Respecting One's Style Era)

524
00:32:22,842 --> 00:32:25,913
The era of drinking until you drop dead is over.

525
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:28,111
The get-together culture has changed.

526
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,082
The alcohol consumption pattern has completely changed too.

527
00:32:31,453 --> 00:32:35,092
Here comes respecting one's style era.

528
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:47,902
(Select Your Beer)

529
00:32:48,072 --> 00:32:49,841
- "Select?" - This era...

530
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:53,513
does not need a beer solely to get drunk.

531
00:32:54,243 --> 00:32:55,243
"Select."

532
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:59,342
It needs a beer one can select.

533
00:32:59,783 --> 00:33:00,812
I love it.

534
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,811
How did she come up with it?

535
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:04,822
You little... I'm Yong Ju's biggest fan, okay?

536
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:07,552
Yong Ju. I have a good feeling about this.

537
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:12,292
Respecting one's style era. Select your beer.

538
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:16,091
I like the direction it's going. But newly released beers...

539
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:19,503
are also emphasizing personal style as their central concept.

540
00:33:20,072 --> 00:33:23,173
Objectively speaking, it's nothing new.

541
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:26,812
You're right. That's the current beer trend.

542
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:29,881
But despite focusing on people's style,

543
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,312
why do brands release only one type of beer?

544
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:35,483
We will...

545
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:39,792
release beers with different ABVs all at the same time.

546
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:43,592
We will produce beers one can actually select.

547
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,092
I see. I like the idea.

548
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:50,262
It's hard to differentiate visually if only the ABVs are different.

549
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:53,433
Let's add some colors so that people can easily select their beer.

550
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,072
- How? - With taste.

551
00:33:55,902 --> 00:33:58,802
How about using fruits to add taste and color?

552
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,841
The original ingredients' essence...

553
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:02,512
will be extracted with only pressure...

554
00:34:02,513 --> 00:34:04,082
and no chemical additives to avoid artificial flavors.

555
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:05,342
Hold on.

556
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:08,012
Liquor companies have released single types...

557
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:11,751
because the factory needs different machine lines for each beer type.

558
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:13,752
But to install different lines?

559
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,552
It'll cost us too much.

560
00:34:16,993 --> 00:34:18,063
The cost.

561
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:22,493
It may be costly, but it's not impossible.

562
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:26,533
I'll take responsibility and negotiate it with our company.

563
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:29,902
- Super cool. - Super cool.

564
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:33,942
Yes! We've finally got the concept down.

565
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:35,873
How about a cheer?

566
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:40,813
Respecting one's style era. Select your beer.

567
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,381
- Come on! - Finally!

568
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,422
Let's do this!

569
00:34:45,322 --> 00:34:46,353
All right.

570
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:59,462
Yes, Director. We have our concept.

571
00:34:59,763 --> 00:35:02,272
I'll present the project proposal to you as soon as possible.

572
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:06,473
Okay. Yes. Got it. Bye.

573
00:35:22,092 --> 00:35:24,723
- Hi. - Hi.

574
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:28,663
Have you seen CEO Yoon Min Ju around?

575
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:32,862
I'm Baekmok Liquor Marketing Team Manager Lim Ju Hee.

576
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:34,473
I see.

577
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:39,672
I'm Jisang Liquor Marketing Team Manager Chae Yong Ju.

578
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:40,942
Oh, my.

579
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,712
Nice to meet you.

580
00:35:47,652 --> 00:35:48,882
How may we help you?

581
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:52,223
I'm sure you heard Mr. Yoon signed the contract with our company.

582
00:35:52,522 --> 00:35:54,191
But for Baekmok Liquor to come all the way here.

583
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:56,562
He's working with Jisang Liquor this time, but who knows?

584
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:58,421
He might work with us next time.

585
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,692
It's best to make myself known to him in advance.

586
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,163
Right. I see.

587
00:36:12,442 --> 00:36:13,473
Lim Ju Hee?

588
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:18,313
- Oh, she's from Baekmok Liquor. - Ju Hee?

589
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:21,381
- How did you know where to find me? - "Ju Hee?"

590
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:24,022
It's been ages.

591
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:26,522
My ex-boyfriend.

592
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,592
"Ex-boyfriend?"

593
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:41,072
By the way, why is she sitting next to us?

594
00:36:44,473 --> 00:36:45,802
- You see... - You see.

595
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:47,542
As the general manager...

596
00:36:47,543 --> 00:36:49,271
for the new product development with Mr. Yoon,

597
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:52,642
I wanted to stay informed about the discussions with Baekmok Liquor.

598
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,752
You're fine with me being here, yes?

599
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:56,252
- But you're already here. - Be quiet.

600
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:00,151
I'm actually using my position as Baekmok Liquor's employee...

601
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:03,092
as an excuse to see how my ex-boyfriend is doing.

602
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,563
You're as good-looking as ever.

603
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:10,102
So when, where, and how did you two meet again?

604
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:13,801
Oh, we were classmates during high school.

605
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:15,832
I kept chasing after him.

606
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,243
You see, he was extremely popular.

607
00:37:18,543 --> 00:37:21,172
You had girlfriends throughout high school, didn't you?

608
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:25,882
I see. Mr. Yoon had relationships nonstop.

609
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,551
Right.

610
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:30,453
Why are you bringing up the past?

611
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:32,852
He was such a nice guy.

612
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:36,152
He had a hard time turning down a girl's confessions.

613
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:39,623
But he and I ended up dating.

614
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:43,332
Because our names both had "Ju..."

615
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:46,432
from Ju Hee and Min Ju, we were called the Ju-Ju couple.

616
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,502
Is that so?

617
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:51,801
"Ju-Ju couple."

618
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,071
Isn't it adorable?

619
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:54,342
- It sure is. - Do you see her?

620
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:55,842
She's a beauty.

621
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:58,783
But why is Yong Ju shooting lasers from her eyes?

622
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:02,711
Even if she's from Baekmok Liquor, Yong Ju isn't rude to a stranger.

623
00:38:02,712 --> 00:38:05,183
You still don't know her, Beom.

624
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:08,091
Listen. We must keep our eyes on Chae Yong Ju.

625
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:09,552
If her hand goes up,

626
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,222
- we must run and stop her. Got it? - Okay.

627
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:14,763
We can't let a person die.

628
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,333
Stop overreacting.

629
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:19,263
I'm not.

630
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,402
Yong Ju rips people apart.

631
00:38:27,313 --> 00:38:28,672
Do you remember this, Min Ju?

632
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:33,211
I used to do ballet.

633
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:37,082
Goodness, ballet of all things?

634
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:39,852
On cold winter nights when my practice ended late,

635
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:42,122
he kept this can of coffee warm in his pocket,

636
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:45,021
even as he shivered,

637
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,962
just to hand it to me.

638
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:54,402
- I'm going home first. - Okay. Bye.

639
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:00,512
Strangely enough, on days work gives me a hard time,

640
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:01,912
I recall this canned coffee.

641
00:39:01,913 --> 00:39:02,913
When did you get here?

642
00:39:02,914 --> 00:39:05,212
- It reminds me how loved I was. - Hey.

643
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:07,813
That's why,

644
00:39:07,814 --> 00:39:09,211
- It's warm. - even if I become a granny,

645
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:10,352
- Thanks. - looking at this canned coffee...

646
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:11,723
will remind me of you.

647
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:23,533
Min Ju's kindness leaves a very long impression.

648
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:25,103
Is that so?

649
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:29,231
In high school, he always tied up my hair.

650
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:31,571
Your hair? He tied it up for you?

651
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:34,012
No wonder he's good at it.

652
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:37,442
So he's a habitual offender. I had no idea.

653
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:39,683
I see. Okay.

654
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:41,652
My gosh.

655
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,783
I left the project proposal for you in my car.

656
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:47,623
- Excuse me for a bit. - Go ahead.

657
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:51,293
- Goodness. - Oh, no.

658
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:56,433
I'm guessing your ankle is still weak.

659
00:39:56,563 --> 00:40:00,873
I even quit ballet because of my ankle. But it still hurts.

660
00:40:03,572 --> 00:40:04,973
Can you help me get to my car?

661
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:12,413
Why not? She's in pain.

662
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:13,513
But...

663
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,583
- Hurry up. - Yes, hurry up.

664
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:20,022
Okay. Here.

665
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:23,422
Be careful.

666
00:40:23,962 --> 00:40:27,232
- Here. - It hurts too much.

667
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:31,262
Isn't love like that?

668
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:34,001
Like the heart pounding...

669
00:40:34,002 --> 00:40:36,372
like thunder?

670
00:40:36,373 --> 00:40:40,572
Or like make my hair stand on end?

671
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:45,283
Right now. Come on.

672
00:40:46,683 --> 00:40:47,783
Stop!

673
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:50,952
What? Left foot.

674
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:53,522
Left foot.

675
00:41:01,232 --> 00:41:03,393
Can't you smile at me like that too?

676
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:05,703
Did I not?

677
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:10,643
Goodness. Whose hair are you going to tie up with that hair tie?

678
00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:13,342
Didn't I have to beg you to tie mine up?

679
00:41:14,313 --> 00:41:17,643
Well, that's true. But...

680
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,152
she won't catch that.

681
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:25,921
Excuse me first. You can leave the project proposal there.

682
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:28,392
But my ankle hurts.

683
00:41:28,393 --> 00:41:29,893
I know it's bearable.

684
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:32,022
Go back.

685
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:36,362
Come on.

686
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,802
Ju-Ju couple?

687
00:41:44,442 --> 00:41:45,702
As if she's the only one.

688
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,072
I've got "Ju" in my name too. It's Yong Ju.

689
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:51,643
As if I had never dated in high school.

690
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:54,813
I didn't. So what? You've got a problem with it?

691
00:41:56,152 --> 00:41:57,252
It's so hot!

692
00:41:58,982 --> 00:42:01,793
He talked to her so casually like second nature.

693
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:04,522
Aren't we also the same age?

694
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,493
He's always formal with me.

695
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:11,902
"I'm guessing your ankle isn't all better."

696
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:14,002
He was all happy, wasn't he?

697
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,783
I'm going to become a soldier.

698
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:33,252
Help me prepare for the physical fitness test.

699
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:38,322
- Is that what you truly want to do? - Yes.

700
00:42:40,192 --> 00:42:41,862
It doesn't seem like it.

701
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:47,373
I need to earn money.

702
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,873
I want my granny to stop selling hotteok.

703
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,672
If that's what you've decided,

704
00:42:58,183 --> 00:42:59,243
I'll root for you.

705
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,651
You should still learn to write music.

706
00:43:02,652 --> 00:43:05,151
You've got to keep something you like. Don't you agree?

707
00:43:05,152 --> 00:43:06,382
I'll try.

708
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:08,353
Good.

709
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:35,913
Hot, isn't it?

710
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:20,492
Would I have been able...

711
00:44:20,493 --> 00:44:22,162
to relax a bit more...

712
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:23,833
if I had had a friend like him in high school?

713
00:44:27,572 --> 00:44:29,473
How did I end up daydreaming like that?

714
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:32,202
How did you end up like this?

715
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:35,243
What were you daydreaming about when your mind rarely wanders off?

716
00:44:40,212 --> 00:44:42,853
Don't tell me you regret it...

717
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:46,453
- when you're not one to regret. - What are you talking about?

718
00:45:07,612 --> 00:45:08,973
I looked for you everywhere.

719
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:13,482
Look for me, my foot.

720
00:45:14,382 --> 00:45:16,012
Keep reminiscing with your ex-girlfriend...

721
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,853
about how the chemistry was off the charts.

722
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:21,422
- Are you jealous? - Of course not.

723
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,392
- You are. - As if.

724
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:25,522
- How about we go on a date then? - Forget it.

725
00:45:28,232 --> 00:45:29,462
We'll do what?

726
00:45:30,732 --> 00:45:31,802
Go on a date.

727
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:33,832
Our nickname as a couple is also Ju-Ju.

728
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,103
What are you saying? How are we a couple?

729
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:38,203
We're colleagues.

730
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:41,743
Think of me as a colleague. I'll think of it as a date.

731
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:44,243
You said you'd wait for my answer.

732
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:47,043
Yes, and I will.

733
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:49,512
I wanted to take you out for a meal,

734
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,222
but what can I do when you're not into it?

735
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:52,622
When did you suggest we go out?

736
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:53,993
Should I clear my schedule for this weekend?

737
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:55,893
This weekend would be best.

738
00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:57,922
But I could be busy.

739
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,203
Mr. Yoon.

740
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:42,132
You look exceptionally pretty today.

741
00:46:43,942 --> 00:46:46,743
What? Well...

742
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:48,243
It's just...

743
00:46:50,612 --> 00:46:53,143
You're here as a colleague, not someone on a romantic date.

744
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:56,183
Of course. Anyone could tell we're here as colleagues.

745
00:47:02,192 --> 00:47:04,422
Are you free this evening?

746
00:47:06,462 --> 00:47:08,532
What's this about? Am I being summoned again?

747
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:11,632
Yes, but it's for something intimate and personal.

748
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:37,223
Who likes flowers that much?

749
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:39,092
As if they're special.

750
00:47:55,013 --> 00:47:57,583
When was the last time you received flowers?

751
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,283
I don't know. Let me think.

752
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,882
Are those for me?

753
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:08,052
But...

754
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:13,492
Why did you invite him? He is a busy man.

755
00:48:13,493 --> 00:48:15,493
Just get some water for him.

756
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:16,763

Grandma.

762
00:48:30,813 --> 00:48:34,583
I thought that buying flowers was a waste of money.

763
00:48:35,252 --> 00:48:36,313
They're pretty.

764
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,782
It turns out I never knew their value...

765
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,152
because I had never received them before.

766
00:48:43,393 --> 00:48:45,993
Flowers are something you like, Yong Ju.

767
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:49,533
I'll help you discover...

768
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:51,962
everything that you like.

769
00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:55,802
To make up for the time you spent not being yourself,

770
00:48:56,402 --> 00:48:57,473
I'm going...

771
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,302
to find everything you like.

772
00:49:36,513 --> 00:49:40,712

That and the flowers.

774
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:47,522
Get home safely.

775
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:50,022
Sure. You get home safely too.

776
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:52,723
- Head in first. - Sure.

777
00:49:55,632 --> 00:49:56,993
- Good night. - Sure.

778
00:50:08,212 --> 00:50:11,342
Grandma, I'm home.

779
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:14,882
I received flowers today.

780
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:19,183
Where is she?

781
00:50:29,163 --> 00:50:30,802
Grandma, are you in the bathroom?

782
00:50:35,302 --> 00:50:36,333
Grandma?

783
00:50:38,043 --> 00:50:39,103
Grandma?

784
00:50:52,922 --> 00:50:54,152
Hello?

Hardships and sufferings.

786
00:51:54,382 --> 00:51:57,013
They always wait for you to be in a better place...

787
00:51:58,552 --> 00:52:00,083
before they stab you in the back...

788
00:52:00,922 --> 00:52:04,263
bringing you to your knees...

789
00:52:06,692 --> 00:52:08,163
in the most miserable way.

790
00:52:19,243 --> 00:52:20,841
The cost for the mortuary and casket...

791
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:22,272
will be about this much...

792
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:25,583
while the catering service has a minimum order of 30 portions.

793
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,712
You have three options for flowers on the altar...

794
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:31,682
which differ in size.

795
00:52:31,683 --> 00:52:33,453
This is how much each option costs.

796
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:34,893
I'll go with this option.

797
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:38,862
Do you have a photo of your grandmother?

798
00:52:39,163 --> 00:52:40,421
Surprisingly enough,

799
00:52:40,422 --> 00:52:41,893
families of the deceased don't tend to have one.

800
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:44,801
There's one on my grandma's phone.

Just like you've been nagging me,

813
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:40,652
I called for an ambulance, so don't worry.

814
00:53:42,022 --> 00:53:43,522
It'll arrive soon,

815

smile and laugh to your heart's content...

01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,603
Why would you even say that...

910
01:01:08,603 --> 01:01:10,873
when that won't excuse you?

911
01:01:13,842 --> 01:01:15,413
I had no other options.

912
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:18,342
I was...

913
01:01:20,212 --> 01:01:21,813
only 21 at the time.

914
01:01:24,183 --> 01:01:25,552
I was practically a kid myself,

915
01:01:26,623 --> 01:01:28,092
so how could I raise one?

916
01:01:30,252 --> 01:01:31,563
My only option...

917
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:36,163
was to run.

918
01:01:45,502 --> 01:01:46,743
Mr. Chae Gyeong Cheol.

919
01:01:48,112 --> 01:01:52,382
Did you see the flowers that were lined up outside?

920
01:01:54,183 --> 01:01:57,013
What about the guests that came to express their condolences?

921
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:00,583
As you can see,

922
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,362
I built a good life for myself.

923
01:02:11,063 --> 01:02:12,833
And I owe it all to my grandma.

924
01:02:37,692 --> 01:02:39,263
Don't cry over something like this. It's all right.

925
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:42,933
You're okay. This isn't something to cry about.

926
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:00,612
I'm all right.

927
01:03:10,592 --> 01:03:13,293
Gosh. I'm fine.

928
01:03:14,192 --> 01:03:15,192
I'm...

929
01:03:22,902 --> 01:03:23,933
Grandma.

930
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,342
He...

931
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:31,882
is hurting more over my ordeal than me.

932
01:04:04,143 --> 01:04:05,542
(We thank Lee Jong Hyuk, Ko Sang Ho, and Pyo Ye Jin...)

933
01:04:05,543 --> 01:04:06,982
(for their special appearances.)

934
01:04:34,772 --> 01:04:37,473
(Brewing Love)

935
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:39,942
Grandma, I thought...

936
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:43,183
I'd never be able to manage a life without you alone.

937
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:44,853
But it turns out, I'm not alone.

938
01:04:45,723 --> 01:04:47,382
Come with me.

939
01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:50,252
Oh Chan Hwi, I keep seeing you in my future.

940
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,462
But I don't even know what my own future holds.

941
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:55,333
Bang Ah Reum, that's your job!

942
01:04:55,732 --> 01:04:57,892
I can hamper the launch of the new beer without you.

943
01:04:57,893 --> 01:04:59,631
You did great work, Ms. Chae.

944
01:04:59,632 --> 01:05:00,702
You too, Mr. Yoon.

945
01:05:00,703 --> 01:05:02,972
Today, we'll make it or break it, so let's stay strong.

946
01:05:02,973 --> 01:05:04,473
Let us begin.
