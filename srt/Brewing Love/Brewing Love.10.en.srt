If we miss out now,

21
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,319
we'll never be able to stop the release.

How...

23
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,490
What do we evaluate?

24
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:27,459
It's the taste.

25
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,859
It boils down to whether this beer tastes good.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,500
Taste is never absolute.

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,830
Why not? Because our tongue is so very sneaky.

28
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,269
The first sip might taste great,

29
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,069
but the second and third, not so much.

30
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,640
That's what we must target.

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,509
I like the story.

32
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,780
Select a beer that suits your taste.

33
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,250
Three lines so you can pick the flavour and strength you like.

34
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,089
But now we must think.

35
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:02,830
Why did large companies only release one line per product?

36
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,830
Wouldn't there be a reason no one did this before?

37
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,970
If all three were to sell equally well,

38
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,169
that would be great.

39
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,739
But that's a delusion.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,839
Do you have to sour the mood like that?

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,739
We haven't released the products yet.

42
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,880
It's our job to consider the worst-case scenario.

43
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,720
Isn't that what we're here to do?

44
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,079
You're right. Go on.

45
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,850
If we release multiple products at the same time,

46
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,519
one is bound to sell better than another.

47
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,560
What doesn't sell will become dead stock.

48
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,160
Wouldn't wholesalers only want to buy what sells well?

49
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,228
Who would buy what will become dead stock?

50
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,739
If wholesalers start buying only what sells well,

51
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,870
only that product will reach the shelves.

52
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:50,669
That means the consumers will only be exposed to...

53
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,880
one of the three products.

54
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,880
How is that different from releasing just one product?

55
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,949
Now do the math.

I like it.

59

All three are of decent quality...

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,139
and I think they'll sell well.

61
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,539
I really like the 11 percent one.

62
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,710
I'm not sure about the other two.

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
They might end up in the warehouse.

64
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,549
Won't that be a headache for your Sales Team?

65
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,620
It would. I feel the headache come on already.

66
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,759

67
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,160

I too thought it didn't go down smoothly enough.

72

It feels like it's my fault.

"You should've done a better job."

155
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,498
How dare he say that?

156
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:24,599
I got him to approve every single step.

157
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,138
Shouldn't he have done a better job tasting the samples?

158
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,738
He gasped and cheered when he tasted it before,

159

but now...

160
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,080

176
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,210
is disastrous.

00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,889
It's a yes or no.

188
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,029
Is that a hard question?

189
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:30,960
Is it too hard to answer?

190
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,759
What does your intuition tell you?

191
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,330
- It's tasty. - It's fantastic.

192
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,540
I think so too.

193
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,470
Then it's only right to go ahead.

194
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,680
Chairman. You're kidding, right?

195
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,440
You saw the scores from the internal assessment.

196
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:49,680
Yes.

197
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,850
I can't completely ignore the internal assessment.

198
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,720
Let's do this, then.

199
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,359
We did an internal assessment.

200
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,029
Let's do an external assessment.

201
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,868
That's only fair.

202
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,800
- An external assessment? - Yes.

203
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,800
I'll enter it in the international blind beer contest.

204
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,810
If we win, you will release the product immediately.

205
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,239
How's that?

206
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,479
I like that.

207
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,379
A win at the international blind beer contest.

208
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,249
That title is better than any marketing campaign.

209
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,858
Good.

210
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:35,359
If any of these three win that contest,

211
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,989
we'll release it.

212
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,930
Mr. Yoon. Do you think you can do it?

213
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,769
Of course.

214
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,470
My beer never fails.

215
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,970
And one more thing.

216
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,210
If we win, I'd like full authority until the release...

217
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,909
of the new product.

218
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,290
Yes!

219
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:10,989
I look forward to it.

220
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,609
You're all here.

221
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,679
- How did it go? - How did it go?

222
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,220
- How did it go? - What did they say?

223
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,519
Calm down, guys. The result is...

224
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,219
- half and half. - Half and half?

225
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,658
We didn't get the clearance to release the beer,

226
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,399
but we still have a shot.

227
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,259
If we win the blind beer-tasting contest.

228
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,868
How can we do that.

229
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:51,329
That's as good as a no.

230
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,739
- I should type up my resignation. - What was that?

231
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,439
TF Team. Don't you believe in Together?

232
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,009
Right. After all we went through to make it.

233
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,310
- I believe in it. - We'll win.

234
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,649
I'm confident we'll win!

235
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,550
Then to boost our morale,

236
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:10,018
how about a team dinner?

237
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,090
I thought you hated team dinners.

238
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:14,119
I love that you suggested it first.

239
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,389
Well...

240
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,629
Sorry but we...

241
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:19,729
have plans.

242
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:27,139
What are you doing in front of the others?

243
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,139
We all know you're dating.

244
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,409
They're dating?

245
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,310
You're seriously clueless too.

246
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,979
We have eyes, you know.

247
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,850
I never let it show.

248
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,090
It's obvious even at a glance.

249
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,720
Was I the only one who didn't know?

250
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,719
Come with me. When did you figure it out?

251
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,619
- I could tell right away. - "Right away?"

252
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,690
- Are you really dating? - Well...

253
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,728
- I should go. - Me too.

254
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,729
Wait.

255
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,739
Don't you two have plans?

256
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,368
- We do? - We do?

257
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,940
It looked like you two needed to talk.

258
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,379
Forget it if not.

259
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,129
- Do you have something to say? - What?

260
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,029
I don't.

261
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:28,800
Do you?

262
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,170
What did Mr. Yoon want us to talk about?

263
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,940
Fried chicken tastes best by the river.

264
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,710
Here.

265
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,389
Leave it.

266
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,830
Why do Koreans love fried chicken so much?

267
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,330
From elementary to high school,

268
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,999
kids never stop talking about it.

269
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,840
"Dad brought fried chicken on the way home."

270
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,738
"Soccer's on today,"

271
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,138
"so I'll ask Mom to order chicken."

272
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,238
"There are two drumsticks..."

273
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,950
"and Mom gave both to my brother."

274
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,248
Even on sports day at school,

275
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:20,550
they sit around to share a box.

276
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Do you know that...

277
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,119
this is the most shared food among families?

278
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,989
You never had it with your family?

279
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,158
- No. - Not once?

280
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,229
Not once.

281
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,100
I'll do it. I'll be your family.

282
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:42,810
Ms. Beautiful Bang.

283
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,769
I'll buy you chicken after work,

284
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:47,009
eat it with you when soccer's on,

285
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,979
and give you both drumsticks.

286
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,248
Like today, let's sit...

287
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:53,820
by the river and eat it with beer.

288
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:56,420
Let's do...

289
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,859
everything together.

290
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,969
Look over there.

291
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,810
They're taking wedding photos.

292
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:27,780
That must be the trend these days.

293
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,590
That has nothing to do with us.

294
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:38,330
I guess not.

295
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,669
Can I ask you something?

296
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,570
Marriage is your life goal.

297
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,709
Should you give up on it that easily for me?

298
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,480
You could...

299
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,780
meet someone much better.

300
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,980
You're an essential part of my marriage.

301
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,949
I don't know when, but you've become an essential part.

302
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,790
It could've been...

303
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,760
when you lowered the screen on your truck,

304
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,699
when you told me to blow out the birthday candle,

305
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,070
or when you called me "Ms. Beautiful Bang."

306
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,299
I don't know when it was,

307
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,639
but I guess I liked all those moments.

308
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,179
Let me ask you something too.

309
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:28,780
I keep thinking...

310
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,480
there's another reason you can't get married.

311
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,619
I want to know what that is.

312
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,389
But you won't tell me, will you?

313
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,800
We can never have a full conversation.

314
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,600
Can I go?

315
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,020
I want to...

316
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,020
tell you everything.

317
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:13,619
I want to come clean to you,

318
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:16,389
and that's bad.

319
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:36,510
(Chae Yong Ju, Head of Marketing)

320
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:38,810
No. Forget it.

321
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,419
(YNWA Swimming Center)

322
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,070
- How do we look? - So beautiful.

323
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:51,319
This is your final chance to surrender.

324
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,888
- Surrender! - You're surrounded!

325
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:55,459
Don't shoot me, please. Don't shoot.

326
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,289
Don't shoot.

327
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,799
- Spare me. - You'll be okay. Get down.

328
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,230
No.

329
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,070
Don't shoot.

330
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,899
Don't shoot.

331
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,409
How did my dear Min Ju know I was here?

332
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,549
Look right here. It says, "If you can't..."

333
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,579
"contact me by midnight, consider me dead and find me here."

334
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,520
I couldn't ignore it when you even sent me the address.

335
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:05,449
I had to cancel my date to come here, you punk.

336
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,429
My gosh. This guy called me "you punk."

337
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
How touching.

338
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,459
How can you joke around right now?

339
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:20,938
But I was quite serious today.

340
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:21,969
Remember what you said?

341
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:24,439
That there would come a day...

342
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:27,379
I could properly face it.

343
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,810
I almost died facing it.

344
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,579
I thought I was going to die, okay?

345
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,290
Goodness. So why the swimming pool of all places?

346
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,659
Is it because we were in the lows together?

347
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:44,730
The water calms me down.

348
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:48,399
It knows every part of me.

349
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,500
People die when they can't breathe.

350
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,070
I can't breathe.

351
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,810
At times, I forget how to breathe.

352
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,449
It's funny, isn't it?

353
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,590
It's not funny.

354
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,889
You're just desperate.

355
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:18,189
I don't know that past of yours that makes it hard to breathe.

356
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:21,128
And I won't ask until you tell me about it first.

357
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:22,668
But don't you like Ms. Bang to the point...

358
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,399
you want to fight against that past?

359
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,899
You know everything.

360
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,669
You seriously do.

361
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,310
- Did you win that fight? - I lost.

362
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,310
And without mercy at that.

363
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,010
I tried to fight it head-on.

364
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:43,149
Now, I'm too scared to fight it again.

365
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,090
I'm giving up.

366
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:51,159
It won't do.

367
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,560
A guy who can't breathe getting married is absurd.

368
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,129
I can't become a husband.

369
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:01,240
I don't even know when I'll get better.

370
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,609
Just imagine me passing out in front of Ms. Beautiful Bang.

371
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,540
No way.

372
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,550
I can't do it.

373
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,820
I'm a man who can't protect his woman.

374
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,590
Seriously.

375
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,219
Chan Hwi. There are no male and female roles in love.

376
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,929
Being handsome, ugly, rich, or poor has nothing to do with love.

377
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,760
Isn't it love when nothing else matters?

378
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,669
When everything is incomprehensible.

379
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,040
Not being able to understand with your head is love.

380
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,908
Isn't that why we say we fell in love?

381
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:38,969
Don't make me cry.

382
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:43,750
I must want to marry Ms. Beautiful Bang.

383
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,480
What now?

384
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:19,080
What? It's Chae Yong Ju.

385
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,619
What brought you here in the morning?

386
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,289
Must I have a reason to come to my boyfriend's house?

387
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,429
No. You're always welcome here.

388
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,600
Because of Oh Chan Hwi, we couldn't have our date yesterday.

389
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:36,300
Let's have a proper one today.

390
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,270
- All right. - I'm hungry.

391
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,099
- Are you hungry? - Yes.

392
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,169
That's bad. I can't let you starve. Come this way.

393
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,240
(Dried seaweed for gimbap)

394
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,879
How did you know I like gimbap?

395
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,590
What do I not know about Ms. Chae?

396
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:04,188
Watch from your seat...

397
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,259
how good I am at making gimbap, Ms. Chae.

398
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,300
Yes, sir.

399
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,169
Tasty dried seaweed...

400
00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:12,198
is key in gimbap.

401
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,668
Is that so, chef?

402
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:15,100
- Yes. - I see.

403
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:21,040
Don't eat the ingredients.

404
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,109
- How about two rows of ham? - Yes.

405
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,490
Aren't the gimbap ends you get while watching them...

406
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,699
- being made the best? - They are.

407
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,830
Here. Open up.

408
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,570
My granny...

409
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,740
used to feed me gimbap on picnic days.

410
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:59,109
Is that so? Then I'll feed it to you from now on.

411
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,290
- Have one. - Okay.

412
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,060
Goodness. It's good.

413
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,230
("The Empath's Survival Guide")

414
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,369
Here.

415
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,939
Thanks.

416
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:42,119
Why do you not ask me about my past?

417
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:45,990
People were always curious.

418
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,359
How tough life was.

419
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:51,699
What made me suffer so much.

420
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,439
Isn't such a life normal?

421
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,840
Stuff like that.

422
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,379
To me,

423
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,219
the present is important.

424
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:12,250
The memories we'll make from now on are much more important.

425
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:19,800
Neither you nor I can know everything about each other's past.

426
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,070
How lonely it was. How miserable it was.

427
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,500
How can we understand it all?

428
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:29,270
Simply because we're lovers,

429
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,379
we don't need to know about the pain we barely forgot.

430
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:38,079
As I used to work in the Special Task Force,

431
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,280
there is loads of confidential information.

432
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:43,418
What kind of training I went through.

433
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:45,050
Where our military camp was.

434
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:48,990
Actually, most of it is confidential.

435
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:50,689
I can't tell you any of it.

436
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,600
Just like those.

437
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,030
I think everyone lives...

438
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:59,429
with at least one piece of confidential information.

439
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,840
I won't dare to ask or guess...

440
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:09,379
about the times...

441
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,649
you've endured.

442
00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:15,480
I will...

443
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,320
only look at Yoon Min Ju before me.

444
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,189
The one who hasn't given up...

445
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:24,129
and has stubbornly come this far...

446
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,000
after walking through the thorny path.

447
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,000
Right here.

448
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,929
I will only look at Yoon Min Ju right here.

449
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,270
Let's do that, okay?

450
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:39,139
Okay.

451
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,179
Let's do that.

452
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,179
Shall we get going now?

453
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,649
To where?

454
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,990
A place you'll love.

455
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,859
You helped me find a lot of things I like until now.

456
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,158
It's my turn now to help you.

457
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,569
Gosh, but all I need is you to be by my side.

458
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,799
No. I can't let myself be indebted.

459
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,069
Come on. There's no owing each other when it comes to love.

460
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,270
That's not true. I owe you tons.

461
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,139
Let's go. Get up.

462
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,510
Let's go.

463
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:21,178
I'd like two as well.

464
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,749
- I want four. - Wait, okay? Give him a break.

465
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,188
- I want four, please. - Good grief.

466
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:26,489
- Hold back a little. - Can you finish them all?

467
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,358
- I totally can. - What is wrong with her?

468
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,928
This is the rumoured must-eat place.

469
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,658
- I know. - It sure is delicious.

470
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:32,888
Gosh, it looks good.

471
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,759
- Ms. Beautiful Bang. - What are you doing here?

472
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,260
I was waiting for you.

473
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,438
Everyone. I need to get permission from a certain someone. Let me ask.

474
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:42,439
What?

475
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,639
Can I do business here?

476
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,208
These customers want my toast so much.

477
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,209
They're dying to buy one.

478
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,749
- His toasts are rumoured to be good. - I want to try one.

479
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,580
I heard the service was great.

480
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,888
I don't really mind.

481
00:31:56,889 --> 00:31:58,550
I must be a hit in this town, too.

482
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:00,159
Wait just a bit, okay?

483
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,070
(Hwi's Toast)

484
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,169
Let's go.

485
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,740
- Where? - Didn't you want to know?

486
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:18,609
Know why I avoid marriage.

487
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,878
I did. Let's go.

488
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:24,350
Let me make it clear right now. Nothing good will come out of it.

489
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,750
It's not my problem if you regret it.

490
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,050
Okay. I'm fine with everything.

491
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,379
Oh Chan Hwi!

492
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,350
Enough!

493
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:15,290
What is it? Did I scare you?

494
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,790
I guess I'm no longer cool.

495
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,000
It's too early to get frightened.

496
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,429
What if I told you I even shot a person to death?

497
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:30,440
Stop joking around.

498
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,739
I'm not.

499
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,150
Let's go grab a bite.

500
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:53,699
Didn't you say I was going to love it?

501
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:55,258
Yes. Don't you love this place?

502
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,830
Gosh, I thought it was a lovey-dovey date.

503
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,699
We're here!

504
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,439
Min Ju. Why do you always run late?

505
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,080
- Min Ho? - You're hopeless.

506
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:13,209
You were taking so long to let us try the new beer...

507
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,549
that we started to think you went to pick the hops.

508
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:17,020
What took you so long?

509
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:18,790
Everyone was waiting for you.

510
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,989
I didn't know you came.

511
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,428
Okay. Now that everyone is here, let's get the party started.

512
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:26,698
- Let's party! - Come on now!

513
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:28,999
- Help us out over here. - Okay, let's go.

514
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,429
- Look at all these beers. - This way, please.

515
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:35,698
It seems he likes to stay seated.

516
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:39,540
I'm guessing he keeps his distance from his son.

517
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,440
He's not easy to get along with, is he?

518
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,779
Goodness. No, stay seated.

519
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:49,219
- Gosh. - Oh, dear.

520
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,489
She's right. You made a long trip coming here.

521
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,459
It's fate that we've met today.

522
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,089
Let's have some fun chit-chat.

523
00:35:58,429 --> 00:35:59,460
Together, okay?

524
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,028
Tell us first...

525
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:06,298
why you are keeping a distance from your son.

526
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,469
Is keeping a distance this family's tradition or something?

527
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,869
I'm just curious, all right?

528
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:15,979
I'd appreciate it if you could give me some space.

529
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,150
No way.

530
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,778
Life never goes according to your will.

531
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:22,678
Try the beer your son has made.

532
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,690
- Goodness. - Nice.

533
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,819
Let's have fun.

534
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,658
All right. Cheers!

535
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:33,658
- Cheers! - Cheers!

536
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,559
- Cheers! - Cheers!

537
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,029
Even if I look at them from all angles, they don't look alike.

538
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,198
I take after my mom.

539
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,269
- Right? - Yes.

540
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,709
CEO Yoon's family is alive and well.

541
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,339
But why did they never visit?

542
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,738
Is this the first time trying your son's beer?

543
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:48,739
What?

544
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,249
Well, we never had the chance to try it.

545
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,649
He never brought any over.

546
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,879
Who threw a glass at me...

547
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,379
when I wanted to make beer?

548
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,988
And who left home...

549
00:36:56,989 --> 00:36:58,388
because of a simple disapproval?

550
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:00,158
We'd have to speak the same language to live together.

551
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,789
Goodness, as if you ever wanted a proper conversation.

552
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,359
It's not like you tried either.

553
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,559
- You... - Come now.

554
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,730
Stop it. Today's supposed to be a happy day.

555
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,000
That's what it's like between Dad and Min Ju.

556
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,699
There's no need to walk on eggshells.

557
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,440
Yes, it's okay. This is the usual.

558
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,739
Please dig in.

559
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,179
- She has the heart of an angel. - I know, right?

560
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,710
Hallelujah.

561
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,249
At this rate, I'll have to wait until my 60th birthday to eat.

562
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,218
The mourner's house would be a better place to eat.

563
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:31,919
- I'm hungry. - Hush.

564
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,420
This won't do. All right.

565
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:37,589
Everyone has to chug it down this time. Raise your glasses.

566
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,928
- Cheers! - Cheers!

567
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:42,900
- Chug it down! - Cheers!

568
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,750
Thank you.

569
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:17,630
Guess how long it takes for a person...

570
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,569
shot in the head with a rifle to die.

571
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,040
Thirty seconds?

572
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,739
Ten seconds?

573
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:26,909
Five seconds?

574
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,949
"I've pulled the trigger."

575
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,850
"There goes the bullet." When those thoughts crossed my mind,

576
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,949
they were already dead...

577
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,020
in split seconds.

578
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,489
But it's much faster than that.

579
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,589
The speed of a rifle bullet is about Mach three.

580
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,560
That's fast to the point...

581
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:52,529
where you're already dead...

582
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:56,239
before you realize you've been shot in the head...

583
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,509
and feel the pain.

584
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,909
Why have you been mentioning those since earlier?

585
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,150
I killed them.

586
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,089
People.

587
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,520
I'm serious.

588
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,989
I...

589
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,360
wanted to become a soldier since I was seven.

590
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:26,029
Shooting guns looked so cool to me.

591
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,369
And I became a soldier like it was natural.

592
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:32,670
I requested a dispatch because it looked cool.

593
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,239
My salary was also doubled.

594
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,679
At first,

595
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:40,980
I loved how life was better than in Korea.

596
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,750
But little did I expect...

597
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:45,520
our country's ship...

598
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:49,589
to get hijacked back then.

599
00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:56,230
Three men have been taken hostage.

600
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:16,889
(Barber shop)

601
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:27,929
(Watch your head)

602
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,000
Hands on your back! Get down!

603
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:32,400
(Deck office)

604
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,239
Align your aim and fire immediately to take them out instantly.

605
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,940
Our nation's hero.

606
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:14,310
Why are you spaced out?

607
00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:16,440
It gets better after a good sleep.

608
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,520
Not wanting to be labelled as weak,

609
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:22,580
I endured for five years.

610
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:26,719
I thought I'd forget if I endured it.

611
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,389
But...

612
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:31,889
from one day on,

613
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,060
I couldn't breathe.

614
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,469
Do you know what it means to have killed someone?

615
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,480
In the middle of a delicious meal,

616
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,610
I would have dry heaves.

617
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,319
Goodness.

618
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,790
I can still smell the blood from back then.

619
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:13,170
Are you all right?

620
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:15,670
Please open the door.

621
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,798
- Chan Hwi. - Chan Hwi.

622
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:18,409
- Are you okay? - My family walks on eggshells.

623
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:21,980
When I can't eat,

624
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,810
neither can my family.

625
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,080
When I can't breathe,

626
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,549
neither can my family.

627
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,219
That's why I left home.

628
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,560
So that my family...

629
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,429
can eat properly...

630
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,799
and take a breather.

631
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:49,469
Can...

632
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,909
you do that?

633
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,380
Can you...

634
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:58,179
live such a life with me?

635
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,750
And forever at that.

636
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,230
I'll head inside.

637
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:25,469
No, not again.

638
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,190
Please.

639
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,219
Oh Chan Hwi!

640
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,549
I'll try.

641
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:40,380
I'll try to eat well...

642
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,080
and remember to breathe.

643
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,919
I'll try my best, and throw in the towel...

644
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,060
when it gets too much for me.

645
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:52,830
So don't run away from me if that's what you're afraid of.

646
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,299
I won't let you leave me.

647
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,138
- Here. - I won't go.

648
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,509
Come on. Take this.

649
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,948
What is it?

650
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:15,079
You can't come inside until you drink it all.

651
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,420
Forget it.

652
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:21,659
Okay, fine.

653
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,529
- Come on. - I can't believe you.

654
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,769
Why are you out here alone?

655
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,480
I was getting some fresh air.

656
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:49,449
I can't come inside until I empty the cooler.

657
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,020
Yong Ju's orders.

658
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:59,429
To both me and you,

659
00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:01,500
she is someone precious.

660
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,429
Don't you agree?

661
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:06,929
If you had thought so,

662
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:10,670
you should've been at her grandmother's funeral.

663
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:13,139
She was in so much pain.

664
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:14,440
I expected no less...

665
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,480
since you attended Mom's funeral...

666
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,619
as a soldier and not as her husband.

667
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,389
That's what I still can't understand.

668
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,860
I was at her grandmother's funeral.

669
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:31,929
I made it to the door.

670
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,630
Why didn't you come in?

671
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:42,299
Ever since I lost your mother,

672
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,409
I haven't been able to attend funerals.

673
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:49,909
For some reason, I can't set foot inside them.

674
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,210
They scare me.

675
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,330
(Condolences)

676
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,150
(Condolences)

677
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,690
My military uniform and boots are like my armour.

678
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:09,519
Having them on was the only way for me to remain stable and sane.

679
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,929
It was your way...

680
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,730
of not crumbling.

681
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,229
Your great-grandfather, your grandfather,

682
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,238
and even your uncle. We're a family of soldiers.

683
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,039
I was forced to be a man in the traditional sense.

684
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,039
Never did I come across a man like you...

685
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,009
who was sensitive to every small emotion.

686
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:34,619
Even though I wanted to be close to you,

687
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,750
I didn't know how to do it.

688
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:40,689
Your mother was the only one who understood you,

689
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,790
so I leaned on her instead.

690
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:49,529
Who knew she'd leave us so soon?

691
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:53,568
I didn't know what to do.

692
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:55,369
You should've told me.

693
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,739
Unbelievable.

694
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,210
You're like a mind reader when it comes to other people,

695
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,150
but not when it comes to your father.

696
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,989
You're right.

697
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,989
I never even tried to understand you.

698
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:20,900
That's right. A son...

699
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,699
didn't even bring his father his own beer.

700
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:30,569
How is it?

701
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,480
It's decent enough.

702
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,279
How can we have a conversation when your answers are always short?

703
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:46,790
To be honest, it felt good.

704
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:48,658
Hearing that you're the reason...

705
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:50,960
the village people have a stable life...

706
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,190
made me so proud.

707
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:03,239
Then, come back to visit.

708
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,279
Sure.

709
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,580
Gosh, when will we drink all this?

710
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,149
We're mosquito food out here.

711
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,419
There are eight cans,

712
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,618
so we'll have four each.

713
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:20,619
Seriously?

714
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,519
Our livers aren't in the same condition.

715
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,659
Not when I'm significantly older.

716
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,068
Okay, let's do this.

717
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,900
We'll see what happens. Here.

718
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,670
You did great.

719
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,318
- Goodness. - Gosh. Hey.

720
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:49,650
We're back.

721
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,190
Come have a seat here.

722
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,389
Goodness.

723
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:03,460
Nicely done.

724
00:51:13,569 --> 00:51:16,638
This is so unfair.

725
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:18,178
What on earth?

726
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:20,809
What's with the dialect?

727
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,019
Were you one of us?

728
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,250
You know,

729
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:29,158
I've been trying to get on his good side...

730
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:31,929
and had to live my life...

731
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,298
walking on eggshells around him.

732
00:51:35,299 --> 00:51:38,469
- What are you doing? - Let go of me.

733
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:44,198
What came over me...

734
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:48,210
that had me fall for a man who is so much older than me?

735
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,150
That's enough!

736
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,650
Mr. Yoon Chang Seok!

737
00:51:57,219 --> 00:52:02,489
Would it kill you to be a fraction of what he's like?

738
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,790
Goodness.

739
00:52:03,819 --> 00:52:05,360
Min Ju...

740
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,730
only has eyes for Yong Ju.

741
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,799
Those eyes...

742
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,569
were meant to look at her.

743
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,279
Mr. Yoon, here's what you'll do.

744
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:26,678
Once a week,

745
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:30,649
you'll have him teach you how to be sweet.

746
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,850
- Nicely put. - Keep going.

747
00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:34,589
Classes on how to be sweet.

748
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:38,830
Goodness, my baby.

749
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,500
Mom, come sleep with me.

750
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,129
It's scary to sleep here.

751
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:48,869
Goodness. Today, you'll sleep with your father.

752
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:50,868
- Just us two? - Just us two?

753
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:51,940
That's right.

754
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,909
You know that your father is a high-ranking military officer.

755
00:52:56,779 --> 00:52:59,679
He'll defeat any ghosts that come your way.

756
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,279
Now, go to bed.

757
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:05,520
Cheers.

758
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:08,318
- Goodness. - Sisters.

759
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,319
- Sure. - There you go.

760
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,190
- Here. - My goodness.

761
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,429
Do you want a hug?

762
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:56,799
Why am I being comforted by the sight of those two?

763
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:00,739
Thanks, Yong Ju.

764
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:03,540
See? I told you you'd love it.

765
00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:10,849
Will the beer competition soon take place?

766
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:14,588
We'll fill out an application and send our beer.

767
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,860
Then comes the evaluation and awards.

768
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:20,630
Goodness. I should get started on the label design.

769
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:23,360
What? But we don't know if the beer will be launched.

770
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:25,130
Come on.

771
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,799
How can a beer you made not win an award?

772
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,238
It will be smooth sailing until the launch...

773
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:35,309
because I'll be that prepared.

774
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,610
Trust me.

775
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,279
Sure.

776
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,420
It's a precious beer we made together,

777
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,319
so I'll make sure it's a hit.

778
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:47,989
That being said, you'll properly see me do my work.

779
00:54:49,759 --> 00:54:51,758
I've been eyeing you from the moment we met.

780
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:53,989
- Is that so? - Continuously.

781
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:57,730
Let's go.

(Sealed, Fragile)

784
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:17,250
I'm here for the delivery.

785
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,190
Hello.

786
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,730
Please have it delivered safely.

787
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:33,698
- Hello. - Hi.

788
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:34,739
Thank you.

789

792
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:50,779
Judges, for this procedure of tasting, to your tables.

793
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,489
Over here.

794
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,690
- Welcome. - Hi.

795
00:56:14,779 --> 00:56:17,439
Everyone, we thank the contestants for being here...

796
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,709
for the award ceremony...

797
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,419
of the 2024 International Blind Brew Cup...

798
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,480
that is being held in Korea.

799
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:26,019
The award ceremony will now commence.

800
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,119
First of all, I'll announce the winner for the bronze.

801
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:31,729
Taking home the bronze is People's Lager...

802
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,360
produced by Brew House Crib.

803
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,259
First winner of the bronze award.

804
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,229
It's People's Lager produced by Brew House Crib.

805
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,199
What's taking Yoon Min Ju so long? Unbelievable.

806
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,969
What if the beer wins an award?

807
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,440
Am I supposed to accept it instead?

808
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,879
He'll be here. He said so.

809
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,949
Don't get ahead of yourselves.

810
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,920
It's not like you have a chance at winning.

811
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,420
How can you be that sure?

812
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,419
These must be swapped out...

813
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,130
before they're entered into the competition.

814
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,069
(Sealed, Fragile)

815
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,449
This is me righting a wrong.

816
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:32,319
It's for the company's sake.

817
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:36,190
My actions will save the company millions.

818
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:40,529
It scored zero points on the internal evaluation,

819
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:42,230
so it winning an award...

820
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:44,900
seems weirder to me.

821
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,900
A score of zero.

822
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:57,540
Lastly, all that's left is the winner of the gold award.

823
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:58,679

00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,448
The 2024 International Blind Brew Cup, lager division.

825
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:03,949
The gold award goes to...

826
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,369
Guests, I apologize for the delay in the announcement.

827
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,469
It's a first which is why there was a brief misunderstanding.

828
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:26,039
The winner of the gold award is quite special this year.

829
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,939
Multiple beers submitted by one brewmaster...

830
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,210
have been awarded the gold award.

831
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,049
Let me announce the winner.

832
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,118

838
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:52,000
Congratulations.

839
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,420
No way.

840
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:17,988
Min Ju's so cool.

841
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:20,059
Are you kidding? He continues to amaze me.

842
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,799
I can't believe his beer actually won gold.

843
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,258
I was stewing over there thinking you weren't coming.

844
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:54,928
What's the matter? I was right on time.

845
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:56,000
Unbelievable.

846
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:59,299
This is how far you should go.

847
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:03,639
If you continue on this path, you'll only be ruining yourself.

848
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,939
What are you talking about?

849
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,839
As if you don't know.

850
01:00:09,279 --> 01:00:10,310
You do.

851
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:14,479
(Sealed, Fragile)

852
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,520
I'm here for the delivery.

853
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:17,949
Hello.

854
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:21,989
You must be new. We meet for the first time.

855
01:00:24,589 --> 01:00:26,190
Why are you this tense?

856
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,330
Why can't you hold my gaze?

857
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,399
I'm sorry, but I'm cancelling your service.

858
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,670
I'll still pay you your fee.

859
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:40,770
What is it? Do you have to take this particular cooler?

860
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:42,880
You know what's in here.

861
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,949
I see. You're planning on swapping the beer.

862
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:50,420
Of course. That'll be hard to do...

863
01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:52,489
once they've been submitted.

864
01:00:52,589 --> 01:00:54,690
You can't afford to lose out on this window of opportunity.

865
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,959
(Uilhan Brewery)

866
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,389
You know Director Yeom Jang Gun at Jisang Liquor.

867
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,400
You do. There's no way of fooling me.

868
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,670
Would you like to do as I say or talk to the police?

869
01:01:08,299 --> 01:01:09,699
The choice is yours.

870
01:01:14,469 --> 01:01:17,439
From this moment on, the TF Team has full authority...

871
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,750
regarding the release of Together.

872
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,480
You're done getting in the way.

873
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,630
Nicely done.

874
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,429
Unbelievable.

875
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:39,100
My gosh, of course.

876
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,698
Do as you wish, Mr. Yoon.

877
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:43,269
Let's launch the product.

878
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,238
Chae Yong Ju, get on it.

879
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:46,409
- Yes! - Nice!

880
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,579
Gosh, you did great.

881
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,710
Nice!

882
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,589
We did it!

883
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,868
Hello, sir. The first batch is being transported today.

884
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:19,710
I was thinking about stopping by the factory to...

885
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,909
What did you just say?

886
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,920
Why can't the beer be transported today?

887
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:31,480
What on earth are you saying?

888
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,759
I'll come to you. I'll be right there.

889
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:43,929
(Jisang Liquor)

890
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,639
Min Ju.

891
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,040
Why are you here?

892
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:57,480
The first batch of products can't leave the factory today.

893
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:00,750
- It can't happen. - Hold on.

894
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,850
Were you the one who stepped on the brakes?

895
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:07,719
What are you saying?

896
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:10,718
They must leave the factory today...

897
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:12,560
to be sent to direct-only stores across the country.

898
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,729
What if we can't meet the launch deadline?

899
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:15,759
Push the deadline back.

900
01:03:16,299 --> 01:03:18,469
I also have authority over the launch of Together.

901
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:21,739
Yoon Min Ju, what's going on?

902
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:24,839
This is our beer.

903
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:27,138
We made it together.

904
01:03:27,139 --> 01:03:28,540
This batch of beer...

905
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:32,549
will be dumped, Ms. Chae.

906
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,589
(We thank Son Jong Hak for his special appearance.)

907
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:15,259
(Brewing Love)

908
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:17,219
There's a subtle difference to the taste.

909
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,759
Was there an issue with quality control?

910
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,258
I can't have it released in this state.

911
01:04:20,259 --> 01:04:21,928
It's more important to keep our promise.

912
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:23,329
It tasting perfect is more important.

913
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:26,699
We'll see who hits rock bottom first.

914
01:04:27,069 --> 01:04:28,670
Are you kidding me?

915
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,239
Find out who's responsible.

916
01:04:30,339 --> 01:04:32,069
It was an inside job.

917
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:33,339
I found it.

918
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:36,409
What are you trying to say?

919
01:04:37,009 --> 01:04:38,009
You know what.

920
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:41,650
I don't. I don't know a darn thing.
