(Scenes with child actors and animals were filmed...)

(under production guidelines along with experts.)

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,789
This is my feeling. This feeling is mine.

15
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,029
My gosh.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,069
- What's wrong? - It's nothing.

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,799
- Are you okay, Mr. Yoon? - Don't come near me.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,069
- Wait. No! - I told you not to come near me.

19
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,519
Oh my goodness. Watch yourself.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,558
Goodness, look at all these mosquitoes.

21
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:31,429
Hey, you're right.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,030
Goodness.

23
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,299
You should head inside first.

24
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,039
Right, you should come inside soon as well.

25
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,669
No way.

26
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,009
Whatever.

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,509
Just go to sleep.

28
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,150
Hello, sir. I should've been the one to call you.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,949
Sure. I'll come see you soon.

30
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,489
Of course, sir. Take care.

31
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,329
- Goodness. - Hey, good morning.

32
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,769
Well, I...

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,668
Who were you on the phone with that had you so polite?

34
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:23,008
Someone who helped me immensely when in need.

35
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,108
A few years back,

36
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,739
I once rescued his child.

37
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,709
Ever since then, he's been helping me...

38
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,710
in every way possible which I'm grateful for.

39
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,749
Hold on. How many people have you saved?

40
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,049
Who keeps count?

41
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,459
Then, is the person you rescued doing well?

42
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,889
I heard about an opportunity to study abroad,

43
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,989
but he hasn't mentioned his child ever since.

44
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,530
I can't even remember the face.

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,198
It'll take a while until the others get here.

46
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,768
- How about some coffee... - Hey, there. Good morning.

47
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,410
It's good to see you.

48
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,579
- Hello. - You're here.

49
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,180
Ms. Beautiful Bang, did you sleep well?

50
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,749
- Good morning. - Hey, there.

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,350
He's a snorer.

52
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,720
I see everyone's punctual.

53
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,570
(Jisang Liquor)

54
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,798
- Have a safe trip back. - Have a safe trip back.

55
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:25,999
- Bye. - Good job.

56
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,679
Wait.

57
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,978
There's dust.

58
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,349
- Really? - Yes.

59
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,478
- Thanks for that. - Right.

60
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,450
- We'll get going, then. - Sure.

61
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,519
Hold on. Do you have your phone?

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,459
Yes, right here. Do you all have yours?

63
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,188
You have your phones, right? Off we go.

64
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,558
Wait. Do you have your wallet too?

65
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,168
- Wallet. - Mine's in my purse.

66
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,970
We have everything, so shut the door already.

67
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,369
- Right. - Good.

68
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:03,510
- Watch your hands. - Sure.

69
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,449
Hold on. Your seat belt.

70
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,749
Got it. Done.

71
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,949
Right.

72
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,760
(Jisang Liquor)

73
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,559
She has left.

74
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,868
(Episode 6)

75
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:32,270
Shouldn't the boss be back by now?

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,909
Is he going to stay there all day?

77
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,808
The void one leaves behind is always this big.

78
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:40,739
With the oddball of a boss gone,

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,280
there's zero excitement.

80
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,618
Why are you asking for someone who isn't here?

81
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:50,390
Focus on those who are actually in your vicinity.

82
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,890
Catch.

83
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:56,359
No wonder I can't be bothered to work today.

84
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,699
What a poor working environment.

85
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,969
I didn't realize it until now,

86
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,168
but the boss' face kept me energized.

87
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:05,970
- Exactly. - Hey.

88
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,868
You're nowhere near handsome,

89
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,709
so work harder.

90
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,378
Why you... Don't you have mirrors at home?

91
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,780
You're one to talk when you're a newlywed.

92
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,719
- As if... - There's a difference.

93
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,419
Unbelievable. Does a man's good looks put food on the table?

94
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,389
If you like Mr. Yoon that much, why not keep him to yourselves?

95
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,819
Don't be ridiculous.

96
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,059
Our relationship is strictly business.

97
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,488
Hold on. Isn't that Mr. Yoon?

98
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,700
- What? - I think that's him.

99
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,200
Wait. Wifey!

100
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:39,438
Wifey, wait.

101
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,470
Goodness.

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,509
What? The people here...

103
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,309
have no respect for their village chief.

104
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,139
What's this?

105
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,409
Hey, over here.

106
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,378
The ladder's shaking. Someone hold it for me.

107
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,780
Darn. How can I get down from here?

108
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,418
- Mr. Yoon! - Boss!

109
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:05,659
Boss. What's going on?

110
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,559
We saw him go in.

111
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,489
- Mr. Yoon? - Boss!

112
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:11,799
Hey.

113
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,999
You should've told us that you were back.

114
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,339
Where have you been?

115
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,298
I told you I had a workshop to attend.

116
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:25,079
- I thought you had left for good. - Same here.

117
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,279
You must've had a great time with those from a major company.

118
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,779
Have you already forgotten about us?

119
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,719
- Exactly. - It was only an overnight trip.

120
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,149
One might think I was gone for 14 months.

121
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,089
Nothing happened, right?

122
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,728
Did something happen? A lot of things.

123
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,728
- It's a disaster. - Yes, it's a disaster.

124
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:46,959
- Exactly. - That's right.

125
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,999
What?

126
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,099
(Red Liquor, Liquor Street 5th Avenue)

127
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,268
(Jinjin Beer)

128
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,039
What's with all the business cards from wholesalers?

129
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,469
Those who had Naro Beer at the festival...

130
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,840
must've spread the word about how great it is.

131
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,849
We hit the jackpot.

132
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,978
My gosh. We've got so many business cards.

133
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:10,249
Could this be the beginning of us being a major company?

134
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,190
But...

135
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,128
I don't know if we can push out enough beer.

136
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,228
Don't be ridiculous.

137
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,329
We should push it all out.

138
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,669
We should even if we can't.

139
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,368
I'll self-medicate to meet the demands.

140
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:28,339
We should work day and night.

141
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,368
One shouldn't pass up on an opportunity like this.

142
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,738
It's an opportunity.

143
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,580
I guess you're right. Things might be tight,

144
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,108
but Jisang Liquor agreed not to compromise my schedule.

145
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:41,179
By coordinating the schedule, we'll be able to meet the demands.

146
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,689
- Nice. - All right.

147
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,258
But that means you'll be a lot busier.

148
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,790
- Don't you worry. - Don't you worry.

149
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:53,899
But will that major company let you have it your way?

150
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:57,199
If they tell you to work with their schedule,

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,039
that'll hurt the production here.

152
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,439
That will be a major crisis.

153
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,368
Hold on. The village chief...

154
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:07,039
has a point.

155
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,878
Don't be ridiculous.

156
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,878
Chae Yong Ju would never.

157
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,018
Don't you know what she's like?

158
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,449
She's right.

159
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,488
You have a tendency to put a damper on things.

160
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:19,459
What's your problem?

161
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,028
I was thinking of the worst-case scenario.

162
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,158
That being said,

163
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,200
- we should call Chae Yong Ju and... - That...

164
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,999
won't ever happen.

165
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,128
I trust her.

166
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,729
- Good. - Exactly.

167
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:40,340
(Brewing Love)

168
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,479
Is this actually true?

169
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,420
Isn't it obvious?

170
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,790
The article was released by Baekmok Liquor.

171
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,060
It was to make a fool out of us.

172
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,359
In My Name? That's Yoon Min Ju's beer.

173
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,499
Why is his name in the article?

174
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,169
The information must've leaked from our end,

175
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,028
and they're announcing a beef of a similar concept.

176
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,138
That's how Baekmok operates.

177
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,738
They play games by using the media.

178
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:12,509
What was being done while Baekmok was preparing to strike?

179
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,210
Marketing Team?

180
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,849
It's a good thing...

181
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,949
I'm always checking in on our competition.

182
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,190
If the chairman had seen this news article...

183
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,350
This leaves us with one option.

184
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,359
Our beer must hit the market first.

185
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,289
I heard a task force was put together...

186
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,790
to develop a new beer.

187
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,329
That's right, sir. My team's Ms. Chae has been...

188
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,728
- Ms. Chae, you answer me. - Go ahead.

189
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,600
Is it true it'll take six months to develop this new beer?

190
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,408
Yes, six months is the minimum...

191
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:47,039
- Make it three. - Sorry?

192
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,279
You get three months.

193
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,019
How was the first meeting?

194
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,189
Will the task force run well?

195
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,249
Ms. Chae has put everything on the line.

196
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,118
She even put together a workshop.

197
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,319
What's her deadline for the new beer?

198
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,689
- Six months, sir. - That long?

199
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,800
Ms. Chae isn't fooling around on this project.

200
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,070
What if this only puts the Marketing Team in the lead?

201
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,799
Report back to me on everything that goes on.

202
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,409
Our team must take credit for the new beer.

203
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,409
You know why I gave you this job.

204
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,748
That's too tight of a schedule.

205
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:28,378
He'll have to spend all of his time...

206
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:30,748
on the new beer to meet that deadline...

207
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,859
- which will hurt his business... - Can't you do it?

208
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,259
We'll do it. Why would you say otherwise?

209
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,759
Don't you know Ms. Chae? She'll make it happen.

210
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,800
She'll persuade Mr. Yoon and have him focus on our beer.

211
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,590
Right.

212
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,320
Wait.

213
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,228
How can we move up the deadline by three months...

214
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,499
just because we're afraid of Baekmok?

215
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,670
There's more reason...

216
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,599
to make a proper beer that'll guarantee us a win.

217
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,369
Getting the job done despite the obstacles...

218
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,080
proves one's worth.

219
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,080
This hurts the trust we built with Mr. Yoon.

220
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:32,518
If we move up the deadline by three months,

221
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,050
he won't have time to brew his own beer.

222
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,719
Chae Yong Ju, why would you care about his situation?

223
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,359
What can he do when he signed the contract?

224
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,659
- Sir. - Tell him to focus on our beer!

225
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,799
As if his own beer is of any importance.

226
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,300
His sales are next to nothing.

227
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:54,470
Don't play down his business like that.

228
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:03,050
Chae Yong Ju, it isn't like you to say...

229
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,009
something can't be done.

230
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,320
I know, but this is something I don't want to do.

231
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,029
Hold on. Was that sign always there?

232
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:22,830
I saw someone do it and thought I'd try it.

233
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:25,498
What about the reserve forces?

234
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:27,998
Here, mister. Have two.

235
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,040
Nice.

236
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,540
Unbelievable.

237
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,180
I can't believe one's too busy to even eat.

238
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,350
The deadline for our new beer went from 6 months to 3.

239
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,550
- What? - What?

240
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,389
Completing a 6-month project in 3...

241
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,690
will kill us.

242
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,859
I already have three jobs, so that isn't possible.

243
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:56,869
Who is it? Who ordered this?

244
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,399
Maybe it's my fault.

245
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:11,310
Focus.

246
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:13,850
Here, you must...

247
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,090
Only look at me

248
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,700
Hold on. Does CEO Yoon know?

249
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,800
Our hard work paid off.

250
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:36,569
We'll be busier from here on out, so I'll call Chan Hwi.

251
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,570
Put him on speaker.

252
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:38,878
It's been a while since we heard his voice.

253
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,239
- Toast. - That's right.

254
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,319
Hey, boss. Did you hear the news?

255
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,920
Jisang Liquor moved up the deadline.

256
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,420
What do we do?

257
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,759
This will affect the brewing of Naro Beer.

258
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,429
What did you decide? Will you shut it down for a while?

259
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,960
Shut it down? What do you mean by that?

260
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:00,959
See? What did I tell you?

261
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,469
I told you we couldn't trust Chae Yong Ju.

262
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,569
Unbelievable. I knew it!

263
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,839
What do we do, boss?

264
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,868
This is bad.

265
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:14,079
What on earth is happening?

266
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,679
Is what you said true?

267
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
No way.

268
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,949
Didn't you know?

269
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,350
Didn't Chae Yong Ju call you?

270
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:25,618
Let me call Ms. Chae.

271
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:26,720
Do it.

272
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:34,898
(CEO Yoon Min Ju)

273
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,129
She's not picking up.

274
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,399
She's not picking up.

275
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,368
What do we even know about her anyway?

276
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:42,210
We know nothing.

277
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,320
Do what you're told.

278
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,689
If you launch the new beer in three months,

279
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,050
the Busan office will be normalized that much sooner.

280
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,690
That's what you want the most.

281
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,469
I'll only say what I can promise you.

282
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:16,209
I will never do wrong by this place...

283
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,939
or your beer.

284
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,280
You do know, don't you?

285
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,750
Whether I'm being sincere or not.

286
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,379
So, I hope you see me...

287
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:28,080
as who I am.

288
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,189
Darn.

289
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,369
Yong Ju.

290
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,438
I heard the news.

291
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,770
If all goes well,

292
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,669
we might get to go back to Busan in three months.

293
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:55,709
Our family will be thrilled to hear this.

294
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,919
I know.

(Hwi's Toast)

296
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,129
Chae Yong Ju. Yong Ju, wait.

297
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,369
I think I made a huge mistake.

298
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,040
I told Mr. Yoon.

299
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:23,840
- Tell him what? - About the deadline being moved up.

300
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,840
I thought he already knew!

301
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,080

302

(Branch Manager Nam of the Busan office)

306
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,840
Hello? Hey, Yong Ju.

307
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,968
I heard you were in Busan yesterday.

308
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,369
That's right, sir.

309
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,178
I was there for work and couldn't go to see you.

310
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:05,648
The boys told me how delighted they were to see you.

311
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:07,279
They may not say it out loud,

312
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,049
but you can imagine how they're screaming on the inside.

313
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,419
But they were thrilled to see you and said they would hang on tight.

314
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,419
I saw newfound energy in them.

315
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,929
Yong Ju, thank you.

316
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,799
We'll see each other again soon.

317
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,570
Sure. I'll be in touch.

318
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,319
We're going to do our best to hang in there.

319
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
So come back to us.

320
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:45,718
If all goes well,

321
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,259

That's what you want the most.

What I want the most?

327
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,948
How many times did I tell you?

328
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:15,919
There's a reason I was against her from the start.

329
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,489
She's going to ruin the business we have here.

330
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,819
- Those... - My gosh.

331
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,990
who get in the way of our beer,

332
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,590
I...

333
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,829
I won't let them get away with it.

334
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,029
To be honest, our lives depend on this.

335
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,138
Don't you agree?

336
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:35,468
Don't be like that.

337
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,668
We should hear her side of the story first.

338
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,479
That's right. She did a lot for us including helping us...

339
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,009
- at the beer festival. - Exactly.

340
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,679
She has a point.

341
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,049
Of course.

342
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,249
I don't feel at ease saying this about her.

343
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,589
It makes me uncomfortable too.

344
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,188
However, I'm furious with her...

345
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:58,129
and will take her by the collar if I see her face.

346
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,260
What can I do when I'm upset with her?

347
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,329
Is it just me?

348
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,839
That's true. You have a point as well.

349
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,439
Of course, it's upsetting.

350
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:10,040
I'll take her by the collar...

351
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,840
and teach her a lesson.

(Uilhan Brewery)

353
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,990
Oh, no. This is the worst timing for her.

354
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,340
I'm really sorry.

355
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:42,240
I take it back.

356
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,439
The promise I made you.

357
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:50,010
I don't think I can keep it. I'm sorry.

358
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:57,219
Is there anything else you have to say?

359
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,060
No.

360
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,600
Okay, then...

361
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:10,530
can you go now?

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,969
I have no right to feel hurt.

363
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:09,490
Boss.

364
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,189
Was someone here?

365
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,399
No.

366
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,699
We'll go home now.

367
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,969
My limbs ache. I can't do any more.

368
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,668
Good job, everyone.

369
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:23,368
So that you don't feel any pressure,

370
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,368
I'll find another solution.

371
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,240
We have a clear solution.

372
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,878
Dump Jisang Liquor.

373
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:30,310
Scrap the deal.

374
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,020
You must be upset at Chae Yong Ju too. Yes or no?

375
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,919
You can all go now. Clock off.

376
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,490
You're such a softie. It won't do you any good.

377
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,359
You should get angry about things like this...

378
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,958
and cut out everyone involved.

379
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,898
Yes. You're too nice.

380
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:53,499
See you. Good job.

381
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,340
- Bye. - See you.

382
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,269
- Darn you. - Yes.

383
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,979
He needs advice like that.

384
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,540
- Not from you. - He'll be upset.

(Uilhan Brewery)

386
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,540
I can't meet the demands at this speed.

387
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:43,109
Why wouldn't I be angry?

388
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:45,209
Of course, I'm angry.

389
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,649
But...

390
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:49,790
how could I show it?

391
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,990
I know just how much it took her...

392
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,919
to talk to me.

393
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,060
Is there anything else you have to say?

394
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,840
No.

395
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:12,310
How horrible she felt...

396
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,709
as she drove over to see me.

397
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:19,850
I could feel it.

398
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:28,889
You're still up?

399
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,260
You're going to drink?

400
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,658
You never drink at home...

401
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,669
because you say it's like bringing work home.

402
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,740
I just felt like it today.

403
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,939
Why would you feel like it?

404
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,209
You didn't drink at home...

405
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,379
even when your branch was about to get shut down.

406
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,209
Can I have just one drink?

407
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:19,580
Were you always...

408
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,310
so tense and alert even when you got drunk?

409
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,080
But then who could I blame?

410
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,350
It's my fault.

411
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,320
Granny.

412
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,060
I never...

413
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:42,359
had any doubts about my work.

414
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,030
I did everything I was told.

415
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:50,139
I never wondered why it had to be done.

416
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,179
On top of that, this time,

417
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,449
the livelihood of my Busan family is at stake.

418
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,250
Why would I hesitate?

419
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:01,919
Whatever it may be,

420
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,219
I have to do it.

421
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,990
I must make it happen.

422
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,760
But today...

423
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:16,199
Darn it.

424
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,570
Today...

425
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:25,909
I didn't want to do it.

426
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,010
I really didn't want to do it.

427
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,550
I made a promise to him...

428
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,990
and I didn't want to break it so easily.

429
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,159
- Did you just say, "him?" - Yes, "him."

430
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,500
He's not usually like that.

431
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,329
He never did that before,

432
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,439
but today, he took my wrist and pushed me away.

433
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,879
This is the first time you talked about someone else to me.

434
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:06,280
You should be friends.

435
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:09,320
I'd love us to be friends.

436
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:10,820
But...

437
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,619
It's done for.

438
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,290
Who is it?

439
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:21,500
Who is giving my Yong Ju such a hard time?

440
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,100
Who is it?

441
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,869
Give me a name. I'll break the person's back.

442
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,869
Who?

443
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,179
Hang on.

444
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,409
How did he know the launch date?

445
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,949
I never told him.

446
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,389
The only people who knew about the six-month deadline...

447
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,560
were the six TF Team members.

448
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:04,639
But the CEO knew about it already.

449
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:14,350
He gave the exact time frame of six to three months.

450
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,689
What is this?

451
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:19,589
You have no idea how evil their team is.

452
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,520
This is them inserting spies onto the enemy team.

453
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,899
There's a spy on our team.

The new product will be out in three months,

456
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,458
so I came up with a new plan, budget, and strategy.

457
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,290
Can you check the budget for me?

458
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,590
You did this already?

459
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,429
By when will you be done?

460
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,770
Let me go over it and see how much revising it needs.

461
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,399
Okay.

462
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:10,510
Good morning.

00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,949
Get in here and...

466
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,689
Ms. Chae, why are you...

467
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,820
Hello.

468
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,729
You seem to have many questions for the TF Team,

469
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,358
so I came by myself.

470
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,530
I'll sit down.

471
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,659
Ms. Bang, take a seat.

472
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,020
Shouldn't I be in the know about product development?

473
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:36,259
I should get updates.

474
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,090
Yes, of course. I should've reported to you.

475
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,799
I feel terrible...

476
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,760
that you had to go behind my back.

477
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,599
What? How dare you talk back at me like...

478
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,639
You should...

479
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,299
take on someone in your own league.

480
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,810
Don't use my people.

481

Ms. Bang works for me now.

482

I'll kindly answer your questions.

You just made a big mistake.

487
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,968
I'll make up for that mistake...

488

489
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:23,969
You're so darn confident.

490
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,409
I am. What could go wrong?

491
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:28,939

That lunatic...

501
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:18,830
Stay back after work. That's an order.

00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:21,860

Let's walk.

505
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,270
I fed all the information on our team...

506
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,569
to the director.

507
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,239
- I feel... - I hope you feel bad.

508
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,420
But the guys who made you do that should feel even worse.

509
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,460
So ditch the guilt and apologies.

510
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,830
We now have to make up for what happened.

511
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:30,630
You mean Mr. Yoon, right?

512
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,198
I feel bad that we broke the promise,

513
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,138
but the head office made a decision.

514
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:36,639
- We can apologize... - Exactly.

515
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,980
Anyone can go against their word...

516
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,940
and apologize and say they had no choice.

517
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,810
It's just one promise.

518
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,420
But I don't want to break it.

519
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:51,989
I hate it even more to end it this way.

520
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:55,989
To me, a promise...

521
00:35:57,529 --> 00:35:59,659
is how I get close to someone.

522
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,360
Being on time.

523
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,869
Not going against my word.

524
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,940
Sticking to the basics...

525
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,409
is how I show my respect.

526
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,009
"I want you to like me,"

527
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,540
"and I want us to get close."

528
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,750
To me, it's a proposal of sorts.

529
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,919
I'd like us to become people who could make...

530
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,560
and keep many more promises in the future.

531
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,500
You're saying that while eating a popsicle?

532
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,699
Don't seniors say such things over a drink?

533
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:42,670
I didn't want to bare my heart while drunk.

534
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,210
Go home and rest up.

535
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,449
We should start damage control tomorrow.

00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,380
Bye.

537
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,069
She calls this damage control?

538
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,540
- Oh, my gosh. - I feel drowsy.

539
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,909
I'm sleepy.

540
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,080
We must've been...

541
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,549
blinded by greed.

542
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,190
We didn't think before we took such a big order.

543
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:38,060
The boss will be packing it all on his own.

544
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:42,429

What?

00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:11,959
You're not awake.

I am, darn you. I'm awake.

00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:00,940

Oh, dear...

570
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,279
Then you shouldn't have taken the order.

571
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,649
I'm caught in the middle now.

572
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,888
Sorry. I'll work as fast as I can...

573
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:17,159
I don't care about what you do. I need the beer.

574
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,389
By when can I have it?

575
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,000
By tomorrow.

576
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,730
- What? - You'll have it by tomorrow.

577
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:26,529
Tomorrow?

578
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,739
Can you do that?

579
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,309
- Yes. - Good.

580
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,408
I'll come back tomorrow, then.

581
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,948
You're a pretty and handsome bunch.

582
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,750
- Do your thing. - Bye.

What are you doing here?

584
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,618
I said I couldn't keep my promise,

585
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,049
but I never said I'd cause you trouble.

586
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,960
I heard you couldn't keep up with the demand.

587

We're about to make you much busier.

588
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,789
Of course, I should be responsible.

589
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,600
- What should we do first? - I get how...

590
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,999
you convinced Chan Hwi,

591
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,170

I was worried you'd be driving at night.

Would someone that worried...

601
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,009

very upset?

605
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:25,549
No. Why would I be?

(Sent E-mails)

724
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:16,119
I check the e-mails I have sent over and over again.

725
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,619
I always worry about whether I made a mistake.

726
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,219
(New Product Development Presentation)

727
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,989
Even that small responsibility is too much for me.

728
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,509
But what wears me out the most is...

729
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,940
hiding it from others.

730
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,909
That's why I glammed myself up like a shield...

731
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,150
to look perfect on the outside.

732
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:50,819
It worked quite well, you know?

733
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,360
But that girl appeared.

734
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,020
- Hi. - Hi.

735
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,529
Ah Reum. Isn't that a limited edition?

736
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:05,599
- Goodness. - Seriously, you have everything.

737
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,469
I feel a great sense of deprivation.

738
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:10,269
- Good morning. - Good morning.

739
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,339
Ms. Chae. Isn't Ms. Bang's bag gorgeous?

740
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,979
Getting your hands on it is almost impossible.

741
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,080
Yes, it's pretty.

742
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:17,980
Congratulations.

743
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:22,049
She's so indifferent about it.

744
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,019
But doesn't that make Ms. Chae cooler?

745
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,089
- You're right. She's cool. - Right?

746
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,920
- We're leaving first. - Bye.

747
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:36,529
The girl who effortlessly exposes the perfect image...

748
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:38,569
I've tried hard to create.

749
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,400
She's on another level.

750
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:48,079
Because belittling an opponent is just too easy a way out.

751
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,579
I simply wanted to be of help.

752
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,408
But the guys who made you do that should feel even worse.

753
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:55,218
You should personally take responsibility.

754
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:56,818
Don't you get paid the big bucks because you're supposed...

755
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:58,048
to take responsibility for your team's mistakes?

756
00:51:58,049 --> 00:52:01,290
Ms. Bang works for me now.

757
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,989
I hate being compared.

758
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:07,130
But truthfully, I compare myself to others the most.

759
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,330
Because I can't accept the fact that I'm jealous,

760
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,569
I hate myself.

761
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,400
Aren't I...

762
00:52:19,509 --> 00:52:21,279
a total mess?

763
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,250
The beer purity order?

764
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,589
Do you know what that is?

765
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:37,119
Was it "Reinheitsgebol?"

766
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:42,830
What do I comfort her with?

767
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:46,029
Tell me again. I'll do as you tell me to.

768
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,540
What was the purity order again?

769
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,540
Reinheits... What?

770
00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:54,069
Who comforts others as they are told?

771
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,509
Do it from your heart.

772
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,779
Fine.

773
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,889
Reinheitsgebot.

774
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,159
Yes, that.

775
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,559
Beer can only be made with...

776
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,429
water, malt, yeast, and hop.

777
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,900
That order restricts using the four ingredients.

778
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:27,040
That was why Mr. Yoon did a lot of thinking.

779
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,940
"What is my purity order?"

780
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:36,650
Sensitive, anxious, delicate, emotional,

781
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,719
or something like that.

782
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:42,719
Anyway, that is...

783
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,730
how he created this one.

784
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,460
In My Name.

785
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,969
What do you think? Is it a mess?

786
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:01,080
It's good enough.

787
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,839
I agree with you.

788
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,779
To me,

789
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,179
you're good enough.

790
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:11,449
Ms. Beautiful...

791
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,949
Bang.

792
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,790
And...

793
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,330
you're...

794
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:23,699
truly pretty.

795
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,920
I always wondered how you get up to the second floor.

796
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,960
I can't seem to find a way over there...

797
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,089
It's this way.

798
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:53,560
Okay.

799
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,529
What?

800
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:01,839
What?

801
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:08,610
For real?

802
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,710
I see.

803
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,549
Goodness.

804
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:22,489
My gosh.

805
00:55:23,259 --> 00:55:26,659
So this is what it looks like. Oh, goodness.

806
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,830
Did you take all of these yourself?

807
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,999
Of course.

808
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,900
Gosh, you're a great photographer.

809
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,810
How many cameras do you have?

810
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,670
Goodness.

811
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,149
Yes, this place! And that one.

812
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,778
The ladies freaked out because of these.

813
00:55:47,779 --> 00:55:50,549
I did, too, you know?

814
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,819
Oh, right.

815
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:58,860
There's Photo. You did an amazing job decorating the place.

816
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,029
What's that room over there?

817
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,529
May I have a look inside?

818
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,670
Yes.

819
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:20,279
Oh, my.

820
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,020
Hold on.

821
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:28,989
It's a photo of me.

822
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:32,389
Is this what you wanted to show me?

823
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,560
Yes.

824
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,759
It was my first photo.

825
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,299
Your first photo? Even though there are tons in here?

826
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:41,440
Of a person.

827
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,170
I see. It came out really well.

828
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:49,879
What's this, Mr. Yoon? Taking a photo of me...

829
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,008
and showing me places not even Photo has access to.

830
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,750
Why are you being so nice to me?

831
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,750
Right?

832
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:59,690
You managed to come inside a place nobody can.

833
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,429
Isn't your heart beating a little fast?

834
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:11,199
What nonsense are you spouting?

835
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,068
I am a former Special Task Force agent.

836
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:15,900
I always maintain...

837
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:19,469
my calmness.

838
00:57:21,009 --> 00:57:22,040
Really?

839
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,540
Yes.

840
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:29,719
I can have this photo, right?

841
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:32,850
No.

842
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,259
It's mine.

843
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,399
Come on. Stop being cheap. It's just one photo.

844
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,540
My face is on it. This... Why...

845
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,869
Why am I nervous like he's a stranger? What's wrong with me?

846
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,080
I'm sorry.

847
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,279
I don't hold back when I'm certain about something.

848
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,819
I certainly like...

849
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,500
this one.

850
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,270
I'm talking about the photo.

851
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:29,679
Oh, the photo?

852
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,449
Right.

853
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:35,420
I see.

854
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:39,819
Goodness gracious.

855
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:43,020
Thank you for coming today.

856
00:58:43,759 --> 00:58:46,630
Thank you for inviting me.

857
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,259
Shall we get to work? Let's work.

858
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:54,770
The photo...

859
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,119
Gosh, nice.

860
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,219
Good luck!

861
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,888
- Bye. - I'm off.

862
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,190
- Bye. - Bye.

863
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,468
- Goodness. - Great work, everyone.

864
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:26,770
Good job.

865
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,040
Now then, I've got to say goodbye here.

866
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:39,879
Customers won't stop asking if I'm going to sell toasts today.

867
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,249
I'll get going, too.

868
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,279
- Thank you for today. - You've done well.

869
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:45,290
Be careful on your way.

870
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:47,889
I'll get in touch, okay?

871
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,020
Why?

872
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,029
Come on. Stop being so cold.

873
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,830
But that's charming.

874
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,569
- You should get going. - Go ahead.

875
01:00:00,529 --> 01:00:02,670
- I'll be leaving then. - Bye.

876
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,810
Bye.

877
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,250
Bye.

878
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,948
I should get going too. I've got plans in Busan.

879
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,218
Really? I'm also going to Busan.

880
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:25,029
The pink teddy bear brother wants me to come over.

881
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,329
That guy? Is he doing well?

882
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,460
Yes, he is.

883
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:30,830
Well then...

884
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,969
Right.

885
01:00:39,509 --> 01:00:40,540
Thank you for everything.

886
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,509
I see.

887
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:47,310
I'll get going now. Bye.

888
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:21,580
- Min Ju! - Min Ho! How have you been?

889
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:23,880
You grew taller in the meantime.

890
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,790
What brings you here?

891
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,189
Min Ho. You pestered Min Ju to come, didn't you?

892
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,460
I did.

893
01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:34,460
A family needs to see each other often.

894
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,369
I'm guessing Dad's not home.

895
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:41,738
He went to pick up a guest we're having today.

896
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,039
A guest...

897
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,968
I should've contacted you before coming home.

898
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:48,440
Don't you also know that guest?

899
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:51,949
I heard she was the one who saved you six years ago.

900
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:56,350
Hey!

901
01:01:57,279 --> 01:01:59,049
Don't pass out. Hold on.

902
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,690
Hey.

903
01:02:07,989 --> 01:02:09,060
Who did you say it was?

904
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,669
Does Dad know who that person is?

905
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:15,940
Didn't you know that your dad was always in touch with that person?

906
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,009
I had no idea.

907
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:25,210
Good grief. This is all because of the lack of communication.

908
01:02:26,049 --> 01:02:27,110
Well...

909
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:31,920
Neither of us brought up what had happened back then.

910
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:35,359
I'm also seeing the guest for the first time.

911
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,290
The guest has never been invited to our house before.

912
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:44,560
So that person is on their way here, right?

913
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,969
Come in.

914
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,408
- Hi. - Let's head inside.

915
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:56,540
Hi.

916
01:03:09,259 --> 01:03:10,860
Hey.

917
01:03:16,699 --> 01:03:17,730
It's okay now.

918
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,529
Everything is okay now.

919
01:03:25,339 --> 01:03:27,369
Why are you here, Mr. Yoon?

920
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:29,679
What...

921
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:21,230
(Brewing Love)

922
01:04:21,529 --> 01:04:23,159
Why did you do it?

923
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,229
Why did you wreck the town?

924
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,999
Stop caring about me.

925
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,939
I told you I had a lot of secrets.

926
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,869
I might want to know those secrets.

927
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,008
If you want me to wait until you're ready to talk, I'll wait.

928
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:37,179
Don't avoid me.

929
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:39,079
I won't avoid you, either.

930
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,210
I don't regret my decision back then.

931
01:04:41,509 --> 01:04:43,079
Don't avoid me.

932
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,519
Don't disappear from me, okay?

933
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,759
I will never leave you, Ms. Chae.
