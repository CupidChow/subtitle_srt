(Uilhan Brewery)

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,309
(1. Malting, 2. Malt milling, 3. Mash tun, 4. Hopping)

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,849
(Kim Se Jeong)

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,660
(Highly passionate, highly sensitive)

00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,089
(Lee Jong Won)

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,600
(Shin Do Hyun)

7

(Naro Beer)

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,978
(Brewing Love)

11
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:35,008
(This is a work of fiction.)

12
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,009
(Scenes with child actors and animals were filmed...)

13
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:37,009
(under production guidelines along with experts.)

14
00:00:51,724 --> 00:00:52,953
This...

15
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:58,323
Do you have any idea...

16
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:01,794
how many times I prayed for a chance to meet you?

17
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:06,833
Saving a life isn't that big of a deal for me.

18
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:10,803
I only did what I should've done.

19
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:15,574
How is this not a big deal when we got to meet again like this?

20
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:52,643
Your emotions. Why...

21
00:01:59,524 --> 00:02:00,624
What's wrong?

22
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:05,263
What a surprise.

23
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,594
Who would've guessed?

24
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:11,733
Our fates must be entwined in a mysterious way.

25
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:13,533
Right.

26
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:18,573
I had no idea it was you.

27
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:22,813
I mean, you were nothing like the woman who saved me.

28
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,783
Find everything that poses a risk to you,

29
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,954
and protect yourself first.

30
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,883
That's how you can be kind to yourself.

31
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,253
Be kind to myself...

32
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:36,994
Isn't that for people who don't have to face struggles in life?

33
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:42,434
Is that so?

34
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:47,263
Well, people change throughout their lives.

35
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:51,374
Shall we head back inside? Let's not keep Mr. Yoon waiting.

36
00:02:58,184 --> 00:02:59,244
What was that?

37
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:13,394
Why didn't you tell me...

38
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:16,434
you were in contact with Ms. Chae?

39
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:20,334
I had no idea.

40
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,874
Did you even ask?

41
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:27,874
That day...

42
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:30,813
Goodness.

43
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:35,214
Wasn't it an incident you didn't want to talk about?

44
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:38,883
I didn't mention her for your sake.

45
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:44,594
All is well since he now knows.

46
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:47,124
Of course.

47
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,494
You're right.

48
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,304
Little guy. How's the pink teddy bear?

49
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,304
The pink teddy bear?

50
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:02,042
Min Ho, a big boy like you...

51
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:04,283
shouldn't be playing with stuffed animals.

52
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:06,483
What...

53
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:07,883
It's all right.

54
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:10,614
I'm 32, and I still like pink teddy bears.

55
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:12,383
Who cares?

56
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:14,953
What...

57
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,593
Sir, I won that pink teddy bear for him,

58
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,792
so it's upsetting to hear you say that.

59
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,964
Goodness. Were you the sniper?

60
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:24,134
Yes.

61
00:04:24,204 --> 00:04:25,264
My gosh.

62
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:31,004
As said, our fates must be entwined.

63
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:45,584
Hold on. Yong Ju, wait.

64
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:50,123
Can't you stay so that we can talk?

65
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,723
The situation has been bothering me.

66
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,704
Until next time, sniper lady.

67
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:01,433
Sure. I'll win you another stuffed animal.

68
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:03,404
I love you, sniper lady.

69
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:06,673
Drive home safely.

70
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:10,782
Take a break if you feel like dozing off...

71
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,783
and get back on the road when you're not sleepy.

72
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,683
That reminds me.

73
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:17,254
Don't forget your promise.

74
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,524
The stuffed animal.

75
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,754
Got it.

76
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,194
I'll get going then.

77
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:25,264
What? But...

78
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:27,834
Hold on.

79
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:30,433
But...

80
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:41,113
She's definitely hiding something.

81
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:51,654
(Brewing Love)

82
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,673
Is she still not back?

83
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:22,613
My gosh.

84
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:33,493
Goodness...

85
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:37,293
My goodness.

86
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,473
What? Grandma, why aren't you asleep?

87
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:17,233
I was jolted out of my slumber.

88
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,144
Are you just getting back? It's late.

89
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:22,473
- Should I turn on the light? - No, don't.

90
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,283
It'll be blinding. Go to bed already.

91
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,713
Why is the night light off?

92
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,253
I told you to keep it on to prevent getting hurt in the dark.

93
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:32,053
I heard you, okay? Did you come home to nag me?

94
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:35,824
- I'm going to bed, so leave. - So temperamental.

95
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:38,493
Good night.

96
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:42,194
Why? Do you have something to say?

97
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:46,334
No. Sleep tight.

98
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:11,493
Grandma put this up here again.

99
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,464
Why would she do this when I don't need it?

100
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:25,444
As said, our fates must be entwined.

101
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,074
Protect yourself first.

102
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,083
Grandma?

103
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:33,613
Grandma, what's wrong?

104
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:42,522
Welcome.

105
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,924
- Do you have a reservation? - Yes.

106
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,304
Why am I always the first to arrive?

107
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:23,934
I told you I was busy on weekends.

108
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:25,533
Besides, aren't you too old...

109
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,304
to celebrate your birthday with your parents?

110
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,804
If you had to have us here, why not book a fancier place...

111
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,243
rather than this casual restaurant for kids?

112
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:32,773
Kids would come to places like this...

113
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:35,074
to celebrate birthdays with their families.

114
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:38,043
I never got to, and it ate away at me.

115
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,414
Unbelievable. The price dropped again.

116
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:53,993
I'm getting married.

117
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,492
A year later. No matter what.

118
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,862
I was wondering when you'd say that again.

119
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:00,463
Kids these days opt to stay unmarried...

120
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:02,403
and lead incredible lives.

121
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:04,502
Why are you so desperate to get married?

122
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,674
You're a weird one.

123
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:08,574
My dream is to be a good mom.

124
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:11,483
Sure. I hope you have a daughter like you.

125
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:14,483
That's right. I'll have a daughter like me...

126
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,554
and be the mother that you never were.

127
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:19,783
What didn't I do right by you?

128
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,222
I fed you nice things, bought you nice clothes,

129
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:22,323
and sent you to nice schools.

130
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:24,194
You were offered a premium childhood.

131
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:27,193
Do you have any idea how rough it was for me...

132
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,633
to live in poverty?

133
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:31,934
You should count your blessings.

134
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:33,863
Did I say otherwise?

135
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:38,643
I know I had it lucky and am grateful for it.

136
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:41,344
But you should at least know the truth.

137
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:44,444
All you did was give me money.

138
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,393
Of course, ma'am. I'm almost there. Just wait a little while longer.

139
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:02,794
Absolutely. You're the only one I'm relaying this information to.

140
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,204
Yes, of course. Sure thing.

141
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,203
Ah Reum, those corvinas are expensive.

142
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:10,233
Have that rather than cake.

143
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,503
What's the time? Gosh, I'm off.

144
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,873
Anyway, Ah Reum, happy birthday!

145
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:38,503
- Weren't I right? - You were.

146
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,273
Why is he here?

147
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:43,934
I seem to see him everywhere.

148
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,403
- Do you have a reservation? - Yes, under Oh Chan Hwi.

149
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:49,972
Did they have to seat him here?

150
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:51,783
- Did you see that? - No way.

151
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,143
- What are you doing? - Come on.

152
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:54,382
What a joke.

153
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:55,813
- Over here. - Here.

154
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,583
- What should we have? - Let's hurry up and order.

155
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,622
- I'm hungry. - Me too. What about this?

156
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:01,492
- Sounds good. I want that. - Me too.

157
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:03,623
- This one. - Why did I hide?

158
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:05,663
Baby brother, choose what you want.

159
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:06,893
I want alcohol.

160
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:08,294
- What? No way. - I want a drink.

161
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:09,762
- That's a no. - Guys.

162
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,534
- It's Mom and Dad. - Mom and Dad?

163
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,803
- Son! - Mom, Dad.

164
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:15,934
- Mom! - Hey.

165
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:18,273
I can't believe you guys.

166
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:20,443
- You went on a trip overseas... - Sorry.

167
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:21,573
Sorry.

168
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,142
and left me to celebrate our baby brother's birthday.

169
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,883
Being the eldest brother of a Korean family is a challenge.

170
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,113
Anyway, stay safe and have fun.

171
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,783
- I love you. - I love you.

172
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,853
I love you, Mom.

173
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:37,892
- They must be having fun. - It'll be fun for them.

174
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:40,122
A family expressing their love for one another?

175
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:42,534
Ah Reum, I have a meeting and must leave early.

176
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:43,693
Take your time with your meal.

177
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,834
That's right. I should get going too.

178
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:47,464
Drop me off on the way.

179
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,643
What? Is there anything you can do by yourself?

180
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,372
Do you still want a husband after seeing that? I'm off.

181
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,982
I'll pay for the meal on my way out.

182
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,314
See you later. Bye.

183
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,784
- Lucky you, baby brother. - I'm the best, right?

184
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,784
Hold on.

185
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,723
- How about a photo? - Sounds good.

186
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:11,723
- We'll send it to Mom. - Nice.

187
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,133
Seriously?

188
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:26,703
Happy birthday to you

189
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:29,743
Happy birthday to you

190
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:34,112
Happy birthday, dear baby brother

191
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:38,324
Happy birthday to you

192
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:42,824
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

193
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,793
Happy birthday to you

194
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:54,203
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday, Ah Reum

195
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:59,304
Happy birthday, dear Ah Reum

196
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:03,373
Happy birthday to you

197
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,483
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

198
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,263
Ms. Beautiful Bang?

199
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:54,493
It really is you.

200
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,464
Seeing you on the weekend is a nice treat.

201
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,704
Right. Fancy running into you here.

202
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:02,803
She's Ms. Beautiful Bang whom I work with. Say hi.

203
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:04,204
- Hi. - Hi.

204
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,674
They're my siblings.

205
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:11,643
Bit Na, U Ri, Wi Ha, and Man Se.

206
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:13,613
You have four siblings?

207
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:15,714
I've never seen anyone of our age with that many siblings.

208
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:21,324
Right. It's not Ms. Beautiful Bang, but just Bang Ah Reum.

209
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,393
- Happy birthday. - Thank you.

210
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:26,463
We share a birthday.

211
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:27,924
Really? No way.

212
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:31,762
Ms. Beautiful Bang, I'd love to have coffee with you,

213
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,664
but I have to drop them off.

214
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,873
- Who said anything? - Right?

215
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,273
Just in case you're bummed out. I'll see you around.

216
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:40,704
Why would I be bummed out?

217
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,944
- Guys, let's go. - It was nice to meet you.

218
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:47,044
- Take care. - Bye.

219
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,824
It's picture-perfect.

220
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,633
This was the only place I could come to.

221
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:11,844
I already ate, but I'm hungrier for some reason.

222
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:28,892
It was the same back in the countryside.

223
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,594
Why do you keep caring?

224
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,892
Others usually spend money on me.

225
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:35,294
You're mistaken. I spent money on you too.

226
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:36,893
This box of chocolate sandwich cookies...

227
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,603
cost 5.8 dollars.

228
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,632
- I see. - Make a wish...

229
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,103
and blow out the candles.

230
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,413
"I want Oh Chan Hwi as my boyfriend."

231
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:50,714
- What was that? - I didn't say anything.

232
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:04,423
Happy birthday.

233
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:15,274
(A very early morning a few days later)

234
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:21,913
Photo, my eyes open easily in the morning these days.

235
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:29,054
What a delicious morning it is.

236
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,653
Photo.

237
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:38,193
Why did Yong Ju leave in a hurry?

238
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:45,633
She's obviously hiding something from me.

239
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,633
Should I call her?

240
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:51,844
No, right?

241
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:57,474
I should wait, right? Yes.

242
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,153
Hey, Photo.

243
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:05,153
What a beautiful sunny day, right?

244
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:13,594
But what's the point?

245
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,034
I don't even know how Yong Ju feels.

246
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:26,304
Ms. Chae, is something the matter?

247
00:18:27,544 --> 00:18:29,814
Yes, you seem a little down today.

248
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,014
No, everything's fine.

249
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:36,112
We're getting the first batch of the new product sample today,

250
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:37,383
so I guess I'm a little nervous.

251
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:45,724
This actually helps refresh your mood.

252
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,764
Thank you.

253
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:05,943
It's good.

254
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:07,943
Thanks again.

255
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:11,883
What about me? I need a little pick-me-up too.

256
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:15,193
Here, take the whole thing.

257
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:31,744
(Jisang Liquor)

258
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:37,213
The elders...

259
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:51,054
You're here.

260
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:53,693
Well, I prepared these. They're nothing special.

261
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:03,433
When will they be here?

262
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:05,943
- I'm telling you. - Come on.

263
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,643
Hello, everyone.

264
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,813
- Chae Yong Ju, right? - Chae Yong Ju, again?

265
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:11,943
- Chae Yong Ju is here. - What's the matter?

266
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:14,544
- Well... - Say it.

267
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:16,554
Why did you do it?

268
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:18,284
Why did you do that?

269
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:22,453
Why did you wreck the town?

270
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:24,254
Why did you have to do that?

271
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:26,024
What? Me?

272
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,004
Yirgacheffe.

273
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,643
Boss, you're here.

274
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,574
I guess we should go and do some work now.

275
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:47,613
- Yes. - Gosh, we took a long break.

276
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,084
My goodness.

277
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:54,853
Did I tell you ladies?

278
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:58,892
You know, Ms. Chae Yong Ju was the one who saved my life.

279
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:01,293
Here you are, going on about Chae Yong Ju again.

280
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,362
Seriously...

281
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:04,564
I mean, you've been doing this for days.

282
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,203
At this rate, I might see Chae Yong Ju in my dreams.

283
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:12,442
But I think there's something she's hiding from me,

284
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:13,974
and I really can't figure out what it might be.

285
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:15,774
What could it be?

286
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:18,543
You can either like her or be depressed.

287
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,113
Make up your mind, will you?

288
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:24,054
You're driving us nuts, seriously.

289
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:29,192
(Uilhan Pub)

290
00:21:29,193 --> 00:21:32,692
Why are you buying flowers every day for this place? It's a pub.

291
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,163
Aren't they so pretty?

292
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:36,834
These flowers looked so pretty that I just had to buy them.

293
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:40,632
Chief, I went to visit my father, and Ms. Chae was there.

294
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,504
When I saw her, I felt my heart drop.

295
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:45,943
- Oh, no! - What?

296
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:47,844
My ear is bleeding.

297
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:50,244
- What? - Am I dying?

298
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:55,754
Can I hang out here for a bit?

299
00:21:57,284 --> 00:21:59,652
It's not like you'll leave if I say no.

300
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:00,984
Exactly.

301
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:03,754
Well, Ms. Chae isn't saying anything.

302
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:07,794
But I should still wait, you know. I am curious.

303
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:11,563
All you talk about is...

304
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:14,334
Chae Yong Ju.

305
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:16,733
How much longer are you going to talk about her?

306
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,044
Come on. Don't be so mean.

307
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:21,504
- Jjuan, let me explain... - My gosh.

308
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:24,113
I am blocking you. You have been blocked.

309
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:27,014
Boss, keep your mouth shut.

310
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:30,084
I tried to hide it,

311
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,283
but I guess Mr. Yoon felt it too.

312
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:36,524
But I must say, I've never seen him so chatty.

313
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:37,823
- I know. - Yes.

314
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,223
All day long, he's like, "Yong Ju." He can't stop talking about you.

315
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:42,264
Oh, boy.

316
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,033
I mean, how did he even live...

317
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:45,663
- before he met Chae Yong Ju? - Right?

318
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:47,334
Exactly.

319
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:49,172
I thought my love,

320
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,034
Jjuan, and I were the only ones in this town...

321
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:55,643
who were brought together by fate.

322
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:04,013
- What are you doing? - You startled us.

323
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:06,324
We're not even curious about you two.

324
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:20,334
Grandma, the man I saved is living a pretty happy life.

325
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,774
It's great, isn't it? Aren't you glad?

326
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:28,344
So, you're okay too. Right, Grandma?

327
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:32,514
I don't need to regret what happened.

328
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:34,683
Right?

329
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,014
(Grandma)

330
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,153
Grandma, I'm sorry I came so late.

331
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,294
But...

332
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:54,663
why do I feel so uneasy?

333
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:58,433
What's wrong?

334
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:02,613
What? Shall we go inside?

335
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,173
I hope the sample turned out nicely.

336
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:17,423
What's the matter now?

337
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,993
(Uilhan Brewery)

338
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:23,193
(Uilhan Brewery)

339
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:27,564
Oh, nice.

340
00:24:28,603 --> 00:24:29,673
(1st sample)

341
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:35,814
(Beer name, brewer, volume, pairing, suggested price)

342
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:42,683
I focused on the aroma while making the first sample.

343
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:44,682
Beers from big brands...

344
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,324
all smell similar.

345
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:48,693
The aroma is either weak,

346
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:51,324
or it's just like any other grainy scent.

347
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:54,724
It is very aromatic, indeed.

348
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:56,734
You must've used premium-quality hops.

349
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:59,933
Of course, it'll smell and taste good if you use good ingredients,

350
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:02,004
but it also means the unit cost will be high.

351
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:04,872
I have to drive on our way back,

352
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:06,304
so I can't taste it.

353
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:09,344
There's a bitter aftertaste, although it's subtle.

354
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:10,873
You have sensitive taste buds.

355
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,044
I'm a supertaster.

356
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,013
The quality is certainly there,

357
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:18,852
but the aroma isn't enough...

358
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:21,183
for us to nail down the concept.

359
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,254
Shall we check out the second sample now?

360
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:26,623
How about we use locally grown hops, rice, and barley...

361
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:29,064
and emphasize that it only contains locally grown ingredients?

362
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,834
There are many beers like that already.

363
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:34,403
I've tried so many beers while traveling across the country.

364
00:25:34,863 --> 00:25:36,933
Then how about we try cold-temperature aging?

365
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:38,632
Then it'll taste smoother.

366
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:40,903
Just from the sounds of it, I can tell the costs will go up.

367
00:25:41,143 --> 00:25:42,774
Like the lemon beer and the grapefruit beer,

368
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:44,573
how about we add a new fruit flavor?

369
00:25:44,574 --> 00:25:46,642
If it's not done well, it's likely to fail...

370
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:48,014
because of the artificial taste.

371
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,553
(Mashing: Crushed, malted grains are soaked...)

372
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:50,852
(in hot water to extract sugars from malt.)

373
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:54,283
(Filtering: After mashing, grain bits are filtered out.)

374
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:57,093
(Hopping: Boil the wort and add hops.)

375
00:25:57,094 --> 00:26:00,993
(Chilling: Chill wort to below 20°C.)

376
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,132
(Yeast and Airlock: Yeast is added...)

377
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,263
(to aid fermentation, and an airlock...)

378
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:04,462
(is installed to monitor the fermentation process.)

379
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,563
(Hydrometer: A hydrometer is used...)

380
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,833
(to check the condition of the yeast and the alcohol percentage.)

381
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:11,833
(Check Additional Ingredients)

382
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:15,643
(Storage in Beer Aging Cellar)

383
00:26:24,653 --> 00:26:27,254
We've done everything we humans could do on our end.

384
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,754
Now, we shall wait, hoping the beer will turn out nicely.

385
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,573
But you two were in different groups in the special forces.

386
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:43,734
How did you two become friends?

387
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:45,504
Right, I was curious too.

388
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:51,544
That's a very important and sensitive issue.

389
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,683
So, we can't really tell you guys.

390
00:26:54,314 --> 00:26:57,353
Well, it's like a state secret.

391
00:27:01,123 --> 00:27:03,753
(1 year earlier)

392
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:06,063
My gosh! Unit 767, the strongest of all.

393
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:07,764
You're working hard to protect our country.

394
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:11,863
Come on. I'm getting used to selling booze now.

395
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:15,233
That's right. Let me know when you're on leave.

396
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,933
I'll buy you all kinds of delicious food.

397
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:19,004
Yes. Solidarity.

398
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,413
"Unit 767, the strongest of all?"

399
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,613
I am not cool with this.

400
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:28,442
How dare she use UDF's nickname?

401
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:29,484
"How dare she?"

402
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:54,474
I'm Oh Chan Hwi.

403
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:56,943
I'm Chae Yong Ju.

404
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:01,844
- I used all my might. - That was our youth.

405
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,623
Goodness. What's with you two?

406
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:07,784
Sure, keep calling it a state secret.

407
00:28:08,024 --> 00:28:09,453
It's so childish that I refuse to hear the rest.

408
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:14,594
It's hot. Do you guys want coffee?

409
00:28:15,463 --> 00:28:16,794
We have to go downtown to get coffee, right?

410
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,103
- You should go since you said it. - What?

411
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:21,834
No! I will go.

412
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:23,673
Because I'm...

413
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:25,702
a cool guy.

414
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,903
(Cool Guy)

415
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:33,014
Hey, I cherish that bike. I never let anyone else use it.

416
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,112
I'll use it in secret since you cherish it so much.

417
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,653
What? You're definitely not using it in secret now.

418
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,453
I found the helmet on my own.

419
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:42,153
I want to ride that too.

420
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:45,324
You've been on that bike.

421
00:28:46,264 --> 00:28:47,294
Me?

422
00:28:48,324 --> 00:28:50,794
Ms. Beautiful Bang, why are you still sitting down?

423
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:52,663
You have to come with me.

424
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:55,974
- Me? Why? - Are you saying I should go alone?

425
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:58,673
How many... One, two, three, four, five.

426
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,974
I need to get five cups of coffee.

427
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:01,673
I only have two hands.

428
00:29:03,974 --> 00:29:05,713
Okay, I'll come with you.

429
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:17,024
I noticed that you had such a happy family.

430
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:19,824
All families are happy. Am I wrong?

431
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:23,463
Some families aren't.

432
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:28,433
So, do you live with the Five Eagles?

433
00:29:29,974 --> 00:29:31,004
No.

434
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:33,274
I live on my own.

435
00:29:33,943 --> 00:29:34,974
The truth is,

436
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:37,373
I've run away from home.

437
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,484
I told you I had a lot of secrets.

438
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:44,953
I guess...

439
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:48,254
I might want to know those secrets.

440
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,724
My gosh. Hey, I heard that!

441
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:55,594
You seem quite interested in me these days.

442
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:58,663
Once you fall for my charms, there's...

443
00:30:07,403 --> 00:30:09,913
There's no way out.

444
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:22,393
Had I not crossed paths with Yoon Min Ju at that moment,

445
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,754
would Grandma's situation have changed?

446
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:27,994
(Grandma)

447
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,093
I missed her call.

448
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,892
Grandma!

449
00:30:30,893 --> 00:30:33,103
Grandma, I'm sorry I came so late.

450
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:41,844
No. What's the point of thinking about this now?

451
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:43,774
It's all in the past now anyway.

452
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:46,883
What are you doing here alone?

453
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:49,853
I just wanted to get some air.

454
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:53,284
Why are you avoiding me?

455
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:57,094
What do you mean? I wasn't avoiding you.

456
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:01,324
I could sense it when I saw you at my dad's place.

457
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:03,594
I thought, "There's something she can't tell me."

458
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:08,363
If you want me to wait until you're ready to talk, I'll wait.

459
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:09,574
So...

460
00:31:10,673 --> 00:31:11,834
don't avoid me.

461
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:14,373
If you avoid me, I will be sad.

462
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:20,213
I feel like you can read my mind even if I try to hide stuff,

463
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:22,584
so I'll just tell you honestly.

464
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:27,183
I have a lot on my mind now.

465
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:29,753
But it has nothing to do with you. It's about me.

466
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:30,853
I just...

467
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,994
Once I sort my thoughts, I will tell you everything.

468
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,234
I won't avoid you, either.

469
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:43,673
Okay.

470
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,474
Yong Ju!

471
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:47,703
Rao has to go back to Seoul now.

472
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:49,173
What?

473
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:54,383
What is it? What's wrong?

474
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:57,514
I just heard that my dad collapsed.

475
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,453
I should go and see him to find out what's going on.

476
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:02,123
But I have to drive. What should I do?

477
00:32:02,693 --> 00:32:04,923
Wait, you drank earlier.

478
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:06,423
Let's take my car.

479
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,724
- Okay. - I'll come with you too.

480
00:32:16,373 --> 00:32:18,873
(Central Surgery Center)

481
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:20,974
Mom.

482
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,314
Rao!

483
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:25,673
What happened?

484
00:32:26,383 --> 00:32:27,814
- Your dad... - Yes.

485
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:30,314
What happened? Tell me.

486
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:32,213
What should we do?

487
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,253
We've confirmed that it's an ischemic stroke.

488
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,554
He will have to undergo emergency surgery now.

489
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,892
Please read this surgery consent form...

490
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,324
and sign it right away.

491
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:45,094
Mom.

492
00:32:48,363 --> 00:32:49,373
Wait.

493
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:56,643
(Authorized Personnel Only)

494
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:03,014
(Pontine hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage)

495
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,023
(Respiratory paralysis could occur.)

496
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:10,224
(Signature)

497
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:17,933
You have to sign the form, Rao.

498
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:20,933
You are his guardian now.

499
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:25,574
Rao.

500
00:33:28,244 --> 00:33:29,274
Shim Rao.

501
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,244
Okay.

502
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,683
(Signature)

503
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:40,584
Thank you.

504
00:33:58,804 --> 00:33:59,844
- Rao. - Yes.

505
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,244
Listen to me carefully, all right?

506
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:06,813
There comes a moment in life...

507
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:10,313
when you suddenly have to become an adult overnight.

508
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:14,883
It's when your parents who you thought would protect you forever...

509
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,023
suddenly collapse.

510
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:25,094
From now on, you should protect your parents.

511
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:29,003
But what can I do? I am not ready for this at all.

512
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:33,844
Even now, I have no idea what to do. What should I do?

513
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:35,773
Can you calm down first?

514
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:37,943
You should not be crying now.

515
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:40,383
Come with me.

516
00:35:02,164 --> 00:35:04,733
It's your dad, so you should get extra large diapers.

517
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:08,873
If you only use regular diapers like these, it'll get expensive.

518
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,442
If you use these...

519
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:12,883
with separate liners, it'll be much more cost-effective.

520
00:35:14,014 --> 00:35:16,184
You're his son,

521
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:18,983
but it'll be embarrassing for him to have you change his diapers for him.

522
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:21,824
Keep that in mind and try to be extra sweet to him...

523
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:23,824
so he won't be too embarrassed.

524
00:35:25,494 --> 00:35:27,264
You see, bedsores can be very scary.

525
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:29,934
Clean his body often to check for new ones.

526
00:35:31,894 --> 00:35:33,764
- I'll wait outside. - Okay.

527
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:36,604
This way.

528
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:41,442
Hospital bills, care expenses, and more.

529
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:43,313
You'll have to pay a lot of bills from now on.

530
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:46,542
Consider using caregivers on weekends.

531
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:48,582
If not, you should be here.

532
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,784
Take that into account too.

533
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:53,183
If you stay here as a caregiver all day,

534
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,523
you'll collapse first.

535
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,192
Care is like running a marathon.

536
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:59,693
- You should be in good condition... - But how do you know...

537
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,664
all of this so well?

538
00:36:04,293 --> 00:36:06,563
Yeah. How do I know all of this?

539
00:36:09,673 --> 00:36:10,733
Mr. Yoon?

540
00:36:11,874 --> 00:36:13,304
Why are you here, Mr. Yoon?

541
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,942
- Gosh... - Mr. Shim Cheol Nam!

542
00:36:14,943 --> 00:36:16,413
We received all the payments for your bills.

543
00:36:16,414 --> 00:36:18,813
What? He is my father.

544
00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:24,514
Have you bought everything already?

545
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,423
CEO Yoon, I truly appreciate that,

546
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:29,854
but I'll handle it myself.

547
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:32,423
It's rather uncomfortable.

548
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:34,893
Honestly, I've no idea when I'll be able to pay you back.

549
00:36:34,894 --> 00:36:35,894
And...

550
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:37,764
That's how it is. I can handle it.

551
00:36:39,503 --> 00:36:42,204
That's exactly how I felt too.

552
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:45,003
"Why would other people help me this much?"

553
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:48,974
"Just leave me alone." This kind of thought, I mean.

554
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,474
But those meddlesome people...

555
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:57,054
made me who I am now.

556
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:00,683
When you're forced into a corner,

557
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,494
you lose control of yourself,

558
00:37:04,253 --> 00:37:05,894
not knowing if you need help now.

559
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,522
People just need...

560
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:10,534
to stretch their arms and say, "I need help."

561
00:37:11,594 --> 00:37:14,003
But they end up harming themselves.

562
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:15,733
Don't make that mistake...

563
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,233
and accept the person offering to help.

564
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:22,244
Then, you'll be able to help someone later, Rao.

565
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:24,543
This is actually nothing.

566
00:37:25,574 --> 00:37:29,713
There will be a lot more you have to go through.

567
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,684
So,

568
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:34,253
cheer up.

569
00:37:35,184 --> 00:37:36,253
Yes.

570
00:37:37,624 --> 00:37:40,224
This is just the beginning. Take a firm stand.

571
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,193
- We can do it. - Yes.

572
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:45,463
I'll gather myself up and take a firm stand.

573
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:47,934
Honestly, I'm not confident...

574
00:37:48,104 --> 00:37:50,003
Can I call you if there's something unclear?

575
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:51,534
- No. - Sorry?

576
00:37:51,773 --> 00:37:54,304
Kidding. Ask whatever.

577
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:56,542
Thank you so much!

578
00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:57,673
Thank you!

579
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:02,184
It's raining.

580
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:05,313
I'll take you home.

581
00:38:05,354 --> 00:38:07,554
That's okay. I can take a taxi.

582
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:11,324
- Please, allow me to do that. - If you want...

583
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:13,494
Okay.

584
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:17,293
Wear my jacket until we get in the car...

585
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,434
What are you waiting for?

586
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,304
I bet she never watches soap operas.

587
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:28,144
I'm coming!

588
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:32,014
Wait for me.

589
00:38:38,454 --> 00:38:39,923
Wherever you go, if possible.

590
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:51,293
Are you okay?

591
00:38:53,604 --> 00:38:55,832
What would make me worried?

592
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,104
I'm just worried about him.

593
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,403
Giving useful tips to Rao means...

594
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:03,273
you've already gone through all of those.

595
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:16,354
You've gone through a lot.

596
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,513
Thanks for the ride.

597
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,383
It must be tough to go back right away.

598
00:39:45,613 --> 00:39:46,753
Hey, the guy!

599
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:48,554
Please come in!

600
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:50,994
To our house?

601
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:56,693
One second.

602
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:59,263
Why did you invite him? He is a busy man.

603
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,104
Just get some water for him.

604
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,333
Water? Okay.

605
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,273
You're the guy!

606
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:09,474
It's nice to meet you.

607
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:11,672
"The guy?"

608
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:13,443
Yes, you're the guy.

609
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:16,354
I've heard a lot about you from her.

610
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:20,523
Did she talk a lot about me?

611
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:23,152
When did I? Please!

612
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:24,494
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

613
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:26,963
- Yong Ju, set the table. - Dinner?

614
00:40:28,063 --> 00:40:31,263
This is so sudden. I'm not sure if we have anything...

615
00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:33,402
Please, let me. I'll help her set it.

616
00:40:33,403 --> 00:40:34,434
Okay.

617
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:55,724
So,

618
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:59,594
what did she mention about me?

619
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,733
You need some water?

620
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:06,963
Please, zip it!

621
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:11,474
- Here. - Thanks.

622
00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:14,273
Well,

623
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:19,112
she usually doesn't drink at home.

624
00:41:19,113 --> 00:41:22,582
- One day... - Stop!

625
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,613
It wasn't anything.

626
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,653
It's not funny at all!

627
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:35,692
Let me help you.

628
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,264
It's okay. I'm used to doing it alone.

629
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:41,863
Then, let me dry the dishes, at least.

630
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:43,733
Would you?

631
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:11,764
Come on!

632
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:13,633
What did I say?

633
00:42:13,804 --> 00:42:16,163
One day, I had a 38-degree fever.

634
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:18,304
So, I was wondering if I should go for a part-time job.

635
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:27,684
I will do it.

636
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,363
I hope...

637
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:44,264
you get along well with her.

638
00:42:45,793 --> 00:42:48,534
I mean, you two spending ordinary days like today.

639
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,344
I've told this...

640
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,974
to no one yet.

641
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:01,883
I like her a lot.

642
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,184
That's why...

643
00:43:06,824 --> 00:43:08,083
I'll be more friendly with her.

644
00:43:11,724 --> 00:43:12,753
I see.

645
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,124
Thanks.

646
00:43:40,383 --> 00:43:42,554
What the heck? When did I go to sleep?

647
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:45,423
Oh, my!

648
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:51,563
I hope he went back well.

649
00:44:01,074 --> 00:44:02,343
The phone is turned off.

650
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:04,644
Transferring to voicemail.

651
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,954
I'm sorry. Because of me...

652
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:21,324
(Last night)

653
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:25,463
Her room is so empty.

654
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:28,963
It's very contrary to what she usually says.

655
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:35,273
What on earth happened to her?

656
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:45,812
- That. - Yes?

657
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:46,854
Over there.

658
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:08,503
The real sad thing about poverty is...

659
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:12,574
that it doesn't give you time to look for the things you like.

660
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:16,784
It prevents Yong Ju from living up to her name.

661
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:22,184
When did this happen?

662
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,954
Six years ago after I collapsed.

663
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,483
Hey!

664
00:45:48,383 --> 00:45:50,813
Hey! What?

665
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:53,284
You can't lose consciousness. Hold on.

666
00:45:58,193 --> 00:45:59,193
(Grandma)

667
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:10,003
(Grandma)

668
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:14,974
Hey.

669
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,414
You're okay.

670
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:27,883
Everything will be okay.

671
00:46:34,894 --> 00:46:35,963
Is this 911?

672
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:41,133
I don't know what made you decide to do this.

673
00:46:41,434 --> 00:46:43,062
Find everything that poses a risk to you,

674
00:46:43,063 --> 00:46:44,204
and protect yourself first.

675
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:47,204
That's how you can be kind to yourself.

676
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:50,474
That's how you can be kind to yourself.

677
00:47:00,883 --> 00:47:03,323
I don't know how to thank you for this.

678
00:47:03,324 --> 00:47:05,594
Well, if you don't mind,

679
00:47:06,554 --> 00:47:08,263
would you give me your bank account number?

680
00:47:08,264 --> 00:47:11,434
No. I just did what I was supposed to do.

681
00:47:18,304 --> 00:47:19,304
(1 missed call)

682
00:47:19,305 --> 00:47:20,804
What? She called me.

683
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:22,943
Grandma.

684
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:26,943
Grandma!

685
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,982
Grandma, what's wrong? Wake up, Grandma!

686
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:32,652
Grandma, what's wrong with you? Oh, no. Grandma.

687
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:36,152
Grandma, please wake up! What's wrong?

688
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,594
Grandma! Can you not hear me?

689
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:41,023
Grandma!

690
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:43,793
(911 Emergency Medical Services)

691
00:47:48,104 --> 00:47:49,764
I was late.

692
00:47:50,074 --> 00:47:52,434
Grandma, I'm sorry I came so late.

693
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:55,773
Grandma...

(Hwikyeong General Hospital)

696
00:48:05,813 --> 00:48:06,853
For cerebral hemorrhages,

697
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:07,982
it's crucial to treat patients within the golden hour,

698
00:48:07,983 --> 00:48:09,624
but she was brought here rather late.

699
00:48:10,193 --> 00:48:12,324
She's bleeding more as we speak.

700
00:48:12,494 --> 00:48:15,164
As you can read in the form, she may experience hemiplegia...

701
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:17,764
or speech impairment after the surgery.

702

(Signature)

703
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:25,333
She blames herself...

704
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:27,673
for what happened to me.

705
00:48:28,344 --> 00:48:30,374
I told her countless times not to do that.

706
00:48:32,374 --> 00:48:33,643
She came home late...

707
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,443
because she was busy saving someone's life.

708
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:31,333
I need to pay for the surgery and rehabilitation.

709
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,403
Right, I'll need a caregiver too.

710
00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:37,644
How much does it cost to hire a caregiver?

711
00:49:41,113 --> 00:49:44,184
It's quite pricey. So the monthly expenses...

712
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:51,054
My paycheck won't even be enough to cover everything.

713
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:05,934
For communications security. Sergeant Kim.

714
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:08,104
Wait. Should I call you by your name now?

715
00:50:09,943 --> 00:50:11,713
Well, I just wanted to ask you...

716
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:15,344
about military discharges.

717
00:50:15,744 --> 00:50:17,514
Gosh, no.

718
00:50:18,113 --> 00:50:20,354
I'm just thinking about it for now.

719
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:22,983
I just had a few questions.

720
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:30,063
Then can I text you some questions I have?

721
00:50:30,733 --> 00:50:32,894
Thank you. Okay.

722
00:50:33,094 --> 00:50:35,204
You told me to protect myself.

00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:38,434
I'll do...

724
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:41,204
whatever it takes to protect myself.

725
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,094
(Off to Germany for his studies, Discharged from the military)

726
00:51:02,394 --> 00:51:06,193
So let's meet again one day.

727
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,374
("Everything I Love Will Make Me Cry")

728
00:51:20,313 --> 00:51:21,483
(Chae Yong Ju's Memory Album)

729
00:51:56,883 --> 00:51:58,054
(Chae Yong Ju's Memory Album)

730
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,454
(This must have been my go-to outfit even as a kid.)

731
00:52:06,994 --> 00:52:08,923
What's so desperate this time around?

732
00:52:08,994 --> 00:52:10,593
Why do you keep saying you're all right?

733
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,962
But you're trying way too hard.

734
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,703
If you keep suppressing them, it will become a habit.

735
00:52:15,704 --> 00:52:18,074
Good job, doing that all on your own.

736
00:52:31,054 --> 00:52:32,954
("Your Name, Youth" by Movning)

737
00:52:43,264 --> 00:52:45,363
It was me who made you give up...

738
00:52:48,863 --> 00:52:49,963
on living your life.

739
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:20,164
- Grandma. - Yes?

740
00:53:21,104 --> 00:53:22,164
I don't...

741
00:53:24,673 --> 00:53:26,903
regret my decision back then.

742
00:53:34,443 --> 00:53:36,443
I feel awful for saying this to you.

743
00:53:38,784 --> 00:53:39,813
But...

744
00:53:41,753 --> 00:53:43,854
I decided not to regret it.

745
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:46,454
That's right.

746
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,693
Who cares about what happened in the past?

747
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:51,764
The past is the past.

748
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:55,333
If the past keeps dragging you down,

749
00:53:55,604 --> 00:53:57,574
just grab it and kick it aside.

750
00:53:57,704 --> 00:54:00,403
Why are you acting so timid? That's not very like you.

751
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,523
- I'll be off. - Don't be afraid.

752
00:54:17,923 --> 00:54:19,894
You bet. I'm your granddaughter.

753
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:42,983
Why are they all standing outside?

754
00:54:43,184 --> 00:54:44,184
Gosh, what do we do?

755
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:46,353
- I can't believe this happened. - My goodness.

756
00:54:46,354 --> 00:54:48,582
- Right. - Seriously. Did someone go up?

757
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:51,422
- What? Oh, my. - No way. Why would anyone do that?

758
00:54:51,423 --> 00:54:52,953
- Why would anyone go up there... - My goodness.

759
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:54,462
- so early in the morning? - Right.

760
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,993
- Hello. - My goodness.

761
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,732
- Hey. - What's going on?

762
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:00,163
They received a report...

763
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:02,562
regarding a distress situation from the mountain.

764
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:05,073
It rained so much last night.

765
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:07,033
And there must've been a landslide from the downpour.

766
00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:10,304
Someone clueless must've gone up and gotten into an accident.

767
00:55:10,813 --> 00:55:12,414
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

768
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:14,743
- There it goes. Good grief. - Really?

769
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,414
- Two ambulances? - There are two ambulances?

770
00:55:16,744 --> 00:55:19,453
- Two? - I hope it's nothing serious.

771
00:55:19,454 --> 00:55:21,422
One, two. This is the village chief.

772
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:23,522
I got a call from the fire department.

773
00:55:23,523 --> 00:55:25,093
They received a report about a distress situation...

774
00:55:25,094 --> 00:55:26,323
from the mountain.

775
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:27,692
It was a man's voice.

776
00:55:27,693 --> 00:55:29,692
His phone got turned off in the middle of a call.

777
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,933
Everyone should check if their family is all right.

778
00:55:31,934 --> 00:55:33,232
- A man's voice? - That's all.

779
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:34,933
- So his phone isn't working. - What?

780
00:55:34,934 --> 00:55:37,232
- Everyone, check on your family. - What about Mr. Yoon?

781
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,232
Mr. Yoon? Oh, my.

782
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:41,042
Come to think of it, we didn't see him today.

783
00:55:41,043 --> 00:55:42,402
No way.

784
00:55:42,403 --> 00:55:43,874
He's probably sleeping.

785
00:55:44,443 --> 00:55:46,474
I'm sure he's home.

786
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:48,542
- Has anyone seen him? - He must be home.

787
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:49,882
The phone is turned off.

788
00:55:49,883 --> 00:55:51,914
- His phone is turned off. - Transferring to voicemail.

789
00:55:52,454 --> 00:55:55,383
- No way. - There's no way.

790
00:55:55,624 --> 00:55:57,153
- Right. - No way.

791
00:55:57,824 --> 00:55:59,453
- My gosh. - He didn't answer his phone.

792
00:55:59,454 --> 00:56:01,224
- Goodness. - Who would go to the mountain?

793
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,333
My gosh.

794
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:06,994
- Where's Mr. Yoon? - What?

795
00:56:08,104 --> 00:56:09,933
- He's not here. - Where did he go?

796
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:12,232
He said he needed to sort out some things,

797
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:13,874
so he grabbed some camping tools and went out.

798
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:16,503
- He asked me to feed Photo. - Camping tools?

799
00:56:17,673 --> 00:56:18,773
It can't be.

800
00:56:19,644 --> 00:56:20,684
My gosh.

801
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:23,713
What?

802
00:56:32,293 --> 00:56:33,693
Mr. Yoon!

803
00:56:34,594 --> 00:56:36,324
Mr. Yoon Min Ju!

804
00:56:43,003 --> 00:56:44,673
Mr. Yoon Min Ju!

805
00:56:46,934 --> 00:56:48,003
Darn it.

806
00:57:02,224 --> 00:57:04,324
Where on earth is he?

807
00:57:12,664 --> 00:57:13,733
What?

808
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,934
Is he...

809
00:57:25,273 --> 00:57:26,974
Were you really camping here?

810
00:57:27,613 --> 00:57:28,684
Hey.

811
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,213
"Hey?"

812
00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:34,653
Did you know I looked everywhere for you?

813
00:57:36,284 --> 00:57:37,324
The cut...

814
00:57:38,253 --> 00:57:39,854
You're hurt.

815
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:41,624
How could you just disappear...

816
00:57:41,693 --> 00:57:43,494
after leaving a note saying you're sorry?

817
00:57:44,034 --> 00:57:46,263
I came here to see you, but there was a distress situation.

818
00:57:46,264 --> 00:57:47,832
And you were nowhere to be seen.

819
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:49,664
All kinds of thoughts crossed my mind. Seriously.

820
00:57:51,104 --> 00:57:52,304
Remember what I told you?

821
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:56,543
It wasn't about you. This was about me.

822
00:57:58,173 --> 00:58:01,383
If I were to go back in time...

823
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,613
and relive the same situation all over again,

824
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:06,284
I would still save you.

825
00:58:07,653 --> 00:58:09,423
I would save you, Mr. Yoon.

826
00:58:09,824 --> 00:58:11,523
So don't avoid me.

827
00:58:11,724 --> 00:58:14,463
Don't disappear like this.

828
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:20,903
I'm sorry for making you worry.

829
00:58:22,003 --> 00:58:23,034
But...

830
00:58:24,474 --> 00:58:25,833
I didn't disappear.

831
00:58:28,644 --> 00:58:30,503
I needed time to think too.

832
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:33,414
I kept feeling responsible...

833
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,713
for what happened to your grandmother too.

834
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,653
But I needed time to think.

835
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:41,624
To figure out a way to be with you despite what happened...

836
00:58:42,023 --> 00:58:43,483
instead of avoiding it.

837
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:48,394
Then you should have told me so.

838
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:52,393
You turned off your phone. And you only left a note...

839
00:58:52,394 --> 00:58:54,903
I'm sorry about that too.

840
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,433
But how did you hurt your forehead? Are you okay?

841
00:58:59,434 --> 00:59:02,543
I'm not okay! I'm not...

842
00:59:05,144 --> 00:59:06,813
I'm not okay at all.

843
00:59:09,184 --> 00:59:10,313
You see,

844
00:59:11,383 --> 00:59:15,624
no one had ever asked me if I was okay.

845
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:17,723
And that had never been a problem for me.

846
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:21,594
But ever since I met you, you kept asking me if I was okay.

847
00:59:22,324 --> 00:59:25,293
You made me question if I was really okay...

848
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:27,664
or not.

849
00:59:29,034 --> 00:59:31,204
"I see. I'm not okay right now."

850
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,474
"I'm hurting right now."

851
00:59:37,144 --> 00:59:38,874
I have these thoughts now.

852
00:59:39,673 --> 00:59:42,184
Look what I've become because of you.

853
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:02,604
I will...

854
01:00:04,074 --> 01:00:07,574
never leave you.

855
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:45,304
(Brewing Love)

856
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:47,374
You're giving the villagers the wrong idea.

857
01:01:47,434 --> 01:01:50,103
- You said you would wait. - Yes, I'm waiting.

858
01:01:50,104 --> 01:01:51,942
This is confusing. I'm shutting you out!

859
01:01:51,943 --> 01:01:54,844
It's been a while, my dear ex-boyfriend.

860
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:56,684
"Ex-boyfriend?"

861
01:01:56,744 --> 01:01:59,613
She looks especially beautiful today.

862
01:02:00,014 --> 01:02:02,684
- What's your favorite dish? - Toasts.

863
01:02:02,883 --> 01:02:05,353
I'd rather see the new product fail...

864
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,193
than see the Marketing Team succeed.

865
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,522
To make up for the time you spent not being yourself,

866
01:02:09,523 --> 01:02:12,264
I'm going to find everything you like.
