(Brewing Love)

00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:35,139
(This is a work of fiction.)

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,178
(Scenes with child actors and animals were filmed...)

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,179
(under production guidelines along with experts.)

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,970
Hold on.

15
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,679
Didn't you say you'd wait?

16
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:10,009
I was doing just that.

17
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,020
Who waits for a meeting right in front of someone's nose?

18
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:18,148
What's going on? Is this a romance flick?

19
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:20,588
Should we give you some privacy?

20
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:23,788
If you stand around like that, who will trim the weed...

21
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,789
that keeps growing despite being cut down daily?

22
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:28,159
You're bothering the ladies.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,360
Come on.

24
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:34,100
Hold on a second.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,699
Why are you picking up a sickle?

26
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,808
How can I sit around...

27
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:39,808
and let the ladies work alone in this heat under the blazing sun?

28
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,780
- I should help. - Hold on.

29
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,550
Don't do this. To be honest,

30
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:49,118
you blatantly trying to kiss up to me won't work.

31
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,350
Who's trying to kiss up to whom?

32
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:56,288
It's true that I'm lurking around your property...

33
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,088
hoping to strike a deal with you,

34
00:01:58,089 --> 00:02:00,059
but this isn't me trying to score points.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,199
One should help those in need.

36
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,238
But... Weeds are no joke.

37
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,339
It isn't easy to work with a sickle.

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,970
You can get hurt. Hold on!

39
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,880
The two of them are like water and oil.

40
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,410
Tell me about it.

41
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,749
However, opposites attract.

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,418
- What on earth? - What?

43
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,120
- Come on. - What about it?

44
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,189
(Episode 3)

45
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,259
Goodness.

46
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,759
I'm good with sickle and shovels.

47
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,299
If I think about all that shoveling I did in Mount Baekma...

48
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,829
That'll be all.

49
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:43,499
Boss. Hire Chae Yong Ju as a part-time worker.

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,609
She used to be in the special task force.

51
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,079
No. No way.

52
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,109
I'll call the part-timer I already have.

53
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:54,680
Goodness.

54
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:58,949
Chan Hwi, it's me. Can you work a shift today?

55
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,090
You can't?

56
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,759
No, it's all right.

57
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,430
It seems as though I should stay, right?

58
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:13,829
Sure.

59
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,210
Oh Chan Hwi, cleared.

60
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,849
(Brewing Love)

61
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,078
(Hwi's Toast)

62
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,079
Chae Yong Ju.

63
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,419
I had to turn down that part-time gig for her,

64
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:33,519
but she's not even at the office.

65
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,989
What is she even up to?

66
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,690
I should just head back.

67
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,030
(Hwi's Toast)

68
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,160
I'll be back.

69
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:50,269
Wait.

70
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,139
What was her name again?

71
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,280
Ye Ppeum?

72
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,519
Yi Ppeum?

73
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,220
I got it. Ah Reum as in beautiful.

74
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,090
What the...

75
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,858
- What was that? - Did you hear that?

76
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,359
- No way. - That was weird.

77
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:23,600
Why...

78
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,169
Why did I turn away?

79
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,320
Since I'm here, maybe I should stay the day.

80
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,989
Clinging onto Yoon Min Ju in the hope of striking a deal...

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,760
is hopeless.

82
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,330
What I need the most right now is...

83
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,239
intel.

84
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,140
Yoon Min Ju.

85
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,979
Tell me who you are.

86
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:09,378
That's just how it is.

87
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,589
- Is that so? - I mean it.

88
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,418
It's driving me crazy. You see, the other day...

89
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,260
Loud noises often trigger headaches for him.

90
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,530
Unbelievable.

91
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,030
What happened there?

92
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,770
It's nothing.

93
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:29,600
Physical contact makes him uneasy.

94
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,979
He can't stand anything rubbing against his skin...

95
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:38,609
and cuts off the tags on his clothes.

96
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,850
That's why most of his shirts have holes in them.

97
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:49,359
Yoon Min Ju...

98
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,359
is highly sensitive.

99
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,890
Goodness, thank you.

100
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,858
- Good work, everyone. - Good work.

101
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:58,529
- You all did well. - How about a drink?

102
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,530
Sure.

103
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,839
Goodness me. Look at her working hard.

104
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,509
Even the weeds will stay away at the sight of her.

105
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,640
Sure.

106
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,749
That's it.

107
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,629
Pace yourself. You don't want a heatstroke.

108
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:29,928
It's fine. My working more means more time for the ladies to rest.

109
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:31,570
I should work hard while I'm at it.

110
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:34,600
Why bother working so hard when it'll go unnoticed?

111
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,439
That's not why I'm doing this.

112
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,379
Is that perhaps for me?

113
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,010
- Yes. - Nice.

114
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,820
- What... - Wait!

115
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,748
Darn. Seriously?

116
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:22,679
Did you see my core strength?

117
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,789
There's no falling for me. Nice!

118
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:31,260
How can I send her packing?

119
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,830
Are you okay?

120
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,429
Goodness.

121
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,269
He's fine!

122
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,238
Kicking his knees against something is a pastime of his.

123
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:47,640
He's one to often leave his wits at home.

124
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,850
I usually have a lot on my mind.

125
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,979
Let's grab some lunch.

126
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,760
Yoon Min Ju often walks into things.

127
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,298
What? But it's not lunch hour.

128
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:09,359
Sorry?

129
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,169
Goodness.

130
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:14,469
Since it's a hot day, let's call it a wrap early.

131
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,168
I'm sure you'll be EAT like always...

132
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,570
as in "eating alone today."

133
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,169
How come you're still asking that after all this time?

134
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:22,979
- You sure are persistent. - I know.

135
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
I'll eat alone.

136
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:26,950
- What about you, Ms. Chae... - Goodness.

137
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,720
Don't mind me. I'll grab lunch where I can.

138
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,920
Sure. Enjoy your lunch, then.

139
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,300
Isn't this unreasonable?

140
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,570
You have to eat outside in the sun,

141
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,479
but he's heading home to eat indoors in a cooler space.

142
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,710
No one said anything about eating out in the sun.

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,180
I'm exhausted, oh, wild bee

144
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,219
Come with us if you want.

145
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,519
We'll take you to a place that will surprise you.

146
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,629
Here.

147
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,899
Open sesame!

148
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:24,909
Gosh, it's so cool in here.

149
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,779
No way.

150
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,879
You could even live in here!

151
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,710
Are you seriously surprised by this?

152
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,119
This is what we're entitled to.

153
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,518
Said by our boss.

154
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,259
So go ahead and relax.

155
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:25,229
Yoon Min Ju takes good care of his employees.

156
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,499
I hardly expected this from him.

157
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:37,180
Gosh, my head.

158
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:39,580
I'm all out of sorts.

159
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,590
One should help those in need.

160
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,859
That's not why I'm doing this.

161
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,129
Photo, there are such kinds of people.

162
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,470
Those who give their all to help others...

163
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,369
but fail to look after themselves.

164
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,210
People who don't know how to take care...

165
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,379
of themselves.

166
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:12,509
It makes me uncomfortable...

167
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,379
to see her.

168
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:19,749
This won't do. I'll send her home this afternoon.

169
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,619
I should put an end to this. Right?

170
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,999
Hey, why won't you believe me?

171
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,899
I can be cold-hearted when I need to be.

(Jisang Liquor)

173
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,210
She went to see him once again.

174
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:41,379
She really isn't the average person.

175
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,509
Highly ambitious is what she is.

176
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,749
I just hope her actions don't backfire on me in any way.

- Did you call for me? - Bang Ah Reum.

180
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,799
Why are you at the office?

181
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,469
Ms. Chae of the Marketing Team...

182
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,599
is out there trying to sign a deal with Yoon Min Ju.

183
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,269
In my opinion,

184
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,040
there's no chance of him working with us.

185
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,738
So instead, I put together...

186
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,209
a list of breweries we can merge with...

187
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,249
- that are similar to his... - Bang Ah Reum.

188
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,450
Who are you to make that judgment call?

189
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,549
Do you know why we're putting everything on the line...

190
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,820
for a nobody like Yoon Min Ju?

191
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,320
Because the chairman...

192
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,119
of Jisang Liquor wants him on board!

193
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,529
That's why we must lay down our lives for this.

194
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,499
Or we'll get the boot.

195
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,869
Don't make me compare you to Chae Yong Ju.

196
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,440
Yoon Min Ju.

197
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:49,940
- I'll meet with him again. - Bring him here.

198
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:51,180
We're running out of time.

199
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,479
Yes, sir.

200
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,290
He didn't even read what I put together all night.

201
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,659
How am I supposed to persuade Yoon Min Ju?

202
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,930
Strike that. I must get it done.

203
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,100
I only have one year left.

204
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,769
That darn little twerp.

205
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,239
Ah Reum.

206
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,509
- Yes? - Did you get an earful?

207
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:24,479
Of course not. It wasn't enough to faze me.

208
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,920
We never doubted you.

209
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,690
Would you like to join us for lunch?

210
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,118
Go ahead without me.

211
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:35,790
I'm having a salad anyway.

212
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,389

234
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,529

237
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,350
I can't believe you.

238
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,779
I mean it.

239
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,029
Do you want another?

240
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,639
Hey, Grandma.

241
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,609
I'm working.

242
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,479
Have you eaten?

243
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
And your medicine?

244
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,389
You still have a lot left. Are you sure you're taking them?

245
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:23,319
Grandma, I can't be there to manage everything.

246
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,518
You have to...

247
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,529
Hello?

248
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,759
You always hang up when you know you're in the wrong.

249
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,629
Unbelievable.

250
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,070
It's really hot in here.

251
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,649
Thanks for that.

252
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,920
Why are you here alone?

253

Where are the ladies?

254
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,489
It's hot outside, so I told them to rest longer in the den.

255
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:00,729
Right. I knew it.

256
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,060
It must be just you and your grandmother.

257
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,669
How did you know that?

258
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,639
You said you always couldn't manage her medicine intake...

259
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,340
which means you're the only one she has.

260
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:14,770
How perceptive of you.

261
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:19,079

262
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,780
nothing beats a cold cup of iced Americano...

263
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:24,820
That's so sweet of you!

264
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:27,719
Thank you so much.

265
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,490
This is more acidic...

266
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:32,260
Acidic, what?

267
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,100
- That brought me back to life. - Forget it.

268

- No way. - How's the injury you suffered?

273
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,609
It's fine now...

274
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,609
That reminds me. How did you know that?

275
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,148
I never told anyone.

276
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,678
You're the first person to ask about it.

277
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,790
Well...

278
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:02,790

280

Wait.

281
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:16,969
Thanks.

282
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,409
- Here. - Thank you!

283
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,260
Tie your hair with this.

284
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,459
Wait. Sorry.

285
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:41,490
Should I tie it back for you?

286
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:44,600
- Would that be possible? - Yes.

287
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,469
Thank you.

288

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,719
How did you know to bring a rubber band?

290
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,949
That was all I had to tie hair.

291
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:07,350
The yellow rubber band.

292
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:11,490
It hurts when letting down your hair.

293
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,989
Also, it makes you lose your hair too.

294
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,260
You know a lot of things.

295
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,969
By the way, how did you know about all this stuff?

296
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:24,600
I'd die for some coffee.

297
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,739
Ma'am, what kind of coffee do you like?

298
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,280
I prefer men like this guy...

299
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:31,108

- That's not... - Goodness. What should I do?

324

That's a misunderstanding. It was...

325
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,688
My hands were dirty, so I needed help...

326
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:53,529
Didn't you tell us she was prohibited from entering here?

327

328

- gently touching her like this? - Sure!

331
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,240
I should put an end to this.

333
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,379
Ms. Chae,

334
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,480
I would like for you to leave here now.

335
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,790

336
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,689
I feel uncomfortable.

337
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,260
I feel uncomfortable whenever you see me.

338
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,399
But I told you I wasn't doing this to impress you.

339
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,329
Is it because you just can't stand seeing me?

340
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,799
I can't be that bad.

341

You're the worst.

You're the worst of the worst.

345

I'm leaving, then. For now.

346
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,189
This isn't how I wanted to send her away.

347

I'm the only one who thinks this is unjust?

348
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:03,399
Is that your way to block all the people around you?

Chief,

367
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,908
how much Naro draft beer is left inside this keg?

368
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:23,010
You mean now?

369
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,939
Let's see.

370
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,179
This keg can hold 20 liters of beer.

371
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,689
- I think it's still half full. - Then, there's about ten liters.

372
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:38,560
Take a seat over there. Will a 500ml glass be enough?

373
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:41,759
No, give me a ten liters, please.

374
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,799
(10 liters?)

375
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,830
What?

377
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,080
Here. Here you go.

(Uilhan Pub)

379
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,399
I guess she'll really drink all the beer here.

380
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:27,109
Yoon Min Ju can't stand the sight of me.

381
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:32,550
Then, I can make him come over to see me!

(17th Village Chief of Baegok-ri, Very Nice Man)

383
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
CEO Yoon, you better answer my call now.

384
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,369
Answer the phone.

385
00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:00,240
- Yes, Chief? - CEO Yoon!

386
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,739
She's beyond your imagination!

387
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
Sorry?

(Uilhan Brewery)

389
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,309
Darn it, Chae Yong Ju.

390
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,879
It's a never-ending story!

391
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,560
- What was that? - You tell me.

392
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:31,040
You drank it all.

393
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,439
There's nothing left now.

394
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,510
So, please leave now.

395
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,709
- What did I do wrong? - Chief.

396
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,878
Originally, I used to work as a saleswoman...

397
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:43,419
in Busan for a long time.

398
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:47,449
Baekmok Liquor had a dominant power in Busan.

399
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:51,820
So, it was very hard to sell our products in pubs and bars.

400
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:54,859
So, whatever we produced, we couldn't sell any of it.

401
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,270
At that moment, I came up with an idea...

402
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,539
It's too much. Are you sure you guys can drink all?

403
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,770
Sure, owner.

404
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,138
We Jisang Liquor are all thirsty souls.

405
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:10,579
So, please take our beer and just show it to your customers.

406
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,779
If they don't sell, we'll drink it all! Right?

407
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,719
- That's right! - That's right!

408
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,520
Please give me another.

409
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,060
I used to drink a lot back then.

410
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:24,919
Those were the times.

411
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:29,899
I'll save our colleagues...

412
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,469
no matter what.

413
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,879
I'll make sure they're fine!

414
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,350
How about you save me first?

415
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,290
Darn it. Why isn't he here yet?

416
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,619
You...

417
00:26:58,189 --> 00:27:00,560
Why are you just standing there?

418
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:02,330
What took you so long?

419
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,159
- I'm leaving now. - Please, wait.

420
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,599
She and I just don't see eye to eye.

421
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,168
Wait, so you're leaving?

422
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:13,739
It's even worse for me.

423
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,580
- So what? Deal with it! No! - No, wait.

424
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,649
She's really something. She really is.

00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:29,560
Oh, no! I'm so forgetful.

Whatever.

433
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,189
Let me ask you just one straightforward question.

434
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,429
Why is it that you can't even stand the sight of me?

435
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,060
You see, I'm...

436
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:14,730
Never mind.

437
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,270
I know you're trying.

438
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:23,980
But...

439
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,580
you're trying way too hard.

440
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:35,659
How did you know?

441
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,219
You treat your job like your entire life, don't you?

442
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,060
And you try to help others with everything.

443
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,029
You were in the special forces, so you'll try...

444
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,629
to protect your employer like they're your country,

445
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:46,000
but don't do that.

446
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,270
It'll only eat away at you,

447
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,439
without you even realizing it.

448
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:54,270
Are you all right?

449
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:05,718
I told you. You're not okay.

450
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:08,590
Feelings don't vanish on their own. They'll keep piling up like this.

451
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,819
They'll fester and eventually explode.

452
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,520
Should I tell you what would happen after that?

453
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,399
Hey.

454
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,600

She can keep her posture even while dozing off.

457

She keeps her guard up even when she sleeps.

458
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,219
Why is she trying this hard?

459
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,139

- More? - Yes.

- It's downhill this way, - Yes.

471

- and it's uphill this way. - Right.

472
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,580
It's a slope, so it's naturally higher on one side.

- Come on up. Let's go. - Goodness! He always does this.

00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,869
Can't you move here?

544
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,439
Well, shall I just live here, then?

545
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,639
That'd be so amazing!

546
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,770
I'm expensive though.

547
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:31,809
That woman looks familiar.

548
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,008
Wasn't that the young lady who got drunk, blacked out,

549
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:36,249
and slept like a log earlier?

550
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,849
Why is she showing up everywhere?

551
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,150
Can she teleport herself?

552
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,619
- That hearty laugh. - Oh, how's it going?

553
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:45,219
Not well.

554
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,630
- My gosh, Chae Yong Ju... - What is it?

555
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,959
Wait! This beer festival.

556
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,830
I heard you organized this, Mr. Yoon.

557
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,829
I know. It's hard to imagine, knowing his personality.

558
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,100
But he really was the biggest contributor!

559
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:03,009
Are you pretending you didn't hear us even though you're proud?

560
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:04,579
Why can't you just say it?

561
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,979
"I organized this festival."

562
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,979
Why can't you say that?

563
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,819
Just say it, sweetheart!

564
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,049
My goodness. That's enough, all right?

565
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,360
Well, I should hurry up and make hop wreath samples.

566
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,329
- Oh, I'll help you! - No, I politely decline.

567
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,199
- Please, let me help. - No, it's really fine.

568
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,999
- Anyway, aren't you hungover? - What?

569
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,600
Who drinks ten liters of beer at once?

570
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:31,599
- I do! I'm totally fine. - No, wait!

571
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,138
I think she's our only option if we want to make it work in one blow.

572
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:38,209
Yes. Let's send them to the valley of love...

573
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,210
where they'll enter as two people and exit as a family of three.

574
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:44,850
Shoot.

575
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,319
Oh, this looks nice.

576
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,520
Well, this is pretty.

577
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:53,960
Does this look all right?

578
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:04,170
Oh, okay.

579
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:09,778
What is this? My gosh!

580
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:11,480
What are you doing?

581
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,279
Why? What is this about?

582
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,649
My goodness. What is this about? I can walk.

583
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,718
Goodness. You ladies are very strong.

584
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,719
You need to seal the deal with our boss, don't you?

585
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,089
Shall we step in and help you?

586
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,190
- Do you have a good idea? - Yes.

587
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,859
Go into the woods and get some Fischer's ragwort.

588
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,489
- Oh, Fischer's ragwort? - Yes.

589
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,798
Okay, but why do you need Fischer's ragwort all of a sudden?

590
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,529
You can only find them until June. Am I wrong?

591
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,230
How do you know that?

592
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,298
- Attention! - Yes.

593
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:38,900
Fischer's ragwort is an excuse.

594
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,439
Excuse!

595
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,369
Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to say. All right.

596
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,939
- Okay. - We'll handle the rest.

597
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,650
- Now, off you go! - Okay, I'll go now. All right.

598
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:51,449
Good. She's gone. Moving on to our next target.

599
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,190
How is this supposed to help me?

600
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,489
My gosh.

601
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,690
Seriously, how many times have I been kicked out?

602
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:05,029
This really isn't easy.

603
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,630
Fischer's ragwort? What is going on?

604
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:10,100
Hey, why are you here? Oh, my.

605
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,069
My goodness.

606
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,339
Nice, score!

607
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:23,150
Where have you been? You were gone for a while.

608
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:24,719
I made these all by myself.

609
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Boss.

610
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:29,489
Hurry up and go into that mountain in the back, okay?

611
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,318
- The mountain in the back? - Yes.

612
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:34,658
We sent Chae Yong Ju there and told her...

613
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:36,400
to get some Fischer's ragwort.

614
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,100
But the thing is, we can't reach her now.

615
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,699
It'll get dark very soon in the mountains.

616
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,209
And you know, wild boars have been sighted there.

617
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,508
- Yes. - What if something bad happens?

618
00:37:49,509 --> 00:37:51,738
Oh, well. Don't you worry.

619
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,880
She'll beat wild boars too. She's like a human weapon.

620
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,178
Fine. Even if she gets eaten alive by wild boars,

621
00:37:58,179 --> 00:37:59,919
I don't care!

622
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,959
- Yes, let's not worry. - That's right.

623
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,818
- The worst is death anyway. - In that mountain, she will die.

624
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:10,928
But I heard her grandmother was the only family she had.

625
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:14,368
- What do we do? - Oh, no. I don't know what to do.

626
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:16,269
I don't know either. My goodness.

627
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,100
Oh, no. What should we do?

628
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,778
Oh, dear. This is bad.

629
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:26,480
Her grandmother will be so worried.

630
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,020
- Nice. - Why is it that...

631
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,988
- What? - you ladies suddenly sent...

632
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:35,519
Chae Yong Ju and Yoon Min Ju to that mountain?

633
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,719
Well...

634
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Don't tell me...

635
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,960
Are you hoping they'd end up together?

636
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:44,399
Goodness. What is with you?

637
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,699
Can you ladies not see?

638
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,068
At a glance, I can tell they're not compatible.

639
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:51,839
They're like polar opposites. My goodness.

640
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,138
You ladies are clueless, seriously.

641
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:57,838
- You really know nothing. Oh, boy. - Sure.

642
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,449
No, that's not going to work. Goodness, these people.

643
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,519
- Hey, can't you... - No wonder he's still single.

644
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,049
- He's a good man though. - Yes, he is.

645
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:17,630
Where did she go?

646
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,110
Ms. Chae Yong Ju!

647
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,119
I hope she didn't fall or roll down the side.

648
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,960
Darn, they fooled me again.

649
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,159
Those ladies are definitely up to something.

650
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,699
I can't see a thing.

651
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,739
Did something really happen to her?

652
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,980
What's that?

653
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,279
What?

654
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:13,589
Oh! Hi!

655
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:16,920
What... My gosh.

656
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,589
Is this "I Am a Natural Person," the TV show?

657
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,988
What are you doing here?

658
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:24,059
Well, I'm trying to start a fire.

659
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,698
I was so busy picking herbs that I didn't realize it'd gotten so dark.

660
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,169
My phone battery died, so I'm just going to sleep here...

661
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,838
and descend when the sun comes up in the morning.

662
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:33,469
You're going to sleep here? Wait, you will sleep here?

663
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:37,279
That's not something you should say so naturally, is it?

664
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,150
Isn't it pretty nice here?

665
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,179
Well, I thought I could manage without a fire,

666
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,080
but I guess it's colder in the mountains.

667
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,020
You want to start a fire?

668
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,459
Well, I'll do it.

669
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,529
- Do you have a lighter? - No.

670
00:40:56,029 --> 00:40:59,699
Then what? Are you going to rub branches together to start a fire?

671
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,900
Do you think that's easy? Your wrists will hurt like crazy.

672
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,810
Everyone carries a fire striker around, you know.

673
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,469
Who does that?

674
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:11,380
Just kidding.

675
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:13,009
All right.

676
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,290
- Oh, my. - There.

677
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:22,690
What?

678
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:27,729
These days, the sun rises at around 5am,

679
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,899
so let's stay here for a bit and start heading down soon.

680
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,429
If you try to descend now, you'll sprain your ankle as it's so dark.

681
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,869
Okay.

682
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,940
Hold on. I'm just realizing I haven't heard your answer yet.

683
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:43,178
So? Why is it that you just can't stand me?

684
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:44,239
Wait.

685
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,609
You didn't hear my answer because you fell asleep.

686
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,619
Fine.

687
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,650
Just go ahead and tell me honestly now.

688
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:54,419
What is the reason?

689
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,360
I hate feeling uncomfortable like this.

690
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,298
Why aren't you saying anything?

691
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:11,169
Are you mad at me about something?

692
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,568
If you're mad at me, let it out and yell at me.

693
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:14,138
I'd much prefer that.

694
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:16,509
- That way, we can talk it out. - You should...

695
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,509
breathe.

696
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:22,480
You're too worked up right now.

697
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,679
We can't talk if you're like this.

698
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:34,089
Now,

699
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,799
can I talk?

700
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:39,830
Yes.

701
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,440
Telling others to just let out their anger and let it go...

702
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,810
could make some people uncomfortable.

703
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,639
Some people can express their anger and let it go,

704
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:52,239
but there are also people...

705
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:54,109
who really struggle to return to their daily life...

706
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,949
when they let themselves get angry.

707
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,520
And for some people, that's more painful.

708
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:02,989
I'm one of those people.

709
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:10,659
I should've been more thoughtful.

710
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,560
I'm sorry.

711
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,299
I've never been mad at you.

712
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,969
And I never hated you.

713
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,110
It's just that when I see you...

714
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,549
I'm reminded of my old self. That's all.

715
00:43:32,549 --> 00:43:35,119
If my discomfort made you uncomfortable as well,

716
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:36,889
I apologize.

717
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,259
No, well...

718
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,259
You don't need to apologize.

719
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,869
I'm surprised that you get flustered too.

720
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,839
What? I'm not flustered.

721
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,110
When I was young,

722
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:02,210
what I heard the most was...

723
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,420
"Why are you so sensitive? Man up."

724
00:44:05,549 --> 00:44:06,750
I heard that the most.

725
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:10,560
My dad was a soldier.

726
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
What?

727
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:17,159
Well, he wanted his son to be manly, like most dads would,

728
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,369
but as you can see... He ended up with a son...

729
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,969
who cried at anything and everything.

730
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:29,839
He wanted me to climb as high as I could no matter what I did,

731
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,239
and he wanted me to be at the center of it all.

732
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:36,520
But in reality, I was like a solitary island.

733
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:41,150
I isolated myself because I couldn't even be normal,

734
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:43,759
like a strange solitary island.

735
00:44:57,469 --> 00:44:59,468
I didn't bring the supplies.

736
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:00,809
I'll get scolded, right?

737
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,540
I'll help you, so don't be upset.

738
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:07,449
Thanks.

739
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,259
Hey, can you help me with this?

740
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:19,388
Hey. You stopped caring about me.

741
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:20,630
That's hurting my feelings.

742
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:22,488
Okay.

743
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:24,600
I'll help you. Don't be so upset.

744
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,770
Thanks.

745
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,449
Why am I...

746
00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:49,960
different from other people?

747
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,190
Everyone is different.

748
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:55,960
Why would you want to be like everyone else?

749
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:39,299
How much longer will you keep crying like that?

750
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,170
Stop it.

751
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,699
When I look at you,

752
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,810
you remind me of the son my father wanted me to be.

753
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,310
Your military boots...

754
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:25,619
keep dragging me back to my past.

755
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,739
I can never anticipate your next move.

756
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:55,710
May I hold your hand?

757
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,219
I mean, it's just a handshake.

758
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,389
To comfort me?

759
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,900
You're not a weirdo. It just means you're a kind person.

760
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:19,540
Being kind isn't an easy feat.

761
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:21,669
Your willingness to help others...

762
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,940
knowing your kindness wouldn't be reciprocated...

763
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,080
Not everyone can do that.

764
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,350
How long...

765
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:35,250
did it take for him to be able to tell...

766
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:38,190
his story this calmly?

767
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,029
So are you happy now?

768
00:48:49,569 --> 00:48:50,600
Well,

769
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,369
my life isn't so bad.

770
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,980
Well, someone saved my life six years ago.

771
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,049
Hey!

772
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,089
You're okay.

773
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,690
Everything will be okay.

774
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,290
I can't remember anything about that person...

775
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:17,230
except for...

776
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,170
what that person said to me.

777
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:25,839
I should block out everything...

778
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:28,139
that's harming me...

779
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:31,009
to protect myself first.

780
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:34,380
And that's being kind to myself.

781
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,920
I've been trying my best to follow...

782
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:40,690
what that person advised me to do.

783
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:45,759
Be kind to myself...

784
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:52,630
Isn't that for people who don't have to face struggles in life?

785
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,170
Aren't there more people...

786
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,670
who don't have the time or resources to look after themselves?

787
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:21,889
Did you know?

788
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:23,830
When you start...

789
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,100
to feel emotional,

790
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,330
you quickly cover your nose first.

791
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,369
If you keep suppressing them,

792
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:36,110
it will become a habit.

793
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:45,779
I'm going to get some sleep.

794
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,350
I'll stay by your side.

795
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,049
So...

796
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:54,920
please rest up tonight.

797
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,279
Hello, ma'am.

798
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:53,210
Did I get my grade?

799
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,449
Well, you are in Grade A.

800
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,850
But it's an A minus.

801
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,819
It's not just an A.

802
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,119
An A minus?

803
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,560
The occupations of the parents are important these days.

804
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:08,088
Many of our clients check...

805
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:09,758
if they have specialized careers or not.

806
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,759
But your parents...

807
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:16,829
- My dad is in cryptocurrency. - My gosh, don't worry.

808
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,100
- That will be more than enough. - My mom is in real estate.

809
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:21,369
I can't lie, though.

810
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,139
Okay.

811
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:36,949
I'm going to work.

812
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,880
How could I get Yoon Min Ju on board?

813
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:04,480
Is that really the only way?

814
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:08,549
Don't make me compare you to Chae Yong Ju.

815
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:11,989
It's better than getting compared to her.

816
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,429
Yes. I can't stand that.

817
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:17,130
If I put my mind to something, I can get it done too, Chae Yong Ju.

818
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,159
Sergeant First Class Chae Yong Ju.

819
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:23,969
What? What time is it?

820
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,170
You're up. It seems you had a restful night.

821
00:54:27,509 --> 00:54:28,540
Me?

822
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,508
No way.

823
00:54:30,509 --> 00:54:33,310
I rarely lower my guard.

824
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:35,310
Look at that.

825
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,480
That's the saliva stain.

826
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,350
My what?

827
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:41,949
You're lying.

828
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:44,520
We should go back down.

829
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:46,318
It's the day of the festival. We have so much work to do.

830
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,758
And the people in the village love me.

831
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:51,330
I'm certain they've been waiting for me all night.

832
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,199
My gosh. You make it sound like you're hosting the festival.

833
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:00,809
Even when I get drunk,

834
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:02,068
I never let myself loosen up like this.

835
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:04,540
Why did I sleep through the night?

836
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,509
Goodness. I've been slacking off on my discipline.

837
00:55:07,949 --> 00:55:10,178
Why are you beating yourself up for it? Things like this happen.

838
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:12,219
My self-discipline has been weakening lately.

839
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:14,819
Goodness. Could you stop with that?

840
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:16,988
No one's going to criticize you...

841
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,560
for letting yourself loose.

842
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:25,259
So you shouldn't be so harsh on yourself either.

843
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,799
The day just started too.

844
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,540
Aren't you the enlightened one?

845
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,739
My gosh, wait up for me.

846
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,839
(Baegok-ri Town Hall)

847
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:48,249
(Baegok-ri Town Hall)

848
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,489
- Hello. - Hey.

849
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,889
I'm Section Chief Bang Ah Reum from Jisang Liquor.

850
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,960
- Where's everyone? - Don't you know who I am?

851
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,759
I'm the village chief.

852
00:55:57,929 --> 00:55:59,529
I got them all in one place. Go inside.

853
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,440
(Many a little makes a mickle.)

854
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,080
Hey.

855
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,980
What is it that you want to talk to us about?

856
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,388
We need to go and get ready for the festival.

857
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:22,989
Can you get to the point and make it brief?

858
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:26,359
What a hassle this is. Why did you want us here?

859
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,529
We don't have all day.

860
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,088
Gosh, they are people who are much older than her.

861
00:56:30,089 --> 00:56:32,359
Why are we letting her boss us around like this?

862
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,100
- Right. - Gosh, let's hear her out first.

863
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:37,569
Everyone.

864
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,469
I'll help you make a fortune.

865
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:46,440
- A fortune? - What?

866
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:48,778
- What did she say? - Did she say a fortune?

867
00:56:48,779 --> 00:56:52,179
Everyone, it sounds like this might take a while.

868
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,719
- Let's hear her out. - Sure thing.

869
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,718
Don't you want to sell a lot of Naro Beer?

870
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,758
Sure.

871
00:57:00,759 --> 00:57:03,158
But you're not making much compared to the labor you put in.

872
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:05,630
I guess our money has feet. It seems to disappear.

873
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:06,900
Let me tell you why.

874
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,270
The production volume is low because the brewery is small.

875
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,198
Then what's the solution?

876
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:14,469
Make a super big brewery.

877
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:16,610
Then we can just produce a lot of beer.

878
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:18,710
Precisely.

879
00:57:19,279 --> 00:57:22,049
Jisang Liquor has an annual production volume...

880
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,179
of 500,000KL.

881
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:27,020
What did you say? Five hundred what?

882
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:28,649
How many bottles is that?

883
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,819
If each bottle contains 500ml,

884
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,020
we would produce one billion bottles.

885
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:35,159
One billion bottles.

886
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:38,659
Then how much would we make from all that?

887
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:50,110
Hold on.

888
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,009
Why is it so quiet here?

889
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,049
It's not usually this quiet.

890
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:58,380
Maybe, it's because it's still early.

891
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:02,988
What's the point of making a lot of beer?

892
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:05,060
- You must sell a lot of it too. - Right.

893
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:06,189
To do that,

894
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,330
you must have solid distributors all over the country.

895
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,360
Jisang Liquor has 16 direct stores all over the country.

896
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:13,830
Don't forget about Jisang Supermarket,

897
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,028
Jisang Department Store,

898
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:16,298
and Jisang Convenience Store.

899
00:58:16,299 --> 00:58:18,400
Naro Beer will be available everywhere.

900
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:20,238
My gosh.

901
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:23,110
And the future profits would be incomparable to what you make now.

902
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,339
This sounds amazing!

903
00:58:27,779 --> 00:58:28,879
Hold on.

904
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,750
Then what's Ms. Chae Yong Ju doing here?

905
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,480
Does she have a different agenda?

906
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,658
Ms. Chae Yong Ju from the Marketing Team...

907
00:58:38,659 --> 00:58:40,158
wants to hire Mr. Yoon as a brewer,

908
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:42,029
so he can launch a new beer product for Jisang Liquor.

909
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:45,099
She would be taking only Mr. Yoon to Seoul.

910
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,158
What?

911
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:49,270
That means she wants to steal Yoon Min Ju from us.

912
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:50,799
Then what about us?

913
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,569
I see. She wants us to starve to death?

914
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:57,339
Well,

915
00:58:58,009 --> 00:58:59,440
that would be the worst-case scenario.

916
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,580
I can't believe this.

917
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:03,710
I can't believe this.

918
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,750
- I can't believe this. - I can't believe this.

919
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,250
- My goodness. - This is awful!

920
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,089
Ma'am!

921
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:14,290
I got the vegetables!

922
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,330
- Don't come. - No.

923
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:18,330
That little...

924
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,198
She's back.

925
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:22,868
- Let's go and talk to her. - Why is she back?

926
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:23,969
- I can't believe this. - Let's go.

927
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:26,569
- Goodness. - How could she do this?

928
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,408
What? She seems chirpy this morning.

929
00:59:29,409 --> 00:59:30,469
- How dare she? - What?

930
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:33,310
- What's her deal? - I can't believe this.

931
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,110
- Unbelievable. - Goodness.

932
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,379
- I can't focus on work now. - Seriously.

933
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,849
- We need to talk to her. - Let's talk to her.

934
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:39,949
What...

935
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,190
- Let's hear from her. - Let's go.

936
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:43,818
I heard she disappeared.

937
00:59:43,819 --> 00:59:46,289
What's wrong? What's going on?

938
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:47,759
- What's this? - Even I would be so angry.

939
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:49,159
Right.

940
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:52,100
- Hey, Mr. Yoon. Come here. - What?

941
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,100
What? Go ahead. Just talk to me.

942
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,440
- No, Chief. - No!

943
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:04,109
- Don't do it. - What are you doing?

944
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,379
- Stop it. - What are you doing?

945
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,810
- Come on. - Let go.

946
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,449
Oh, no.

947
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,759
Come on. My goodness.

948
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,949
Sir.

949
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,549
I...

950
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:53,219
I wasn't trying to throw that at your face.

951
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,528
I mean, it's your fault!

952
01:00:55,529 --> 01:00:58,099
Because you had such an evil plan,

953
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,658
you were punished by karma!

954
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:01,798
I wasn't trying to do that on purpose.

955
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:03,099
- Right. - Exactly.

956
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,440
- Yes. - What are you talking about?

957
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:07,969
- You can't do that. - Come on.

958
01:02:46,699 --> 01:02:49,509
(Brewing Love)

959
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:52,040
I want both of you to leave right now.

960
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:53,839
I can't leave like this.

961
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:55,509
Me neither.

962
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,920
What did you say to the people in the village?

963
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,349
I only told them the facts.

964
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:00,778
If we make a deal with Yoon Min Ju,

965
01:03:00,779 --> 01:03:02,150
he could sign with us, right?

966
01:03:02,290 --> 01:03:04,690
You need to judge objectively if Ms. Chae is...

967
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,658
a trustworthy person.

968
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:09,989
Of all people, at least you can judge me for who I am.

969
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:12,860
I've been doing that...

970
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,569
from the beginning.
