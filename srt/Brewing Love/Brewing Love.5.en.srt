1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,369
(Uilhan Brewery)

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,140
(1. Malting, 2. Malt milling, 3. Mash tun, 4. Hopping)

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,080
(Kim Se Jeong)

4
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,850
(Highly passionate, highly sensitive)

5
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,459
(Lee Jong Won)

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,659
(Shin Do Hyun)

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,228
(Baek Sung Chul)

8
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:26,499
(Uilhan Brewery)

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,529
(Naro Beer)

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,138
(Brewing Love)

11
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:35,139
(This is a work of fiction.)

12
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,139
(Scenes with child actors and animals were filmed...)

13
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:37,139
(under production guidelines along with experts.)

14
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,380
We should take shelter.

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,520
What's with him?

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,819
- Head there first. - Sure.

17
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:27,660
Shall we get going?

18
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,240
Am I wrong?

19
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:43,940
Are these emotions...

20
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,080
mine?

21
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,839
Come on. It's already late.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,850
These aren't my emotions.

23
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,119
There's no way I like her.

24
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:09,569
I guess it stopped raining.

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,929
Right.

26
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,038
- Shall we get going? - Sure.

27
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,069
Right.

28
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,509
How will you get home?

29
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,410
We can share a cab.

30
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,880
Why? We live in opposite directions.

31
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:23,578
All roads lead to one, and it's late.

32
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,650
- We should share a cab. - It's fine.

33
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,090
Whatever. I don't mind getting home early.

34
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,359
It's not like I want to take the long way home.

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,389
Doesn't he know who he has feelings for?

36
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,299
So much for me being an escort.

37
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,600
As if I need one.

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,668
- Mr. Yoon. - What the...

39
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:48,840
Did that startle you?

40
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,680
- What... - Are you not feeling well?

41
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,410
Sorry?

42
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,850
No, it's just that my heart is beating abnormally.

43
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,180
Your heart? Why is that?

44
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,418
Do you have an underlying heart condition?

45
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,060
It wasn't actually my heart.

46
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,989
I guess you can say I absorbed emotions.

47
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,359
You absorbed emotions?

48
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,828
It's nothing. I'll feel better once you two head off.

49
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,840
Sure.

50
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,268
Where are you staying? We should give you a ride.

51
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,840
No, I'll get back on my own.

52
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,940
- You should get going. Go on. - Right.

53
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,679
- Are you sure you're okay? - Don't come at me together.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,049
Stop.

55
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,389
What's with him? Is he drunk?

56
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:36,888
Are you asking I'm drunk...

57
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,660
when you don't know who made me feel this way?

58
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,289
Who's causing it?

59
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,389
Hold on a second.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,960
Do you really not know?

61
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,099
Know what?

62
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Well, your...

63
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,039
What?

64
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,750
I think it's best for us to part ways.

65
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,109
I'll see you at the next meeting.

66
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,720
Take care, then.

67
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,579
Sure.

68
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,519
We'll get going first.

69
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,160
- Sure. - Come on.

70
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,090
Stay in touch.

71
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,529
Where I got hit earlier...

72
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,669
Why would you touch it?

73
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,700
I'm worried it might scar.

74
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,669
- I bet it's still throbbing. - Hold on.

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,239
Doesn't Kang Beom know how he feels?

76
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,169
But his heart was pounding.

77
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,979
Mind your own business.

78
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,679
How can he not know this?

79
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,629
(Brewing Love)

80
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,470
(Episode 5)

81
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,289
Boss!

82
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,700
Put down your camera and enjoy this with us.

83
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:29,570
He's an expert at spending time alone.

84
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,400
I guess it's photo day.

85
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,210
Come on.

86
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:41,340
It's not like there's anything new.

87
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,779
What were you taking photos of?

88
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,020
Take photos of us instead. Make us look good.

89
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:52,820
I don't take photos of people.

90
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:54,589
I only take photos of things that never change.

91
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,859
- What... - A jerk.

92
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,859
That's what my late mother took photos of.

93
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,830
Didn't I tell you she was a photographer?

94
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:05,999
- Now, that's stylish. - Tell me about it.

95
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,369
- She must be so cool. - Right?

96
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,410
(Absorbing emotions)

97
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:12,579
(A talent those highly sensitive possess)

98
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,580
(Do you wish to manage your hyper-empathy and sensitivity?)

99
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,049
"They confuse their emotions with other people's..."

100
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,950
"and feel the emotions felt by other people."

101
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:27,320
"That puts them in a unique position to heal others,"

102
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,160
"but that leads to draining their own energy."

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
There are Mr. Yoon and the ladies.

104
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:43,010
- Shall we make a stop? - Sure.

105
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:45,238
- Seriously. - Here you go.

106
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,978
Have some rice instead.

107
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,248
- How do you like it? - I already had my meal.

108
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:50,280
What? Why didn't you tell us that?

109
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:51,949
Hello!

110
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,619
- Goodness. - Gosh.

111
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,989
But the meeting is in the afternoon.

112
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,689
We came by early. You must be having lunch.

113
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:02,358
They always come to us for a meal, don't they?

114
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,629
Are we your lunch ladies?

115
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,900
- Get over here. - Get over here.

116
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,139
Others must be joining us today.

117
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,039
Yes, but we asked them to be here yesterday.

118
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:18,979
Thanks.

119
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,909
How dense of me.

120
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,150
Eat up if you get our drift.

121
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,109
The bibimbap was mixed yesterday.

122
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,489
Try some. Go ahead.

123
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,220
Exceptional, right?

124
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,689
Goodness.

125
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,059
- It's nice to eat as a group. - I know.

126
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,859
- Goodness. - My gosh.

127
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,649
Mr. Yoon, are you sure you're feeling all right?

128
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,479
- Maybe you should see a doctor... - Goodness.

129
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,978
No doctor can treat what he has.

130
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,619
Exactly. His illness is untreatable.

131
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,450
Because he's a nutcase.

132
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,259
I'll get more water.

133
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,330
Thanks.

134
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,499
Goodness me.

135
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,099
You ate too much too fast.

136
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,700
It's that good.

137
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,280
Let's see.

138
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,119
Do you need something?

139
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,450
Well...

140
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,790
I don't get involved with others' love lives.

141
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,430
I'm hardly ever interested,

142
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,229
but your situation...

143
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,669
My heart is suffering immensely.

144
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,739
Mr. Yoon.

145
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,309
Are you sure there isn't a problem?

146
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,680
Of course not. You're the one with the issue.

147
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,109
- Me? - Well...

148
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:10,420
What do you think about Ms. Chae?

149
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,790
As in Yong Ju?

150
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,820
- I respect her. - Respect?

151
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,790
- She's admirable. - Is that all?

152
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,460
What more should there be to it?

153
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,868
- Let me get her some water first. - Hold on.

154
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:23,330
Just a second.

155
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,898
You know how it is. When she's thirsty,

156
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,868
you want to get her water as soon as possible.

157
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,179
What do you call it when you only have eyes for her?

158
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,979
- What's that? - What can it be?

159
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,550
- I'm her junior colleague. - Darn.

160
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,180
It's my duty as her junior colleague.

161
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,090
You like...

162
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,960
Like?

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,359
Darn.

164
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,930
Could you have feelings for her?

165
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,159
What?

166
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,399
What on earth?

167
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:05,210
That's the funniest thing I heard all year.

168
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,739
Mr. Yoon.

169
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:11,350
What I have for her is respect. I'm a true fan.

170
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,920
Mr. Yoon, I see you're not perceptive.

171
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,259
That was hilarious. Get a grip on yourself.

172
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,330
Oh, no. He has no clue whatsoever.

173
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,100
That idiot.

174
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,669
Mr. Yoon must love to take photos.

175
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,600
- There were many at his place. - Right.

176
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,239
His mother used to be a photographer.

177
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,639
She died young.

178
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:41,909
I see.

179
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,850
- What has you in a good mood? - Right.

180
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,019
What has you giggling?

181
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,489
Here.

182
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,470
We should slowly get to our meeting.

183
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,498
It's our first one, you see.

184
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,340
- Right. - Sure.

185
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,269
So I heard.

186
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,810
Be good to our boss.

187
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,378
Even if he puts up a wall,

188
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,638
just let him be since that's who he is.

189
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,149
He's actually a kind soul.

190
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,550
I thought I was the boss here.

191
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,589
He already got to know the team members.

192
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,819
We even had drinks together and are now one single team.

193
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,320
We're one team, so don't worry.

194
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:39,200
- What? - Focus.

195
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:50,609
No matter how you put it,

196
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,619
this seems wrong.

197
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,330
"The meeting must be held at Mr. Yoon's place of work."

198
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,128
That condition of the contract...

199
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,070
seems like a tall order.

200
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,340
Hold on.

201
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,768
I signed the contract since you agreed to that,

202
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,268
so you can't go against it.

203
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:21,878
Videoconferencing is a common practice these days.

204
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,378
He's like a roadblock

205
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,710
What do you mean by that?

206
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,590
Thanks.

207
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,690
I understand where you all stand,

208
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,859
so let's focus on the meeting for now.

209
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,070
Here. Thanks.

210
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:44,899
All right.

211
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,539
This is what we'll be spending most of our time on.

212
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,070
(1st Meeting on Product Development)

213
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,639
A concept. We need one to brew the right beer.

214
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,008
That's right.

215
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,149
That is why I was thinking about holding a two-day workshop.

216
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:01,618
We'll visit famous breweries and research the market.

217
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:02,649
Ms. Chae.

218
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,589
The craft beer scene and commercial beer brewing...

219
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,019
are two different markets.

220
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,289
If it's to study recipes,

221
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,790
we can buy well-known craft beer at bottle shops.

222
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,228
A two-day workshop seems unnecessary.

223
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:13,560
- I agree. - Same here.

224
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,129
I'm afraid I'll be too busy.

225
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,499
There are at least a truckload of ladies who await my toasties...

226
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,840
A truckload...

227
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,829
It's an odd vibe in here.

228
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,859
Gosh, what a great nap.

229
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,129
That was great. I slept like a log.

230
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,700
How refreshing.

231
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:01,739
Unbelievable.

232
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,249
(Baegok-ri Village Hall)

233
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:05,978
For 30 years...

234
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,849
I have two X-rays.

235
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,050
For 30 years.

236
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:10,749
(Hwi's Toast)

237
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,720
Unbelievable.

238
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,790
What is this? Is this a challenge?

239
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,728
Who are you to block the path of a man?

240
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:21,758
I'm stiff all over and would like a massage.

241
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,969
Don't go in there.

242
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,499
If he wants a massage,

243
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,040
- he should get his massage. - Sure.

244
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,040
I felt like a squid on a grill.

245
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,839
It was hot in there.

246
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,008
Why don't we grill a squid?

247
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,009
- Sounds good. - Good.

248
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,690
Our company already has a signature beer.

249
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,658
As per the chairman's order,

250
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,670
it became our goal to make one that tastes like nothing else.

251
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,339
Up until now, we copied beers that were trending...

252
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,170
and had a brewmaster come up with a recipe...

253
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,269
so that we could release our beer in two months.

254
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:07,009
To be honest, that's not what I want.

255
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,050
I don't want to do the bare minimum...

256
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:12,080
and would go on a workshop if one is necessary.

257
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,790
That being said, to do a proper job,

258
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,919
it'll take at least six months...

259
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,759
since I can't sacrifice the operations here at my brewery.

260
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,989
Even that's a tight schedule for me.

261
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,899
Six months to launch a new beer?

262
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:29,398
- Yes. - Six months.

263
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,430
(D-6 months)

264
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,369
Fine. We give you our word.

265
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,479
All right, then. We'll all be attending the workshop.

266
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,479
Rao, could you book our accommodations?

267
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,850
Ms. Chae, that was unfair for you to ask.

268
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,189
- Sorry? - Well,

269
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,789
I may be the youngest,

270
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,089
but I'm a regular employee at the Seoul office...

271
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,099
and a member of this task force.

272
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,029
I don't get why I of all people...

273
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,330
should book accommodations for the rest.

274
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:14,539
Yong Ju, I'll do it.

275
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,680
Sure thing.

276
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,580
How about we wrap up today's meeting?

277
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,479
Sure. Good job, everyone.

278
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:31,790
- Have a good one. - Sure.

279
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,330
Have a safe trip home.

280
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,129
Bye, Ms. Beautiful Bang.

281
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,509
Why that...

282
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,350
That punk's getting on my nerves.

283
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,648
(Baegok-ri Village Hall)

284
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,090
- I'll tidy up inside. - Sure.

285
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:03,430
It's no walk in the park.

286
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,270
"It's unfair."

287
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,740
"It's unfair."

288
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,319
- Yong Ju. - Yes, sir.

289
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
Come over here.

290
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,159
Can you organize these files today?

291
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,260
Yes, I'll try.

292
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:39,459
- You can do it, right? - Sure.

293
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,059
Let me do it.

294
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,928
I'll summarize and report to you!

295
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,030
(Safety first)

296
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,750
I should get going too.

297
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,178
- Have a safe trip back home. - Good luck.

298
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,219
Sure!

299
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:08,820
Ta-da!

300
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,789
What's all this, sir?

301
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,600
It's snacks!

302
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,980
You told me that's what I should do.

303
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,119
That's the right thing to do.

304
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,189
I thought you left.

305
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,969
I mean, you don't need to pretend to be fine.

306
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:51,100
What are you talking about? I'm totally fine.

307
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,169
You don't look fine,

308
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,909
though you don't seem to know it.

309
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:08,719
We met for a business. How about focusing on that?

310
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,689
And you don't have to care about how others feel.

311
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,590
If I say I'm fine, then I really am.

312
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,230
I got it.

313
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,969
I should get going now. Take care.

314
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,080
I know you pretend to be cool because of me.

315
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,449
I know you're worried...

316
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,030
your anger might affect me.

317
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,500
That's why you give me the cold shoulder.

318
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,929
I'm thankful for that, but...

319
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:03,669
Yong Ju!

320
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:07,109
What a jerk he is!

321
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,409
He's totally nuts, a jerk, and an idiot!

322
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,820
"Unfair"? Really?

323
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,449
I should let him know what unfair means!

324
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,820
Gosh!

325
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,119
Thank you for trying to make me feel better.

326
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,560
- I'm who you can count on, right? - Yes.

327
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,489
Did you say nuts? It's funny.

328
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,759
I think he's out of his mind.

329
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,729
He may have left his brain somewhere.

330
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,699
If I were five years younger, I should've already hit him.

331
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,340
Directly!

332
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,469
That was funny.

333
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,139
- You know how I'm good at it. - Of course, I know.

334
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,550
Darn it.

335
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,469
What? "Thank you for trying to make me feel better"?

336
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,600
Then, what was all about focusing on business?

337
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,139
What was all about the others' feelings she told me?

338
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:10,969
What a joke.

339
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,580
Was I too cold?

340
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,709
I was worried that he'd feel stressed out.

341
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Yong Ju.

342
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,750
Are you up for a beer?

343
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:25,990
A beer?

344
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,159
Next time.

345
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:32,459
I feel suddenly thirsty.

346
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,659
Then, let's stop for a minute to get some water.

347
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,070
Sure.

348
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,939
(Uilhan Brewery)

349
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,340
He came.

350
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,609
I guess Yong Ju just left.

351
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,149
She just left without saying goodbye?

352
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,820
I guess so.

353
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,918
She should've said to you at least.

354
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,158
I thought she was a well-mannered lady!

355
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,628
She just ignored us waiting for her?

356
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:03,759
That's what I mean.

357
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,659
She's rather ill-mannered!

358
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,259
That's quite harsh. She just...

359
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,369
Just...

360
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
We're disappointed.

361
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:13,500
- Yes, it's disappointing. - I see.

362
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,310
- That's disappointing. - Right.

363
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,678
No! What are you talking about?

364
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,580
I'm totally fine.

365
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,448
- I mean it. - I see.

366
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:29,289
That's how our boss means it.

367
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,490
Yes. You trust us, don't you?

368
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,999
Yes, it's me.

369
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,898
We have something to work on.

370
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:45,939
Start moving now.

371
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:47,769
Yes, sure.

372
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,070
- Hello. - Hi.

373
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,540
- Hello. - Welcome.

374
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,209
Two bottles of water.

375
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,879
Then, it costs...

376
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,419
Why won't it open?

377
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,218
Did somebody lock this?

378
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,388
Then, keep the change for now, please.

379
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,128
We'll visit here quite often due to meetings.

380
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:11,490
Is that okay for you?

381
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,330
Then, I got it.

382
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,800
- We should get going. - See you.

383
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,030
Drink this.

384
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:20,439
Thanks, Jjuan.

385
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,740
I mean drink it all.

386
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,340
You mean in here?

387
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,109
I see.

388
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:35,919
Oh, Chief!

389
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,759
- We should go somewhere. - Where?

390
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,060
Sook and Young Sisters are quite angry now.

391
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:46,458
We allowed you to use the Village Hall and more.

392
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,829
But how dare you leave without a word?

393
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,898
We weren't thinking that.

394
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,638
- Where are they now? - We'll catch up with our car.

395
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,368
- You, off you go. - Why?

396
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,540
In what world are you now? No overwork!

397
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,209
Yong Ju, you're the only one coming.

398
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:06,719
Sure. You're good to go.

399
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,919
- Should I get in your car? - Yes.

400
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:14,388
- This way! - Ma'am, please.

401
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,689
Wait. Please.

402
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,089
Why the pub all of a sudden?

403
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,759
- You'll know the reason soon. - Yes.

404
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,899
Shout it.

405
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,899
- Five, four, three, two. - Five, four, three, two.

406
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:28,599
One!

407
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,639
Ta-da!

408
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,350
How...

409
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,919
What is this all about?

410
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,589
- Good work today. Take care. - Yes.

411
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,958
I'll go home once I return the car.

412
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,129
- Okay. - See you.

413
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:02,939
How can she leave without saying goodbye?

414
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,540
She's mean.

415
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,229
I'm leaving!

416
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,659
See you.

417
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,310
She got a part-time job?

418
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,350
- It's been taken care of. - Pardon?

419
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:51,019
For the next year and a half.

420
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,619
I like being exact with my calculations.

421
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,189
It means you should come back.

422
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:56,189
Thank you.

423
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:05,530
What? What are you doing there?

424
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,980
My gosh. Why did you knock this over?

425
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:28,290
Oh, darn.

426
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,730
My clumsiness is my charm.

427
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,000
By the way, what's with this part-time job?

428
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:38,699
You work for a big company.

429
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:43,310
Are you in a bind?

430
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,810
Do you need to make fast cash?

431
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,209
What are you saying?

432
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,020
Boss, I'm sorry.

433
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,959
- You're here. - Yes.

434
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,259
My kid started running a fever all of a sudden.

435
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,929
And my husband said he'd be home late. My gosh.

436
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,999
- Is your kid okay now? - Yes.

437
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,859
I gave my kid a fever reducer, and my husband is home now.

438
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,000
You always help me out when I have an emergency like this. Thank you.

439
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,869
I've worked many part-time jobs,

440
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,609
and a boss like you is hard to come by.

441
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,409
What?

442
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,050
"Boss?"

443
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,449
Ms. Beautiful Bang, are you rich?

444
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:34,060
This was one of the things I heard the most growing up.

445
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,129
"A girl must be obedient!"

446
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,929
I never held back.

447
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,100
This girl was born, and she threw punches whenever she was provoked.

448
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,969
I just hated losing.

449
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,270
Not the fact that I lost.

450
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,869
I hated letting others find out that I was sad about it.

451
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,040
It made me feel like a real loser.

452
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,109
So I was always like, "Okay, it's totally fine."

453
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,550
I always told myself that.

454
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,990
- You're an orphan - You're an orphan

455
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:07,260
You have no mom or dad.

456
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:13,260
I have no parents, but it doesn't mean I have no family.

457
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,770
Hey, you live off welfare.

458
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,830
Does the free food taste good?

459
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:22,469
You can eat because my dad pays his taxes, so be grateful.

460
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:25,240
Pass on my thanks to your dad.

461
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,010
I can eat more, right?

462
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,908
Yong Ju! Let's go and sing karaoke.

463
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,079
- Come with us. - Let's go.

464
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,249
Karaoke?

465
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,179
I'm broke, and I have my shift.

466
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:35,519
Excuse me.

467
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,490
Can we get two more servings of pork belly?

468
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:39,689
Two servings...

469
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,600
Oh, boy.

470
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,510
- Grandma! - Yes!

471
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,540
Come.

472
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,218
(Corn on the cob, Hotteok)

473
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:10,350
(Fish Cake)

474
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,590
What?

475
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,990
Oh, it's just... It's very dusty here.

476
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:51,459
- Oh, come on. - Look at all this dust.

477
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,428
What is with him?

478
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:55,599
Hello. You can take that table...

479
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,100
- in the back. - I'll have a beer.

480
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,398
- Enjoy. - What a way to ruin the mood.

481
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,398
Dust, all of a sudden? Who cares?

482
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,899
Dust? What is with you?

483
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,439
I feel like your vibe has changed.

484
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,580
Really?

485
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:16,290
Well, I'm not sure about that.

486
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,219
I wonder what gave you such an impression.

487
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,119
Hey, come on!

488
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,658
By the way, you can't even drink.

489
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,189
How did you get into beer making?

490
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,898
It's not that I can't drink.

491
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:32,270
I choose not to drink because it gives me a headache.

492
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:36,099
(In My Name, Naro Beer)

493
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,070
You know, when you drink a lot of beer,

494
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,639
you reach a point when people's voices get muffled.

495
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,049
I know what you're talking about. When you start feeling buzzed.

496
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,550
That's when you start talking louder.

497
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:51,790
I like it when that happens because I actually feel calm.

498
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,359
I mean, I can block out all external noise,

499
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,290
so I can focus on the sound of my breathing.

500
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,389
In that moment,

501
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,169
I feel like I'm all alone in the world,

502
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,869
and I quite like that.

503
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,669
"All alone?"

504
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,709
You know, while working with us,

505
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,079
if you ever need some alone time,

506
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,849
just let me know, anytime.

507
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,280
I promise you I'll make it happen.

508
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,119
Then if you ever need company,

509
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,030
just let me know, anytime.

510
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,730
I'll make it happen too, right away.

511
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,030
All right. Stay. Try to stay like this. Stay!

512
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:40,060
Oh, no! You need to use your muscles.

513
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,100
You were doing great.

514
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,469
Okay. When your head hurts,

515
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,369
pull out your phone and press one.

516
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,909
Here, try.

517
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:54,279
Press it.

518
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,810
- Press one. - Yes, that's it.

519
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,020
You make all this fuss every time you go away for work.

520
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:04,990
How much longer will you keep this up?

521
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:08,388
I made side dishes and put them in the fridge for you,

522
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:09,619
so don't forget to eat them.

523
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,559
I asked the caregiver to stay with you until late,

524
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,000
so have dinner with the caregiver. Okay?

525
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:18,199
Hold on. How much do I owe the caregiver, then?

526
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,500
Two days and...

527
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,510
Four hours, so...

528
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,439
Stop calling the caregiver here.

529
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,649
I can manage alone.

530
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:33,379
You're at it again.

531
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,090
What will you do if you faint again when you're alone?

532
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,320
Anyway, I have to go.

533
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:44,929
When I call you, please pick up right away.

534
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,459
Goodness, you're nagging me again.

535
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,300
Just go. Leave me alone.

536
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,429
Bye.

537
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,340
What's wrong? What is it?

538
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:56,770
Goodness. What?

539
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,070
I almost tripped. That's all.

540
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,109
Is that all you're taking for your two-day trip?

541
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,719
This is enough. What more do I need?

542
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,218
You don't need to come out. I'll see myself out.

543
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,048
- Don't come out. Just stay here. - Okay.

544
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,489
- Bye! - Bye.

545
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,339
Focus.

546
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,310
Yoon Min Ju, focus.

547
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,929
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

548
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,610
Hey, you're acting so strange these days. Do you know that?

549
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:13,549
No. Of course, that can't be.

550
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,549
Well, that's just how I am.

551
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,589
When I sense someone's overwhelming emotions,

552
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,588
I get so immersed that I almost feel like...

553
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:24,759
they're my own emotions and I get confused.

554
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:31,569
So that said, I will check today and make sure that is the case.

555
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,299
Yes.

556
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:39,869
See you later.

557
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:58,360
Does my outfit look lame?

558
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,060
Do I look okay?

559
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,139
I should've gotten a haircut.

560
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,850
What are you doing now?

561
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,739
Mr. Yoon!

562
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,779
Mr. Yoon!

563
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,150
My gosh.

564
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,428
Did you look up some restaurants for the evening?

565
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,429
Yes.

566
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,230
There's this amazing place.

567
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:21,580
Have you been keeping well?

568
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,610
Yes.

569
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,150
We'll have lunch here and go together.

570
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:29,020
Okay, sounds good.

571
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,989
What's with you?

572
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,489
- Guys, we will... - Look at the sea!

573
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,560
- Oh, my. - Wait...

574
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,529
He's acting like he owns the ocean or something.

575
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,670
- Our itinerary... - Goodness.

576
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,739
I don't like the sea.

577
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,639
Do you like the sea?

578
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,040
I don't like looking at it while working.

579
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,409
We're on a tight schedule today.

580
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,520
This won't be easy.

581
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,819
Beom! Hey!

582
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,250
Look, the sea!

583
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,158
No, I mean, Beom!

584
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,060
- Give me a minute, okay? - No, listen!

585
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:12,389
Help! Someone is drowning!

586
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:15,229
Can someone help her? Help!

587
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,929
- Oh, no! - What do we do?

588
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,528
- Hey, look! - Someone is drowning.

589
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,569
What do we do?

590
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,799
What's going on?

591
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,110
Help! Over here!

592
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,739
What zoomed by just now?

593
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,980
- Should we call 911? - What should we do?

594
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,650
Oh, no.

595
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,949
Someone is drowning!

596
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,279
What do we do?

597
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,549
- My gosh. - What?

598
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,560
I knew it. Way to go, Yong Ju!

599
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,630
Oh, my. Well done!

600
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,869
- They saved her. - Amazing.

601
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,540
Are you all right? Can you hear me?

602
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:05,980
- Beom, call 911. - Okay, 911.

603
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:08,949
Please...

604
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:12,389
Please.

605
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,190
Are you all right?

606
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,799
Thank goodness!

607
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,110
They saved her life.

608
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,409
Oh, thank you.

609
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:41,480
- Are you all right? - Yes, of course.

610
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,750
My goodness.

611
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:44,250
Hold on.

612
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:46,719
All right, here.

613
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,259
- No, it's okay. - It's fine. Keep it on.

614
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,690
- Go. Let's go. - Thank you.

615
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,199
What about me?

616
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,069
No one will help me up?

617
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,539
Here, get up.

618
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,110
No! I mean, how come no one will help me up?

619
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,360
My gosh. Are you smitten?

620
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,529
- You are smitten. - What are you saying?

621
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,830
Look at you, you're smitten with me

622
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,980
What's with all the scars on your back?

623
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,650
I'm a man with many secrets.

624
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,850
I'll make a special exception for you and let you in on one of them.

625
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,889
In ten seconds.

626
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,360
Seriously, what's with him?

627
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
What?

628
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:13,339
So, you were both in the special forces?

629
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:18,480
I was worried you'd find me irresistible, so I kept it a secret.

630
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:19,980
Goodness.

631
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,920
I didn't say anything.

632
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,790
Mr. Yoon told us to wait here. Where did he go?

633
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,319
Oh, my.

634
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,949
I know that suitcase. The magic suitcase.

635
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,239
What's he doing?

636
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,369
Here, some toiletries. And use this towel.

637
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:20,909
Thank you.

638
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:22,580
What about me?

639
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,310
What about me?

640
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:26,650
Where's mine?

641
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,790
Wear this.

642
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:38,960
How could you jump into the sea without a second's hesitation?

643
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,028
We didn't have time to think.

644
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:42,529
The body reacts automatically.

645
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,230
Gosh, I hate the sea.

646
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,968
If you go into the water in winter...

647
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:47,239
Gosh, I'm still traumatized.

648
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,568
Hey, isn't it better than the intense one-week training?

649
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:53,569
That's the word I fear the most. Can you please not mention it?

650
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,110
Okay?

651
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,879
We'll wash up quickly and come back.

652
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
Okay.

653
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,819
You were pretty good out there when you hadn't eaten anything.

654
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:06,150
You know I'm a good swimmer.

655
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,489
Why did you take off your shirt?

656
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:11,589
Why not?

657
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,060
My gosh.

658
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,560
How can anyone like that exist?

659
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,270
No way. Do I...

660
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,388
Am I the only one seeing a halo around her?

661
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:39,520
Him too?

662
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,119
Wait.

663
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,889
- How could he just jump in? - Her too?

664
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,100
- My gosh. My heart is pounding. - What...

665
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,000
- Why him? - My boss was in the special forces?

666
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:57,670
Is it now? Is it the time to hand in my notice?

667
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,710
How am I going to check with them here?

668
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:14,460
My gosh. Look at this place.

669
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,718
How much volume do you think it can hold?

670
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:18,529
The volume must be at least 3,000 to 4,000L.

671
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,469
Calling it tasty doesn't cut it.

672
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,139
Hey, your eyes are unfocused.

673
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,949
When you get tired, the first thing...

674
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,389
I guess I got too excited.

675
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:27,928
They're totally out of focus. I'm certain.

676
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:29,230
Mr. Yoon. They are...

677
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,630
- Hey. - Wait.

678
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,239
You startled me.

679
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,669
You can't hide in here and drink.

680
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,040
I'm not hiding.

681
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,110
I'm drinking out in the open.

682
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,980
Well, do you want a glass?

683
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:51,989
This beer...

684
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,420
It's totally my kind of beer.

685
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,960
I'm totally hooked.

686
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,690
You get hooked on beer so easily.

687
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:05,170
My gosh. You're so clueless.

688
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:11,839
Go and get some fresh air.

689
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:20,210
You see, it's so easy to fall for something.

690
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,580
It only takes three seconds. How could you not know?

691
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:25,888
Besides, those three seconds aren't ordinary.

692
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:30,520
There's a slow-motion effect on that person's face.

693
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,959
The objects around that person become so quiet.

694
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,630
It gets dead quiet as if they stopped moving.

695
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:41,600
Then there's a glow behind that person's head.

696
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,809
Ta-da! She starts glowing all of a sudden.

697
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,239
Then it starts. One, two, three.

698
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,610
Only a fool wouldn't know what that means.

699
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,779
A fool?

700
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,618
Well, there are different types of falling for someone.

701
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:58,048
You have to question if it's a genuine concern...

702
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,960
or if it's because she saved someone's life and so on.

703
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,359
So it could be a temporary feeling from seeing a humanitarian act.

704
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,528
That might be why my heart might be feeling full.

705
00:47:05,529 --> 00:47:07,658
It could be confusing.

706
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:09,999
Besides, how am I supposed to distinguish...

707
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,630
when a storm of feelings overwhelms me?

708
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,069
My gosh. Mr. Yoon.

709
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,670
You finally spoke to me without honorifics.

710
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,679
- My gosh. - You started to like me, right?

711
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:24,080
- Goodness. That's not true. - Right?

712
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:26,549
Come on.

713
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:29,549
That's not a bad idea.

714
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:34,089
Then we'll have to listen to other people's opinions.

715
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,159
How come we're the only ones working?

716
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:51,639
Thank you for your hard work today.

717
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,080
Our lodging is pretty close. Let's get going.

718
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,809
All right. Good work, everyone.

719
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,679
- Good work. - Good work.

720
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,548
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

721
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:04,089
Yong Ju. This used to be our turf. Right?

722
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,449
This brings back old memories.

723
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:08,060
By the way,

724
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:10,619
the atmosphere feels a bit off.

725
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,929
What's this?

726
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:14,960
What is this?

727
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,169
None of our promotional stuff is properly managed.

728
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,568
They're talking about closing down the branch.

729
00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:20,770
Who would manage them?

730
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:23,639
But still... This is too much.

731
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:25,139
What do we do?

732
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,040
I think she's angry.

733
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:32,678
Come on out!

734
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:34,678
- What? What do you want? - You!

735
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,249
That's enough, Baekmok.

736
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,020
You know that clearing off the shelf isn't cool.

737
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,419
Listen. I'm buying your company's beer...

738
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,960
when no one wants to drink it.

739
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,459
You should thank me and bow to me.

740
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,959
I heard you guys were closing down.

741
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,330
- So what are you going to do? - Mr. Park?

742
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,670
Mad Dog Yong Ju?

743
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,270
Ms. Chae.

744
00:48:58,739 --> 00:48:59,770
What brings you here?

745
00:49:00,509 --> 00:49:02,110
Let's catch up later.

746
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,610
How dare they clear off the shelf in our turf?

747
00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:08,219
"Clear off the shelf?" What do you mean?

748
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,319
I'll tell you.

749
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:14,859
- Sir! Three more bottles of Likey. - Yes.

750
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,718
Here you go. Three more bottles of Likey.

751
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:18,759
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

752
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,060
Nice.

753
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,739
- I'm getting tipsy. Let's go. - Yes.

754
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,609
- Thank you. - Thank you.

755
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:37,480
It's a method of buying all of their competitor's beer.

756
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,649
It may look like they're increasing their competitor's sales.

757
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:42,650
Four servings of pork belly...

758
00:49:42,651 --> 00:49:43,778
- But if this continues... - and Likey, please.

759
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:45,849
Well, we ran out of Likey.

760
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,589
We have Tenns. Why don't you drink that instead?

761
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,488
Come on. They're always out of Likey.

762
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,488
Which company manufactures Likey? This isn't cool.

763
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:54,258
- Let's drink Tenns. It's better - Give us Tenns then.

764
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:55,629
- I'll give you Tenns. - Okay.

765
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,428
- Hold on. I'll clear the table. - Okay.

766
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,829
Likey will start to be recognized by consumers as a beer...

767
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,400
that no restaurants carry.

768
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:05,009
Once they're forgotten by consumers,

769
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:06,540
the sales will go down.

770
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:10,080
In the end, the company will stop manufacturing the product.

771
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,649
Beom and I will stay here and take care of this mess.

772
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,689
You can go ahead first.

773
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,889
You said I would take action if a team effort was needed.

774
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,489
I think you need a team effort now.

775
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,329
Gosh, if they stop selling Likey,

776
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,600
it would make our job in the Planning Team harder.

777
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,000
Everyone knows I'm not that devoted to the company,

778
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,369
but I can't let our competitor win.

779
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,940
Then what should we do, Ms. Chae?

780
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:45,779
Then let's start catching these cheaters.

781
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,048
(Catch the cheaters)

782
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,250
(Handing off)

783
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,449
(Bang!)

784
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,759
(You're all dead meat.)

785
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,060
(Legendary Lady in Black)

786
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,790
Why did you break this precious bottle?

787
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,028
(Fizzing)

788
00:51:01,029 --> 00:51:02,298
Clean this up and come out.

789
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:03,729
Give us a bottle of Likey.

790
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:04,769
(Come on, put it in now.)

791
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,900
(Reaching)

792
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,270
- What are you doing? - What's your problem?

793
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,338
(Smirking)

794
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:09,500
(Who are you?)

795
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:10,769
(Scowling)

796
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:11,770
(A lunatic with clear eyes)

797
00:51:11,771 --> 00:51:12,868
(Roaring)

798
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,310
(Why do I feel like we're doomed?)

799
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:24,850
Baekmok.

800
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:27,520
Must you play dirty like this?

801
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:29,290
Are you guys thugs?

802
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,888
Our team managers settled...

803
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,829
that we wouldn't try to clear off each other's shelves.

804
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:36,000
Come on. What are you talking about?

805
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,199
I heard that your team manager abandoned you and went to Seoul.

806
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,469
Right?

807
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,239
Am I wrong?

808
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,069
Ms. Chae.

809
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:50,210
Are you going to keep holding that?

810
00:51:53,049 --> 00:51:54,049
Go ahead.

811
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,219
I didn't abandon them.

812
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:01,920
You have to get your facts straight.

813
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,960
I wasn't going to ask again.

814
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:09,330
Where's your team manager?

815
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,270
My gosh, Ms. Chae.

816
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,170
I heard you went to Seoul. What brings you here?

817
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,169
Goodness. My guys got greedy again.

818
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,338
What do your juniors know?

819
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:21,679
I bet they were just following orders.

820
00:52:22,509 --> 00:52:25,080
Clearing off someone else's shelf was the worst sales method.

821
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,509
So I suggested we should never do it...

822
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:29,419
or even teach our juniors about it. Didn't I tell you that?

823
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,290
Yes, I know that.

824
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,219
It wasn't allowed anymore because you threw a huge fit about it.

825
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:36,159
Don't be so mad.

826
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,429
What do you want me to do then?

827
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,500
A proper apology...

828
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:44,469
and an even more proper way of taking responsibility.

829
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,729
Fine. I'll take responsibility for this.

830
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,770
I'll gather up my juniors and discipline them properly.

831
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:52,309
You jerks. I told you not to do it.

832
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,409
No.

833
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,639
You should personally take responsibility.

834
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,109
Don't you get paid the big bucks because you're supposed...

835
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,610
to take responsibility for your team's mistakes?

836
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,289
My goodness.

837
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:08,360
- I can get my part-timer to do it. - Gosh, no.

838
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:09,919
(Today's Pub)

839
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,230
Goodness.

840
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,739
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

841
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,909
Where are the other employees?

842
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,060
Why didn't you tell me things were this bad down here?

843
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,860
How could I?

844
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,698
We already feel so awful that we burdened you...

845
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,529
to fix this problem alone just to save our branch.

846
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:56,670
I tried my best to fill in your shoes.

847
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,839
But it didn't go so well.

848
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,210
I'm sorry that you had to see this.

849
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:04,850
Why are you sorry?

850
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,379
I'm sorry that I didn't know things were this bad here.

851
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,190
My gosh, Ms. Chae. Why would you say that?

852
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,519
We're going to do our best to hang in there.

853
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,219
So come back to us.

854
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,929
I'll do whatever it takes...

855
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:23,360
to save our branch.

856
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:27,900
So please just hang in there for six months.

857
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,110
Seriously? How can she be so cool time after another?

858
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,219
I'll give out the key cards.

859
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,819
You guys go ahead. I'll go inside after a call.

860
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,170
Mr. Park. Did you get home safely?

861
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,810
No. I felt bad that we couldn't have a meal with you after all that.

862
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,150
Yes. I'll do everything to save our branch.

863
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:16,480
So please give me a bit more time. Hang in there a little longer.

864
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,389
Yes. Okay.

865
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,170
Hey, Grandma. Did you eat?

866
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:38,969
Liar.

867
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,380
I bet you didn't eat again because it was a hassle.

868
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:43,279
Did you exercise?

869
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:46,908
Come on. You have to move around a lot.

870
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:47,920
So you can...

871
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,520
Hello? Hey.

872
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,290
Did she just hang up on me?

873
00:55:55,259 --> 00:55:56,290
Come on.

874
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:29,759
Do you want me to put a Band-Aid on you?

875
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,190
I'd need one if I got hurt.

876
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,459
Seriously?

877
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,529
Right here. Your fingers got cuts.

878
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:39,630
Gosh, this is...

879
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:42,869
- Give me your hand. - What...

880
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,549
Did you also get this Band-Aid from your magic bag?

881
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:58,750
There are more cuts all over your hand.

882
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,920
Those aren't even cuts. They're just some scratches.

883
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,060
I can't even feel pain from them.

884
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:06,029
What?

885
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,199
But I can.

886
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:13,369
The first things I notice...

887
00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:16,199
are the small wounds...

888
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:18,940
you don't even remember.

889
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:20,739
So...

890
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,710
I don't want you to get hurt.

891
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,679
Even if it's just a tiny scratch.

892
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,089
I won't be okay with that.

893
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,389
Why not?

894
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,400
I...

895
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,529
Well...

896
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,549
All done. You're good now.

897
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,080
- I see. So... - Here.

898
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:05,750
Thank you.

899
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,310
This is my feeling. This feeling is mine.

900
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,389
- My gosh. - What's wrong?

901
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,290
It's nothing.

902
00:58:46,529 --> 00:58:48,028
- Are you okay, Mr. Yoon? - Don't come near me.

903
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:51,130
- Wait. No! - I told you not to come near me.

904
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,299
(Brewing Love)

905
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,039
We're so in trouble.

906
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,838
I'll give you three months to launch the new product.

907
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,709
- Pardon? - What do you mean?

908
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:40,048
Tell him to focus only on our product!

909
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:42,020
Don't belittle his business like that.

910
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,920
You're making a mistake now.

911
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,150
- What do you think? - They're pretty good.

912
00:59:47,449 --> 00:59:48,920
I agree.

913
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,629
Ms. Beautiful Bang.

914
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,529
Why are you getting nervous?

915
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,500
I don't hold back when I'm certain about something.

916
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,569
I certainly like you.
