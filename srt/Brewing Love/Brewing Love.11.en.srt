The drawing of a group of people...

18
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:49,266
is great at accentuating the name,

19
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:50,405
but I think...

20
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:52,975
It doesn't show the taste or flavour and strength...

21
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:55,406
of the beer that we want to promote.

Is something bothering Ms. Chae?

30
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:44,797
Together went into mass production.

31
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:46,757
She's worried the taste will shift.

32
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:52,496
I heard about that term.

33
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:55,166
What exactly does it mean when taste "shifts?"

34
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:58,507
Even if the ingredients and recipe are the same,

35
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:01,177
depending on the maturing, fermenting, temperature and things,

36
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:03,146
unpredictable minute changes...

37
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:04,715
can affect the beer's taste.

38
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:05,776
Yes.

39
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,686
Our first batch is 3,330,000 bottles.

40
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:11,986
That means all 3,330,000 beers must taste the same.

41
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:13,656
But something minute could change that.

42
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:15,386
Industry people call that...

43
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:17,226
a taste shift.

44
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,326

Over 3.33 million beers...

47
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:28,806
Mr. Yoon must be really stressed out too.

48
00:02:29,237 --> 00:02:32,006
- Is he okay? - That's why Ms. Chae's worried.

What's up?

54
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,767
I rushed over after sitting in meetings all day long.

55
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:06,806
You must be busy with the release.

56
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:08,406
You should get some rest.

57
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,106
I'm here because I had a feeling our brewmaster...

58
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,947
would be too worried to sleep.

59
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:17,185
Seeing you wiped away my worries.

60
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:18,617
- Did it? - Yes.

61
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:41,207
Goodness.

62
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,477
You're looking out for me when you must be busy?

63
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:47,177

is part of my job as head of the team.

65
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,797
It gets to you, doesn't it?

66
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:06,397
It does.

67
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:10,505
I've never produced this much beer in one go.

68
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:11,875
In this field,

69
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,077
a taste shift isn't rare.

70
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:17,246
But that doesn't mean it's a defect.

71
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:20,076
It's just a minute change in taste.

72
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:23,847
But people who drink the same thing all the time...

73
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:25,686
can tell right away.

74
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:29,227
They go, "Hey, the beer tastes different."

75
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:32,927
That's the scariest.

76
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:34,227
It is.

77
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,097
- Is there anything I can do? - What?

78
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,167

Go home. You have work tomorrow.

84
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:03,527
I can stay another hour.

85
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:08,626
Then spend that extra hour on sleep.

86
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:11,967
Get going.

87
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:14,636
Get up.

88
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,936
No, wait. I'll drive you.

89
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:22,806
You can nap on the way.

90
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:26,316
- You're too tired to drive. - I'm fine.

91
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:28,286

The first batch is being transported today.

104
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:13,256
I was thinking about stopping by the factory to...

105
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,066
What did you just say?

106
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:22,206
Why can't the beer be transported today?

107
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:24,837
What on earth are you saying?

108
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,907
I'll come to you. I'll be right there.

111
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:50,227
The first batch of products can't leave the factory today.

112
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:53,337
- It can't happen. - Hold on.

113
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:56,667
Were you the one who stepped on the brakes?

114
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:00,436
What are you saying?

115
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,576
They must leave the factory today...

116
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:05,446
to be sent to direct-only stores across the country.

117
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:07,476
What if we can't meet the launch deadline?

118
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:08,547
Push the deadline back.

Yoon Min Ju, what's going on?

121
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,956
This is our beer. We made it together.

122
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:23,227
This batch of beer...

123
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:26,037
will be dumped,

124
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:28,097

125
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:41,076
Taste both of them.

(Jisang Liquor)

127
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,006
There's a subtle difference to the taste.

128
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:08,176
Was there a taste shift?

129
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,805
When we produced the first batch,

130
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,276
we used a different fermenting tank.

131
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:12,816
I think that affected the taste.

132
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:15,245
I can't have it released in this state.

133
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,445
Give me a little more time.

134
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:18,455
I'll get the taste back on track. I can do it.

135
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,955
- No. We must ship it today. - Yong Ju.

136
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:22,727
I'm speaking as the team leader.

137
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,657
If we fail to release the first batch on time,

138
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:27,657
our credibility will drop in no time.

139
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:29,466
Don't you know how important credibility is?

140
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,967
Why are you thinking only about this one time?

141
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,437
Consumers can even tell mineral water brands apart.

142
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:35,436
If word gets out that it tastes different,

143
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:37,005
they'll turn away from our brand.

144
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:38,107
Then...

145
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:40,477
what about the wholesalers waiting for our product?

146
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:42,206
Who would trust us...

147
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:44,607
and sell our product if we break our word from the start?

148
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:48,486
A loss in credibility means a loss in sales.

149
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,117
Who wants to drink a beer that tastes different each time?

150
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:54,316
Once consumers turn away, we'll have to stop producing this.

151
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,327
Min Ju.

152
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:59,727
Do you know how much the product in the factory costs?

153
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:02,626
It costs five million dollars.

154
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:04,966
Five million dollars.

155
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:07,796
If we halt production, we won't recover the five million...

156
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:09,906
that went into the first batch,

157
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,576
but we'll also lose the money we invested in developing it.

158
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,006
That's a much bigger loss.

159
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:16,706
You said you wanted our beer to do well.

160
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:20,077
I'm doing this because I want our beer to do well.

161
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:24,545
It's more important to keep our promise.

162
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:26,915
It tasting perfect is more important.

163
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,256
- Min Ju! - Yong Ju!

164
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:34,996
Do you want our beer...

165
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:39,536
to be a quick hit before it disappears?

166
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:45,107
Go home.

167
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:49,706
The directors will have heard about it by now.

168
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:50,906
I must report to them.

169
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,077
Yong Ju.

170
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:55,046
We must stop it now.

171
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,087
This is our last chance.

172
00:09:57,516 --> 00:09:58,816
We identified the problem first...

173
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,587
and can fix it so why won't you?

174
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:04,827
It will come back at us as a much bigger problem.

175
00:10:08,197 --> 00:10:10,996
No company can accept this.

176
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,867
I work at Jisang Liquor...

177
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,937
and have a duty to follow their decision.

178
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:20,136
Don't you see where I stand?

179
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,016
I'd like you to leave everything to us...

180
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:30,317
from here on out.

183
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:08,087
It's a precious beer we made together,

184
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,187
so I'll make sure it's a hit.

185
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:13,957
That being said, you'll properly see me do my work.

186
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:16,626
I've been eyeing you from the moment we met.

(Jisang Liquor)

188
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:38,016
Do you want our beer to be a quick hit before it disappears?

189
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,697
Are you kidding me?

190
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:53,837
Why can't you release it?

191
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:56,337
You used to work in sales!

192
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:58,367
Don't you fear the sellers?

(Marketing Director Na Tae Jo)

194
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:10,416
I'm sorry, sir.

195
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,156
But...

196
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:14,916
now that I know it tastes different,

197
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,426
it's only right to correct it before release.

198
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:21,155
I'll apologize in person to each wholesaler...

199
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:23,396
and ask for more time.

200
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,396
Can't I do that?

201
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:29,837
Are you out of your mind? Is this a joke?

202
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,067
Sir.

203
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:35,607
I know very well how nonsensical this is.

204
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:37,207
But...

205
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:39,946
it's also a fact that...

206
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:42,187
a beer that tastes wrong doesn't last long.

207
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:44,817
All the classic beers that the public still loves...

208
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:47,216
tasted exactly the same until they took over...

209
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:48,987
five percent of the market.

210
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:51,926
Five percent of the market is worth 200 million dollars.

211
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:56,026
That's the kind of beer Mr. Yoon wanted to make.

212
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,295
This will profit us in the long run.

213
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:01,197
That means throwing away five million dollars!

214
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,967
Why would you even talk about classics lasting long?

215
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:07,136
What are you saying?

216
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,246
How would the customers know it tastes different?

217
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:11,675
No one will know!

218
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:13,176
We know.

219
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:17,087
You lot...

220
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,856
You lost your minds...

221
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:21,957
because the chairman has your backs.

222
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:25,625
You seem to think you actually have the right to make decisions...

223
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:27,827
because the chairman said so!

224
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,697
Don't go too far...

225
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,367
across the line.

226
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,107
Get out.

227
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:38,536
Get out!

228
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:58,187
My gosh.

229
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,237
You're the factory manager.

230
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:09,307
What are you doing?

231
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,737
Why would you listen to such nonsense?

232
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:16,175
Who cares if it tastes a bit different?

233
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:17,376
That's nothing!

234
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,516
Ship the beer right away.

235
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:22,117
Right now.

236
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:25,687
What did he say?

237
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:27,386
No, of course.

238
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:29,025
It's hard for a company...

239
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,625
to dump a batch for tasting off.

240
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,796
Still, we can't just ship it out.

241
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:34,796
I don't know what's right.

242
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:38,097
I can understand and accept both positions.

243
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:39,796
He's pretty firm.

244
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:41,866
The situation isn't ideal,

245
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,535
but if we release as planned today,

246
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:45,505
we must set a distribution plan for the factory...

247
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:47,036
and direct-only stores with the SCM Team.

248
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:50,176
Yes.

249
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:53,676
I have to talk to Mr. Yoon.

250
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,145
Start the meeting without me.

251
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,487
I need to make a call.

252
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,256
Shall we go?

253
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:12,597
It tastes wrong?

254
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:15,506
(Planning Team Director Yeom Jang Goon)

255
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:17,837
Hello.

256
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,876
Have you heard, sir?

257
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:25,876
Of course they must go ahead. It's too big a loss.

258
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:30,847
If it were not just about a slight change in the taste...

259
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:33,886
but about cloudy beer or yeast floating about,

260
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,587
that would be scrapped for being a defect.

261
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:38,357
It's a shame.

262
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:43,097
Did I say something wrong?

263
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:44,327
No.

264
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:47,636
- You can go. - Yes, sir.

265
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:57,006
This is how far you should go.

266
00:15:57,676 --> 00:15:58,947
If you continue on this path,

267
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:01,347
you'll only be ruining yourself.

268
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:12,496
I'll ruin myself?

269
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,026
We'll see who hits...

270
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,766
rock bottom first.

271
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:35,347
(Min Ju)

272
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:46,526
I thought about it again and you were right.

273
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:50,467
We're in charge of making it and we realized it tasted different.

274
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:52,496
We can't release it as is.

275
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:54,266
I get why you're angry.

276
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:57,867
So I persuaded the director as best I could,

277
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:01,807
but the company just can't allow delaying the release.

278
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:03,476
(Min Ju)

279
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:06,816
I'm sorry I'm not a good enough team leader.

280
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,586
(I thought about it again and you were right.)

281
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:12,286

282

(I'm sorry.)

286
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:33,936
What's the point in making excuses...

287
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:36,777
when I couldn't solve anything?

288
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:50,327
I wish he'd reply even if it were to be angry.

289
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:06,236
How long were you here for?

290
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,337
Have you been waiting since you left?

291
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,375
You should've called me...

292
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:12,876
I waited because I wanted to talk to you...

293
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,886
in person rather than send you a reply.

294
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:18,247
What about dinner?

295
00:18:18,646 --> 00:18:20,257
You haven't eaten, have you?

296
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:22,857
Let's get something to eat first.

297
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:36,767
Why are your hands so cold?

298
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:38,367
Are you cold?

299
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,747
Is there anything you want to eat?

300
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,146
You couldn't eat while you waited for me.

301
00:18:49,017 --> 00:18:50,347
I'll eat what you want.

302
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:53,787
- You like rice. - Not me.

303
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:56,257
You. What do you want to eat?

304
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:58,087
I'm okay with anything.

305
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,367
Are you really okay?

306
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:11,206
- Yes. - No.

307
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:17,975
We're releasing a first batch that doesn't taste right.

308
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:19,017
About that.

309
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,587
Are you okay with that?

310
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,247
We had no choice.

311
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:26,686
I thought only of myself.

312
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,357
Sorry for putting you on the spot.

313
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:32,997

Never mind.

319
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,676

00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:33,257
Okay. Take care of everything for me.

00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:38,966
Are you cold?

370
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:43,007
What I want to eat, what I need,

371
00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:46,547
and what I want to hear. He feels everything.

372
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:50,416
At times, he knows me better than I do.

373
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:55,617
I don't know unless he tells me.

374
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:58,057
But Min Ju is fine with everything.

375
00:23:58,587 --> 00:23:59,626
He's happy with anything.

376
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:04,896
I don't know how Min Ju is truly feeling.

377
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,466
You know, I...

378
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:15,376
Sorry.

379
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:20,646
Hello, sir.

380
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:23,885
Even though I want to open up to Yong Ju,

381
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:26,486
she has a lot to take care of at the moment.

382
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:29,326
I don't want to become another burden.

383
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:31,426
- Bye. - I only wish...

384
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:33,926
for one thing.

385
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:37,297
I'm sorry.

386
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,466
Hello?

387
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:43,665
All I need...

388
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,135
Oh, yes, right.

389
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:48,307
- is for you to give me a hug. - I'm sorry. I left the office.

390
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:53,047
- Why is everything so complicated? - Okay. I'm so sorry.

391
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,557
Shall we go if you're done?

392
00:25:00,557 --> 00:25:01,587
Shall we?

393
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,626
Why is it so complicated?

394
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:15,367
And I mean everything.

395
00:25:19,107 --> 00:25:20,777
(One week later)

396
00:25:34,656 --> 00:25:37,385
Isn't this the beer CEO Yoon...

397
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:38,925
made recently? Together.

398
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:41,155
Yes. It has just been released.

399
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:43,895
The bottle is still hot.

400
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:45,596
Beer shouldn't be hot.

401
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:47,866
I'm just saying it's... What? Shall we drink it together?

402
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:48,867
Together!

403
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:50,267
- Together! - Together!

404
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:54,136
(Jisang Liquor)

405
00:25:54,906 --> 00:25:55,935
(Jisang's Globalization)

406
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:57,077
(Jisang Liquor)

407
00:26:55,696 --> 00:26:57,166
Granny.

408
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:10,087
Today is the highly anticipated release date of Together.

409
00:27:12,386 --> 00:27:14,087
But why am I not happy?

410
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:20,357
I hope there are no issues.

411
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,597
Right?

412
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:36,347
(Min Ju)

413
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,287
Look at her.

414
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,096
I knew it.

415
00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:56,567
Both of you look terrible.

416
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:00,996
Your skin feels so rough. Goodness.

417
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:03,435
It's like you've got no strength.

418
00:28:03,436 --> 00:28:05,336
Why must you make my heart break?

419
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:07,635
Who told you to look so pale?

420
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:09,746
- Aunties. - Yes.

421
00:28:09,747 --> 00:28:11,705
My goodness. Really.

422
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:13,746
Let's go inside. Come now.

423
00:28:13,747 --> 00:28:15,047
- Gosh. - My legs feel cold.

424
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:22,117
Are these all for me?

425
00:28:22,587 --> 00:28:23,756
I'm touched.

426
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:27,155
No way. We're eating with you. It has three portions.

427
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:28,757
Do you think we don't have mouths?

428
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:32,465
Gosh, you're finally smiling.

429
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:35,497
- Are you feeling better now? - Yes.

430
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:38,706
- Here. Try some of this. - Thank you.

431
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:41,337
- This too. - Wait.

432
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:43,246
Dig in.

433
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:46,676
How's Min Ju been doing?

434
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:49,816
I've been too busy to get in touch.

435
00:28:49,817 --> 00:28:50,986
- That's an excuse. - That's an excuse.

436
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:55,986
You're right.

437
00:28:57,857 --> 00:29:01,725
I want us to fight over who is more upset like children,

438
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:04,626
clear up the misunderstanding,

439
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,166
and make peace.

440
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,607
But I've got so much on my plate.

441
00:29:10,107 --> 00:29:12,537
I end up choosing the easiest way out.

442
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:15,537
And it's ignoring him.

443
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:20,247
Don't you think he knows you're ignoring him...

444
00:29:20,446 --> 00:29:23,287
and waiting for you even though it's eating him?

445
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:25,116
Maybe?

446
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:26,956
It's not just eating him.

447
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:30,287
Min Ju is sick right now. He looks like a living corpse.

448
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:34,395
Is Min Ju sick? How bad is it?

449
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:35,926
He makes beer...

450
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:38,827
and doesn't sleep all day long.

451
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,797
That fool.

452
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,166
A few days ago,

453
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:45,336
he was found passed out on the brewery floor.

454
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:46,807
Min Ju passed out?

455
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:50,906
- What... Aunties. - Go.

456
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:55,246
- Go after you have one of these. - Right.

457
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,216
Good. You need energy to run.

458
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,547
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

459
00:29:59,587 --> 00:30:02,317
- Go ahead. - Chew, okay? Chew.

460
00:30:03,857 --> 00:30:06,696
Why did you mention that? She needed to eat first.

461
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:09,396
Let's eat. We've done our job.

462
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:10,796
- This way. - Be careful.

463
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:12,496
- No, really. - This way.

464
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:14,165
Leave your body to me.

465
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,735
Why are you roaming around?

466
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:16,935
- You need rest. - But...

467
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:18,166
No. I...

468
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:19,905
Be careful. He might bump into the door.

469
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:22,776
- Relax. - Be careful.

470
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:25,307
- Slowly. - Come on.

471
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,576
I'm totally fine, okay?

472
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,875
Stop overdoing it.

473
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:31,116
I need to get the taste of the beer right.

474
00:30:31,117 --> 00:30:33,216
Have you forgotten already?

475
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,955
You passed out from overworking a few days ago.

476
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:40,256
You totally did. And it freaked everyone out.

477
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:43,996
Why do you want to go back into the brewery?

478
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:45,566
- Lie down. - No, but...

479
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,736
- Lie down. - Lie down.

480
00:30:49,706 --> 00:30:51,037
I think his fever went down.

481
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,475
Doesn't he have a slight fever?

482
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:57,346
I'm all right. Goodness.

483
00:30:57,347 --> 00:31:00,316
All right, my foot. How are you all right?

484
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:04,587
You must work while getting some sleep.

485
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:07,316
Did you contact Ms. Chae?

486
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:09,655
Right. If you haven't, I'll do it.

487
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:12,786
That darn big company beer. They're working people to death.

488
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,626
No, don't you call her. Don't, okay?

489
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:19,867
She'll blame herself again if she knows I'm sick.

490
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:23,867
I don't want to hurt Yong Ju.

491
00:31:26,107 --> 00:31:28,506
- Come now, leave. Both of you. - Okay.

492
00:31:28,507 --> 00:31:30,346
- All right. Rest. - Can't we see you sleep?

493
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,875
- No. - Is that a no?

494
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:33,846
- Bye. - Let us see you go to...

495
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:35,475
- Fine. We're leaving. - Sleep, okay?

496
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,446
- We're leaving. - Get some sleep.

497
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:39,317
What...

498
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:46,526
- Let's go straight home. - Okay.

499
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:47,527
Bye.

500
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:52,767
Yong Ju...

501
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:55,797
Why do you look so pale?

502
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,376
And what's with your light clothes? Don't you get cold easily?

503
00:32:01,277 --> 00:32:03,646
A lot has been stressing you out recently, right?

504
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:07,747
Don't worry. I can get the taste right.

505
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:10,586
I'm testing it right now.

506
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:12,617
The second supply will be fine.

507
00:32:19,426 --> 00:32:20,757
I heard you passed out.

508
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:24,196
How unwell were you?

509
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,097
No, I'm fine. I'm all better now.

510
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,936
What about dinner? Did you have some?

511
00:32:31,436 --> 00:32:33,936
You had something simple because you were busy, didn't you?

512
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:35,906
And even had coffee on an empty stomach.

513
00:32:36,277 --> 00:32:37,706
I can totally tell.

514
00:32:39,507 --> 00:32:41,017
But I won't know.

515
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,517
- What? - If you don't tell me,

516
00:32:47,557 --> 00:32:48,817
I won't know.

517
00:32:50,357 --> 00:32:52,787
Whether you're fine or not.

518
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:55,097
How you feel.

519
00:32:56,896 --> 00:32:58,527
I don't know a thing.

520
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:01,797
What is this?

521
00:33:02,396 --> 00:33:04,236
Is it fine as long as you get better?

522
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:06,807
Should I brush it off now that you're not sick anymore?

523
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:11,747
Am I to stay ignorant all the time?

524
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:15,547
Yong Ju.

525
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:18,186
This is nothing to me.

526
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,557
I didn't want to worry you.

527
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:23,756
I don't want to make you worry.

528
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:26,287
Can't you stop making me indebted to you?

529
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:28,725
I told you there was no owing each other in love.

530
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:29,826
How is that true?

531
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:32,625
Doesn't that mean we each need to love each other equally?

532
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:34,066
But we're not, are we?

533
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,037
You're already everything to me, Yong Ju.

534
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:38,906
That's what you think.

535
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:42,577
Remember what I told you?

536
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:45,547
I will...

537
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:49,146
only look at Yoon Min Ju who is before me.

538
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:51,445
That means...

539
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,117
even if you endured things alone in the past,

540
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,486
I want to be with you from now on.

541
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,486
I'm sincere about being together.

542
00:34:00,896 --> 00:34:02,027
I know.

543
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:04,367
I want that too, you know?

544
00:34:04,597 --> 00:34:06,736
But why do you always say you're okay?

545
00:34:08,236 --> 00:34:10,167
Why do you not talk about your pain?

546
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:13,506
You feel my emotions before I do.

547
00:34:13,776 --> 00:34:15,937
You care about my business more than me.

548
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:19,806
But why won't you let me do it?

549
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,016
I can't let you do it.

550
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:23,787
Why not?

551
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:32,827
I know how painful it is to feel...

552
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:38,466
the other person's emotions.

553
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:42,696
I can't possibly let you do that.

554
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:45,707
That hurts me more.

555
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:47,807
That breaks my heart more, okay?

556
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:50,946
If you're in pain because of me.

557
00:34:52,477 --> 00:34:54,046
If you're sad because of me.

558
00:34:54,716 --> 00:34:56,477
And when I feel those emotions,

559
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:01,386
it'll be the end of me.

560
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,426
I'll die, okay?

561
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:06,926
I'm serious.

562
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:15,696
Then...

563
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:20,106
what can I do with you?

564
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:36,057
What...

565
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:42,897
are you trying to tell me right now?

566
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:46,526
You know, don't you?

567
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,167
You felt it.

568
00:35:53,136 --> 00:35:55,207
No, I don't.

569
00:35:58,247 --> 00:35:59,446
I don't know.

570
00:36:20,997 --> 00:36:22,037
We...

571
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:26,167
won't break up.

572
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,247
Instead, it's a truce.

573
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:35,477
Rather than having an emotional fight,

574
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:40,155
let's focus on what each of us must do.

575
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,017
Once we get our emotions sorted out,

576
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:46,486
let's see each other.

577
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:52,566
Okay.

578
00:36:54,236 --> 00:36:55,597
We won't break up.

579
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:22,295
- I know, right? - Yes.

580
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:23,497
My goodness.

581
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:26,066
A truce?

582
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:28,066
What's wrong with him?

583
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:30,266
We need to get going now.

584
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:32,105
At this rate, it'll be impossible.

585
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:34,576
That Ju-Ju couple is so wild.

586
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:36,276
They get on my nerves.

587
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:40,377
What is it? You're scaring me!

588
00:37:40,477 --> 00:37:42,816
Why are you doing something out of the ordinary?

589
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:46,916
Just go to your room on the second floor.

590
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,586
Meditate, will you?

591
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,286
Did he have breakfast?

592
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:53,227
- Gosh, how frustrating. - I know.

593
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:58,227
Stop scaring us.

594
00:37:58,997 --> 00:38:00,796
How about fighting it out with me?

595
00:38:00,937 --> 00:38:03,097
This doesn't suit you at all.

596
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:08,336
Is Mr. Yoon Min Ju doing well?

597
00:38:08,477 --> 00:38:09,836
I don't know. He's weird.

598
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:11,577
All he does is run every day.

599
00:38:12,977 --> 00:38:14,846
He's dying for the day the truce ends.

600
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:17,347
Oh Chan Hwi. Put the vinyl down.

601
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:21,816
Look at her adoring it because it's from Min Ju.

602
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:23,886
What's the use of a truce?

603
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:26,856
Remember we must prepare for Together's second supply next week?

604
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:29,255
You'll have to meet CEO Yoon then.

605
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:31,397
For the sake of us people stuck in the middle,

606
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,026
please unite...

607
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:35,437
as soon as possible.

608
00:38:38,037 --> 00:38:39,267
Let's go, honey.

609
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,077
We should worry about us, not them.

610
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:46,747
What is it? Did something happen?

611
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:49,917
We're the ones with a big war ahead of us.

612
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:52,287
But I'm a pacifist.

613
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:54,256
We're leaving.

614
00:38:56,187 --> 00:38:57,326
- Good luck. - Good luck.

615
00:38:57,327 --> 00:38:58,356
Good luck to you too.

616
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:10,236
This won't make my mom happy.

617
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:13,707
Dad won't even step out.

618
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:16,136
You never know.

619
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:18,207
I might charm them to come out.

620
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:21,247
By the way, if your mom says,

621
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:23,886
"Have you saved some money?"

622
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:27,287
"It's absurd you don't even own a house."

623
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:29,716
What do I do?

624
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:31,586
Why are you worried about that?

625
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:34,897
I'm Bang Ah Reum. I earned financial freedom.

626
00:39:36,026 --> 00:39:37,397
That's not something to worry about.

627
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:40,196
What I'm worried about is persuading my mom.

628
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,037
Why are you worried about that?

629
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:45,037
I'm Oh Chan Hwi.

630
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,377
The guy loved by everyone.

631
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:55,747
Why must we eat outside?

632
00:39:57,287 --> 00:39:59,647
Please wait a bit. I'll bring Father outside.

633
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:00,856
Forget it.

634
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:04,256
He'll never leave the house.

635
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,037
Good grief.

636
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:19,307
Father!

637
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,946
- What's with you? - I'm Oh Chan Hwi.

638
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,506
- "Oh Chan..." - We're...

639
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,946
having brunch outside. Would you like to join us?

640
00:40:28,816 --> 00:40:31,286
No, I'm good. I always eat alone.

641
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:32,917
Leave it over there.

642
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:35,856
No way.

643
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:37,557
Office workers...

644
00:40:37,856 --> 00:40:41,026
wait outside my truck before it opens to eat my toast.

645
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:42,897
This is a golden opportunity.

646
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:46,196
- Doesn't it look amazing? - Well, shall I try a piece?

647
00:40:47,397 --> 00:40:50,097
If you want to eat it, come out to the yard.

648
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:51,466
My gosh.

649
00:40:51,836 --> 00:40:53,167
There's even beer.

650
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:58,046
Hey. Goodness.

651
00:40:59,006 --> 00:41:00,077
Look at him.

652
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:01,776
Oh, my.

653
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:08,986
Really?

654
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:20,066
I heard there was beer.

655
00:41:20,566 --> 00:41:22,267
Yes, we have cold beer.

656
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:31,307
To think I'd drink beer at home.

657
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:33,506
Nobody drinks with me.

658
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:38,647
Don't worry. I'll be your drinking buddy from now on.

659
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:40,386
- Father. - What?

660
00:41:42,017 --> 00:41:43,156
Here. Have a glass.

661
00:41:51,097 --> 00:41:52,627
- Father. - Yes?

662
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:54,796
Right.

663
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,977
That hits the spot!

664
00:42:07,946 --> 00:42:09,276
Why is this split into two?

665
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:12,417
Gosh.

666
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:15,457
No, not that one. Eat this one.

667
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:17,687
Why can't I eat the piece of apple I want to?

668
00:42:18,957 --> 00:42:21,156
She wants you to eat the biggest and prettiest piece.

669
00:42:21,827 --> 00:42:24,597
This one's the prettiest. Right, Mother?

670
00:42:26,466 --> 00:42:27,566
Acting like you know it all.

671
00:42:28,097 --> 00:42:30,836
Do you think this will make me approve of your marriage?

672
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:33,037
You're totally mistaken.

673
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:36,136
I'm going back inside first.

674
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:50,057
- I enjoyed the meal. - Sure.

675
00:42:50,856 --> 00:42:52,356
We're still here, you know!

676
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:57,196
You can't go back inside like that.

677
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:05,835
I think I won him over about 98 percent.

678
00:43:05,836 --> 00:43:06,906
Right?

679
00:43:08,307 --> 00:43:11,176
Let's just go through with it. My mom will never approve.

680
00:43:13,546 --> 00:43:16,175
I can't allow that.

681
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,086
You shouldn't be treated this way.

682
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:19,985
All that matters is us.

683
00:43:19,986 --> 00:43:23,886
I'm going to win their approval...

684
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,526
and have them bless our marriage.

685
00:43:29,926 --> 00:43:33,667
I'm going to see your father walk you down the aisle,

686
00:43:34,597 --> 00:43:36,367
bow down to your father,

687
00:43:38,037 --> 00:43:39,336
and take your hand from his.

688
00:43:56,057 --> 00:43:57,686
Have you heard that we should make sure...

689
00:43:57,687 --> 00:43:59,327
our everyday items are pretty to look at?

690
00:44:09,997 --> 00:44:11,966
Really? You like songs like this too?

691
00:44:12,906 --> 00:44:13,906
What about now?

692
00:44:13,907 --> 00:44:15,877
How did I ever function without Yoon Min Ju?

693
00:44:26,946 --> 00:44:28,457
It's not him.

694
00:44:30,256 --> 00:44:31,356
Hey, sir.

695
00:44:32,926 --> 00:44:34,497
Is it finally tasting how it should?

696
00:44:34,827 --> 00:44:36,597
What a relief!

697
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,566
Sure, I'll order them to be released right away.

698
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,836
Has CEO Yoon been there...

699
00:44:44,537 --> 00:44:46,767
He never sticks around for a chit-chat.

700
00:44:52,946 --> 00:44:56,176
Well, I should check the progress of Together.

701
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:57,516
I'm only going there...

702
00:44:57,517 --> 00:44:59,485
since it's my responsibility as a project manager.

703
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:00,557
Of course.

704
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,996
It is inappropriate to break through enemy lines...

705
00:45:13,997 --> 00:45:15,195
when we called a truce.

706
00:45:15,196 --> 00:45:17,636
That is why I came bearing news.

707
00:45:18,307 --> 00:45:20,877
You probably heard that Together was back to its original quality.

708
00:45:21,977 --> 00:45:23,236
I worked many nights...

709
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:25,647
to bring you this news.

710
00:45:32,386 --> 00:45:34,256
- What is this? - Isn't it obvious?

711
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:35,716
I just crossed the line.

712
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,156
Come on. I have something to say.

713
00:45:50,566 --> 00:45:52,536
You prefer rice while I like bread,

714
00:45:52,537 --> 00:45:55,136
so I will alternate when cooking breakfast.

715
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:57,246
You like scary movies while I can't stand them.

716
00:45:57,247 --> 00:45:58,545
I prefer romance.

717
00:45:58,546 --> 00:45:59,876
I'm sorry to say this,

718
00:45:59,877 --> 00:46:01,247
but I won't go gun shooting with you again.

719
00:46:01,446 --> 00:46:02,476
It was boring.

720
00:46:02,477 --> 00:46:04,186
Also, don't stick to drinking beer only from your company...

721
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:06,246
and enjoy other brands with me from time to time.

722
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:08,756
There are so many types of beer in this world to...

723
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:12,026
And then... Wait, there's more.

724
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,096
Beer and...

725
00:46:14,097 --> 00:46:15,957
I love you, Min Ju.

726
00:46:19,597 --> 00:46:21,997
- What was that? - I said I loved you. Why?

727
00:46:22,437 --> 00:46:23,497
Goodness.

728
00:46:27,606 --> 00:46:29,577
(Beom: Read this!)

729
00:46:29,807 --> 00:46:31,807
Have you tried the new beer from Jisang Liquor?

730
00:46:32,106 --> 00:46:33,506

733
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:40,017
- What's this? - There's already an article on it.

734
00:46:43,586 --> 00:46:44,756
Hold on.

735
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,596
Hello. Are you available for an interview?

736
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:54,196
- It'll be brief. - You haven't admitted anything yet.

737
00:46:54,997 --> 00:46:56,596
- Over here. - Can you say a few words?

738
00:46:56,597 --> 00:46:58,036
- Stop. - Where do you stand?

739
00:46:58,037 --> 00:46:59,267
Could you say a few words?

740
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,807
Yes, this is Jisang Liquor.

741

Yes, this is Jisang Liquor.

742
00:47:06,506 --> 00:47:07,775
Yes, this is Jisang Liquor.

743
00:47:07,776 --> 00:47:10,276
- No, that news article... - Thank you.

744
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:13,146
- Yes, of course. - Absolutely.

745
00:47:13,147 --> 00:47:14,187

- Did you read the news article? - What do we do?

748
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:24,396
Reporters are calling nonstop.

749
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:25,896
We're doing our best to hold the articles,

750
00:47:25,897 --> 00:47:27,397
but they're spreading like wildfire.

751
00:47:32,437 --> 00:47:34,376
- First, - We'll call you back.

752
00:47:34,377 --> 00:47:36,207
I have a meeting to attend.

753
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:46,147
What now?

754
00:47:46,316 --> 00:47:49,057
You should've reported any problems we had!

755
00:47:49,687 --> 00:47:51,787
You should've told me...

756
00:47:52,256 --> 00:47:55,626
that there was an issue with the first batch of beer!

757
00:47:55,627 --> 00:47:58,695
I'm sorry, sir. I was hoping to solve it on my end.

758
00:47:58,696 --> 00:48:00,496
- Unbelievable. - The news must've reached...

759
00:48:00,497 --> 00:48:01,767
the chairman by now.

760
00:48:02,097 --> 00:48:03,896
This is exactly why...

761
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:05,937
I was against this project from the start.

762
00:48:06,106 --> 00:48:09,206
Let's be honest. Every time we launch a new product,

763
00:48:09,207 --> 00:48:11,546
our competitors slander us using the media...

764
00:48:12,077 --> 00:48:14,517
saying that it's too cloudy and has sediments.

765
00:48:14,776 --> 00:48:17,647
Besides, the product itself was of adequate quality.

766
00:48:17,946 --> 00:48:21,557
The consumers are questioning the quality of the beer.

767
00:48:21,716 --> 00:48:24,017
It tastes different from bottle to bottle,

768
00:48:24,256 --> 00:48:26,926
and they're saying we've been deceiving the public.

769
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:38,766
First of all, we issued a rebuttal article...

770
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:40,706
to fight off any rumours...

771
00:48:40,707 --> 00:48:42,836
that have been calling Together defective.

772
00:48:43,506 --> 00:48:45,576
The problem though is that the articles...

773
00:48:45,577 --> 00:48:47,176
are spreading too quickly online via social media.

774
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:49,847
I'm afraid it's already out of our hands.

775
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:53,146
Who did this? Who would do such a thing?

776
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:56,986
Judging by how fast the rumours spread online,

777
00:48:57,557 --> 00:48:58,585
there's a good chance...

778
00:48:58,586 --> 00:49:00,585
that this was set up by a vindictive someone...

779
00:49:00,586 --> 00:49:02,557
who knew about our quality issue.

780
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:03,897
Find who it is.

781
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:06,767
Find out who's responsible. Whoever that is.

782
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:09,836
It was an inside job.

783
00:49:10,636 --> 00:49:13,267
Some jerk either received a bribe from Baekmok Liquor...

784
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:16,206
or is in cahoots with them.

785
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:18,477
Finding who's responsible isn't the pressing matter.

786
00:49:18,776 --> 00:49:20,747
Can't you see the mess the company is in?

787
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:26,986
Shut down the production of the new beer.

788
00:49:27,957 --> 00:49:29,057
That's our best option.

789
00:49:29,586 --> 00:49:32,155
If you don't, this will tank our company image.

790
00:49:32,156 --> 00:49:34,227
Are you even hearing yourself?

791
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:36,356
This project cost a fortune!

792
00:49:41,397 --> 00:49:43,536
This is one hectic weekend.

793
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:45,466
I knew something like this would happen.

794
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:47,236
Hold on.

795
00:49:48,176 --> 00:49:50,706
Did you know what was going to happen?

796
00:49:50,707 --> 00:49:52,676
Be honest, Mr. Kim.

797
00:49:52,877 --> 00:49:55,617
He's a human lie detector.

798
00:49:56,347 --> 00:49:57,946

799
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:00,046
I don't know anything.

800
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:01,957
I mean it.

801
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:06,787
That's a lie.

802
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:10,196
What would I know? I'm being wronged.

803
00:50:18,006 --> 00:50:20,367
- That's a lie. - Why are you on my case...

804
00:50:20,537 --> 00:50:23,006
when it's annoying enough that I had to come to work on a weekend?

805
00:50:24,006 --> 00:50:26,676
I have nothing, absolutely nothing,

806
00:50:27,046 --> 00:50:29,077
to do with what's going on.

807
00:50:34,486 --> 00:50:36,687
Could you describe in detail...

808
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:40,856
what exactly is going on around here?

809
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:48,367
Yes, Baekmok.

810
00:50:49,597 --> 00:50:51,606
The news articles will be taken care of on my end.

811
00:50:52,106 --> 00:50:55,836
However, spreading rumours online is what you do best.

812

816
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:23,597
Director Yeom never gives me any important work.

817
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:25,367
He's telling the truth.

818
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:27,977

It's the company's start date.

823

Because he doesn't trust others,

824
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:53,996
he writes important documents himself.

825
00:51:53,997 --> 00:51:56,135
Since he never knows when he'll need them,

826

he always stores backup files.

about the new beer being developed by the TF Team.

859

860

865

Or should I deal with it in my own way?

871
00:54:18,707 --> 00:54:20,176
This is all your fault!

872
00:54:21,247 --> 00:54:23,616

892

00:56:50,127 --> 00:56:51,866
to see me for who I am.

911
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:52,997
Do you know why?

912
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:55,397
Because that one person...

913
00:56:56,196 --> 00:56:58,207
proves that I lived my life well,

914
00:56:59,906 --> 00:57:01,167
and furthermore,

915
00:57:03,176 --> 00:57:04,747
makes me be more of myself.

916
00:57:06,877 --> 00:57:09,316
If you haven't even tried to find that one person,

917
00:57:10,776 --> 00:57:12,386
apologize to yourself.

918
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:15,187
As if you know anything.

919
00:57:15,716 --> 00:57:17,687
I didn't come here to patronize you...

920
00:57:18,627 --> 00:57:20,086
or offer words of comfort.

921
00:57:20,727 --> 00:57:25,196
I only came here because I knew I'd regret not saying this to you.

922
00:57:47,316 --> 00:57:49,556
We will recall every bottle manufactured...

923
00:57:49,557 --> 00:57:52,227
and offer refunds to consumers who have already bought any.

924
00:57:52,586 --> 00:57:55,195
Mr. Yoon, in the meantime, you will prepare for its relaunch.

925
00:57:55,196 --> 00:57:56,456
As for me, I'm off to deal...

926
00:57:56,457 --> 00:57:58,926
with the scoundrel at Baekmok Liquor.

927
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,497
Those who spread false rumours and write malicious comments online...

928
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:03,867
should be taught a lesson.

929
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:05,636
Then...

930
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,106
All right.

931
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:09,836
Hold on.

932
00:58:10,276 --> 00:58:12,976
Should any problems arise, call me instantly...

933
00:58:12,977 --> 00:58:16,347
Ms. Chae, don't burden yourself with every task.

934
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:19,146
Yong Ju, let us carry the burden with you.

935
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:20,886
We're a team, aren't we?

936
00:58:21,086 --> 00:58:23,386
Exactly. We're a united team.

937
00:58:24,656 --> 00:58:26,727
What do you say? How about we wish us luck?

938
00:58:30,656 --> 00:58:31,727
Sure.

939
00:58:33,097 --> 00:58:34,466
What...

940
00:58:35,466 --> 00:58:37,796
- We still can't get it right. - Just get moving.

941
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:42,336
Let's get it right the next time.

942
00:58:42,776 --> 00:58:44,306
- Okay? - We should raise our hands, right?

943
00:58:44,307 --> 00:58:45,675
We'll decide on that some other time.

944
00:58:45,676 --> 00:58:47,476
- Go on. I wish you luck. - Good luck.

945
00:58:47,477 --> 00:58:48,746
- I'll see you later. - I wish you luck.

946
00:58:48,747 --> 00:58:50,347
- See you later. - I'll get going.

947
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:51,946
See you.

948
00:58:52,187 --> 00:58:53,386
- Good luck. - Right.

949
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:55,216
I wish you luck too.

950
00:59:22,946 --> 00:59:25,086
(Jisang Liquor)

951
00:59:36,296 --> 00:59:38,597
(Jisang Liquor)

952
00:59:43,466 --> 00:59:45,606
- Want to join me for coffee? - I'm good.

953
01:00:19,636 --> 01:00:20,636
(Jisang Liquor)

954
01:00:20,637 --> 01:00:22,577
Sir, a glass of soju seems to be in order.

955
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,546
Gosh, your shoulders. They couldn't be stiffer.

956
01:00:26,446 --> 01:00:29,046
- This calls for a manual massage. - I hear you.

957
01:00:34,986 --> 01:00:36,386
Would it kill him to join us?

958
01:01:02,276 --> 01:01:03,417
Mr. Park.

959
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:06,117
The company chat room is blowing up.

960
01:01:06,216 --> 01:01:08,986
The director of the Planning Team got the boot.

961
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,957
Sure, we should meet up right away.

962
01:01:11,756 --> 01:01:12,886
I'm leaving the office as we speak.

963
01:01:16,097 --> 01:01:19,097
Exactly. Talk about the unexpected.

964
01:01:19,497 --> 01:01:20,566
I'll be right out.

965
01:01:29,136 --> 01:01:30,477
Not a single person...

966
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:34,377
has called.

967
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:56,897
(Planning Team Director Yeom Jang Goon)

968
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:09,546
(Planning Team Director Yeom Jang Goon)

969
01:02:26,127 --> 01:02:29,536
(Planning Team Director Yeom Jang Goon)

970
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:34,236
(Letter of Resignation)

971
01:02:39,377 --> 01:02:42,617
Some things in this world can be messed with...

972
01:02:43,077 --> 01:02:45,946
while some things in this world are sacred.

973
01:02:46,886 --> 01:02:50,787
Together should've been off-limits from beginning to end.

974
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,086
That's right.

975
01:02:52,957 --> 01:02:54,687
What you did was wrong.

976
01:03:28,926 --> 01:03:31,767
(Brewing Love)

977
01:03:32,426 --> 01:03:34,796
I know it was rough, Yong Ju.

978
01:03:34,926 --> 01:03:37,897
You did great, Chae Yong Ju.

979
01:03:38,437 --> 01:03:40,335
- Oh Chan Ran? - My name at birth.

980
01:03:40,336 --> 01:03:42,077
Only my family remembers it.

981
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,706
It's about time you dealt with the closing of the Busan office.

982
01:03:45,707 --> 01:03:47,206
You're coming too, right?

983
01:03:47,207 --> 01:03:48,876
Absolutely not.

984
01:03:48,877 --> 01:03:52,085
It's okay. Do whatever it is you want now.

985
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:55,517
Not being certain of something is also who you are.

986
01:03:55,716 --> 01:03:58,886
And I even love the indecisive Chae Yong Ju.
