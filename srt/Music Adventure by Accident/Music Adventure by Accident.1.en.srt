by accident)

(A man's music travelogue)

3
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,490
There was a time I told my mom,

4
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,490
"I signed a contract with a music agency."

5
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,260
"What if I release an album?"

6
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,860
Here was what my mom said.

7
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,630
"Hee Min."

8
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,670
"Haven't you been criticized
enough already?"

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,109
"Release an album,
and you'll be criticized more harshly."

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,870
"Don't do it."

11
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:58,279
Some may laugh at me for saying this,

12
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:02,079
but to be honest, I've always been ready.

13
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,850
I'm over 40 now.

14
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:07,459
I'm too old...

15
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,789
to listen to my mom.

(Cheering)

28

You didn't drink soju by yourself,
did you?

29
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,660
(It's a snowball fight in July!)

30
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,429

(This isn't a trip.)

40

(Lee Seung Hoon)

54
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:35,739
The vibe is different.

55
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,970
It was about half a year ago.

56
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,310
- Yes.
- It ended in February of this year.

57
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,310
When "Adventure by Accident 3" ended,

58
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,319
the audience had nothing to watch
on Sunday.

59
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,579
Was it that good?

60
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,919
You had the whole nation
twisted around your finger.

61
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,250
- I did?
- Stop being humble.

62
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,220
- Thank you.
- Many were bummed out.

63
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,729
We returned ambitiously with
a groundbreaking season this hot summer.

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,199

65
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,329
- Since Kian84, Seung Hoon,
- Yes?

66
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,100
- Si Eon, who's not here,
- Yes?

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,940
and I like bikes,

68
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,009
- we went to Japan together.
- We did.

69
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:13,910
Our adventures continued.

70
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,609
- That's nice.
- During our break.

71
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,310
- Hold on. Since earlier,
- Yes?

72
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,079
- Let's see.
- something's been shining next to me.

73
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,220
- Wait, the radiance is...
- The light...

74
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,789
- Who is he?
- Yoo Teo is sitting right there.

75
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:25,919
It's Yoo Teo. My goodness.

76
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,859
Hi. I'm actor Yoo Teo.

77
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:33,999
(A man with both...)

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,499

(Actor Yoo Teo)

83
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,809
By the way, you have a boyish charm...

84
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:50,910
and a masculine charm.

85
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,080
- Yes.
- But watching the short footage just now,

86
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,150
you seemed like Kian84.

87
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,419
He's very pure.

88
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,660
There are people who pretend.

89
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,960
- But he doesn't?
- He doesn't.

90
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,660
He's right.
Teo is a very transparent person.

91
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,929
- He's also honest.
- Yes.

92
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:09,460
He's a lot like a boy.

93
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,429
I lived in New York for about seven years.

94
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,010
But I experienced new things
even in New York.

95
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,640
I've always wanted
to go on an unplanned...

96
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:22,309
and spontaneous trip during my life.

97
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,679
It made my heart pound
and was on my bucket list.

98
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,879
Is that so?

99
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,350
Upon hearing we were going to the US,
I thought it'd be a leisurely trip,

100
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,419
which would give us a break.

101
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,619
But it was as intense as the other seasons
of "Adventure by Accident."

102
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,460
- It was fun.
- I can say it with confidence.

103
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,859
Do look forward to it.

104
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:41,660
(Do look forward to it!)

105
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,929
(A red clay lodging in Pocheon
1 month before the trip)

106
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,299
It's already sad.

107
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,499
He's Director Kim Ji Woo.

108
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:47,539
It always starts like that.

109
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:48,739
The season always starts sad.

110
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:51,070
Where on earth is the table?
I've always wanted to ask.

111
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,309
Do you remember when we first came here?

112
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,809
I think it was just a year ago.

113
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,179
Now that you say it,
it was just a year ago.

114
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:02,179
Right?

115
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:04,189
We came after our trip to India.

116
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,749
No. We came before that.

117
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:06,890
- Before that?
- Yes.

118
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,919
We talked about it before that.

119
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,030
It's been half a year
since "Adventure by Accident" ended.

120
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,330
- A lot happened in the meantime.
- Time flies.

121
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,169
- Whenever you meet people,
- Yes?

122
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,470
you ask them what they want to do...

123
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:23,669
and what their dream is.

124
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,140
Yes. He asked the children.

125
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,869
(In the first destination, South America)

126
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,439
Yes, I remember.

127
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,939
(I want to become an entrepreneur.)

128
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,950
The baby monks.

129
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,850
(Even in the third destination,
Madagascar)

130
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,320
(He always asked their dream.)

131
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,989
Here's my reason.

132
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:43,760
(Why do you always ask about their dream?)

133
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,590
I'm always in the holiday spirit.

134
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,559
It's like, "Are you studying hard?"
And you can't answer it.

135
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,600
Like an uncle.

136
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,499
Honestly speaking, the people around me...

137
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:54,400
barely talk about their dreams.

138
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,140
What I found different about myself
from others is that...

139
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,340
- I keep doing things.
- Right.

140
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,280
- I drew comics, appeared on TV shows,
- Yes?

141
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,010
and acted in the past.

142
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,249
(Starting off as a comic artist,)

143
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,760
(he appeared on TV shows by accident.)

144
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,419
- You look like a baby.
- How young.

145
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,689
- You look so young.
- My gosh.

146
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,859
(He took up a new challenge of acting.)

147
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:21,999
Goodness, look how young you were.

148
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:25,700
(And he even won
the Entertainment Award Grand Prize.)

149
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
That was cool.

150
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:28,169
It was a touching Grand Prize.

151
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,609
(Kian84 kept achieving things.)

152
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,239
- Stuff like that...
- Yes?

153
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,979
- is fun.
- Right.

154
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,450
Do you have a dream you couldn't achieve?

155
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,780
From what we see, Kian84's dream
has already come true.

156
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,020
My dream was to become a singer.

157
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:47,189
It's clearly written
in Sohwa Elementary School's yearbook.

158
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:48,619
"My dream is to become a singer."

159
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,460
- It's true.
- What a surprise.

160
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,200
I always listen to the news,
current affairs,

161
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,929
- and things like that.
- Right.

162
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,669
They do nothing to me.

163
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,100
But music still...

164
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,539
touches my soul.

165
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,010
It makes me emotional.

166
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,280
I shed tears while singing at karaoke.

167
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,950
There wasn't a time I cried
while watching dramas or movies.

168
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:17,749
But music still has the power to move me.

169
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,460
My heart is a rough gemstone.

170
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,919
It needs someone to craft it.

171
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:28,600
(His exhausted and dried-up feelings
are still...)

172
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,359
(moved by music.)

173
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,400
Good grief.

174
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,570
I know how that feels.

175
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,340
You can feel the sincerity in the music.

176
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,479
(The dream he always had
like a one-sided crush)

177
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,539
That's the life I dreamed of.

178
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,010
Singers shined to me.

179
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:52,119
The title of the show this time
isn't "Adventure by Accident."

180
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,090
It's Music Adventure...

181
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,820
by Accident.

182
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,229
- "Music Adventure?"
- Yes.

183
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,159
So that was how
Music Adventure by Accident...

184
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,859
- happened.
- We're going to a country of freedom...

185
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,759
where you can express yourself wildly.

186
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,999
It's the country of full freedom.

187
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,570
- And that's the US.
- "The US?"

188
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,139
- Gosh.
- He loves it.

189
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,180
(From the King of Rock and Roll
Elvis Presley)

190
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,909
- Elvis Presley.
- He's so cool.

191
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:20,920
(To the King of Pop Michael Jackson)

192
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,450
- Jackson!
- Beat it!

193
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,050
(Beyonce)

194
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,389
- I know each and every song.
- Right?

195
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:28,460
(Eminem)

196
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,560
(Lady Gaga)

197
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,729
Just the names itself make my heart pound.

198
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,330
- Isn't the US crazy?
- They're global artists.

199
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,399
The legends.

200
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,800
This is a hit song everyone knows.

201
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,409
(The sacred place of music, the US,
and...)

202
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,970
(and Kian84's personality,)

203
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,639
(which changes nature
into a fried chicken...)

204
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:53,149
(and the afterlife into a happy place,
meet.)

205
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:54,149
But...

206
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,290
the thought that Kian84
will make music like them...

207
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,749
- doesn't make sense.
- Right?

208
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:01,489
It was Beyonce, Stevie Wonder,

209
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:03,220
- then Kian84.
- Kian84 popped up next.

210
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,560
That was a natural flow.

211
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:10,029
(Incheon International Airport,
The day of departure)

212
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,639
- That's when you're the most excited.
- It's the airport.

213
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,540
The airport gets you the most excited.

214
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,070
Hi.

215
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,580
(His easy-going footsteps...)

216
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:23,009
(I'll show you something.)

217
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,550
(were uploaded onto social media.)

218
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,019
- "I'll show you something."
- It's Hyun Moo.

219
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:29,649
He wore those during a show.

220
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:33,960
(The same outfit
as the previous day's recording?)

221
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,220
After recording "Home Alone"
the previous day,

222
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,359
I slept at a nearby motel.

223
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:41,899
- It's the life of a celebrity.
- Right.

224
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,470
I wonder what events
will be waiting for us.

225
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,940
It's time for me to leave again.

226
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,369
I can see how excited you are.

227
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,670
- Your flight ticket.
- Okay.

228
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:54,779
Prices are high in the US,
so I prepared a generous amount.

229
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,879
The dollar exchange rate is currently...

230
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,409
You're going to the most expensive
country.

231
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,649
Let's see how much Director Kim gave me.

232
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:01,720
(Knows the international financial trend)

233
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:05,090
One, two, three, four, five,

234
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,460
six, seven, eight...

235
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,759
- Twenty? Gosh.
- He gave you a lot this time.

236
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,960
(If there's 22 of 100 dollars...)

237
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Twenty-two in total.

238
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,029
(Using his brain)

239
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,159
I got 220 dollars.

240
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,399
(2,200 dollars)

241
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,600
I got twice the amount
when we went to Madagascar.

242
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,269
- You're right.
- But I used it up much faster.

243
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,109
Hi, it's Kian84.

244
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:32,779
It's been a while
since the last Kian84 TV.

245
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,680
Let me show you what I packed.

246
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,850
Clothes-wise,
I brought one pair of pants and underwear.

247
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,690
Since I have to be stylish...

248
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,489
in the US, I packed two tops.

249
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:45,729
You took two?

250
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,729
Aren't those new?
I haven't seen them before.

251
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:50,499
I bought new clothes.

252
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:51,529
You packed a lot.

253
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:55,769
This is the bag Porpi gave me
when he came to Korea.

254
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,509
Kian84.

255
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,940
(Porpi, a local friend he met
in South America)

256
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:05,479
(Porpi flew to Korea
and gifted him the bag.)

257
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,220
Carrying that bag around
made me feel at ease.

258
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,550
- Like a guardian angel?
- Yes, it put me at ease.

259
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,619
Are you doing well, Porpi?

260
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:13,889
(Taking the Porpi bag on this trip)

261
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:15,889
Our first destination is...

262
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,690
New York. It only takes 14 hours.

263
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,029
On this show,

264
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,359
a 14-hour trip is short,

265
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,100
like going to Daegu.

266
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,369
It doesn't feel that far.

267
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,440
So I'm not that worried.

268
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,139
The 14-hour trip felt like visiting
my next-door neighbor.

269
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:33,540
It's considered a domestic flight
in this show.

270
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,609
Relatively speaking.

271
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:36,540
<i>Do you remember?</i>

272
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,909
(He can't help but hum.)

273
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:40,820
<i>The 21st night of September</i>

274
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,879
- He took a direct flight to New York.
- Yes.

275
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,550
(JFK Airport, New York, USA)

276
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,389
(Arrived at JFK Airport, New York)

277
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,930
(Tired)

278
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,930
The departure checkpoint is no joke.

279
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,200
The immigration checkpoint is strict.
It's tough.

280
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,639
I heard the US
was the most powerful country...

281
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,570
and thought they'd be quick
to handle things.

282
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,440
Korea is fast.

283
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,509
- Yes. Korea is on the quick side.
- I'm disappointed.

284
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,550
Thank you.

285
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,879
(Sniffing)

286
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:19,920
This is how New York smells.

287
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:23,659
- Was that your 1st time in the US?
- It was my 1st time.

288
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:24,690
- His first time?
- Gosh.

289
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,290
- What? Really?
- I've been to LA before.

290
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,460
LA is in the US.

291
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,229
It was 6 to 7 years ago.

292
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,139
(He's been to LA but not the US.)

293
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,739
(Making his first steps
while smelling New York)

294
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,580
(Trying to take a taxi first)

295
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,979
Just a moment.

296
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:45,479
- Those yellow taxis are famous.
- The yellow cab?

297
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,420
That's right.
Those appear in movies a lot.

298
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,450
It's like you should get in the taxi
with a bagel...

299
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,790
and coffee in your hands.

300
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:58,460
(A foreign yet familiar feeling)

301
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,460
Excuse me?

302
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,259
Do you go to Manhattan?

303
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,930
Go? Okay.

304
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,639
Do you know this place? Plaza Hotel?

305
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:10,170
- You're going to the Plaza Hotel?
- Plaza Hotel?

306
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,409
- Do you know the Plaza Hotel?
- Yes, it was in "Home Alone."

307
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:13,710
- I remember.
- So you knew.

308
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
First off,

309
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,609
- I need to find an accommodation.
- Are you paying in cash or credit card?

310
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,220
- What?
- We can hear English.

311
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,080
Cash or credit card?

312
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,350
(Struggling)

313
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,989
Gas or car?

314
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,359
Gas or car?

315
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:32,159
(Gas or car?)

316
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:35,029
(What?)

317
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,430
"Gas or car?"

318
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,460
(Gosh, Kian84.)

319
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:39,629
Gas or car?

320
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,999
Let's see.

321
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,609
I...

322
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:50,440
- Cash?
- Yes.

323
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,050
- Cash? Money?
- Yes.

324
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,749
What money?

325
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:58,290
The meter?

326
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,220
- The driver is confused.
- He's puzzled.

327
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,590
You go. You want to go.

328
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,759
- "You want to go?"
- Why would he go?

329
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,859
(A smothering communication gap)

330
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,029
Why did you make him uncomfortable?

331
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:14,470
You see, my brain needed time to think...

332
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,800
- in English after six months.
- My side hurts.

333
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,040
- "Gas or car?"
- "What money?"

334
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,239
- The driver can go as he wants.
- "You want to go?"

335
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,450
(They couldn't communicate but set off.)

336
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,009
How long will it take?

337
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:28,220
- One hour.
- "One hour?"

338
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,850
The minimum fare is 70 dollars.

339
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,859
(70 dollars is a fixed price
from the airport to Manhattan.)

340
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,460
It's...

341
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,859
(If it's 70 dollars...)

342
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,359
- about 8,000 won.
- "About 8,000 won?"

343
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:43,300
- Eight thousand won.
- You're totally out of touch.

344
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:46,070
How will you survive in the US?

345
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:48,840
We should give Kian84 his pay in dollars
from now on.

346
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:50,840
Just give him in dollars.

347
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,570
Reduce it tenfold.

348
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,570
(A discount in pay due to miscalculation)

349
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,639
My sides hurt.

350
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,639
- I live in a different world.
- It hurts.

351
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,680
How funny.

352
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,920
(Going downtown
using both English and math)

353
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,649
I'll go to an accommodation first.

354
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,420
There's only one accommodation I know
in New York.

355
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,690
It's the Plaza Hotel...

356
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,259
Kevin stayed...

357
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:16,330
in New York 30 years ago.

358
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,029
My dream was to go there
when I was little.

359
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,300
- Same here.
- Me too.

360
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,540
When I first went to New York,

361
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,940
that was the only accommodation
I could think of.

362
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:29,680
I went there
without looking into how much it was.

363
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,279
- It's likely expensive.
- It's a five-star hotel.

364
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:39,220
(Thoughtlessly going to Manhattan)

365
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,920
I can see it.

366
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,389
Gosh.

367
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,759
If we keep going...

368
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:48,100
- It's New York.
- It's actually New York.

369
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,200
I'm finally in the best city...

370
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:54,999
Manhattan, New York.

371
00:16:56,869 --> 00:16:57,970
The city among cities.

372
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,769
(The city among cities)

373
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,379
You can't help
but want to work in New York...

374
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:03,710
inside those buildings.

375
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,519
- Do Yeon?
- Yes?

376
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,019
(Ready?)

377
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,290
(Ready? Yes.)

378
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,350
Let me inform you about New York...

379
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,489
you must be wondering about.

380
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:17,359
I was dying for this moment.

381
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,590
- You all know New York, right?
- Of course.

382
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,530
<i>In New York</i>

383
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:25,770
(You know this song, right?)

384
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,300
(Laughing)

385
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,899
- You should've gone to New York instead.
- Listen.

386
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,040
Manhattan, the Bronx,

387
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,070
Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.

388
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,980
New York is comprised of five boroughs.

389
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,609
It is the largest city
located in the northeastern US.

390
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,750
As the center of economy, culture, and art
not only in the US but also globally,

391
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,689
- it's named the capital of the world.
- Gosh.

392
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,619
A city symbolizing freedom and diversity
where many races live together.

393
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,689
A city robust of various music.

394
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,760
Called the most loved city
by people around the world,

395
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,959
- it's New York!
- New York!

396
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:01,939
Goodness.

397
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,810
That over there.

398
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,379
Wasn't this place
where Spiderman flew here and there?

399
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,679
- Yes.
- In "Spiderman."

400
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,080
(It feels like Spiderman
could appear at any moment.)

401
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,449
It's amazing.

402
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,480
This kind of place wasn't seen
in "Adventure by Accident."

403
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,389
(Oh, my goodness)

404
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,290
Kevin!

405
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,790
(They arrived at the Plaza Hotel.)

406
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,459
Oh, that's the Plaza Hotel.

407
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,230
Driver, here.

408
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,230
(Sir, this is my destination, right?)

409
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,800
Thank you.

410
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,840
- It's 120 dollars.
- Including tips.

411
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,510
Not just taxi drivers,
but people in the US...

412
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,040
have earned money
through tips for a long time.

413
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,740
They earn a living through tips.

414
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,840
(It's a must to tip people
in service industries!)

415
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,679
(He has finally arrived
at the city center of New York City.)

416
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,679
Okay.

417
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:53,520
(This place stirred
his childhood 30 years ago.)

418
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:55,889
(The Plaza Hotel,
which was in his imagination)

419
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,730
- This is the Plaza Hotel.
- This is the Plaza Hotel.

420
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:03,230
(Did 41-year-old Kevin's dream come true?)

421
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,669
Being in a developed country...

422
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:07,669
doesn't feel like "Adventure by Accident."

423
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,169
(On every road we traveled,)

424
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:12,340
(there were traps.)

425
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:13,969
(Chaos and noise were
part of everyday life.)

426
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:15,609
- Gosh, I remember that.
- Be careful.

427
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,209
We felt humanity, and it was wild.

428
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:23,580
(He feels bewildered
by the unfamiliar sensation.)

429
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:25,949
(Well...)

430
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:28,189
(He doesn't enter but walks by.)

431
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:29,719
- Why?
- Why is he not going in?

432
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,790
On the way here, I did a quick search.

433
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,629
I found some information
about the fees on the map.

434
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,230
It was 680 dollars per night.

435
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:38,669
It's 1,000,000 Korean won per night.

436
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:39,699
(It's 1,000,000 Korean won per night.)

437
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:40,699
That's too expensive!

438
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,070
I received 22 hundred-dollar bills.

439
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,770
I had to use 7 bills
to spend a night there.

440
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,879
It was impossible. It was too expensive.

441
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:49,709
- That's too bad.
- But it's so expensive.

442
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:50,980
I gave up spending the night there.

443
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,580
I felt something
just by looking at the external building.

444
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,179
To feel Kevin's childhood,
you need 680 dollars.

445
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,389
(Where shall I go now?)

446
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:03,419
And then...

447
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,899
this is the Central Park.

448
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:09,000
(Central Park)

449
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,629
I think we have this in Dongtan, Songdo,

450
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,399
and other 20 cities,

451
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:16,770
but this is the original Central Park.

452
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,109
I thought Central Park was
originally from Dongtan.

453
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,379
Is it a franchise?

454
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:23,010
- I'm not sure.
- Is it a franchise park?

455
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Maybe it's directly managed
from the headquarters.

456
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,379
Directly managed from the headquarters?

457
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,550
- Maybe, yes.
- My goodness.

458
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,550
(Kian84 always thinks out of the box.)

459
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,449
(He wanders to find Central Park,
the headquarters.)

460
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:32,090
The weather is nice. All good.

461
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,320
I'm hungry.

462
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:37,219
There are many food trucks
around Central Park.

463
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,500
I haven't had a proper meal
since coming to the US.

464
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:45,800
(He passes the hamburger truck.)

465
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,310
Even in front of the Central Park,

466
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,939
people sell the same fake products.

467
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,449
I thought there wouldn't be any fake goods
in New York City but it was the same.

468
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:00,149
- It was the same.
- There is no big difference.

469
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,379
Chicken over rice?

470
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,149
Can I have one chicken over rice?

471
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:07,490
(Ordering his first meal in New York City)

472
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,590
- It looks delicious.
- Oh, my!

473
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,290
New York city is famous...

474
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,429
for their street halal foods.

475
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:15,100
- I didn't know. I saw the chicken rice.
- Yes.

476
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,159
That's very delicious.

477
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,100
I like it. I eat it when I go there.

478
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,770
- Halal food.
- Yes, halal food.

479
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,000
(The chef looks trustworthy.)

480
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:25,369
Oh, he crushes it.

481
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,139
(He's looking forward to his first meal
in New York City.)

482
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Thank you.

483
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,540
It looks so good.

484
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,709
American food is expensive
but the portion is huge.

485
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,550
It looks delicious.

486
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:40,520
(He explores the park
after buying his lunch.)

487
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,459
It's beautiful.

488
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,060
Being in the park makes you happy.

489
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,060
Just the park itself.

490
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,030
It's nice that they have
a lot of greeneries.

491
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,830
There are many wild animals too.

492
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:56,570
(Looking for a place to eat)

493
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,609
(The New Yorkers are enjoying
their lunch on the grass.)

494
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,740
This spot is nice.

495
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:05,409
(He follows the New Yorkers
and looks for his place.)

496
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,780
Eating on the grass.

497
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,350
He's a New Yorker.

498
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,080
(Among the people sitting on mats)

499
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,219
My goodness. This is nice.

500
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,919
(He just sits on the grass.)

501
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,330
Lunchbox on the grass.

502
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,359
He likes being on the floor.

503
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,359
It tastes like Indian food.

504
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,429
- The rice was long.
- It must be tasty!

505
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,230
It looks so good.

506
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,270
(He starts eating on the ground.)

507
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
(It's tasty!)

508
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,810
It's delicious.

509
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,969
(He immediately goes for another bite.)

510
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:35,240
It looks so good.

511
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,510
(He gobbles up.)

512
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,020
- He eats so well.
- Yes.

513
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,379
(Gobbling)

514
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,850
(What's that sound?)

515
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,689
(New Yorkers are relaxing
and sipping coffee.)

516
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,560
(The foreigner is just gobbling up
his first meal.)

517
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,770
(We're used to seeing him like this.)

518
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,469
(In South America,)

519
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:03,100
(in India,)

520
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,570
(and also in Madagascar,)

521
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:07,669
(he always ate on the ground.)

522
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,439
Only the menu and the background changed.

523
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,439
It's the same.

524
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:15,280
Whether in India or New York,
he remains the same.

525
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,919
- You're right.
- I love it.

526
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,659
I'm so tired.

527
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,199
(I had my meal.)

528
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:32,530
(He lies down.)

529
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,800
- Is he going to fall asleep?
- I felt sleepy after the meal.

530
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:37,840
(A romantic nap in Central Park)

531
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,169
He's taking a nap in Central Park.

532
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,740
You're truly enjoying New York.

533
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,480
Don't steal my things.

534
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,679
You should take good care of your bag.

535
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:45,810
You never know.

536
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:48,879
(He threw aside the lunchbox,)

537
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:51,590
(and he's now indulging
in a peaceful nap.)

538
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:55,689
Gosh, this is awesome.

539
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,129
Is he chewing while sleeping?

540
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:01,629
- It's rumination.
- Is it rumination?

541
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,469
(He feels sleepy with a full stomach.)

542
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:10,939
I want some more.

543
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,169
Seriously.

544
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:13,609
- I knew it.
- Is he always like this?

545
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:15,510
- He is living the most enviable life.
- He can never waste food.

546
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,109
The more you chew,
the more delicious it becomes.

547
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,609
(Coughing)

548
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,619
(He nonchalantly ignores the choking
and lies down again.)

549
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:25,590
It's because of gastroesophageal reflux.

550
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,389
That's too weak.

551
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,359
Look at his arm. He's like a beggar.

552
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,129
(He drinks while lying down.)

553
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,100
I need to go to my accommodation...

554
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,500
and change clothes.

555
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,439
(He continues to walk.)

556
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,109
(Swallowing his saliva)

557
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,219
- My goodness.
- What's wrong?

558
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,760
(He stops and scratches his ribs.)

559
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,520
(My goodness)

560
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,129
- Wait.
- What's wrong?

561
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,459
- Why?
- Do you need to use the toilet?

562
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:09,100
- My stomach hurts.
- How did you know?

563
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,300
- For real?
- Yes.

564
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,570
How did you know?

565
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,699
I know just by looking at your face.

566
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:15,399
Are you going to do your business here?

567
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:17,540
As soon as he arrived in New York,
he ate, and now he's looking for a toilet.

568
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,909
(Embarrassed)

569
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,840
Is there no toilet around here?

570
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:24,280
Will the police catch me
if I do my business here?

571
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,379
There are many trees.

572
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:26,409
I need the toilet.

573
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:28,449
(There are no toilets in sight.)

574
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:30,480
At Dongtan Central Park,

575
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,590
there are toilets,
but there are none here.

576
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,750
There were no toilets!

577
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,820
Yes, because...

578
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,820
there are too many drug addicts.

579
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,459
- I see.
- So the country...

580
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,600
- They got rid of it.
- got rid of the toilets.

581
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,260
I couldn't poop
because of the drug addicts.

582
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,600
It was a social critique.

583
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,570
- My gosh.
- I mean...

584
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,939
A comment from the winner
of the Grand Awards.

585
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:52,469
We can't poop because of you all!

586
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:54,070
His words now carry a different weight.

587
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,810
Toilet.

588
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,780
Then,

589
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,780
(He suddenly doesn't look so good.)

590
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,280
I should poop at the Plaza Hotel.

591
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,619
Will they charge me 50 dollars
for using the toilet?

592
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:06,490
(He's going to the Plaza Hotel.)

593
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,659
Oh, my goodness.

594
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:09,659
(I'm in trouble.)

595
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,290
(We can see how much in a hurry he is.)

596
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,929
(He's running fast.)

597
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,100
Why didn't they install a toilet here?

598
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,800
(He has a suspicious mark on his pants.)

599
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,699
- Wait. There's something on your bum.
- No.

600
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,340
He was on the grass.

601
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,340
Wait, it's so dark.

602
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,909
When you sit on the grass,

603
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:29,179
- the dirt gets on you.
- Same dirt on his arm.

604
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:30,980
Aren't you going to the toilet
since you already dirtied your pants?

605
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,149
Pooping since there's already dirt on it.

606
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:34,580
- If I do that...
- This is too much.

607
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,050
But some might misunderstand.

608
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,050
(His closing argument)

609
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,219
- My goodness.
- What's that?

610
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:42,219
(I didn't poop on my pants.)

611
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,260
The signal came immediately.

612
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:46,590
I'll enter here...

613
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,830
and use their toilet.

614
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,000
(Smiling)

615
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,000
What? President only?

616
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:55,699
What does that mean?

617
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,169
President only? What does that mean?

618
00:26:58,169 --> 00:26:59,240
(Resident only)

619
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,270
(It's resident, not president.)

620
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,139
- Resident.
- Resident.

621
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,510
- Resident.
- It's somewhat similar.

622
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:08,820
If you didn't pay 680 dollars per night,

623
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,820
you can't poop here.

624
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,090
This is difficult.

625
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,119
It's not this way.

626
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,219
(Those without power or money,
find another toilet.)

627
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:18,119
My goodness.

628
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,159
- It's Toilet Adventure by Accident.
- I know.

629
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,330
The signal is here. Please.

630
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,330
(He goes to the next building
after his failure.)

631
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:28,070
Is this an office building?

632
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:31,270
Is the office building open
only for their employees?

633
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:34,909
I should be able to enter here.

634
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:36,179
(He tries to enter.)

635
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:39,580
- Are you going to the car park?
- Toilet?

636
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,709
(Kian84 turned off his camera
out of embarrassment.)

637
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,219
- It's up here.
- Yes.

638
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:45,290
- It's right through the bridge.
- Thank you.

639
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:48,820
You couldn't understand him, right?

640
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,189
He told me to go out and turn left.

641
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:55,060
Wait. I'm serious.

642
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:57,859
(His sincere sweat falls.)

643
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:58,899
This situation is making me sweat.

644
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:02,169
- Gosh.
- If you see the footage,

645
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:04,000
you can see all the cameramen lost me.

646
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,310
Right. We only have
your self-camera footage.

647
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,270
- I felt like dying.
- It's to survive.

648
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:08,679
Yes, this is reality.

649
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,480
I need to go to a cafe.

650
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:15,350
- Yes.
- Have one drink and go to the toilet.

651
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,050
He needs to go to a cafe.

652
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:19,990
The cafe lets you use the toilet
if you buy a cup of coffee.

653
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:24,159
Cafe and espresso.

654
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:29,629
(He tries to use a cafe toilet.)

655
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,469
I don't think there's a toilet here.

656
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:37,139
I don't think there's a toilet here.
It's too small.

657
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,070
I couldn't see the toilet sign there.

658
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,070
(He fails to poop for the 3rd time
because of the small space.)

659
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:43,379
(My goodness)

660
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:46,250
Seriously.

661
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,250
For real!

662
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,280
Oh, no.

663
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:50,949
Starbucks.

664
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,750
Is there a Starbucks here?

665
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,919
(There's a wine bar next to him.)

666
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,090
If I buy one bottle of wine...

667
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,830
"If I buy one bottle of wine..."

668
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,159
For goodness' sake.
Let me buy a bottle of wine.

669
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,429
"Let me buy a bottle of wine."

670
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:05,270
There must be a wine name
with that curse word.

671
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:06,699
If I buy one bottle of wine...

672
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,330
But wines are expensive.

673
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,100
(The fierce battle
between instinct and reason)

674
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,939
In the midst of it all, you thought
about the cost of living in New York.

675
00:29:12,939 --> 00:29:13,939
Yes.

676
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:15,510
You make me want to poop too.

677
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,480
(He's sweating.)

678
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:20,550
(Gosh, wine...)

679
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,020
I'll buy a cup of coffee.

680
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:23,379
- It was expensive.
- Oh, no.

681
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:24,679
It was expensive.

682
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,750
There's Starbucks!

683
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,990
I knew it.

684
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,389
I never saw someone
who wants to poop for this long.

685
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,590
Seriously.

686
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:36,129
(He speeds up after finding Starbucks.)

687
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:38,199
Starbucks.

688
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:40,030
(He tries to ask politely
after turning off his camera.)

689
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,129
Is there a toilet here?

690
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,500
- It's only for guests.
- Oh, only?

691
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,909
(He tries to ask politely
after turning off his camera.)

692
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,669
You don't know toilet?

693
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:52,179
Why are you starting a fight?

694
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:54,209
I wouldn't stop you
from going to the toilet.

695
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,780
Thank you.

696
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,649
- Jerks.
- "Jerks."

697
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:01,490
- Starbucks punks.
- "Jerks."

698
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,219
Of course, he's upset.
It's a physiological reaction.

699
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,359
(The ordeal of 41-year-old Kevin,
who crash-landed in New York)

700
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,530
Just let me poop.

701
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,030
- This is crazy.
- I'm going crazy.

702
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,129
The angle of the camera is so funny.

703
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:12,129
(The angle makes
the viewers want to poop.)

704
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:13,399
Even I'm so tired.

705
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,030
Mart?

706
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,740
(After failing for the 4th time,
he enters a supermarket.)

707
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:21,240
- Kian84! Hello.
- Yes. Hello.

708
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,179
(Is she Korean?)

709
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:25,409
- It was a Korean mart?
- Hold on.

710
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:26,609
- Oh, my.
- It's amazing.

711
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,750
Is there a toilet?

712
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,449
(Is she a Korean savior
in a foreign country?)

713
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:31,850
Oh, my goodness.

714
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,219
Toilet? Okay.

715
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:36,189
Seriously. I was saved.

716
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:37,790
- You were lucky.
- He made it.

717
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,030
How fortunate.

718
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,459
I guess you can't use the toilets
freely in America.

719
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:43,530
Koreans had my back.

720
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,270
Thank you.

721
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,969
Here. My goodness.

722
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,270
For goodness' sake.

723
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:52,740
(I saw the paradise.)

724
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,780
(Toilet Adventure by Accident. The End.)

725
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:59,649
(Laughing)

726
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,250
Thank you so much.

727
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,320
- He looks peaceful.
- He looks happy.

728
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,219
- Why did you sweat so much?
- Why did you sweat so much?

729
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:09,389
I was so happy.

730
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,159
You make me want to poop.

731
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,859
- Looking at the footage?
- Yes.

732
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:14,359
(It was a successful
bowel movement marketing.)

733
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,800
Thank you so much. You saved me.

734
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,899
The toilet was so good.
Hope you make a lot of money.

735
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:22,639
- Thank you so much.
- I feel so thankful.

736
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:25,169
Kian84...

737
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:27,909
That place will be known
as the place where Kian84 pooped.

738
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:29,439
(The place where Kian84 pooped)

739
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:31,040
Koreans are the best, everyone.

740
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,080
Korea is the best.

741
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,820
The buildings are cool,
but you can't poop in there.

742
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:37,719
For goodness' sake.

743
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,919
The Plaza Hotel that gave me a fantasy,
thanks to Kevin.

744
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,119
It gave me a fantasy,
but it didn't let me poop.

745
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,629
New York lacks warmth.

746
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,330
No matter where you go, Korea is the best.

747
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,560
- Yes.
- I agree.

748
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,199
- There is no place like Korea.
- You still left a permanent mark.

749
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,270
(What shall I do now?)

750
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,369
After it gets dark,

751
00:31:57,469 --> 00:31:59,270
many places become dangerous.

752
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,939
Before it gets dark,

753
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:04,139
I'll visit the Bronx.

754
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,980
- The Bronx?
- It's nice there.

755
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,649
Yoo Teo told me about this place.

756
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:11,219
It's where hip-hop originated from.

757
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:13,590
(The two met before he departed.)

758
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,689
Nice to meet you.

759
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:15,820
This was the first time we met.

760
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,760
You've seen "8 Mile," right?

761
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,359
- They do a rap battle.
- Yes.

762
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,760
Is there still something like that?

763
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:26,199
I filmed "Past Lives" a while ago.

764
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,730
I went to the Bronx to take a break.

765
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,969
- Kyung Soo road?
- "Kyung Soo road?"

766
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:31,669
- The Bronx.
- Bron?

767
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,939
- The Bronx.
- The Bronx.

768
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:34,070
The Bronx.

769
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,280
It's a place where
many immigrants came in the past,

770
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,939
and where many Black people also live.

771
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:40,949
That place has not been
as touristy as Manhattan.

772
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,820
I thought Harlem was
the birthplace of hip-hop,

773
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,649
but now it's been redeveloped,
and it's no longer like that.

774
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:47,050
He also knows about real estate.

775
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:49,689
Harlem is touristy now.

776
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:51,219
- Yes, you're right.
- I see.

777
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,060
Harlem...
People put nicknames for famous streets.

778
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,859
- Was it like Harlidan-gil?
- Yes. Like that.

779
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,100
- It became a trendy area.
- From Kian84 Real Estate.

780
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,300
The Bronx.

781
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:03,199
How far is it?

782
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,399
(It takes around 20 minutes by car.)

783
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,540
The taxi fare is...
If I go around only by taxi...

784
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,480
it'll be over my budget.
The cost of living in America is high.

785
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,350
Let's take the subway.

786
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,879
Yes, you can't take a taxi from now on.

787
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,149
You should take the subway...

788
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,520
to see the real New Yorkers.

789
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,560
I'm curious what the New York subways
look like.

790
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,330
Is it this?

791
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,000
This is unusual. It's the first time
to take a subway in Adventure by Accident.

792
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You're right.

793
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,939
They built the subway in 1907.
My goodness.

794
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,939
How did they build it? They're not aliens.

795
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,510
It's an old subway.

796
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:44,040
I need a ticket.

797
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:47,510
(A self-service ticketing machine)

798
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:50,379
A fast metro card is 9 dollars.

799
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,649
Is it about 10,000 Korean won?

800
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,490
The subway isn't cheap.

801
00:33:55,389 --> 00:33:57,219
(He inserts coins.)

802
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,129
(He chose to purchase a 1-way ticket
that costs 3.25 dollars.)

803
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,830
Let's see. Metro card.

804
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,070
Did you get the right ticket?
It's not easy to buy the ticket.

805
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,429
He got better
after traveling here and there.

806
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,439
(It's so easy for him
to buy the right ticket now.)

807
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,909
(He passes the gate without an issue.)

808
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,070
Bron...

809
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:17,980
Which way is the way to the Bronx?

810
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,149
- Here? Thank you.
- This way.

811
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,250
Thank you.

812
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,449
(He tries to get to the right platform
with his imperfect English.)

813
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,750
The Bronx. It's here.

814
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,549
It goes to the Bronx.

815
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:29,659
(He gets to the platform
going to the Bronx.)

816
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,860
He found it without getting lost.

817
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:34,589
The facility is very old.

818
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:37,429
(An old ceiling)

819
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,830
It's like what I saw in "Joker."

820
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,569
I think it's a few decades old.
Maybe more than 50 years.

821
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:44,440
(It's common to see a rat
in the New York subway.)

822
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
A New York rat.

823
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,310
Oh, my goodness!

824
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,980
- They're kissing.
- My goodness.

825
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,080
(He enters hesitantly.)

826
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,049
I got into the New York subway.

827
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:01,449
The camera angle feels intrusive.

828
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:03,089
It's smaller than I thought.

829
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:04,119
It was not spacious.

830
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,330
- It's not spacious.
- It's narrow.

831
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,389
Fortunately, there is air conditioning.

832
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,400
(After standing cramped for a while,)

833
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,139
(he arrived safely.)

834
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,710
(Looking around)

835
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,839
This is the Bronx.

836
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:25,679
We're at the Bronx.

837
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
The Bronx.

838
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
This is where hip-hop...

839
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,119
originated from. The birthplace.

840
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,690
It's the birthplace of hip-hop.

841
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,020
- In "8 Mile," they do a rap battle.
- Yes.

842
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,589
- It's so cool.
- You're right.

843
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,089
I want to do that.

844
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:42,799
Will there be a real rap battle?

845
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,860
(He came to this city
to fulfill his wishes.)

846
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,869
Simon Dominic.

847
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:51,040
This is where hip-hop started.

848
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:54,339
- Have you been here?
- Yes.

849
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,239
(Glancing)

850
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:03,020
The ambiance must be different.

851
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,350
Hi.

852
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:10,489
Hello.

853
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,060
They don't greet me back.

854
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:18,330
- It's not easy.
- I was a bit scared.

855
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,630
(Siren noise)

856
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,270
Is that how they take the car?

857
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:26,909
- My goodness. It's pushing it.
- What's going on?

858
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:28,139
- What's going on?
- Is it helping by pushing?

859
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:30,009
Is it like a wedige?

860
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,239
It's interesting.

861
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,980
(The unknown traffic order of the Bronx)

862
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:38,449
I see.

863
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,960
Someone made the car...

864
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:47,960
to look like vintage.

865
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,400
- Someone broke into the car.
- My goodness.

866
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:53,929
Did they make the shock absorber
purposely like this?

867
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:56,900
(The bumper isn't in a good shape.)

868
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,770
The last driver we met in Madagascar...

869
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,810
The taxi driver.

870
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,810
I suddenly remember his car
that had a plastic window.

871
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,139
(It reminds him of Madagascar.)

872
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:09,319
They're honking a lot.

873
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:13,750
I surely was in Manhattan,
but within 30 minutes,

874
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:15,819
I came to Madagascar.

875
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,259
(From a city
full of high-rise buildings...)

876
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,000
It didn't even take 30 minutes by subway,
but the atmosphere changed drastically.

877
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,600
(to a Madagascar-style street)

878
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:28,670
Why am I here?

879
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,699
(Where is this street that's different
from his imagination of the US?)

880
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,409
You can't leave out the Bronx
when it comes to hip-hop.

881
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:38,179
A large population came to New York
in the 20th century,

882
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:41,210
and African Americans
and various immigrants settled here.

883
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,319
Amazing.

884
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:43,779
(The center of African American culture
in New York)

885
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,389
Hip-hop was born...

886
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,889
when DJ Kook Herc...

887
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,730
threw a party.

888
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:57,100
There is a part without the vocals...

889
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,369
just with the drum and bass.

890
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:02,100
That's called a breakdown.

891
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,600
(While singing along to the music)

892
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,869
(Break down!)

893
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,380
People danced in that break down.

894
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,210
That's how breakdancing started.

895
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:15,509
Next to Kool Herc,

896
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:16,880
there was a host.

897
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,889
The one who would say, "Go, Pani."

898
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,089
Those people became the MCs of today.
Like rappers.

899
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:25,119
That's why they were called MCs.

900
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:29,029
I thought MCs were like
Jae Seok, Gyeong Gyu,

901
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,600
or Hyun Moo.

902
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,069
Why do people who do hip-hop
say they're MCs?

903
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:37,400
- MC stands for microphone checker.
- Right.

904
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,509
This show is really informative.

905
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:42,639
I studied a lot.

906
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,880
(The vibe that comes from experience)

907
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,380
(Tripping)

908
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,719
(He trips while looking around Bronx.)

909
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,049
(He keeps walking in search
of a rap battle.)

910
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,889
What is that?

911
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,630
Why are there so many events?

912
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,429
(The fireplug is open.)

913
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,400
(Packing)

914
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:16,980
(Washing)

915
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,250
(Catching attention)

916
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:24,179
(He takes a shower
in the middle of a New York street.)

917
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:27,650
(Shaking)

918
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:31,589
Bronx mineral spring.

919
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:36,100
- It tastes good.
- You're like a water sommelier.

920
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:39,670
Is that clean water you can wash
your face with?

921
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,799
(It wasn't just Kian who enjoyed
the mineral spring.)

922
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:44,969
- What?
- My gosh.

923
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,380
(The Bronx people do more.)

924
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,909
(Glancing)

925
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:54,610
- Is this an open space?
- There's music.

926
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,779
Hold on. What's with the beat?

927
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,549
What?

928
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,850
It's not easy.

929
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:01,949
You know,

930
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:07,190
with my shallow thinking,

931
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:08,690
I thought I would go somewhere...

932
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:10,929
that plays hip-hop music...

933
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,400
and enjoy that culture.

934
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,869
But I keep avoiding places...

935
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,440
where the music is played
instead of going toward it.

936
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,610
(An unfamiliar street mood)

937
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,739
I'm a bit scared.

938
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:23,310
I think he's going to do something random.

939
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:26,179
(He finds a clothes shop.)

940
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:27,179
It's here.

941
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,779
I'll quickly get rid of the skin
that I came with from Korea.

942
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,750
I'll disguise myself...

943
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,989
as a Bronx person.

944
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:38,290
That's right. Let's change the fashion.
It doesn't fit here.

945
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,089
Isn't there a shirt that says
"I love Bronx?"

946
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:44,100
"I love Bronx?" Like "I love New York."

947
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,670
(He bought the clothes as disguise.)

948
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:49,469
(Struggling)

949
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,409
(Undressing)

950
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:55,779
He has a good body.

951
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,779
(Thinking)

952
00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:00,179
You're saying you like this body, right?

953
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,549
Kian84 has a nice body.

954
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:04,779
(It's to his friend's taste.)

955
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,319
(Putting it on)

956
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:13,130
(Disguising as a Bronx person)

957
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:16,159
(The locals think it's interesting.)

958
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,730
(He doesn't mind.)

959
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,440
What did he buy?

960
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,239
- "Brooklyn?"
- "Brooklyn."

961
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,770
- But it's Bronx.
- Hold on.

962
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,540
(What happened to the Bronx?)

963
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,639
- Why did you buy the Brooklyn one?
- They didn't sell one with the Bronx.

964
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,710
- They didn't?
- No.

965
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,549
The jetlag is troublesome.

966
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,350
- <i>My uncle's name</i>
- What is he doing?

967
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,290
<i>Is Jeong Jin Chul,</i>
<i>he works as a fashion designer</i>

968
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,560
Why are you calling my uncle?

969
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:48,989
(It's a song with memories
of Simon Dominic and his uncle.)

970
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,060
<i>My uncle's name</i>

971
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,830
(He calls him in the middle of New York.)

972
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,730
- <i>Is Jeong Jin Chul, he works</i>
- He's calling someone else's uncle.

973
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,069
<i>My uncle's name is Jeong Jin Chul,</i>
<i>he works</i>

974
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:02,040
(Is he a rapper?)

975
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:09,650
(There's music coming from behind.)

976
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,549
- There's music.
- They're playing music from behind.

977
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:14,690
(Two people are enjoying hip-hop music
from its hometown.)

978
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,790
They carried a speaker with them.

979
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,429
(They carried a speaker with them.)

980
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,460
The leather pants look warm.

981
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:24,330
- In this weather?
- He looks cool.

982
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,830
(Staring)

983
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:28,600
(That moment)

984
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,969
What?

985
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,569
(The man wearing leather pants
suddenly approaches.)

986
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:35,639
Hello.

987
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,409
- What?
- What's happening?

988
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:39,040
Hold on.

989
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,380
- Hi.
- Yes.

990
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,719
- Hello.
- Okay.

991
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,119
- They suddenly came...
- He's scared.

992
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,290
It was scary.

993
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,619
(His eyes are shaking.)

994
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,460
What?

995
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,929
(Two men surround him.)

996
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,560
Come...

997
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,659
- Money?
- "Money?"

998
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:00,469
Money?

999
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:01,569
You thought they were asking for money?

1000
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,670
What?

1001
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:06,110
- I don't have money.
- You thought they were taking your money?

1002
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,170
It's scary.

1003
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:10,810
Money.

1004
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,710
I have no money?

1005
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,650
His posture becomes polite.

1006
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,520
Look at his posture.

1007
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,779
(Polite)

1008
00:43:19,449 --> 00:43:21,350
You don't look like
you're from around here.

1009
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:24,259
- Yes.
- Yes?

1010
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:25,290
Okay.

1011
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:27,830
(They just came
because they were curious.)

1012
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:31,199
I think Americans speak to strangers well.
They're kind.

1013
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,670
- That's right.
- They start small talks.

1014
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:34,830
Are you an artist?

1015
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,869
Me? I'm not.

1016
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,670
I do a little bit of it.

1017
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,440
When I play around.

1018
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,110
I do here and there.
So it's not a big of a deal.

1019
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,610
- Okay.
- You know what I mean?

1020
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,279
- That sounds cool.
- That's cool.

1021
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,619
I'm Korean, and I'm a rapper musician.

1022
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:54,920
Korean.

1023
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,389
- I'm...
- Why did you say you were a rapper?

1024
00:43:57,489 --> 00:43:58,560
I'm Korean.

1025
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,029
From a hip-hop musician company.

1026
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:03,529
- Really? Music company?
- Yes.

1027
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:04,560
A little bit.

1028
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,600
- Respects.
- Yes.

1029
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:09,600
Sorry.

1030
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:11,170
(He first apologizes.)

1031
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:14,310
They're hosting a freestyle cypher.

1032
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,940
- Freestyle.
- Cypher.

1033
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:18,440
Really?

1034
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,549
(He can listen to freestyle rap?)

1035
00:44:19,549 --> 00:44:20,610
There we go.

1036
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:24,080
- Today?
- Today. Tuesday.

1037
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:27,350
- Rap?
- Rap.

1038
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:29,690
(Many people gather in the streets)

1039
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,719
They do it in the streets.

1040
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,259
People stand around and rap together.

1041
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:37,500
It probably occurs often.
We do it often in Korea as well.

1042
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:39,469
- It's in Korea too?
- There are lots of cyphers in Korea.

1043
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,929
They do it often in Hongdae playgrounds.

1044
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,029
- Really?
- Right.

1045
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,369
Where is it?

1046
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:46,810
This is happening in... The address
is Brooklyn.

1047
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,440
- Brooklyn?
- At 8 p.m.?

1048
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,710
- Tonight.
- Can I go?

1049
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,310
- Is it okay if I go?
- Yes.

1050
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:53,509
Okay. Thank you.

1051
00:44:54,049 --> 00:44:55,080
Wait.

1052
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:57,219
I should take a picture.

1053
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:01,449
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1054
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,520
(Smiling)

1055
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,630
I thought this really was the hometown
of hip-hop.

1056
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:10,500
They said there are people who gather
and do music.

1057
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,860
I was a bit scared.

1058
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,900
I was curious,
so I decided to go there in the evening.

1059
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,040
- See you.
- See you.

1060
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:20,770
See you.

1061
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,440
(The aspiring hip-hopper searches
about it.)

1062
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,549
Brooklyn 177.

1063
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,850
Is it far?

1064
00:45:31,279 --> 00:45:33,819
- It's quite far.
- It's a bit far. About an hour.

1065
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,190
I'll look for a place to stay around here.

1066
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,319
(He looks for an accommodation nearby.)

1067
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,259
Is there one like a motel for 50 dollars?

1068
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:43,600
This is the cheapest.
I should get this one.

1069
00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:47,730
(He booked a place near the cypher.)

1070
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,670
<i>My uncle's name is</i>

1071
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,369
(His friend's uncle is summoned again.)

1072
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:55,239
(He heads to Brooklyn
where the cypher will happen.)

1073
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:58,310
He bought one shirt from the Bronx.

1074
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:00,310
He bought a Brooklyn shirt.

1075
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,909
I also washed my face.

1076
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:04,920
(Bronx)

1077
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,920
(Traveling for 50 minutes)

1078
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,520
(Brooklyn)

1079
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,589
(He arrives in Brooklyn by subway.)

1080
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:14,790
- It was a good thing. I had the shirt.
- It was fate.

1081
00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:17,600
(Stopping)

1082
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,000
(Confused)

1083
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,739
It's so confusing.

1084
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,869
There were many places
where you couldn't use your phone.

1085
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:28,969
- It's working well.
- You're using the navigation app now.

1086
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:35,049
The sun sets late here. It's 7 p.m..

1087
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:36,819
It's past 7 p.m., but the sun is up.

1088
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,850
(He walks while looking
for his accommodation.)

1089
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:44,159
Grafitti.

1090
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:45,690
(Is this...)

1091
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,690
Street?

1092
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:51,330
It's amazing.

1093
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,569
(Brooklyn)

1094
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:55,630
- Brooklyn.
- It's cool.

1095
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:58,699
- Right.
- Really.

1096
00:46:58,699 --> 00:46:59,739
- Here.
- It's okay.

1097
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,040
Countless artists live in this area,

1098
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,179
so much so that it is often called
a gathering place for artists.

1099
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:07,049
It's also famous for being
one of the most ethnically diverse places.

1100
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:08,679
(People of various ethnicity
from all across the US live here.)

1101
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,850
Also, it is well known as the hometown
of prominent East Coast hip-hop musicians,

1102
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,819
Jay-Z and Biggie.

1103
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:16,389
They're legends.

1104
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,860
(I can New York)

1105
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:25,360
(Humming the song by the legends)

1106
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,069
All right.

1107
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,569
Just one night here.

1108
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,270
(He arrives at his lodging in Brooklyn.)

1109
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:33,670
Hello. Excuse me.

1110
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,779
How much for one day?

1111
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,080
Right now, we only have
three-bed mixed dorms available.

1112
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:43,920
It's going to come out to 74.36 dollars.

1113
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,650
- So, it's 70...
- It's 74.36 dollars.

1114
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,350
- Seventy-four?
- And thirty-six.

1115
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,790
Seven...

1116
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,119
Wait.

1117
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,429
Seven hundred dollars?

1118
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:54,659
He doesn't even do the math now.

1119
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,330
"We got lucky."

1120
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,060
Did you really pay them 700 dollars?

1121
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,069
No, I didn't.

1122
00:48:00,469 --> 00:48:02,699
Oh, 74 dollars.

1123
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:04,940
It's 74 dollars.

1124
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,000
(It's about 100,000 Korean won.)

1125
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,040
It's 74 dollars.

1126
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,310
(Too bad.)

1127
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,040
Room 308.

1128
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,739
(He arrived at his 1st room
after 20 hours.)

1129
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:14,710
There are three beds.

1130
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,750
Three beds?

1131
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,020
- It's a dormitory.
- I see.

1132
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,580
You're sharing the room
with other people, right?

1133
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,690
- No.
- No, he uses the room alone.

1134
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:21,819
- I'm using the room alone.
- No...

1135
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:23,259
But he said it was a mixed dorm.

1136
00:48:23,259 --> 00:48:26,089
You need to communicate
with others when you enter.

1137
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:28,429
You don't have to share the room
if there aren't other guests.

1138
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:30,860
Because it's impossible
to find a room in New York...

1139
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,369
for only 100 dollars, as far as I know.

1140
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:35,569
That could have been really inconvenient.

1141
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:40,339
(Finally, a bed!)

1142
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:42,009
Oh, my back.

1143
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:43,909
Rap...

1144
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,909
What was it called? A cypher?

1145
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:50,319
Yes. I should go and watch a cypher.

1146
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,420
What? Hold on.

1147
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,759
(He starts dressing hip-hop
before watching a cypher.)

1148
00:48:59,759 --> 00:49:01,830
That song choice is insane.

1149
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,500
You look pretty cool.

1150
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,360
You put on Biggie's music
for being in New York.

1151
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,199
His life is more hip-hop
than anyone else, though.

1152
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:09,230
- It is. Certainly.
- He's a real one.

1153
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,569
(Ripping)

1154
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:15,339
See? It's already starting
to look like hip-hop.

1155
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,610
(He cuts something without mercy.)

1156
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:21,250
All right.

1157
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,549
(He made a pair of shorts.)

1158
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:24,020
Oh, nice.

1159
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,850
That's the type of fit I want.

1160
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:29,489
(Altering his top as well)

1161
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:31,259
They keep playing Biggie's songs.

1162
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,520
Oh, it's a song by Biggie.

1163
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:34,960
Nice!

1164
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,900
Looking good!

1165
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,960
(His T-shirt turned
into a sleeveless shirt.)

1166
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,299
Don't I look stronger?

1167
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:40,500
Yes, you look great.

1168
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,569
(He ran away in the Bronx,
but he's different in Brooklyn.)

1169
00:49:41,569 --> 00:49:42,569
I look good.

1170
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:46,940
(Heading out to take over Brooklyn)

1171
00:49:48,009 --> 00:49:50,040
I didn't want to look like a nerd.

1172
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,110
That's true.

1173
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:52,380
They might look down on you.

1174
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:58,219
(It's gotten pretty dark in the streets.)

1175
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,960
(He goes to find the place
that he heard about.)

1176
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,759
He said it was somewhere around here.

1177
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,400
(Looking around)

1178
00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:16,940
It looks like a factory.

1179
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:21,869
(Unlike the energetic vibe
in the afternoon,)

1180
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,310
(it's pretty bleak here at night.)

1181
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,219
It can get dangerous at night.

1182
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:33,089
New York isn't such a safe city
to walk around at night.

1183
00:50:34,389 --> 00:50:37,560
(The cool graffiti start to look
a bit chilling.)

1184
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:40,989
Gosh.

1185
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,000
- What's that?
- A pigeon?

1186
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,130
It's a dead pigeon.

1187
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,100
(Turning his head)

1188
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:50,699
(He's extra careful
and keeps a lookout in all directions.)

1189
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:52,770
I couldn't walk around at night.

1190
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,839
It's like "Home Alone 2" in Manhattan.

1191
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,540
Once you leave that area, it's "Joker."

1192
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,710
- You were probably able to walk around...
- Right.

1193
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,880
as you were with the production crew.

1194
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,980
It's safe not to go outside
once it gets dark...

1195
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,150
- That's true.
- in other countries.

1196
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,489
Had it not been for the production crew,
my shirt would have been torn to pieces.

1197
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:10,790
You didn't have to tear it yourself.

1198
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,790
Exactly.

1199
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,529
You'll be left with underwear only.

1200
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,400
- Exactly.
- And you lose everything.

1201
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,699
The word "Brooklyn" will have been gone.

1202
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,429
It would have been torn, even if I hadn't.

1203
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,369
You would have been forced
to have a makeover.

1204
00:51:22,369 --> 00:51:23,500
(Have a safe trip
without any forceful makeovers!)

1205
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600
(He keeps looking back,
in case he gets a makeover.)

1206
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,639
Yes, you need to be careful.
You want to stay safe on a trip.

1207
00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:32,810
<i>Simon Dominic</i>

1208
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,179
- He's even singing my song.
- That's touching.

1209
00:51:34,179 --> 00:51:35,250
I thought of you so many times.

1210
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,520
- Right?
- Yes.

1211
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,980
You should have video-called me
or something.

1212
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,750
(He keeps turning his head.)

1213
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,489
It's 177...

1214
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,730
I think I hear hip-hop music.

1215
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,060
- Yes, I hear a beat.
- Yes.

1216
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,100
(He gets close to the music.)

1217
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,500
This must be it.

1218
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,170
It says 177.

1219
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:00,739
(What is this place, by the way?)

1220
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,339
- What?
- Hang on.

1221
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:05,210
- Oh, I walked by it.
- He walked by the place earlier.

1222
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:08,009
- I had no idea.
- It was right next to you.

1223
00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:10,920
(And it was an empty lot
right next to his dorm.)

1224
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,250
What?

1225
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:13,949
He took a lap around the block!

1226
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:15,089
What?

1227
00:52:15,089 --> 00:52:17,159
- That's...
- What happened?

1228
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:18,460
Was it right next to his dorm?

1229
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,029
- How far did you go around?
- How did this happen?

1230
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:23,759
- That's hilarious.
- It was too dark at night.

1231
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:24,860
It was that close?

1232
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,100
(He went around the whole neighborhood
for going the wrong way.)

1233
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,029
(He only got more courageous
and came back to the dorm.)

1234
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:30,369
This must be it.

1235
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:32,940
It says 177.

1236
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,310
(He carefully approaches it.)

1237
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:37,679
Goodness.

1238
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,350
I didn't know they actually did that.

1239
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,250
- Goodness.
- You've got bars?

1240
00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:48,219
(He spits out words without a break.)

1241
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:52,389
(Dozens of rappers are
in this vacant lot.)

1242
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,290
I feel an adrenalin rush
just by watching them.

1243
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,969
(Intimidated)

1244
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:03,239
I'm scared.

1245
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,139
(Hurried)

1246
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,040
(Surprised bunny eyes)

1247
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,509
I came to 177 that the guy in the Bronx...

1248
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:14,380
told me about this afternoon.

1249
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,920
And I'm scared.

1250
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,049
You look really awkward.

1251
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:20,049
But...

1252
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,360
real hip-hop...

1253
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,360
Real hip-hop is...

1254
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,360
(Stammering)

1255
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,500
right here. Let's...

1256
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,060
check it out.

1257
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:36,600
(Excuse me.)

1258
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,770
- Gosh.
- You can do this.

1259
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:42,270
(He's extremely nervous...)

1260
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:45,380
(as he slowly approaches them.)

1261
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:50,920
(This is a real classic
What the heck is a Beethoven?)

1262
00:53:51,219 --> 00:53:53,850
(One man spits a line that goes hard,)

1263
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,989
(and another one follows.)

1264
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,560
It's what I could only see in "8 Mile."

1265
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:05,100
(They freestyle on the spot.)

1266
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,299
(We've got bars
We've got a rhyme for it)

1267
00:54:07,299 --> 00:54:08,730
(We keep it classic)

1268
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:11,239
(What do you think
you're playing the symphony now for?)

1269
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,369
(The rappers are focused
on rapping, and...)

1270
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,139
Look at that.

1271
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,610
- I did not see that coming.
- It's a violin.

1272
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:21,650
I was so surprised.

1273
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,250
(Hold up!)

1274
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:25,679
(Let me just rap with the legends)

1275
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,819
(Because I just stacked it)

1276
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:28,449
(See what happens? I'm the stake)

1277
00:54:28,449 --> 00:54:29,920
(Because I'm the lone ranger)

1278
00:54:30,259 --> 00:54:31,319
(I feel like Goku)

1279
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:32,920
(Because this is
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber)

1280
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:37,000
That's called a punchline.

1281
00:54:37,429 --> 00:54:39,969
(Listen and understand
there's nothing you can tell me)

1282
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:43,400
(I'm not about the LV
Man, I'm about LC)

1283
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,069
(For those who don't know
on how we get it hyped up?)

1284
00:54:46,299 --> 00:54:47,569
(You all know what it is)

1285
00:54:47,569 --> 00:54:49,170
(This legendary cypher)

1286
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,310
- This legendary cypher!
- This legendary cypher!

1287
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:52,839
(If you're loving where you're at)

1288
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,779
Say, "Heck, yes!"

1289
00:54:54,779 --> 00:54:56,310
- Heck, yes!
- Heck, yes!

1290
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,520
(Side to side, if you're loving the vibe)

1291
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:00,250
Say, "Heck, yes!"

1292
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,819
- Heck, yes!
- Heck, yes!

1293
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,960
Your jaws are going to drop.

1294
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,960
It was certainly different
in the place of origin.

1295
00:55:09,429 --> 00:55:10,900
At first...

1296
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,830
You know, when you go to a labor office...

1297
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:16,199
for a part-time job at construction sites,

1298
00:55:16,969 --> 00:55:19,699
there are contract workers
waiting for the van to come.

1299
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:21,409
I see what you mean.

1300
00:55:22,409 --> 00:55:24,909
(Heck, yes!)

1301
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,380
They were rapping back and forth.

1302
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,150
(The way that they passionately engage
in hip-hop...)

1303
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,520
It was so cool.

1304
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,190
It must have been.

1305
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:35,920
- It was cool, and...
- It's so cool.

1306
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:39,319
(He can't seem to close his mouth.)

1307
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:50,400
(Among the New York men
who groove to the rhythm...)

1308
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,040
(is a foreigner
who doesn't know what to do.)

1309
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,779
(Peeking)

1310
00:55:58,779 --> 00:56:00,549
- It's cool.
- Yes.

1311
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,119
- Yes.
- Do you rap?

1312
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:07,750
I like it.

1313
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,989
(A little scared)

1314
00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:11,489
I'm from Brooklyn.

1315
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:13,460
- Brooklyn, yes.
- Where are you from?

1316
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,989
- Korea. South Korea.
- Korea?

1317
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:18,060
- South Korea? That's cool.
- Yes.

1318
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,759
I've always wanted to go to South Korea.

1319
00:56:19,759 --> 00:56:21,799
- Yes. South Korea.
- Yes?

1320
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:23,440
So...

1321
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,839
(Do you want to rap?)

1322
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,270
- Do you want to get in?
- I'll listen.

1323
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,639
He suggests it.

1324
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:31,610
That's what I like about Americans.
They cheer you up.

1325
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,880
I like that too. I love that vibe.

1326
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,580
Even if he doesn't mean it,
you feel so thankful.

1327
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,380
- They want you to participate.
- Yes, they look after you.

1328
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,420
I was watching them,

1329
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,819
and he suggested that I try it out.

1330
00:56:43,759 --> 00:56:47,529
Are they all freestyling?

1331
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,799
Yes. Everybody...
They just jump in when they want to.

1332
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,100
Everybody?

1333
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:56,770
(He starts by singing love and peace.)

1334
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,710
(Because I was 14
when I first left my home)

1335
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,009
(So, I remember thinking,
"Who can I really call?")

1336
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,449
(Who can I get on the phone?
So, I found these rhymes)

1337
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,580
(And then, I found my song
And right now, this is my home)

1338
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,449
(They really hate to see me shine)

1339
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:17,520
(I had to leave my momma at 16)

1340
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,460
(The cypher looked violent,)

1341
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,960
(but the serious stories begin
unexpectedly.)

1342
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,460
- It's pretty deep.
- That's sad.

1343
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,299
Hip-hop that I was familiar with was...

1344
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:32,170
"Yo! Shake it! Listen!"

1345
00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:34,369
And the F-word.

1346
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,739
(That's how tough it seemed.)

1347
00:57:38,279 --> 00:57:40,909
(But the cypher he saw today was...)

1348
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:44,119
It wasn't exactly a battle.

1349
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:46,819
It was more like taking turns...

1350
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,920
to release their pent-up emotions.

1351
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,020
You saw right through it.

1352
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,119
Yes. You just rap what you want to say
in a cypher.

1353
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,199
They were talking
about not having any clothes,

1354
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,000
and it sounded cool.

1355
00:58:02,429 --> 00:58:06,000
There's no pretense
because they talk about their actual life.

1356
00:58:06,469 --> 00:58:09,909
I realized that there was a soul
in hip-hop.

1357
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,310
They're literally street poets.

1358
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:15,210
(Street poets who tell their stories)

1359
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,549
I don't know what they're saying,

1360
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,619
but they look cool.

1361
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,020
(Immersed)

1362
00:58:29,989 --> 00:58:31,000
Wait.

1363
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,770
What?

1364
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,029
(He leaves out of nowhere?)

1365
00:58:37,569 --> 00:58:39,339
(Sighing)

1366
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:43,909
I feel like I should do something.

1367
00:58:47,449 --> 00:58:49,980
Come here.

1368
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,380
"Come here."

1369
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,380
Come here.

1370
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,589
(He feels his swag
5 minutes into watching them.)

1371
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:56,089
- He's guiding them.
- Like a guard.

1372
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,989
Are you a waiter
showing the customers to their table?

1373
00:58:58,989 --> 00:59:01,529
- "This way, please."
- It looked like that.

1374
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:02,630
"Two people."

1375
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:04,330
I had to do something while I was there.

1376
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:07,230
It's so cool.

1377
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:11,639
(He sits on the pavement.)

1378
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:13,610
Wait. Why did you leave?

1379
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:14,739
Are you writing the lyrics?

1380
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,940
I should at least rap a line or two.

1381
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,409
How did you know? You're indeed...

1382
00:59:20,409 --> 00:59:22,880
You look like you're going to write
something.

1383
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,549
It was a bit embarrassing to say things.

1384
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:28,420
- Freestyling is always tough.
- It is.

1385
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,150
Freestyling on the spot is
even tough for me.

1386
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,889
(He takes out his notebook.)

1387
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,029
This is...

1388
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:43,670
(He writes his lyrics
half nervous and half excited.)

1389
00:59:48,509 --> 00:59:49,739
I'm so embarrassed.

1390
00:59:50,509 --> 00:59:51,540
(Simon finds it cute.)

1391
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,279
I feel so shy.

1392
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,150
I don't even remember what I said.

1393
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,380
Why are you so nervous?

1394
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,350
- I can't watch this.
- That's adorable.

1395
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,119
It's admirable that you wrote
the lyrics and did it.

1396
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:07,690
- You're right.
- It's so admirable.

1397
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,029
I feel like a teenage girl.

1398
01:00:09,029 --> 01:00:11,029
But mustering up the courage
to actually do it...

1399
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:13,299
- is valuable in itself.
- Yes.

1400
01:00:14,299 --> 01:00:17,440
(He fights his embarrassment
and writes the lyrics.)

1401
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,239
Is that a rat?

1402
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,509
I thought it was a pet dog.

1403
01:00:23,509 --> 01:00:24,509
Remy from "Ratatouille" is here.

1404
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,880
(She enters with a pot.)

1405
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,420
Is she here to find her son?

1406
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:34,420
(Finding the courage
by looking at the lady)

1407
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,159
Anyone can participate in a cypher, so...

1408
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:41,159
(A deep sigh)

1409
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:42,889
- I wrote a few lines.
- Seriously?

1410
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,429
But it's...

1411
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:47,299
I can't wait to see it!

1412
01:00:47,299 --> 01:00:48,529
I'm not sure if I can pull it off.

1413
01:00:48,529 --> 01:00:49,569
(He's nervous.)

1414
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:51,799
It was pretty nerve-racking.

1415
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,569
Of course, it was.
Even I would have been nervous.

1416
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:56,610
(He gulps down a bottle of water
as he's anxious.)

1417
01:00:57,009 --> 01:00:58,009
(Exclaiming)

1418
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,909
I wish I had soju.

1419
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,679
This is good. I'm excited.

1420
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:09,089
Even I'm getting nervous. Seriously.

1421
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,589
Yo. Shake it.

1422
01:01:12,819 --> 01:01:15,460
- You're walking differently now.
- "Shake it."

1423
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,860
That's all I know.

1424
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,469
(And they're still rapping
without hesitation.)

1425
01:01:24,739 --> 01:01:27,040
(Someone interrupts him.)

1426
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,369
You're allowed to interrupt them?

1427
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:33,409
(Is that all right?)

1428
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,279
(He gets his turn back and raps.)

1429
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,880
(Someone interrupts him again.)

1430
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:41,449
(Fancy and provocative gestures)

1431
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:44,060
(So, you want this battle?)

1432
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:45,619
(Sneezing)

1433
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,489
(Things are heating up.)

1434
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:49,960
- Are you sure you can join them?
- I couldn't.

1435
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,130
Do you think you can spit anything
in the middle of that?

1436
01:01:52,929 --> 01:01:54,869
(Someone joins them.)

1437
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:56,600
(A three-way battle begins
out of the blue.)

1438
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,000
This is war.

1439
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:00,810
(Feeling dizzy)

1440
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:02,210
(Screaming inside)

1441
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:06,179
I'm not sure when to cut in.

1442
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:08,179
It was so difficult.

1443
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,549
You need to have that vigor.

1444
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:13,690
Vigor and guts. You need to be shameless.

1445
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:16,719
(One man starts rapping,)

1446
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:20,860
(and other rappers cut in instantly.)

1447
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:23,900
(Yo!)

1448
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,900
What?

1449
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,759
- It's the violinist.
- Yes, it is.

1450
01:02:26,759 --> 01:02:28,270
(Bring it on!)

1451
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:29,469
(The girl with the violin had hidden
her strength.)

1452
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:31,270
They're good.

1453
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,639
I need courage.

1454
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:35,040
(Realizing)

1455
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,409
I need courage.

1456
01:02:37,509 --> 01:02:39,040
Yes, have courage.

1457
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:40,679
- You don't have to do well.
- You've got this.

1458
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:41,679
You just go in and spit it out.

1459
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:43,150
You just need to say what's on your mind.

1460
01:02:44,619 --> 01:02:47,319
(Yes.)

1461
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:50,290
(I'll have courage.)

1462
01:02:51,319 --> 01:02:53,389
Hey. Yo.

1463
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,730
(Screaming)

1464
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:59,360
He's finally begun!

1465
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,600
(Kian84 starts screaming like a water deer
out of embarrassment.)

1466
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:05,569
He's finally here. It's MC Kian84.

1467
01:03:05,569 --> 01:03:08,810
- MC Kian84.
- I can't watch this.

1468
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,279
Hey. Yo.

1469
01:03:14,409 --> 01:03:15,449
This is driving me crazy.

1470
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:17,520
Yo.

1471
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:20,420
(Bringing out his inner swag)

1472
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,949
(Here it comes.)

1473
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,589
The beat changed.

1474
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,319
He's grooving.

1475
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,889
It's a tough beat to rap to.

1476
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:29,630
He's revving up.

1477
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,130
I didn't know how to start, Simon.

1478
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,130
(I'm a hip-hop truck
with a broken steering wheel.)

1479
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:35,230
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1480
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:37,869
My man, guys.

1481
01:03:37,869 --> 01:03:39,100
- Ready?
- Okay.

1482
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,739
Are you ready?

1483
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:43,210
- I can't watch this.
- To the center?

1484
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,179
Even I hadn't done that before.

1485
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:48,080
(It wasn't exactly a battle.)

1486
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,549
(It was more like taking turns
to release their pent-up emotions.)

1487
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,250
(What he realized
in the birthplace of hip-hop)

1488
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,819
(Hip-hop is about releasing
your pent-up emotions!)

1489
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:57,690
Show them
that you're the Grand Award winner.

1490
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,619
Just shout things out in Korean.

1491
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,230
I decided to do what I wanted.

1492
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:03,529
I'm starting without hesitation.

1493
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:04,900
(Okay!)

1494
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:05,900
(I'm a Korean!)

1495
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:09,069
(Making nuclear bombs)

1496
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:10,739
(You know North Korea?)

1497
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:16,839
(I'm South Korean)

1498
01:04:16,839 --> 01:04:19,509
(Oh, South Korean.)

1499
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,650
(You scared us, bro.)

1500
01:04:22,949 --> 01:04:24,219
(I'm a...)

1501
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,650
(BTS)

1502
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,719
(BLACKPINK)

1503
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,989
(My friends)

1504
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:32,060
- Oh, please.
- My goodness.

1505
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:33,589
Please take his microphone away.

1506
01:04:34,589 --> 01:04:35,989
(You know Simon Dominic?)

1507
01:04:35,989 --> 01:04:37,259
(How about that?)

1508
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:39,259
(Simon who?)

1509
01:04:39,259 --> 01:04:40,330
"Simon who!"

1510
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:42,699
(Don't they know him?)

1511
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,440
(Screw MBC)

1512
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:47,839
(Excuse me?)

1513
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,080
(The crowd goes wild.)

1514
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,610
- This was a wrong project.
- "Screw MBC!"

1515
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:56,150
Ji Woo, this was a wrong project.

1516
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,880
This is so wrong.

1517
01:04:59,819 --> 01:05:00,850
This is wrong.

1518
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:01,850
(Crying)

1519
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:04,389
- I can't believe you said that.
- We need to wrap it up.

1520
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:05,889
- Wrap it up.
- Something went seriously wrong.

1521
01:05:05,889 --> 01:05:08,159
Let's go back to Serengeti.

1522
01:05:08,259 --> 01:05:09,389
- I mean...
- Go back.

1523
01:05:10,029 --> 01:05:11,100
(They all started crying
30 seconds into his rap.)

1524
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,429
- I can't watch this.
- My belly hurts.

1525
01:05:13,429 --> 01:05:14,429
I wish I could hide.

1526
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:16,869
(Embarrassed laughter)

1527
01:05:17,069 --> 01:05:19,139
CEO of MBC, please don't get me wrong.

1528
01:05:19,139 --> 01:05:23,210
I guess I wanted to act tough
without realizing.

1529
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,339
The broadcasting industry is
pretty screwed.

1530
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,250
I kept using the F-word...

1531
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:30,719
for things that I cherished.

1532
01:05:31,549 --> 01:05:33,119
I almost cursed my mom too.

1533
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,520
Even your mom?

1534
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,360
The type of hip-hop that I learned...

1535
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:40,190
always began with a tough story.

1536
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:44,929
I meant to say that I was
from South Korea, not North Korea.

1537
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,159
You wrote "new clear"
instead of "nuclear."

1538
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:48,929
The spelling was...

1539
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:50,940
Those are the words "new" and "clear."

1540
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,770
Oh, did I spell it wrong?

1541
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:54,610
- It's clear.
- New and clear?

1542
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,639
"New clear."

1543
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:57,710
You wrote
about how you're getting paid more.

1544
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,710
Has your appearance fee gone up?

1545
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,110
- That's good news.
- Hold on.

1546
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:02,409
I forgot about that as I was doing it.

1547
01:06:02,409 --> 01:06:04,520
MBC pays you more, and you swear at them?

1548
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:08,119
MBC decided to pay you more.

1549
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:09,290
Why did you swear at them?

1550
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,759
(Stammering)

1551
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:14,159
(Feeling embarrassed a bit too late)

1552
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:15,929
(Keep going.)

1553
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,600
(He's already too dizzy.)

1554
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:23,830
(I got you, bro.)

1555
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:24,900
He's so reliable.

1556
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,770
(I'm from Brooklyn,
and he's from South Korea)

1557
01:06:27,369 --> 01:06:28,469
(The rapper next to him helps.)

1558
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:30,509
- He's helping you out.
- This is crazy.

1559
01:06:30,509 --> 01:06:33,080
(Fortunately, he catches his breath
and regains consciousness.)

1560
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,549
(Thanks, friend.)

1561
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:39,679
<i>I used to be a cartoonist</i>
<i>Now, I'm on TV to make a living</i>

1562
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:42,889
<i>I thought this TV show was a failure</i>
<i>Now, it's the fourth season</i>

1563
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,690
<i>MBC's best TV program</i>

1564
01:06:46,259 --> 01:06:48,889
- He's telling his story now.
- He's getting serious.

1565
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:52,230
<i>My mom always tells me</i>
<i>to give her a grandson</i>

1566
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:53,699
He's rhyming too!

1567
01:06:53,699 --> 01:06:57,170
<i>Sorry, Mom,</i>
<i>I'm rapping in Brooklyn instead</i>

1568
01:06:57,699 --> 01:07:01,339
<i>I don't know when this trip will end</i>

1569
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,040
<i>Let me try making music</i>

1570
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,339
<i>I like it!</i>

1571
01:07:06,409 --> 01:07:08,549
(Good job, bro!)

1572
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,319
- "I like it."
- All right!

1573
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:13,679
- I liked the ending.
- This is crazy.

1574
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:17,560
- That was a freestyle, but he rhymed.
- Yes.

1575
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,060
Like, "MBC's program."

1576
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:21,159
And "grandson."

1577
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:23,460
He actually rhymed.

1578
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,699
- That was pure instinct.
- And he had amazing courage.

1579
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:27,029
That was impressive. Well done.

1580
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:28,529
- Gosh.
- You didn't embarrass any of us.

1581
01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:29,600
- Really?
- Yes.

1582
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:30,869
- Really, Simon?
- Yes.

1583
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:33,170
At least you...

1584
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:34,569
- Do you mean that?
- I do.

1585
01:07:34,569 --> 01:07:37,440
- "Do you mean that?"
- Are you just saying it as a friend?

1586
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,710
No, I mean it.

1587
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:40,980
(Is that so?)

1588
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,679
- The latter part was good.
- Thanks.

1589
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:44,779
- I loved it.
- At least I have your approval.

1590
01:07:44,779 --> 01:07:46,920
- It's about confidence.
- I loved it.

1591
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,719
(He maintained his confidence...)

1592
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,690
(and finished his part.)

1593
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:53,089
(Shy)

1594
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:55,730
(Well done, bro.)

1595
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:56,759
Yo!

1596
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:01,100
(Other rappers cheer him for his courage.)

1597
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:04,139
Shoutout to the homie too.
He was rapping in a different language.

1598
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:05,600
(He rapped in a different language.)

1599
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,639
- Goodness.
- Thank you.

1600
01:08:07,139 --> 01:08:09,469
- He represented Korea.
- I'm proud of him.

1601
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:11,810
Good job.

1602
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:14,110
That's how you know
that hip-hop is international.

1603
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:16,980
That's how you know
that everyone connects to hip-hop.

1604
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,850
So, shoutout to the homie.
He was rapping in Korean.

1605
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:23,420
(Regardless of the skills,
the clap for his brave attempt.)

1606
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,960
Yo, real quick. Just so you know...

1607
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,259
I was...

1608
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:32,029
on the stage before I knew it.

1609
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:34,770
I experience so many things
that I wouldn't have been able to...

1610
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,329
on "Adventure by Accident."

1611
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:39,139
This new experience...

1612
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:42,940
was unbelievable.
In the birthplace of hip-hop,

1613
01:08:43,209 --> 01:08:44,910
I got to...

1614
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:46,910
rap some lines before I knew it.

1615
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,280
It's tough even for professional rappers.

1616
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,450
- You bet.
- That's impressive.

1617
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:51,719
- It would have been tough for me too.
- It really is impressive.

1618
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,679
- Still...
- It would have been tough for me.

1619
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:56,520
As a person
who has drawn webtoons for years,

1620
01:08:57,389 --> 01:09:00,520
I say this to aspiring webtoon artists
in Korea.

1621
01:09:01,389 --> 01:09:04,200
"Don't try to come up with the stories
to become a webtoon artist."

1622
01:09:05,329 --> 01:09:07,030
"You'll naturally become one..."

1623
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:08,770
"when you have a story
that you want to tell."

1624
01:09:09,629 --> 01:09:10,629
That's awesome.

1625
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:14,070
What matters is that
they were my emotions to release.

1626
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:16,570
- That was fantastic.
- Who would ever experience that?

1627
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:19,079
I can't expect to succeed immediately,

1628
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,810
but I find comfort in the fact...

1629
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:24,049
that I got to try it out.
It's still a shame, though.

1630
01:09:26,919 --> 01:09:30,150
(He finishes rapping his lyrics.)

1631
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,419
Yes!

1632
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:34,990
(Now, he enjoys the cypher
with a light heart.)

1633
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:36,959
Heck, yes!

1634
01:09:37,429 --> 01:09:39,429
MC Kian84's face looks far more at ease.

1635
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:41,929
- "MC Kian84?"
- He's more relaxed now.

1636
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,839
- What did those lyrics mean?
- Yes.

1637
01:09:46,139 --> 01:09:47,139
I heard you said it.

1638
01:09:47,139 --> 01:09:49,509
What my rap meant?

1639
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,610
Yes. Thanks.

1640
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:54,610
- He's got new friends.
- Goodness.

1641
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,049
(Hey, bro.)

1642
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,650
(What are you doing tomorrow?)

1643
01:09:58,650 --> 01:09:59,650
Tomorrow?

1644
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,520
Tomorrow... I don't know.

1645
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,049
I have no schedule.

1646
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,560
No schedule.

1647
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:08,389
(Do you want to come
to our recording studio?)

1648
01:10:08,389 --> 01:10:09,429
Seriously?

1649
01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:12,700
- Your studio?
- Yes.

1650
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,700
Sure!

1651
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,469
My name is VSOP SITY.

1652
01:10:16,669 --> 01:10:18,770
Okay. Hold on. What do I do?

1653
01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:21,639
Is this your Instagram account?

1654
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:24,209
(He's invited to a studio
where only musicians are allowed.)

1655
01:10:24,209 --> 01:10:27,110
Oh, rap groups are created
at such cyphers.

1656
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:29,280
- They cast you.
- On the street too.

1657
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,120
- Yes, you were cast on the street.
- Even I never got such offers.

1658
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,120
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1659
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,520
- He must have liked you.
- Yes.

1660
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,490
Let's meet up at around...

1661
01:10:37,759 --> 01:10:39,020
We can meet up in the morning.

1662
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,959
Can I DM you?

1663
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:43,459
- Yes, DM me.
- Okay.

1664
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,129
- All right. Thank you.
- Thanks, man.

1665
01:10:46,429 --> 01:10:47,799
- Bye.
- All right. Nice to meet you.

1666
01:10:47,799 --> 01:10:49,400
- Nice to meet you.
- Good job.

1667
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,469
Good job.

1668
01:10:50,469 --> 01:10:51,499
(They promise to meet up
early in the morning.)

1669
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,910
(Kian84 leaves first.)

1670
01:10:57,839 --> 01:11:00,310
What a shame.

1671
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:01,879
I could have done better.

1672
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,350
<i>Simon</i>

1673
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,190
He keeps singing that song.

1674
01:11:08,589 --> 01:11:10,549
He's constantly reminded of Simon.

1675
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:13,160
This feels like a trip dedicated to Simon.

1676
01:11:13,389 --> 01:11:16,030
- Am I dead or something?
- No, you're still alive.

1677
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:17,129
(He's obsessed with Simon.)

1678
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,929
<i>Simon Dominic</i>

1679
01:11:19,929 --> 01:11:22,070
It would have been great
if I had come here with him.

1680
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,499
He would have killed it.

1681
01:11:26,539 --> 01:11:28,810
<i>My friend, Simon, is a rapper</i>

1682
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,179
<i>A 40-year-old bachelor</i>

1683
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:34,480
<i>He doesn't even have a girlfriend</i>
<i>He's not married</i>

1684
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,650
Are you dissing me right now?

1685
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:39,150
<i>An old bachelor who lives alone</i>
<i>We grow old together</i>

1686
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,389
<i>Get married</i>
<i>and give your parents grandchildren</i>

1687
01:11:43,419 --> 01:11:44,490
I like it.

1688
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:46,389
Excuse me.

1689
01:11:47,459 --> 01:11:49,259
- Hello?
- Hello.

1690
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:51,860
What should I eat?

1691
01:11:52,499 --> 01:11:55,070
You must be hungry. You haven't had
anything to eat since lunch.

1692
01:11:55,829 --> 01:11:56,829
(He quickly scans the menu.)

1693
01:11:56,829 --> 01:11:57,839
Let's see.

1694
01:11:58,169 --> 01:12:00,799
Half... I should get a half dish.

1695
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,969
- Excuse me?
- Yes, sir.

1696
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,280
This one. A big bag.

1697
01:12:06,839 --> 01:12:08,079
- Okay.
- Takeaway, please.

1698
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:10,709
They close early at night,

1699
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:12,350
so I'm taking the food out.

1700
01:12:13,719 --> 01:12:15,190
That was a bit...

1701
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,749
- You still regret it.
- You regret it.

1702
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,660
I could have done better. What a bummer.

1703
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,690
No, you did well.

1704
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:22,629
(His food is ready.)

1705
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:23,759
- All right.
- It's ready.

1706
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:26,530
(His food is in a plastic bag.)

1707
01:12:27,299 --> 01:12:30,429
(Spices in steamed seafood)

1708
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,839
- That looks scrumptious.
- It looks so good.

1709
01:12:33,339 --> 01:12:34,709
They come in plastic bags.

1710
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:36,709
- That's delicious.
- American steamed seafood.

1711
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:39,879
(Try it out.)

1712
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,480
- Is this famous?
- Yes.

1713
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,280
- Famous...
- Most famous.

1714
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,679
- The most famous store?
- Yes.

1715
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:47,690
- Yes?
- Yes.

1716
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:49,889
(He takes out all his dollars
and gets ready to pay.)

1717
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:53,160
- Forty-four dollars.
- All right. Thank you, sir.

1718
01:12:53,419 --> 01:12:54,629
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1719
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:56,190
All right.

1720
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:58,100
(Take care.)

1721
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:01,299
(He returns to his dorm.)

1722
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,829
Such a long day.

1723
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:06,100
What a bummer.

1724
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,870
(He still thinks
he could have done better.)

1725
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:09,810
(Sitting)

1726
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:12,039
(Going through his things)

1727
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:16,009
I like beer.

1728
01:13:16,009 --> 01:13:17,179
(The beer he bought on his way here)

1729
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,690
(He drinks from the bottle.)

1730
01:13:23,589 --> 01:13:25,690
- That must have felt nice.
- I bet it was good.

1731
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,190
(Looking around)

1732
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:29,259
(Looking around)

1733
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,959
He didn't give me any chopsticks.

1734
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:36,169
(The dish he picked turned out to be
finger food.)

1735
01:13:36,969 --> 01:13:39,339
(He casually eats dinner with his hands.)

1736
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,370
(Adding the taste of his hands)

1737
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,940
(Moaning)

1738
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:44,740
- Goodness.
- It tasted good, though.

1739
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:46,740
(Biting the lobster tail off)

1740
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:50,579
(He doesn't want to miss
a single drop of this taste.)

1741
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:52,179
(Sucking)

1742
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,350
This is my favorite part
of "Adventure by Accident."

1743
01:13:57,049 --> 01:13:59,919
(He forgets about his regret by eating.)

1744
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,990
(Here comes a big one.)

1745
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:05,360
That looks so tasty.

1746
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,400
(A big bite of the crab)

1747
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,400
I'm getting hungry.

1748
01:14:08,429 --> 01:14:10,999
(He finishes his dinner
with the taste from his hands...)

1749
01:14:13,169 --> 01:14:15,610
(and takes his phone out of the bag.)

1750
01:14:16,669 --> 01:14:17,879
(Putting on music)

1751
01:14:17,879 --> 01:14:20,179
You're enjoying the lingering excitement.

1752
01:14:21,209 --> 01:14:22,249
(And it's Simon's song again!)

1753
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,780
- Can you stop playing my song?
- Your songs give me courage.

1754
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,749
Is that right?
That song was released a decade ago.

1755
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:27,990
(Are you watching, Simon?)

1756
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:29,520
(Singing for his fan)

1757
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,549
<i>I came late</i>

1758
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,560
(At least I participated
in real hip-hop while I was here.)

1759
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,990
- You look like a musician.
- I was reminded of you.

1760
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:36,160
(At least I participated
in real hip-hop while I was here.)

1761
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:39,129
(Thinking hard)

1762
01:14:40,329 --> 01:14:41,329
I should write a journal.

1763
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:45,600
(Writing down today's inspirations)

1764
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,240
You used to draw things to summarize them.

1765
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:50,509
This time, you write rap lyrics.

1766
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:52,110
I just wrote down what came to my mind.

1767
01:14:52,379 --> 01:14:54,610
I sent them to the songwriter.

1768
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:56,310
I kept doing it during the entire trip.

1769
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:57,950
- You kept communicating with them.
- Yes.

1770
01:14:59,419 --> 01:15:00,450
<i>Hi</i>

1771
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,850
<i>I'm from South Korea</i>

1772
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,820
<i>I do whatever I want, though I'm old</i>

1773
01:15:06,219 --> 01:15:07,419
<i>Now, I'm in Brooklyn</i>

1774
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,660
<i>- To make music</i>
- You're rapping.

1775
01:15:09,959 --> 01:15:11,259
You're certainly in AOMG.

1776
01:15:11,929 --> 01:15:12,929
Exactly.

1777
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:15,469
<i>I thought this show was a failure</i>
<i>Now, it's the fourth season</i>

1778
01:15:16,669 --> 01:15:18,139
It's like I went from the universe
of cute and adorable "Home Alone,"

1779
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,070
which was filled with dreams and hopes,

1780
01:15:20,969 --> 01:15:23,110
to the world of "Joker."

1781
01:15:23,469 --> 01:15:25,579
It's like "Home Alone 2" in Manhattan.

1782
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:27,579
It's the hotel that Kevin stayed at.

1783
01:15:28,209 --> 01:15:29,249
Once you leave that area,

1784
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:30,950
it's "Joker."

1785
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:34,020
(His first day in New York felt like
coming to a tough and crude world.)

1786
01:15:35,789 --> 01:15:37,789
I borrowed two videotapes from the store.

1787
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:39,589
"Home Alone" and "Joker."

1788
01:15:40,089 --> 01:15:41,160
"Home Alone Joker."

1789
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,389
- "Home Alone Joker."
- Two very different movies.

1790
01:15:45,129 --> 01:15:47,329
- He's certainly a storyteller.
- Indeed.

1791
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:48,400
(Shy)

1792
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:51,999
(His 1st day of the trip ends.)

1793
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:03,110
(Day 2 in New York from Brooklyn)

1794
01:16:05,419 --> 01:16:08,249
(The morning of colorful Brooklyn
slowly begins.)

1795
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,560
What?

1796
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:14,389
- A bodybuilder is there.
- Who's he?

1797
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,190
- I was having trouble over the jet lag.
- I understand.

1798
01:16:18,299 --> 01:16:20,230
(He painfully gets up.)

1799
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:21,929
Gosh.

1800
01:16:22,429 --> 01:16:24,070
(Yawning)

1801
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:26,139
Oh, I forgot. I'm in New York now.

1802
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:28,669
I should've worked out. Gosh.

1803
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,879
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

1804
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:37,110
One day... One more.

1805
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:38,620
- You'd like to extend your stay?
- Yes.

1806
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,950
It seems so natural now.

1807
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:43,190
My level of English reached the top now.

1808
01:16:43,789 --> 01:16:44,889
"The top?"

1809
01:16:44,889 --> 01:16:46,060
- Yes, I reached the top.
- It can be better, for sure.

1810
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,120
You speak like a native speaker.

1811
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:49,129
(He is a different type of prodigy.)

1812
01:16:49,589 --> 01:16:50,629
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1813
01:16:50,629 --> 01:16:51,629
(He extended his stay
without any problem.)

1814
01:16:51,629 --> 01:16:52,999
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

1815
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:55,299
(The accommodation fee is 74.36 dollars,
roughly 100,000 Korean won.)

1816
01:16:55,929 --> 01:16:59,770
Oh, the US! This clean air without dust
makes me so good!

1817
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,469
Let's see. I should go to see that guy.

1818
01:17:04,469 --> 01:17:05,940
What was his name?

1819
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:06,940
(Who is he going to meet
in this early morning?)

1820
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,350
(They met each other
at the cypher yesterday.)

1821
01:17:10,579 --> 01:17:12,950
- I have no schedule.
- I have a studio.

1822
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:15,320
Tomorrow, I can go.

1823
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,950
- I mean, to your company.
- That's nice.

1824
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,719
"Humboldt Street, Brooklyn, New York..."

1825
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:22,289
Oh, it's not far away.

1826
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,169
(He moves to the appointment place
full of expectation.)

1827
01:17:29,299 --> 01:17:30,299
It's there.

1828
01:17:31,799 --> 01:17:33,999
(Is this a music studio?)

1829
01:17:35,169 --> 01:17:36,209
It's here.

1830
01:17:38,009 --> 01:17:39,940
It looks like a public office.

1831
01:17:40,539 --> 01:17:43,249
- "Voicing, Natural."
- Didn't he say it was for recording?

1832
01:17:43,879 --> 01:17:46,179
I should download a translation app.

1833
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:48,089
"Photo translator."

1834
01:17:48,089 --> 01:17:49,289
(He opens a photo translation app.)

1835
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:52,759
"Service. A retirement community
that was naturally organized?"

1836
01:17:52,759 --> 01:17:53,789
(A retirement community)

1837
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:55,360
(Embarrassed)

1838
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:57,259
It looks like a career office.

1839
01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:00,759
This guy wanted to help me get a job?

1840
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,169
He might have been offered a job
with his rap skills.

1841
01:18:03,169 --> 01:18:04,530
- He surely looks very earnest.
- That's right.

1842
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,270
(He just rings the doorbell.)

1843
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,870
(There's no bell sound.)

1844
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:11,039
The bell is right next to him!

1845
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:12,440
(You should look at me, Kian84!)

1846
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,339
Oh, it's here.

1847
01:18:14,339 --> 01:18:16,179
(He finally found the doorbell.)

1848
01:18:16,179 --> 01:18:17,650
Excuse me?

1849
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,389
- Yes?
- Hello!

1850
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,950
- What's going on?
- Oh, yes.

1851
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:24,190
How are you doing?

1852
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:25,660
I am...

1853
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,789
Could you tell me your name again?

1854
01:18:27,789 --> 01:18:29,730
- Sorry?
- I don't remember your name.

1855
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:30,889
"Abudabu?"

1856
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,360
- My name?
- Yes. I'd like to know your name.

1857
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,200
- My name is Kim.
- Kim?

1858
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,669
Yes. What's your name?

1859
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,999
- "VSOP SITY."
- "P CITY?"

1860
01:18:37,999 --> 01:18:40,270
- It's v, s, o, p, "VSOP."
- "Risa?"

1861
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:42,740
- V and SOP.
- V. "VSOP."

1862
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,969
- "SITY."
- "SITY."

1863
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,440
- Yes.
- "VSOP SITY."

1864
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,910
- Okay.
- That's my music name.

1865
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:48,950
- Oh, it's your music name?
- Yes, and Instagram as well.

1866
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,280
So, is this a school?

1867
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,749
This... I work here.

1868
01:18:52,919 --> 01:18:55,549
- Oh, you work here?
- Yes, I work here. And...

1869
01:18:55,749 --> 01:18:58,060
We teach kids different things.

1870
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,360
- Are you a teacher?
- Yes.

1871
01:19:00,789 --> 01:19:03,789
(He was the master of cypher,
ruling the backstreet.)

1872
01:19:04,329 --> 01:19:06,160
(However, he's a teacher here.)

1873
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,270
I'm an assistant director of the program.

1874
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:10,400
- I'm in after-school programs.
- Oh, really?

1875
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,070
Oh, What he said is
like an after-school program?

1876
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:14,600
As I saw it before,

1877
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,539
there were some students,

1878
01:19:16,539 --> 01:19:19,310
and the place seemed like
it was for culture and arts activities.

1879
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:21,980
- So, in groups...
- Yes, like teaching kids as well.

1880
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,410
- That's right.
- I see.

1881
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:25,179
Please, look at this.

1882
01:19:26,549 --> 01:19:29,289
Do you see it right here?
It's all my staff.

1883
01:19:29,889 --> 01:19:32,360
- I'll show you around.
- Okay.

1884
01:19:34,459 --> 01:19:36,060
So these are like classrooms.

1885
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,860
We teach them.

1886
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,730
VSOP SITY, you...

1887
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:41,600
Do you teach music?

1888
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,030
- I teach students music. Like you know...
- Do you teach hip-hop?

1889
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:46,539
Yes, I teach them hip-hop.

1890
01:19:46,539 --> 01:19:48,669
- I teach them how to...
- It's an early education.

1891
01:19:48,669 --> 01:19:49,940
You know, making music...

1892
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,009
So, this is the gym.

1893
01:19:52,009 --> 01:19:54,709
All of my kids are here.

1894
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:56,249
Shouldn't he teach kids now?

1895
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:59,350
You don't have a class now?

1896
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:00,850
Oh, no. Not right now.

1897
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,520
Right now, I'm hanging out with you.

1898
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,919
He's a senior here. then.

1899
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,320
He can take his time.

1900
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,360
(He can surely have time for himself.)

1901
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,789
Let's take a seat and continue talking.

1902
01:20:13,259 --> 01:20:14,999
(Surprised)

1903
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,600
(He brought some snacks.)

1904
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,469
I'm fine with a glass of water.

1905
01:20:18,469 --> 01:20:20,200
- This...
- Yes.

1906
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,209
- Gosh.
- It's a salad.

1907
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:25,110
I shouldn't forget his name. VSOP SITY.

1908
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,539
"VSOP SITY."

1909
01:20:26,539 --> 01:20:28,209
(He even wrote his name in Korean
in order not to forget it.)

1910
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:30,650
What do you do?

1911
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:32,950
It's a famous Korean television show.

1912
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,690
Okay. It's like...

1913
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:39,320
VSOP SITY, I thought you were...

1914
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,560
a real gangster and hip-hop rapper.

1915
01:20:41,829 --> 01:20:44,190
- You mean I was hiding my true self?
- I thought you did.

1916
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:47,600
But I see you are a really good person.

1917
01:20:48,299 --> 01:20:49,870
- Right.
- There were some gaps in between.

1918
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:52,139
I used to have a whole different life.

1919
01:20:52,469 --> 01:20:54,070
You see, there was
a lot of different stuff.

1920
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:56,270
I'd been in gangs.

1921
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:57,509
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.

1922
01:20:57,509 --> 01:20:58,709
- Gosh.
- Really?

1923
01:20:58,709 --> 01:21:00,280
- He used to be.
- Yes, he was before.

1924
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:03,310
- Two years?
- Yes. Two years ago.

1925
01:21:04,179 --> 01:21:05,280
I went to jail.

1926
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,950
He had a tough life.

1927
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:10,820
People... I had to protect myself.

1928
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:12,919
You know what I mean, but...

1929
01:21:12,919 --> 01:21:15,230
Before I had a kid.
Now, I have a daughter.

1930
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:17,490
- Are you married?
- I'm getting married.

1931
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:19,160
I've proposed, and I'm engaged now.

1932
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,829
That's not my life anymore.

1933
01:21:20,829 --> 01:21:23,770
- I don't do that stuff anymore.
- That's good.

1934
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:27,039
Like my overall thing
that I do in my life is music.

1935
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:28,370
It's hip-hop, so...

1936
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:30,339
Is your dream a rapper, then?

1937
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:32,480
Oh, yes. I'm an artist.

1938
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,879
- I have a lot of music in stuff.
- Yes, I see that.

1939
01:21:34,879 --> 01:21:36,450
You...

1940
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:38,780
- You want to see some of my songs?
- Yes.

1941
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:40,450
I want.

1942
01:21:41,419 --> 01:21:43,419
(His mainstream beats come out.)

1943
01:21:43,419 --> 01:21:46,060
- It's a music video?
- Yes, that's a music video.

1944
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:47,160
Oh, really?

1945
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,660
- "VSOP SITY."
- Yes.

1946
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,889
(Based in Brooklyn
where he was born and raised,)

1947
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:53,400
(he made all music videos here.)

1948
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,969
That's it. That's what rappers often do.

1949
01:21:54,969 --> 01:21:56,969
Rappers often make songs...

1950
01:21:56,969 --> 01:21:58,839
using their hometown and experiences.

1951
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,669
They all show up in their lyrics.

1952
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:04,009
(It's good.)

1953
01:22:04,009 --> 01:22:06,209
Listen, I'm going to take you here.

1954
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:09,579
Are you still good?
Are you ready for a little tour?

1955
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:10,850
- Okay.
- Ready?

1956
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:12,450
He wanted...

1957
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:15,020
to show me his town and region.

1958
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:17,889
I'm just taking you...

1959
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:21,060
to different places in Brooklyn.

1960
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,360
The project right here is Bushwick.

1961
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,100
This is the Bushwick project.

1962
01:22:25,429 --> 01:22:27,730
And I work in the Bushwick project, right?

1963
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:29,700
But my neighborhood's project is
Cooper project.

1964
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,329
So, that's where we are going to walk to,

1965
01:22:31,329 --> 01:22:33,570
and I'm going to show you
everything like that.

1966
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,810
What VSOP SITY said is...

1967
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:38,379
the council estate founded
by the US government...

1968
01:22:38,379 --> 01:22:40,139
to solve a shortage of houses.

1969
01:22:40,139 --> 01:22:42,950
Especially black people,
they cherish their communities,

1970
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:46,020
so their neighbors and friends
who grew up...

1971
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,419
in the same communities
are considered families.

1972
01:22:47,419 --> 01:22:49,020
So that's what the project was about.

1973
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:52,459
It's a popular place...

1974
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,889
- in many movies and dramas.
- Yes.

1975
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,289
- "Cooper project?"
- Yes.

1976
01:22:56,289 --> 01:22:58,860
That's where the home
of the real hip-hop artists.

1977
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:03,829
(It takes roughly 25 minutes from here to
Cooper project place, VSOP SITY's town.)

1978
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,370
- Yes.
- Real hip-hop.

1979
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:06,770
Real hip-hop artists are...

1980
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:09,310
Have you heard of "Slaughterhouse"
from Eminem?

1981
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:10,539
Oh, Slaughterhouse?

1982
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:12,980
One of the members of the group is
Joell Ortiz.

1983
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,079
- His group.
- Really?

1984
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:17,749
Yes, Joell's old name is Joell Ortiz.

1985
01:23:17,749 --> 01:23:19,719
Oh, wait. On his backside. Who are you?

1986
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:21,549
Look at this! He's my friend.

1987
01:23:21,749 --> 01:23:23,749
What's up, brother?

1988
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,320
It's cool.

1989
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,389
What are you doing, brother?

1990
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:27,889
Say hi to this guy.

1991
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:30,889
- Yeah, brother.
- He's a famous artist in South Korea.

1992
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,200
- It's Kim.
- From South Korea.

1993
01:23:32,329 --> 01:23:33,329
What's up, man?

1994
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,669
Oh, you want it? Teach him!

1995
01:23:37,629 --> 01:23:38,639
It was cool.

1996
01:23:38,839 --> 01:23:40,600
Take a look. I'll show you. You watch us.

1997
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:43,139
(It's a perfect partnership.)

1998
01:23:43,469 --> 01:23:44,539
Did you see that?

1999
01:23:44,539 --> 01:23:46,379
Gosh!

2000
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:47,539
(A bit clumsy)

2001
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:48,579
There you go!

2002
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:50,780
People always have that kind of gesture.

2003
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:52,219
- You did well.
- They often do it, right?

2004
01:23:52,379 --> 01:23:54,879
Come walk with us, man. I was going to
take him to the neighborhood.

2005
01:23:56,049 --> 01:23:58,389
I'm just showing him
different places and stuff.

2006
01:23:58,389 --> 01:24:00,320
- These guys are...
- So, this is crazy.

2007
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,089
They all look so strong.

2008
01:24:02,929 --> 01:24:04,999
- Are you guys friends with each other?
- Yes.

2009
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,900
It's like that in New York.

2010
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,499
It's like that in Brooklyn, especially.

2011
01:24:09,499 --> 01:24:11,370
You never know who you might run into.

2012
01:24:11,469 --> 01:24:13,070
(It's amazing!)

2013
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,370
This is Borinquen. You see this?

2014
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:16,440
Yes.

2015
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,639
Do you see this?
This is called Borinquen Plaza.

2016
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,440
- "Borinquen?"
- Yes, right.

2017
01:24:20,709 --> 01:24:22,110
Where is it?

2018
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:23,150
- You are...
- Fight.

2019
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:24,910
- A lot of fights.
- What fights?

2020
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:26,820
MMA or punches?

2021
01:24:27,049 --> 01:24:28,049
- MMA...
- No.

2022
01:24:28,549 --> 01:24:29,589
When the streetfights are in...

2023
01:24:29,589 --> 01:24:31,620
Here... Your people...

2024
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:34,789
All down the streets. Like this whole...

2025
01:24:34,889 --> 01:24:36,329
Literally right here.

2026
01:24:37,329 --> 01:24:38,499
Why?

2027
01:24:38,499 --> 01:24:41,499
It's just we are from over there,
and they are from over here.

2028
01:24:41,799 --> 01:24:43,669
It's just
because they are from different streets?

2029
01:24:43,929 --> 01:24:45,469
"This is not our territory."

2030
01:24:45,469 --> 01:24:46,499
(The fights were severe back then.)

2031
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:48,610
Some died while fighting?

2032
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:51,509
- Yeah, a lot.
- Why?

2033
01:24:52,139 --> 01:24:53,810
It was different things like gun violence.

2034
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:57,150
Suicide and health issues.

2035
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:58,919
There was a sad story.

2036
01:24:58,919 --> 01:25:00,520
So many friends lost their lives.

2037
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,889
They lost their lives on the streets.

2038
01:25:03,219 --> 01:25:04,289
I see.

2039
01:25:04,289 --> 01:25:05,490
(Bitter)

2040
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:07,759
It's crazy how violent back then.

2041
01:25:07,759 --> 01:25:09,860
It was like a drama. Shootouts and fights.

2042
01:25:10,459 --> 01:25:12,200
- Shootouts?
- Yes.

2043
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,959
- Shots?
- Yes. There were shots.

2044
01:25:13,959 --> 01:25:15,969
This is America. Yes. There are shootouts.

2045
01:25:15,969 --> 01:25:17,999
- Shots?
- This is Brooklyn.

2046
01:25:17,999 --> 01:25:19,940
- Brooklyn!
- And it's crazy...

2047
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,969
It looks so peaceful now.

2048
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:24,240
But back then,

2049
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,039
this was more dangerous than Harlem.

2050
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,549
That's what I heard.

2051
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:34,179
(The fights for territory at night
never ended back then.)

2052
01:25:36,650 --> 01:25:41,990
(It's a whole different view
compared to the city center of New York.)

2053
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:46,360
We mount to Grand Street.

2054
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,100
Grand Street is...

2055
01:25:49,429 --> 01:25:50,499
Projects.

2056
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,799
Are you fighting?

2057
01:25:52,299 --> 01:25:54,070
- WWE...
- There's an MMA champion!

2058
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:55,139
- MMA champion?
- Yes, right here.

2059
01:25:55,139 --> 01:25:56,209
He's Bing Nation.

2060
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:58,879
You're now in enemy territory.

2061
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,280
Grand Street.

2062
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,910
That's the cross reference.

2063
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:03,980
(Kian84 sees something.)

2064
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,219
These shoes, what does it mean?

2065
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,219
- What?
- What does it mean? Shoes.

2066
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,789
The shoestrings?

2067
01:26:10,219 --> 01:26:12,190
I see many shoes.

2068
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,160
(He saw shoes in the Bronx
the previous day.)

2069
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,360
Are they doing that for some reason?

2070
01:26:17,789 --> 01:26:19,560
I guess it has a meaning.

2071
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,560
(The shoes seem to mean something.)

2072
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:23,469
You know, if you enter a neighborhood...

2073
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:25,339
and you see shoestrings,
you already know that...

2074
01:26:25,339 --> 01:26:27,799
you're going into somewhere
crime happened.

2075
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:31,270
You're going somewhere, you know,
it could be dangerous.

2076
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:34,179
- If you die here, we take your shoes,
- Take my shoes?

2077
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:35,679
- put them on the line.
- We throw them on the line.

2078
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:39,480
Every time we throw shoes on the line,
it means somebody died.

2079
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,320
Bodies of fallen soldiers.

2080
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,219
(The hanging shoes symbolize crime.)

2081
01:26:44,089 --> 01:26:45,690
Once we cross Grand Street,

2082
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:47,120
it's enemy territory.

2083
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:50,429
- This side is for the enemy.
- Right.

2084
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:52,860
Now, it's more united.

2085
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,429
Now, you have settled a peace negotiation.

2086
01:26:54,999 --> 01:26:57,100
Now, you're in diplomatic relations.

2087
01:26:57,570 --> 01:26:59,770
Those shoes are like the 38th parallel.

2088
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:00,969
I've never seen those.

2089
01:27:00,969 --> 01:27:02,570
(Amazed)

2090
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:05,209
- What's wrong?
- I don't know why, but...

2091
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:09,650
In Brooklyn, now,
are there many gangsters?

2092
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:12,320
- Heck, yeah.
- Do they do drugs?

2093
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:14,679
I mean, just because you sell drugs,

2094
01:27:14,679 --> 01:27:15,749
that won't make you a gangster.

2095
01:27:15,749 --> 01:27:16,749
That won't make you a gangster.

2096
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:20,089
A lot of people think about
what a gangster is.

2097
01:27:20,419 --> 01:27:21,959
- But it's a misconstrue.
- Right.

2098
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,690
Real gangsters are the people
who provide for their family.

2099
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,660
They're men. The real gangsters are men.

2100
01:27:27,759 --> 01:27:29,329
- That's what we consider a gangster.
- They're knights.

2101
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:31,200
Just because you do something bad...

2102
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,370
or because you're in a gang, you know.

2103
01:27:33,469 --> 01:27:36,139
I guess they don't use the word gangster
for a negative meaning.

2104
01:27:36,139 --> 01:27:37,410
- It means a chivalrous fighter.
- Right.

2105
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:39,480
You're a gangster.

2106
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,810
- Yes.
- In both ways.

2107
01:27:43,579 --> 01:27:44,879
You're a gangster.

2108
01:27:44,879 --> 01:27:46,350
(Learning another meaning of gangster)

2109
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,919
(They managed to cross
the enemy territory.)

2110
01:27:50,219 --> 01:27:51,249
It's the same territory.

2111
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:52,690
They met someone.

2112
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:55,759
(His voice makes them laugh.)

2113
01:27:55,759 --> 01:27:57,160
Everybody is outside today.

2114
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,060
- My boy, yeah.
- What's going on?

2115
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,200
My goodness.

2116
01:28:00,959 --> 01:28:02,900
(Hip-hop vibe)

2117
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,370
They're splitting the beat
into so many pieces.

2118
01:28:06,169 --> 01:28:07,900
- How many times did they do it?
- They did it so many times.

2119
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,740
They did it like ninjas.

2120
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:15,179
(How American ninjas greet)

2121
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:17,679
I can't imitate that one.

2122
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:20,320
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing, Bro?

2123
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,690
I was just on my way to get some food.

2124
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,089
(Amazed)

2125
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,820
(Handshake in the air)

2126
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,089
Hello.

2127
01:28:29,089 --> 01:28:30,360
- Hi.
- You know...

2128
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,200
- I think I saw you yesterday.
- I saw you yesterday.

2129
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,259
- At the...
- Yes.

2130
01:28:33,259 --> 01:28:34,329
- At the cypher.
- I saw you.

2131
01:28:34,329 --> 01:28:35,730
- You saw me.
- Yes.

2132
01:28:35,929 --> 01:28:37,299
Now you do know...

2133
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:41,639
(Yesterday at the cypher)

2134
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:43,039
He's a great rapper.

2135
01:28:43,839 --> 01:28:46,440
(He has a great sense of rhythm.)

2136
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:49,379
- You were very good. I love you.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

2137
01:28:49,379 --> 01:28:50,379
You were good yesterday.

2138
01:28:50,379 --> 01:28:52,219
He has a good vibe. He's energetic.

2139
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:54,219
We were about to show him.

2140
01:28:54,219 --> 01:28:55,320
We were about to show him Cooper.

2141
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,190
- Do you want to come? Join us.
- All right, man.

2142
01:28:57,190 --> 01:28:58,889
- Want to go?
- All right.

2143
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:00,820
- Where are we going?
- My gosh.

2144
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:02,829
(How can he join them so easily?)

2145
01:29:02,829 --> 01:29:05,329
- Everyone is joining them.
- They don't make any appointments.

2146
01:29:05,329 --> 01:29:06,400
It's like the animation "One Piece".

2147
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,829
It's enough if they run into each other.

2148
01:29:07,929 --> 01:29:10,530
It's not like "I have work to do.
Let's meet at this place."

2149
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:12,100
If they happen to meet, they're like,
"Let's hang out."

2150
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,240
- That's what it's like there.
- That's funny.

2151
01:29:13,339 --> 01:29:14,639
That's so natural for them.

2152
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:15,940
It's like the Korean countryside.

2153
01:29:16,039 --> 01:29:17,169
That's a good vibe.

2154
01:29:17,169 --> 01:29:19,240
"Hey, where are you going?
Let me go with you."

2155
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,280
What's going on?

2156
01:29:21,009 --> 01:29:22,410
(Cool suggestion by friends)

2157
01:29:22,709 --> 01:29:24,209
- Do you want to go?
- All right, man.

2158
01:29:24,209 --> 01:29:25,650
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

2159
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:26,919
Do you know where you're going?

2160
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,190
It's Brooklyn, right?

2161
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:31,190
- What's your name?
- Toox.

2162
01:29:31,190 --> 01:29:32,289
- Toox.
- Yes, sir.

2163
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:34,060
- Toox.
- Toox, officially.

2164
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:35,629
Officially Toox.

2165
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:37,829
- Do you like sports?
- Baseball.

2166
01:29:37,829 --> 01:29:40,799
- Baseball?
- Baseball.

2167
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,900
See this. I'm a New York Yankees fan.

2168
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:45,030
- Do you like the New York Yankees?
- I love the Yankees.

2169
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:47,440
- The Yankees.
- I like the LA Dodgers.

2170
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:49,410
Okay. I know Shohei.

2171
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,810
Shohei is the best player
in the world. We know.

2172
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:53,709
(Laughing)

2173
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:55,780
Toox showed a great response.

2174
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:57,049
- It's nice.
- Yes.

2175
01:29:57,549 --> 01:30:00,120
(He makes people laugh.)

2176
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,889
I met Toox. We didn't communicate well,

2177
01:30:02,889 --> 01:30:04,249
but just looking at him made me laugh.

2178
01:30:04,549 --> 01:30:07,089
He resembled Whoopi Goldberg,
and he was all smiling.

2179
01:30:07,089 --> 01:30:08,419
His teeth look healthy.

2180
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:11,589
The person with the best-smiling face
in the world...

2181
01:30:11,589 --> 01:30:14,259
was Jean Claude I met in Madagascar.

2182
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,469
I met someone better than him here.

2183
01:30:17,929 --> 01:30:20,870
I don't know. He was smiling,

2184
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:22,270
so his face made me smile
when I looked at him.

2185
01:30:23,469 --> 01:30:24,940
(His energy has no limit.)

2186
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:28,780
(Shouting)

2187
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:31,280
(He's an energizer who never stops.)

2188
01:30:32,249 --> 01:30:33,679
- He's like a cartoon character.
- He makes me happy.

2189
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:34,850
He has wonderful energy.

2190
01:30:35,789 --> 01:30:39,089
And there's God Nation.

2191
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,620
I guess he's good at fighting.

2192
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:44,190
He resembles Daniel Cormier, a UFC player.

2193
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:47,100
He was a legendary heavyweight player.

2194
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,770
His look and body shape are just like
those of Daniel Cormier.

2195
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:52,030
And VSOP.

2196
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,469
"A gangster is someone
who protects his family."

2197
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,139
(Leaving his past behind)

2198
01:30:58,009 --> 01:31:00,639
He's a real man
with a sense of responsibility.

2199
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:02,209
He's mature.

2200
01:31:02,209 --> 01:31:04,850
(Kian84 got more friends
as he was walking.)

2201
01:31:05,350 --> 01:31:06,350
He keeps smiling.

2202
01:31:07,179 --> 01:31:08,820
Are you high school friends?

2203
01:31:09,190 --> 01:31:10,350
Man, we grew up together.

2204
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:11,350
- We grew up together.
- We grew up together.

2205
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:14,719
- Yes, since babies.
- Baby?

2206
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,759
- You're bosom friends.
- They're like family.

2207
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,360
- Brother.
- Yes.

2208
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,360
When you see the neighborhood,
you'll understand.

2209
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:23,299
- It's one big community.
- Family.

2210
01:31:24,299 --> 01:31:25,799
Gosh. What's that?

2211
01:31:25,799 --> 01:31:26,900
- Yes.
- There you go.

2212
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:28,669
(So many shoes)

2213
01:31:28,669 --> 01:31:29,770
You have to watch out in such an area.

2214
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:31,570
Enemy?

2215
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:33,339
That's how you know
you're in my territory.

2216
01:31:33,339 --> 01:31:34,810
That's the bridge to Cooper.

2217
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:37,079
That's the gate to Cooper.

2218
01:31:37,079 --> 01:31:40,350
So, this is the...

2219
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:44,120
This is the beginning of the neighborhood.

2220
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,120
This?

2221
01:31:45,389 --> 01:31:46,860
This is the beginning of the neighborhood.

2222
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:48,219
- Cooper?
- Yes.

2223
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,259
Contrary to popular belief...

2224
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,329
They google the address,
and they'll see the drug dealers.

2225
01:31:54,329 --> 01:31:55,799
(A place where drug dealers were seen)

2226
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,900
- They made the front page of this.
- The front page.

2227
01:31:59,070 --> 01:32:02,310
It almost feels like a dungeon gate. Okay.

2228
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:04,570
This is the gate.

2229
01:32:04,969 --> 01:32:06,039
Let's walk this way.

2230
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,480
There are so many.

2231
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,579
It's for a reason.

2232
01:32:10,579 --> 01:32:12,450
(Overwhelmed by so many shoes)

2233
01:32:12,549 --> 01:32:13,650
What's up, boy?

2234
01:32:13,879 --> 01:32:15,049
Yes, definitely.

2235
01:32:15,049 --> 01:32:17,249
What's going on?

2236
01:32:17,249 --> 01:32:19,320
This is Kian84 from South Korea.

2237
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,759
A famous artist from South Korea.

2238
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:21,889
It's hip-hop break.

2239
01:32:21,889 --> 01:32:23,389
- Hip-hop break.
- You got to break.

2240
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,799
- What's that? Who is it?
- Did they meet another friend?

2241
01:32:27,629 --> 01:32:28,929
- You got to break the beat.
- Goodness.

2242
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,270
It's Kian84. Nice to meet you.

2243
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:32,270
- Nice to meet you.
- From South Korea.

2244
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:33,570
It's a hot wheel.

2245
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:35,070
- My man.
- Buddy.

2246
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:37,009
- Cool.
- Gosh.

2247
01:32:38,169 --> 01:32:40,240
(Friends keep appearing.)

2248
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:43,410
We're getting more gang members.

2249
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:45,150
Doing what we can. That's all.

2250
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:46,179
I know what you see.

2251
01:32:46,179 --> 01:32:47,579
That's all. Yes.

2252
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:50,549
Yes, everybody outside.

2253
01:32:50,549 --> 01:32:51,650
(Will he be able to survive in the gang?)

2254
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,919
(You're Cooper family now!)

2255
01:32:53,919 --> 01:32:55,289
(Am I?)

2256
01:32:55,959 --> 01:32:56,990
(Now I am...)

2257
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:57,990
(going on the dark side!)

2258
01:32:58,629 --> 01:33:00,999
(How Gangster84 survives in Cooper)

2259
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,100
(Enemies, go away!)

2260
01:33:03,499 --> 01:33:04,969
(Gangster84 shows powerful leadership.)

2261
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:08,870
(His followers increase.)

2262

(Becoming a boss by accident)

2263
01:33:10,709 --> 01:33:12,579
(Proud)

2264
01:33:12,579 --> 01:33:14,709
(I love the life of a boss.)

2265
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,280
What's going on?

2266
01:33:17,749 --> 01:33:20,150
(His rival Teo appears.)

2267
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:21,450
(This isn't right.)

2268
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:24,089
(The Cooper boss loses his face.)

2269
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:25,719
(The boss of the good look is relaxed.)

2270
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,889
(Can I sit?)

2271
01:33:28,289 --> 01:33:30,129
(He attracts women by just being there.)

2272
01:33:30,759 --> 01:33:33,329
(He's so popular everywhere he goes.)

2273
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:35,129
(Bitter)

2274
01:33:36,169 --> 01:33:37,200
(Trying to win favor by dollar)

2275
01:33:37,929 --> 01:33:38,940
(He fails.)

2276
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,469
(Why...)

2277
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,770
(He keeps the boss position by his guts!)

2278
01:33:43,209 --> 01:33:44,209
(Screaming)

2279
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:47,039
(Laughing)

2280
01:33:47,879 --> 01:33:48,879
(How come he's so good?)

2281
01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:50,650
(They're similar and different.)

2282
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:51,810
(A good match, unexpectedly)

2283
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:53,549
(Two unpredictable bosses...)

2284
01:33:54,249 --> 01:33:55,749
(stay with music and conquer New York.)

2285
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:03,829
(A stronger one threatens two bosses?)

2286
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,100
(New York...)

2287
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,200
(and Kian84 create...)

2288
01:34:08,759 --> 01:34:10,169
(the first song.)

2289
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:14,070
(Kian84 becomes a singer?)

2290
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,270
(Singer84...)

2291
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:19,339
(releases his first digital copy?)
