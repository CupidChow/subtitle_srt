1
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,439
(With a big smile, he greets...)

2
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,410
Look at you.

3
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,780
(the denim-on-denim cowboy.)

4
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,880
- You're a real cowboy.
- Turn it off.

5
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,080
- It looks great on you, Teo.
- Really?

6
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,689
- We went to buy a hat today.
- Okay.

7
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,449
But there was an incident.

8
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,559
What incident?

9
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,890
It looks like it fits.

10
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:59,890
It fits perfectly. The size is perfect.

11
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,000
Since I've come this far,

12
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,329
I need to shop for boots and clothes.

13
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm hooked.

14
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,000
I will choose boots and clothes
in my size.

15
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,310
I can't help it.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

16
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,469
- I think it's great.
- Right?

17
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,009
Traveling in a proper outfit
makes you feel different.

18
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:20,649
(And so the denim-on-denim cowboy
was born.)

19
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:21,649
- Gosh.
- Teo...

20
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:24,219
His fashion is on point.

21
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:27,090
It looks better than I imagined.

22
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,020
- Am I okay?
- Hold on.

23
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,060
- What's with you?
- How cute.

24
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,829
Who is that Boy Scout?

25
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:33,829
(So cute)

26
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:35,530
(The cutie cowboy is bright.)

27
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,530
I love it.

28
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,070
Let's pick out an outfit
for Kian84 together.

29
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,170
I think Kian84's size is 32.

30
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,939
Since we traveled together,

31
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:48,180
- Let's see.
- I could guess his waist size was 32.

32
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,579
You've got sharp eyes.

33
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,680
A darker color will suit Kian84 more.

34
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,780
This vintage color is nice.

35
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,620
- That one is pretty.
- It is, right?

36
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,319
I'm not the type to shop that often.

37
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,719
I flexed with my personal credit card.

38
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,760
(Paying with his own money)

39
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,329
I can see you.

40
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:08,459
(Teo came to pick up his younger brother
at the airport after the preparations.)

41
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,599
(Ta-da!)

42
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,700
Look at you.

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,439
- Gosh.
- Let's talk on our way.

44
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,700
- Isn't it hot?
- It's cold. Turn the AC on.

45
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,739
"It's cold?"

46
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,010
(Shocked, he even mixes up the weather.)

47
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,409
We only spent a day apart,

48
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,280
but it felt like a week.

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,120
- We went to a bar yesterday.
- I see.

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,719
When I said I wanted to experience...

51
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,219
- different cultures in Texas,
- Yes?

52
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,730
I got suggested to work
by riding a horse and catching a cow.

53
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,260
Isn't that what you wanted, Teo?

54
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:45,230
It won't be me alone.
All three of us will go tomorrow morning.

55
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,699
- Is that the uniform?
- Yes.

56
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,199
That's right. I bought all of them.
We've got yours, too.

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,199
- We should get going. Let's go.
- Okay, Teo.

58
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,969
(Heading to the hotel
after sharing the itinerary)

59
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,610
As for your pants, I guessed your size...

60
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,680
- to be 32 when I looked at your waist.
- It's exactly 32.

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,419
- Really?
- My top size is 105.

62
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,189
Is it 105? That's my size.
We wear the same size.

63
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:07,620
- Great.
- It'll fit perfectly.

64
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,719
(Teo's wittiness makes Kian84 smile.)

65
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,490
What time did you wake up?

66
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,159
I woke between 8 to 8:30 a.m. today.

67
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,300
- You got some sleep.
- I slept a lot.

68
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,400
Take care of yourself, Teo.

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,900
Don't worry about me.

70
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,539
Take care of your joints.
When I came here...

71
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:24,539
You two are like a family.

72
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,110
Allow me to take this opportunity
to thank...

73
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,379
my international fans.
I'm getting a lot of messages.

74
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,009
They send me tips
on how to take care of my joints.

75
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,050
My goodness.

76
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,280
Thank you.

77
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:38,020
People around the world
are worried about your joints.

78
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,020
I was surprised.

79
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,620
(Touched)

80
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,490
I also slept until 8:30 a.m. today.

81
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,360
I got a good night's sleep.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,259
Did you massage yourself
for an hour and a half?

83
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,900
- I did for an hour.
- You did 30 minutes less today.

84
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,800
But doing that helps your joints, right?

85
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
That's right.

86
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,039
You can't live without that foam roller.

87
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:00,569
- It makes me happy.
- That's good.

88
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:04,909
Look at the sky.
The clouds are unbelievable.

89
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,909
- It's so beautiful.
- How pretty.

90
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:08,180
That's like a piece of art.

91
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,650
It's a painting.

92
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,289
Pass that road, and it's the countryside.

93
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,120
I ended up wanting to travel...

94
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,659
to different cities here,
but not the metropolis.

95
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
- You love the countryside.
- I do.

96
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:26,169
You need to visit Central US
if you want to enjoy authentic America.

97
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:27,229
The countryside is...

98
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:29,000
- where the real fun is.
- I agree.

99
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,400
We're here.

100
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,169
This is the center of the city.

101
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,849
(As soon as the car turns,
they see Bandera's main road.)

102
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,909
That place is the heart of Texas.

103
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,979
Had the roads not been paved,

104
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,090
- it'd be like the old days.
- That's right.

105
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:54,589
(The roads are like the classic image
of the American Old West.)

106
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,660
(Antique shops are lined on the sides.)

107
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,769
It's like a filming location.

108
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,100
This place has a vibe.

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,339
- Right?
- Yes.

110
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,509
I had zero expectations about Texas,

111
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,939
which turned out for the better.

112
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,110
(While admiring Texas's different charm,)

113
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,779
(they arrive at the hotel.)

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,949
How do you feel?

115
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,189
(Looking around)

116
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,490
- It's strange.
- Is it?

117
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,829
(Planning to extend their stay
at the hotel they stayed for the night)

118
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,600
We should ask about the bed.

119
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:33,569
- Hi there.
- Hello.

120
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,639
We have another party...

121
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,269
that wants to join us.
Is there a room for three people?

122
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,269
Yes, that room is for two people
in each bed.

123
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,139
- You mean it's for couples?
- Yes, sir.

124
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,180
- Can we not add another person?
- No.

125
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,310
How about we book another room?

126
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,279
- Then...
- I can sleep on the floor.

127
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,550
Don't do that. It's not comfortable.

128
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,149
- Give me a blanket.
- Do you have something like...

129
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:53,649
a bunk bed or something?

130
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,120
Unfortunately, I don't, sir.
The rooms can only go up to...

131
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,629
- two beds in each room.
- I see.

132
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:01,699
Our room has huge beds.

133
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:02,829
- Can I sleep next to you?
- Yes.

134
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:03,899
- How about it?
- I don't mind.

135
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:04,959
- Should we do that?
- Yes.

136
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,069
There were 2 beds,
so 4 people could stay in the room.

137
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,339
(They gave up on the extra bed.)

138
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,740
(They're finally back in their room.)

139
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,040
It's hot.

140
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,839
Goodness. How nice.

141
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,079
(Kian84 dives into the bed
right after unpacking.)

142
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,050
(Knocking)

143
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,220
Excuse me!

144
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,420
(Banging)

145
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,689
Excuse me?

146
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,259
<i>Pani Bottle</i>

147
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,199
I wondered what that noise was.

148
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,129
<i>It's me in the city</i>

149
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,230
(Welcome.)

150
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,740
The three of you will sleep well
and not feel lonely alone.

151
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,300
- How was it, Kian84?
- Me?

152
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,040
- Yes.
- I was stuck in the car the whole time.

153
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:48,139
- That...
- You know, don't you?

154
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,509
Yes, it drains you.

155
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,750
I'm jealous that you got to see a tornado.

156
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,120
I'll definitely see one again.
I will before I die.

157
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,589
Just like fishing,

158
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,120
you need some time on your hands.

159
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
It depends totally on luck.

160
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
I envy you.

161
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,230
What about another bed?

162
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,629
They don't have one.
We need to share ours.

163
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,529
- Were there no rollaway beds?
- No.

164
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,769
If we can get some bedding,
I can sleep on the floor.

165
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,040
- I want to sleep on the floor, too.
- Okay.

166
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,110
Let's do that.
Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors?

167
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,110
- Okay.
- To be fair.

168
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,209
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I should play too.

169
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,480
- Only then is it fair.
- You're right.

170
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,149
- I knew you would join, Teo.
- You little...

171
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,920
- The loser takes the floor.
- Do we play right now?

172
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,220
- Yes.
- Let's see.

173
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,220
The person who suggests the game
normally loses.

174
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,490
One round?

175
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,089
- We'll only play a round.
- One round.

176
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:40,230
<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

177
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,829
(The first round is a tie.)

178
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:44,800
(Smiling)

179
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:47,699
(On to the next round right away)

180
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,540
(Kian84 gets the floor.)

181
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,569
I knew it.

182
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,740
It's okay.

183
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:57,879
- We were playing fair.
- Darn it.

184
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,310
Darn it.

185
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:02,120
I prefer the bed.

186
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,120
Didn't you like the floor?

187
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,019
I was only being polite.

188
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,819
I'll ask for a lot of covers.

189
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:12,089
- Use that as the mattress on the floor.
- Okay.

190
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,529
The one who suggests rock-paper-scissors
always loses.

191
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,800
- That's interesting.
- It is.

192
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,269
(Wiping his tears)

193
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,939
- Shall we grab a quick meal?
- Let's do that.

194
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,970
- Food.
- As it was Kian84's first Texas trip,

195
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,639
I already had a place in mind.

196
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,810
(Heading off for dinner)

197
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,209
- It's this way.
- It's scorching hot.

198
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,180
- The AC's outdoor unit makes it hotter.
- I'll take the backseat.

199
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,819
(Grabbing)

200
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:40,250
- Are we not taking the car?
- We're going to walk.

201
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,550
- That's not our car.
- It's not our car.

202
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,089
- It wasn't your car.
- That was dangerous.

203
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,860
- Some might've thought we were thieves.
- Isn't that our car?

204
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,389
- You could get into trouble in the US.
- Ours is white.

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,329
- That one is our car.
- And we're walking.

206
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,000
Did the heat get to you?

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
(Did the heat get to you?
I wondered what you were doing.)

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I wondered what you were doing.

209
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,600
Let's take the car. It's hot.

210
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:58,709
- It's right over there.
- It's around the corner.

211
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,709
You can see it.
It's the building after the church.

212
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,110
Did you go there yesterday?

213
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,949
- No. I passed by it.
- So we're trying it out today?

214
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,850
The place we went to yesterday
was quite the traditional bar.

215
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,350
The customers in today's bar
seemed younger.

216
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,620
- Is that so?
- Yes, it feels more youthful.

217
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,759
That's nice.

218
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,629
Kian84 likes youthful vibes,
like the Gen Z style.

219
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,730
I do.

220
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,500
(On their way to the Gen Z style bar)

221
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,330
- How quiet.
- It feels better in the afternoon.

222
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,970
- The cows...
- There's a performance today as well.

223
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,799
- Is it live?
- Yes, it's live.

224
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,840
(Music can be heard from the outside.)

225
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,139
Just listen to them.

226
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,179
(Their expectations are high
from the joyous music.)

227
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:38,379
"Kickback customer parking."

228
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,919
(They follow the music and step inside.)

229
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,090
Nice.

230
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,659
- This bar has a younger vibe.
- And it's big.

231
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:53,830
This place is crowded.

232
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,259
- There's a live performance.
- Yes.

233
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,259
(The bar is filled with people and music.)

234
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,669
- Cowboys are charming.
- Look at that cool-looking man.

235
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,269
- You can really feel the Old West vibe.
- Right?

236
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:05,669
(People of all ages are having fun.)

237
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,009
It's as if I've entered the world...

238
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:10,779
of "From Dusk Till Dawn."

239
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:13,450
That's it.

240
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,580
(Only in American movies)

241
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,250
(A music bar playing country music)

242
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,120
That's true. How nice.

243
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:23,389
(Feeling like a protagonist in a movie)

244
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,330
(With how everyone is excited)

245
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,830
(Smiling)

246
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,059
What did he say?

247
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,299
(All of a sudden)

248
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,330
(Welcome to Texas!)

249
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,470
"Welcome to Texas."

250
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,799
That was an enthusiastic welcome.

251
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,279
- That's it. Welcome to Texas.
- Yes, brother.

252
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,710
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

253
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,509
I thought he was angry at us.

254
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:48,009
- But it was, "Welcome to Texas."
- Just now, right?

255
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,279
- Everyone was cheerful.
- They were.

256
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,720
(Amazed)

257
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,519
A man passing by
gave us a shot of whiskey.

258
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,159
I felt grateful, and he was cool.

259
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,389
I was within the charm.

260
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,399
Cowboys and sheriffs.

261
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,570
It was as if I was at the roots of them.

262
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,470
- Thank you!
- No problem.

263
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,169
Kian84's way of talking
is getting wild, too.

264
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:14,509
"Thank you."

265
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,309
(The beer he ordered)

266
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,340
Would you like it?

267
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:18,879
- It's empty.
- Yes.

268
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,649
- Have another bottle.
- Okay.

269
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,549
- Thank you.
- It's give and take.

270
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,049
- What's your name?
- Sam.

271
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,789
- "Sam."
- Where are you from?

272
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,690
Korea. I'm from South Korea.

273
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,590
- Really?
- Yes.

274
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,220
I used to work at Samsung.

275
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,759
- What?
- He used to work at Samsung.

276
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,000
- The semiconductor factory...
- Yes.

277
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,029
- is a three-hour car ride away.
- In Texas?

278
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,330
- That was how he knew.
- "Samsung?"

279
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,769
I just left there. I just worked there.

280
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,769
I...

281
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,669
live near Samsung's factory...

282
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,940
in Korea.

283
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,580
- Okay.
- Yes.

284
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,049
There's a bond.

285
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,049
Thank you, bro.

286
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:55,480
- Welcome. Thank you.
- Thank you for the beer.

287
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,519
Sure thing.

288
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,350
(After meeting his first
Texas friend, Sam,)

289
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,419
(he takes a refreshing gulp of beer.)

290
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,259
- Have a can of soda.
- Sorry?

291
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,429
- Have a bottle of beer.
- Okay.

292
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,759
Have a bottle of beer.

293
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,029
Being together with them
made me want to drink too.

294
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:17,070
I feel good seeing you drink.

295
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:20,870
Look how they dance.

296
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,409
(People let their bodies flow
naturally to the music.)

297
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,539
(Sam)

298
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,049
Sam.

299
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:27,080
(Acknowledging his friend)

300
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,149
(He's my friend.)

301
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,480
It's like a movie.

302
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,750
This place is...

303
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,690
Hello.

304
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,919
(Making friendly eye contact)

305
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,899
A long time ago...

306
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,159
So,

307
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,899
how long have you been here?

308
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:50,840
- Three or four days?
- I guess that’s the vibe.

309
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,440
It's common in the US.

310
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,139
- Is it?
- There are lots of small talks.

311
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,710
They talk to strangers.

312
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,309
Since this is the countryside,

313
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:58,879
they probably find us interesting,
and so they’re talking to us.

314
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,679
Excuse me. I'm going to dance.

315
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:03,419
(Starts dancing out of nowhere)

316
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,120
(She leads to dance
on the spot where she was standing.)

317
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,519
- Show her.
- He should show her.

318
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,019
Show her your dancing skills.

319
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,090
(Dancing)

320
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:15,960
(Amazed)

321
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,029
Why is he...

322
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:21,169
(Dance84 is showing off his skills.)

323
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,399
She's energetic.

324
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,940
I like the vibes.

325
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,580
Texas Mother.

326
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,210
Mother?

327
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,509
Nice to meet you!

328
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:34,809
Texas Mother.

329
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,549
(Good Son84 was in Brooklyn.)

330
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:41,149
He dances often with the mothers.

331
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,720
Raising children,

332
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,490
tending to cows.

333
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,629
You’ve worked hard.

334
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:50,899
What was that?

335
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,970
- He gives a lot of good wishes.
- She likes them.

336
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,470
(Laughing)

337
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,470
Nice.

338
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,500
(Good Son84 and Texas Mother
came together with fun energy.)

339
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,039
- He suits well with Texas.
- Thank you.

340
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,740
Thank you so much.

341
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,179
(She approaches Teo.)

342
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,110
(Whispering)

343
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,950
- What?
- We're now...

344
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,879
She's 77 years old.

345
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,750
- Oh, my.
- She looks very young.

346
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,419
It's nice.

347
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:17,620
Her expression looks so happy.

348
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,159
My goodness.

349
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,789
Why?

350
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,860
- She's 77 years old.
- What?

351
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,500
- My goodness.
- For real?

352
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:29,669
I thought she was around 60 years old.

353
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:30,669
Me too.

354
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,100
Are you 77 years old?

355
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,370
You look like you're in your 40s.

356
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,179
Nice comment.

357
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:39,649
- Sweet Bottle!
- She looks so in real.

358
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:41,309
- Nice comment.
- I knew it.

359
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,580
It’s great to see her living youthfully.

360
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,279
It's great!

361
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,850
It's great to see you, Mother!

362
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,220
She looks young
because she lives youthfully.

363
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,759
Why would you want to
go to a senior center?

364
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,129
People shouldn't go to a senior center.

365
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:55,629
We need to create places like this
where older people in Korea...

366
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,700
can enjoy instead of
just going to senior centers.

367
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,669
- Kian84 can sing live for them.
- Yes!

368
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,340
It wasn't "No Country for Old Men"
after all.

369
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,309
There's a country for old men.

370
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,210
Two kickbacks!

371
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,610
One with chips, another with fries.

372
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:14,379
- Do you all have any requests?
- I have!

373
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:17,379
Feel free to holler.
We'll get right on it.

374
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,190
"Shut Up and Dance."

375
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,620
"Desperado!"

376
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:22,759
Sir.

377
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,789
The next slow song,
would you like to dance with me?

378
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,659
Oh, sure. Why not?

379
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,600
She asked him for a dance first.

380
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Teo is popular everywhere.

381
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,929
(After accepting the dance request)

382
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,370
Where did you come from?

383
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,169
I'm from South Korea.

384
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,639
South Korea? I've been there.

385
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,139
Where are you guys from?

386
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:42,940
- We're from Germany.
- From Germany?

387
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:47,009
- I'm from Cologne.
- What?

388
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,820
It's so nice to see a person
from your country in a foreign place.

389
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,879
For our dinner...

390
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,250
- Let's eat our dinner outside.
- Okay.

391
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,820
(They're about to head out
to the outdoor terrace.)

392
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,190
He's popular there again.

393
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,299
He's surrounded by people.

394
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,159
This man.

395
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:06,830
He's jealous.

396
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,669
His mouth is protruding.

397
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:10,240
Let's go!

398
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,669
- Teo.
- Kian84!

399
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:17,240
We wanted to invite you,
but you were having so much fun.

400
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,809
- You should've brought me along.
- Normally, in the club,

401
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,549
people who fail to find a partner
exit like that.

402
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:23,049
- That's what they do.
- "Hey, this place isn't good. Let's go."

403
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,450
- Let's go.
- Like this.

404
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,820
(When they walked out confidently)

405
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,720
- My goodness.
- The sunset is unreal.

406
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,860
The sky is so pretty.

407
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,360
It was a good choice to come out.
The sunset was pretty.

408
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,929
The sunset was beautiful.

409
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,500
It's crazy.

410
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
Golden hour.

411
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,799
Golden dream. Shiny day.

412
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,799
(The fresh breeze and a touch of
Texan romance greeted them.)

413
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,139
(It feels like their lonely hearts...)

414
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,110
(are being healed a bit.)

415
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,610
Gosh, it was chaotic.

416
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,879
What were you talking about?

417
00:17:56,879 --> 00:18:00,120
They came from Germany.

418
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,919
- Oh, they weren't Americans?
- No, they weren't.

419
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,620
- They came for a trip.
- They were tourists?

420
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,460
Yes, they were tourists.

421
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,360
- Of all places, it’s Germany.
- We talked about why we came here.

422
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,230
One lady was very pretty.

423
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,230
- Oh, is it?
- He didn't miss the chance to look.

424
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,100
- There was a pretty woman.
- Do you want a blind date?

425
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,039
- I...
- I can ask her to come outside later...

426
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,240
for a chat with you.

427
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,799
Which person are you talking about?

428
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,340
There's one pretty lady.

429
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,840
The one with a hat?

430
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,110
(Stop asking.)

431
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,080
- It's nice.
- It's fun to mingle among the tourists.

432
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,320
I like this terrace.

433
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:31,980
She wants...

434
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,919
She wants to dance with me.

435
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,289
- For real?
- I need to dance with her.

436
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,519
- Come on!
- Oh, my gosh.

437
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,090
I'm not... I'm a bad dancer, though.

438
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,759
- Okay.
- Oh, the person who asked a while ago.

439
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,400
- You must feel empty inside.
- I wasn't lonely being with him.

440
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
- Right.
- Yes.

441
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,299
You have someone to talk to.

442
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,470
Hey, Pani.

443
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:54,809
I experienced this yesterday.

444
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,140
Do you know what I learned?

445
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,480
Teo came here instead of Dex.

446
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,750
Nothing has changed.

447
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,920
The two have the same roles.

448
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,319
(Laughing)

449
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,119
(Dex was always surrounded by people.)

450
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,059
(We could only watch him.)

451
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,589
(Nothing has changed.)

452
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:17,130
I lived my whole life like this.
I'm used to it.

453
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,400
- I know.
- Yes.

454
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,369
I don’t have any emotional turmoil.

455
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,099
Nothing has changed.

456
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:24,740
This is where I belong.

457
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,740
Same for me too. This is comfortable.

458
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,940
This conversation is sad.

459
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,509
But...

460
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,079
I danced with Texas Mother.

461
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,509
(I did dance with Texas Mother.)

462
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,849
It feels like I had a tour as a good son.

463
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,079
Teo...

464
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,019
Teo can speak English. It is what it is.

465
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,720
Right.
It's because of the language barrier.

466
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,490
Aren't you going to drink this?

467
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,960
You can have it.

468
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,099
(Strangely, I keep craving alcohol.)

469
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:51,700
This is nice.

470
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,799
(I'm fine, but...)

471
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,099
Are you from the town?

472
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,140
- Something's going on here.
- Are you from here?

473
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,769
I'm actually from Houston.

474
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,140
- But I live here now.
- Oh, okay.

475
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,440
What made you move here?

476
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:05,240
My husband used to work here.

477
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,309
And then he moved to Austin.

478
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,450
He went to work for the Samsung plant.

479
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,750
Samsung Man was her husband.

480
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,089
- Sam.
- I see.

481
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,450
Oh, Sam.

482
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,619
It's so funny that there are so many...

483
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:20,089
- people who are related to Korea.
- This is so interesting!

484
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,430
But...

485
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,000
it's normal etiquette to dance...

486
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,470
and talk to each other in the US.

487
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,799
We can never stop dancing...

488
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,339
before one song finishes.

489
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,809
- Dance until the end.
- Is it an unspoken rule?

490
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,440
- Is that the etiquette?
- I have to escort her back too.

491
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,680
That's the dancing culture.

492
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,480
That's awesome.

493
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,880
Just now, Sam...

494
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,190
Aren't they the Germans?

495
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,619
(A bunch of Germans
coming in all at once.)

496
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:52,890
(They become silent all of a sudden.)

497
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,130
- No, it's not that.
- You are bad at hiding your expression.

498
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,700
You're so innocent.

499
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,799
Two of them are sharing
the same thought, right?

500
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,970
- Hello.
- Yes.

501
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,369
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

502
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:07,839
- Thanks.
- German, yes.

503
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,410
- Thank you.
- Where are you from?

504
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,480
South Korea.

505
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,809
South Korea? I've been there.

506
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,680
- Yes.
- Seoul.

507
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
(Laughing)

508
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,779
I know no one in Germany.

509
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:18,619
- Coming from Germany...
- What are you doing here?

510
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,390
We're here to see some cowboy culture.

511
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,319
Because we have one more friend.
He was born in Germany.

512
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,660
- Yes, we've met him.
- Yes.

513
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,960
- Yes.
- He... So...

514
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,460
Pani Bottle is chatting well.

515
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,230
He's fluent in English. Nice.

516
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,970
I've been there. Yes.

517
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,970
It's a big city, right?

518
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,470
- It's a big one.
- Okay.

519
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,769
(The lonely Pani Bottle
of yesterday isn't here anymore.)

520
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,279
In the middle of Germany, Frankfurt.

521
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,509
- I know. I've been there.
- You know? You've been?

522
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,880
- It's a big city, right? In Texas?
- We've been to Austin.

523
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,519
His mouth is protruding again.

524
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,650
(Looking around blankly)

525
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,690
No.

526
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,259
- Cheers, guys.
- Yes, cheers.

527
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,490
Cheers!

528
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,490
(He doesn't even have a beer.)

529
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,329
- He didn't have beer.
- I didn't see that.

530
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:02,759
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

531
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,200
Hey, guys.

532
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,869
(Looking around)

533
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,269
My name is Pani.

534
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,500
(He found that Kian84 wasn't mingling.)

535
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,339
(Well...)

536
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,910
(Everyone! I'll introduce him to you!)

537
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,609
- Let me introduce him to you guys.
- He's sensible.

538
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:21,349
Guys, listen up.
This guy's name is Kian84.

539
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,920
- Kian84.
- Kian84.

540
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,950
- He's a very famous webtoon writer.
- Hey.

541
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,720
- It's like a comic book.
- I'm not famous.

542
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,019
Don't say that.

543
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:30,490
You're very famous.
You won the Grand Award.

544
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,519
He's a cartoon writer.

545
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,490
I'm not famous! Don't say that.

546
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,829
A really famous one.

547
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:36,230
His cartoons...

548
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,000
were made into series and films in Korea.

549
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,930
He's not talking and laughing.

550
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,200
He's not liking what you say.

551
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,470
He's just... He has false modesty.

552
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,140
Don't speak too highly of me.

553
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,009
(Looking around)

554
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,579
Wait, looking at the situation...

555
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,390
Are you a couple?

556
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,319
A couple?

557
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,160
There were 2 men and 3 women.

558
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,490
- In case they were traveling in couples.
- In case it might be not polite.

559
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,829
I thought one woman didn't have a partner.

560
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,529
- I thought maybe that was the case.
- One with no partner.

561
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:12,400
How do you say, "Couple" in German?

562
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,200
Are you guys together?

563
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,369
No, we're just friends.

564
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,200
- They're all friends.
- Friends?

565
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,170
- He's excited.
- I’m not relieved.

566
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,569
"Relieved."

567
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,539
Some...

568
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,009
(Loading the next question)

569
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,420
(Look at him.)

570
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,849
- Are they getting to know each other?
- Yes.

571
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:35,250
There's no such thing outside of Korea.

572
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,660
It's our culture.

573
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,960
To Germans,
you need to be straightforward.

574
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,990
Is it?

575
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,700
Are all of you single?

576
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
His question...

577
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,799
has only one goal.

578
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,569
"Are you couples?" The second question
is "Are you single?"

579
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,299
He has only one purpose.

580
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,809
No, I was just curious.

581
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,740
You just fake in the beginning
as if you're thinking of a question.

582
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,980
I was curious.

583
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
(He's a transparent person.)

584
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,380
Are all of you single?

585
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,079
- No.
- No?

586
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:05,319
- Is there a couple amongst you all?
- Yes.

587
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,420
Guess who they are.

588
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,789
There's one couple here.
He wants you to guess them.

589
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,890
Guess who they are.

590
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:12,859
Did they break up?

591
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:14,029
- No, they're together.
- Oh, they're together.

592
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:15,089
His last hope.

593
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Refusing to believe the reality.

594
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,859
(Is he dating with...)

595
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,029
(the lady that I was interested in?)

596
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,900
(He chooses her.)

597
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,900
Here.

598
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,240
- That's why they're sitting together.
- Is it?

599
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,339
- I know, right?
- Exactly.

600
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,380
(Is he her boyfriend?)

601
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,410
Am I right?

602
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,549
I easily guessed it right.

603
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:35,650
Okay, no.

604
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,380
He said, "No."

605
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,650
- Okay.
- This is good.

606
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,119
- This is good.
- Goodness.

607
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:45,190
Your expression is too transparent.

608
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,859
How can I know?

609
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,660
(My goodness.)

610
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,569
- Ah! I know!
- I got it! I have the answer.

611
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,430
- I got it.
- I get it! Teo!

612
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,799
Try to guess.

613
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,410
Okay. I know. Yes.

614
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:02,880
Okay.

615
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,779
- Me?
- Yes.

616
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,609
- Understand.
- No.

617
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:08,980
Aren't you two dating each other?

618
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,579
(Laughing)

619
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,519
No?

620
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,720
(Feeling absurd)

621
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,220
It's normal nowadays.

622
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,490
- I thought so too.
- It's possible.

623
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,960
- We're not together.
- No?

624
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,059
No.

625
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:23,029
- So now we have two left.
- I see.

626
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:25,759
- It's easy.
- I think it's her.

627
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,900
Because she's shy.

628
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,470
(Standing)

629
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,700
(You're right.)

630
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,410
- Kian84 is so happy.
- My gosh!

631
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,039
He's happy in many aspects.

632
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,049
I'm sorry.

633
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:41,509
Sorry.

634
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,819
- This is...
- It's so funny.

635
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:45,720
Global cultures can be quite complex.

636
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:48,650
- I should go back.
- Why, all of a sudden?

637
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,789
Why are you suddenly so shy?

638
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:51,319
(He returns quickly
after asking questions.)

639
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,660
What did you experience here?

640
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,230
He asked what you experienced.

641
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,900
For me, I experienced
New York City, Brooklyn,

642
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,869
- New York City?
- real hip-hop...

643
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:08,470
In Brooklyn, we experienced
the project culture.

644
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,880
He did some rap there too.

645
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,279
Rap?

646
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,109
- Can you rap for us?
- Together.

647
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:16,349
They want to listen to your rap.

648
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,150
- My rap.
- Hip-hop84.

649
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,349
- Yes!
- Yes!

650
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:23,160
I don't rap if it's not cypher.

651
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,559
My goodness.

652
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,559
(In front of her)

653
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:31,900
(Loading his explosive rap skills
that turned Brooklyn upside down)

654
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,730
- Come on.
- Yes.

655
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:34,829
You're Cooper Family.

656
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,200
- Cooper Family.
- You can do it.

657
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,440
Show them!

658
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,710
Your serenade of love!

659
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,210
He's cute.

660
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:46,509
- You're a shy boy.
- So cute.

661
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:48,210
- He's so cute.
- I wasn't manly.

662
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,720
- I hated it.
- No, it was your charm.

663
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
You have a youthful charm.

664
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,750
I think he drank too much.

665
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,250
One more beer.

666
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,259
(He escapes finding a beer for an excuse.)

667
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,289
Since we have guests,

668
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,690
we shouldn't eat ourselves.

669
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,660
I should buy five more.

670
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,470
It's time to say goodbye.

671
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,230
He's continuing to find a way
to stay with them.

672
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,099
What if they leave soon?

673
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:14,369
This is for you.

674
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,809
- They're for you, guys.
- It's on me.

675
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,579
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

676
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,650
Cheers!

677
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:23,480
(They became friendly with the table
next to them.)

678
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,549
Cheers.

679
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,289
(Feeling proud)

680
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,960
Cheers!

681
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,819
I think he's...

682
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,130
The man with glasses is single.

683
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,730
The other two ladies are single too.

684
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,529
There must be something going on there.

685
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,700
He keeps talking about that.

686
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,700
Is it impolite to ask about this?

687
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,710
No, you can ask at the right time.

688
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:48,910
But Germans can ask...

689
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,880
why you are so obsessed with that topic.

690
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:54,950
To Germans,
you need to ask straight forward.

691
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:58,650
"I'm interested in her. Is she single?"

692
00:27:58,819 --> 00:27:59,950
It's not being rude.

693
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,049
Oh, because I'm interested?

694
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:03,920
Yes. You keep asking questions to others
because you're interested in her.

695
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,259
(He suddenly speaks the fact.)

696
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,559
He holds back and then finally speaks.

697
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,660
Are you interested in her?

698
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,430
(Well, that lady.)

699
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:13,700
I was right.

700
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,470
- It's funny.
- No wonder you kept asking.

701
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,569
- I know, right?
- Yes.

702
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,910
Dance with her. You can ask.

703
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,339
- Right.
- I can ask her?

704
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:22,609
Yes, you should.

705
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:25,240
Okay. In German-way. I'll bring her.

706
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,079
I can bring her to sit here.

707
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,549
- Why?
- Don't do such a thing.

708
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,880
- Why?
- Don't do such a thing.

709
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,190
He wants you to bring her.

710
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:34,589
I think he made a gesture to welcome.

711
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:36,720
- My gosh.
- Don't do it.

712
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,660
- I think he wants it.
- Yes.

713
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,059
- He wants it.
- No!

714
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,230
When he does that, he wants it.

715
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,460
Please do so.

716
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:45,900
No! Don't do such a thing.

717
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,799
- Nicole.
- Yes?

718
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,700
Can we sit together? Thank you.

719
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:52,869
(Sit together?)

720
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,640
- Good.
- Will she say yes?

721
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,609
(Please!)

722
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
(He's nervous.)

723
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,509
This is amazing.

724
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,279
(He gets nervous too.)

725
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,049
(She stands up.)

726
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:05,079
She's coming!

727
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,990
(She comes to sit with them
without hesitation.)

728
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,619
(Nice to meet you.)

729
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,859
Let's see some romance for the first time
in Adventure by Accident series.

730
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,799
Right. Let's shoot Texas Signal.

731
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,900
- "Texas Signal."
- "Texas Signal."

732
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,170
- That's a good idea.
- Right?

733
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,440
Romance Adventure by Accident.

734
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,170
Finding his love.

735
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,170
(Excited)

736
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,009
This feels like a real dating show.

737
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,279
What are you talking about?

738
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,650
(He shouts unnecessarily.)

739
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,650
My goodness.

740
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:38,319
Kian84 wants to talk to you.

741
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,420
Yes, very...

742
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,150
I translated that you wanted
to talk with her.

743
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,160
Her name is Nicole.

744
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,859
- Nicole.
- Okay.

745
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,690
- It's driving me crazy.
- It's like a reality show.

746
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,759
(I should say something.)

747
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,000
(What should I say for Nicole to like?)

748
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,170
Let's approach her.

749
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,170
(You can do it, Kian84!)

750
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,769
Are you single?

751
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,970
(His first gentle question,
"Are you single?")

752
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,309
(Laughing)

753
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,740
(Are you single?)

754
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,380
How many times are you asking
that same question?

755
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,380
- How many times are you asking?
- You don't look cool.

756
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,819
Stop asking.

757
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:12,519
He did well.

758
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,150
In German style,

759
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,150
he did well.

760
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,319
- Well...
- In case she has a boyfriend?

761
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,759
what if she's married?

762
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,460
- Are you single?
- Maybe?

763
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,930
- Maybe?
- Maybe?

764
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,400
She's leaning forward.

765
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,230
- She's positive.
- It wasn't a "No."

766
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,700
She's positive.

767
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,369
I guess she has a few guys hitting her up.

768
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:36,240
- You're very beautiful.
- Thank you.

769
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,109
Do you have a girlfriend?

770
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,509
- Yes, maybe?
- I don't have.

771
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:41,509
Maybe.

772
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,220
Maybe.

773
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:46,549
- Playing hard to get is great.
- Maybe.

774
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:48,119
You did well. You're sensible.

775
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,690
Good job.

776
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,160
- It's not easy.
- You're witty.

777
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,859
Did you ask for a dance?

778
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,089
Go for a dance. We'll be eating here.

779
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:57,329
For real? Dancing?

780
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:58,430
Yes, let's go.

781
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,630
Go.

782
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,529
- Good.
- It's going well!

783
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,539
Go!

784
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,839
- What's your name?
- Nicole.

785
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,440
Nicole. My name is Kian84.

786
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,009
- Kian84.
- Kian84, yes.

787
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,509
- Nice to meet you, Kian84.
- Nice to meet you.

788
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,779
(Kian84 and Nicole came to the stage.)

789
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,779
Nicole.

790
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,420
(Spectators quickly following along)

791
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,359
(The stage is full with
lively dancing time.)

792
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:25,619
Yes.

793
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,390
(Awkward)

794
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,329
What's that?

795
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,029
- What's that?
- What are you doing?

796
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,900
- Why did you dance like that again?
- Why did you do that?

797
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,539
I started off like that.

798
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:39,839
That's what Jae Seok does.

799
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,869
Why did you do that?

800
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:43,539
He danced grasshopper dance in Texas.

801
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,109
(Dancing)

802
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,049
What are you doing? You should lead her.

803
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,380
(Her friend is recording.)

804
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,650
(Sam)

805
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,519
Everyone is supporting him.

806
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:59,660
(Texas Grasshopper tries jumping.)

807
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:03,960
(He tries to shake off
the awkwardness with some interjections.)

808
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:08,130
(He suddenly feels shy.)

809
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,240
He's shy.

810
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,769
(He's feeling shy again.)

811
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:14,269
(You can do it, Kian84!)

812
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,609
(He falters.)

813
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,750
(Where did Kian84
who danced with Texas Mother go?)

814
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,150
- I know, right?
- Where did that energy go?

815
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,920
(He doesn't go closer to her
but keeps jumping at his spot.)

816
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,549
He must be so shy. My goodness.

817
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,819
He should hold her hand but he's so timid.

818
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:34,029
(Usually, people dance holding hands.)

819
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,759
(The couple in front are
holding hands too.)

820
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,529
- Shall I tell him?
- Yes.

821
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,900
Kian84! Hold her hand!

822
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:45,700
(The cupid appeared
on stage out of nowhere.)

823
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,710
Hands!

824
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:49,609
Do you need to tell me about that too?

825
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,680
Hold hands!

826
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,880
(My goodness)

827
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
(He extends his hand.)

828
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
He held her hand.

829
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,319
(He held her hand!)

830
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,150
(Well done, Kian84!)

831
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:02,890
(Nicole leads the dance.)

832
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,589
- I felt shy.
- He's getting there now.

833
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,390
He adapted.

834
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,829
(I feel so shy.)

835
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,160
(This is fun.)

836
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:15,500
(He's being dragged by Nicole.)

837
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,069
This is embarrassing.

838
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:20,339
I danced despite feeling shy.

839
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,480
I danced with a stranger I randomly met...

840
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,609
at a bar in the hometown of cowboys.

841
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,980
How cool is that?

842
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,380
If you watch Al Pacino's legendary movie,

843
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,619
"Scent of a Woman,"

844
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:34,319
he dances tango with a woman,

845
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,549
and that's the best scene.

846
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,890
It was almost the Texas version
of "Scent of a Woman."

847
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,059
I was Al Pacino of Texas.

848
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,589
You meet and dance once and say goodbye.

849
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:44,029
How cool is that?

850
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,700
I was almost Joseon's Al Pacino.

851
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,039
(Joseon's Al Pacino is excited.)

852
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,039
It's crazy.

853
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,769
(Exclaiming)

854
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,410
It's hot.

855
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,140
(Nicole is pulling Kian84.)

856
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,980
- Nicole is more proactive.
- I felt so shy.

857
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,210
(He drops his head.)

858
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,619
This is crazy.

859
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,180
It's so funny that he's being shy.

860
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,650
(It's so funny that he's being shy.)

861
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,759
I was almost Joseon's Al Pacino.

862
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,759
(Joseon's Al Pacino
can't even see her eyes.)

863
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,329
He was really cute.

864
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:16,259
- He's cute.
- I've never seen him like that.

865
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,700
(That moment)

866
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,200
(Nicole held Kian84's waist.)

867
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:25,069
(He starts hopping
because he's flustered.)

868
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,140
(Screaming)

869
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,109
(Laughing)

870
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,109
It's crazy.

871
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,250
- Where are you going?
- Goodness.

872
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,490
- My gosh.
- Where is he going?

873
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,259
(Exclaiming)

874
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,630
Idiot.

875
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,700
What are you doing?

876
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,730
You were like a boy running away
after confessing to a girl.

877
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:57,470
I felt so embarrassed.

878
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,500
I danced,
but I felt embarrassed afterward.

879
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,640
(He dashed out in embarrassment.)

880
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:02,339
I'm not...

881
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,940
I'm not as smooth as Al Pacino yet.

882
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:08,109
(After Kian84 ran out)

883
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,019
(Nicole is left alone.)

884
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:14,890
- She was alone.
- She was left alone.

885
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,319
- Nicole.
- Nicole.

886
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,660
(He becomes her partner
so that she doesn't feel awkward.)

887
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,490
- She seemed to be feeling awkward.
- Of course.

888
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,089
Nice.

889
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:23,630
That was bad manners. I should hurry back.

890
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:26,970
Get lost, you idiot.

891
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,069
(Laughing)

892
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:31,069
Go die!

893
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:32,670
(Patting)

894
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,240
I can see it clearly from here.

895
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,440
- It's okay.
- I couldn't keep it together then.

896
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,039
- It's okay.
- I can see it clearly from here.

897
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,109
- Why...
- It's okay.

898
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:43,180
- Why are you going inside? Go and sleep.
- It's because you felt awkward.

899
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:45,480
Why am I getting so annoyed?

900
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,449
- You grow up like this.
- Right.

901
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:49,449
- Until when am I going to grow?
- Think of it as a growing pain.

902
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,619
(He rushes back.)

903
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,400
(He sees from far...)

904
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,699
- You're late.
- She was taken.

905
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,630
(Nicole seems happy.)

906
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,500
- She's dancing.
- Nicole.

907
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,639
(He grabs his heart for some reason.)

908
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,239
Nice.

909
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,639
(The song ends.)

910
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,639
(She ends the dance time well
thanks to Teo.)

911
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,610
- Nicole.
- Teo saved it.

912
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,880
I think the person changed in the middle.
Is it just me?

913
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:19,480
He even told him to hold his hand.

914
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,889
- Where did you go?
- Thank you.

915
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,920
- Thank you.
- Why did you run?

916
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,519
I felt so embarrassed.

917
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:27,860
You could have just danced until the end.

918
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,329
It's embarrassing.

919
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,530
- You couldn't look at her eyes.
- I couldn't.

920
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,969
- Why?
- It's...

921
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,230
I'll get going first.

922
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,599
I can't stay here anymore
because I feel so awkward.

923
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,440
(The German friends come back.)

924
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:44,840
- Thank you, Nicole. Thank you.
- Me too.

925
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,909
Thank you.

926
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,380
(He feels okay after seeing Nicole smile.)

927
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,489
- Why did you run?
- Why did you run?

928
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:55,119
(Thinking)

929
00:36:55,389 --> 00:36:56,519
He felt shy.

930
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:59,519
They're seeing my weak side.
I'm a little shy.

931
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,429
- Shy.
- Shy.

932
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,460
This isn't manly.

933
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,699
Aren't you feeling hungry?

934
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,369
- Now?
- Yes.

935
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,170
I'm not hungry.

936
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,599
I guess you feel satisfied because
you danced with someone...

937
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,670
- you liked.
- I think so.

938
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,139
I have indigestion now.

939
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,880
I'm having the most fun today.

940
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:20,949
I think I'm having the most fun today.

941
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,380
Forget the tornado. Today is the best.

942
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,190
I found the tornado today.

943
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,550
You followed her instead.

944
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,389
A tornado in his heart.

945
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:32,059
Nicole came like a tornado in his heart.

946
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,489
What time are we going tomorrow?

947
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,159
Do we have to go there until 5 a.m.?

948
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,460
We have to get there until 5:30 a.m.

949
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:41,329
(They went to a bar
searching for cowboys.)

950
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,329
(They met Eddie the cowboy there.)

951
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:45,469
Okay. Type in your number.

952
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:48,940
(They got excited and exchanged numbers.)

953
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:52,340
(They promised to go to a cowboy's farm.)

954
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,710
It's an hour drive away.

955
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,550
We have to go there until 5:30 a.m.

956
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:00,179
Then we have to set off at 4:30 a.m.

957
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:03,250
- We have to wake up at 4 a.m.
- We have to get up at 4 a.m.

958
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,190
- We have to get going now.
- It's...

959
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,130
I should ask for this to be packed.

960
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,059
Bye.

961
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:11,960
- Is this the end?
- Bye.

962
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,360
You should have exchanged numbers.

963
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,800
(He leaves the regret behind
and prepares to go to the hotel.)

964
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,639
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

965
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,710
- It was fun. Wasn't it fun?
- It was very fun.

966
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,550
Did you have more fun yesterday or today?

967
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,750
- The three of us are together today.
- That's right.

968
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,320
- So it's...
- We have to hang out together.

969
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,090
Most of the people were nice to us.

970
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,289
- That's right.
- It's so nice.

971
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:38,559
The people of Texas are not just friendly.

972
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:41,289
I even felt,
"Why are they being so nice to me?"

973
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,760
- Right. They're so nice to travelers.
- It's interesting.

974
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,530
They're like...

975
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,730
my aunts...

976
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,539
and uncles but American.

977
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:54,539
- But American.
- He's feeling so close to them.

978
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:57,739
(They get back to their hotel
feeling familial love.)

979
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,079
(Kian84 tries to lay his blanket
on the floor.)

980
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,079
Kian84 lost rock-paper-scissors earlier,
so he will sleep on the floor.

981
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,550
But I like the hard floor.

982
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,449
Are you really going to sleep
on the floor?

983
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:10,619
- I'll go up if I feel uncomfortable.
- Okay.

984
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,590
(Messy)

985
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:18,099
(Teo sets the blanket neatly again.)

986
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:19,730
He's worried his back would hurt.

987
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,599
(He replaces it with his thick blanket.)

988
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,300
I'll do it.

989
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,940
I'm almost done.
They gave us a thin blanket.

990
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,110
It's okay.

991
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,039
I was just lying down.

992
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,179
- Goodness.
- What a horrible person.

993
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,849
You're such a horrible person.

994
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,050
(He's embarrassed.)

995
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,820
- "You're such a horrible person."
- "You're such a horrible person."

996
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:41,719
I'm not even looking at him.

997
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:44,159
You always took care of us, though.

998
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,260
He's not nice.

999
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,519
(He's not nice.)

1000
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,030
I'll do it.

1001
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:50,659
I'm almost done.
They gave us a thin blanket.

1002
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,929
- It's okay.
- Be quiet.

1003
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:53,969
(His mom mode is on.)

1004
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,469
- Teo.
- You should at least have it like this.

1005
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:58,500
(He laid a thick blanket for him.)

1006
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Okay.

1007
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,539
If I snore while sleeping, just kick me.

1008
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:03,909
Okay.

1009
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:07,380
- Wouldn't this be noisy?
- I'm okay with noise.

1010
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,579
- You are?
- Yes.

1011
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,949
(The day ends warmly
thanks to the eldest brother.)

1012
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,889
- It's 4 a.m.
- It's so early in the morning.

1013
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,400
(It's already time to wake up.)

1014
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,769
(He's swollen.)

1015
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,010
(Brushing his teeth on the floor)

1016
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,039
Your teeth will wear out.

1017
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,980
- Gosh.
- Your gums will wear out.

1018
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,010
Your teeth will fall off.

1019
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,519
We have to reveal the gift.

1020
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,349
- Wasn't it revealed yet?
- It wasn't. I waited.

1021
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,289
I chose the shirt,

1022
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,960
- and Teo chose the pants.
- Really?

1023
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,329
- This is your shirt.
- Retro.

1024
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,800
It will fit you. You and I
have the same size. It will fit.

1025
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,730
- It fits.
- It's perfect.

1026
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,440
- Really? Is it okay?
- It's nice.

1027
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,039
It's perfect. Nice.

1028
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,739
The shirt. That's good.

1029
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:11,280
- This...
- It fits perfectly, right?

1030
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:12,980
- Bootcut pants.
- It's amazing.

1031
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,110
And...

1032
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,349
(Something is lacking.)

1033
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,780
this is the last touch. The belt.
I got it because you like flashy things.

1034
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,150
- It's cool, right?
- It's cool.

1035
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:23,489
It should go in. It should make a noise.

1036
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:25,119
(He knew what style he liked.)

1037
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:27,690
It looks very different with the boots.
Here you go.

1038
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,059
- That's cool.
- This is the finishing touch.

1039
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,500
The hat will finish the look.

1040
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:33,059
(Gasping)

1041
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:34,130
Why? Is it because it's expensive?

1042
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:36,199
It's made in Texas.

1043
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,440
Made in Texas.

1044
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,110
It fits perfectly.

1045
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,170
- It's comfy, isn't it?
- Yes.

1046
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,039
Thank goodness. The hat was crucial.

1047
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,179
This is great.

1048
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,309
- You look great.
- It's perfect.

1049
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:50,519
I was proud because it suited him so well.

1050
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,079
- It suits you so well.
- Yes.

1051
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,079
(Teo is proud of giving him a great gift.)

1052
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:54,889
(Is he flapping?)

1053
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:56,090
(He's very excited.)

1054
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,860
- Did you pull out a gun?
- It was a revolver.

1055
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,929
- It suits him, though.
- It's perfect for you.

1056
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:05,000
He's a drunk cowboy.

1057
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,730
Look in the mirror.

1058
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,130
Kian84 has always looked good in clothes.

1059
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,199
- You should wear that on a daily basis.
- I know, right?

1060
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,199
- It suits you.
- His former work was "Fashion King."

1061
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,940
- Do you like it?
- It's not bad.

1062
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,969
- Nice.
- He's happy.

1063
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,039
That's a genuine smile.

1064
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,780
I like it.

1065
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,510
I've always worn...

1066
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,280
- It was worth it.
- That's excellent.

1067
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,650
It's the most dressed up
I've ever seen him.

1068
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
I should have gone to Nicole wearing that.

1069
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:33,019
It wasn't too bad.

1070
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:35,489
It started to look good
when I put on the hat.

1071
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,800
Before the hat,
I was a nerdy college student.

1072
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,730
After the hat, I was a cowboy in Texas.

1073
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,599
I'd say I pulled it off.

1074
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:44,639
That's how important your outfit is.

1075
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,440
(A sexy cowboy)

1076
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,980
(A cute cowboy)

1077
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:52,179
(And...)

1078
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,980
(a fashionista cowboy)

1079
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:56,949
Clothes are certainly important.

1080
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,550
He's become an entirely different man.

1081
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,980
(The three cowboys are ready.)

1082
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,289
This is so early.

1083
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:03,590
The sun isn't even up yet.

1084
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:07,360
I found out why cowboys started
working so early.

1085
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,860
Cows and horses get stressed
when it's way too hot.

1086
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,800
- I see.
- That's why they start early.

1087
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,099
- Let's hit the road.
- Yes.

1088
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,400
- So...
- It's Devine.

1089
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,309
I kept exchanging text messages...

1090
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:23,510
with him after we parted ways at the bar.

1091
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,139
I even got the exact location
of the ranch.

1092
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:30,750
I like that his ranch...

1093
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,579
doesn't even show up in Google Maps.

1094
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:34,820
- I see.
- We're going...

1095
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,260
to an actual local ranch to help out.

1096
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,389
I hope we can find inspiration there
as well.

1097
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,860
(The dark dawn starts to get brighter.)

1098
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,969
(We can slowly see the scenery.)

1099
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:55,369
There are just plains here.

1100
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:58,380
(The endless plains are before them.)

1101
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,349
The area is a bit... How should I put it?

1102
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,780
When I was serving in the military
in Pyeongtaek,

1103
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,219
I could see the vast plains...

1104
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:09,619
as I went to stop the protestors.

1105
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,760
But this was larger than that.

1106
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,460
Like the ocean,
you can see the horizon past the land.

1107
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:19,099
So, I couldn't tell...

1108
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:21,530
whether the end was the cloud,
the ocean, or the land.

1109
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,670
Because it was so vast.

1110
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,239
(He's never seen
such a large area before.)

1111
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:27,099
I liked how those sights...

1112
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:29,409
were unfamiliar.

1113
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,710
(While he's busy appreciating the view,)

1114
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,949
(Teo chooses a song by Bob Dylan.)

1115
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:40,750
Do you have "Knockin' on Heaven's Door"
sung by this man?

1116
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,920
- Yes, I do.
- Let's listen to that.

1117
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,900
(Driving along the plains in Texas,)

1118
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,210
(they listen to traditional American music
in its birthplace.)

1119
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,880
(Feeling the cool wind in Texas at dawn)

1120
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,219
The sun is coming up.

1121
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:16,889
Gosh. Look at the sunrise behind us.

1122
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,960
This is literally the countryside.

1123
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,530
(The sun slowly rises past the dark dawn.)

1124
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,400
You can't even pay...

1125
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,409
to watch such a sight.

1126
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,010
Amazing.

1127
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,980
(Pani on the wheel)

1128
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,079
Kian84, come to the center for a second.

1129
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,289
(Knocking on a ranch's door together)

1130
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,329
Pani, can you pull over...

1131
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:55,559
to the right for a moment?

1132
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,599
- Just for a minute.
- Sure.

1133
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,199
- Why, Teo?
- What?

1134
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:03,099
We have to take a photo here.

1135
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:05,199
Of the three of us with the hats on.

1136
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,969
I want to cherish this moment.

1137
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:10,510
I think it was his first time
asking for a photo in the US.

1138
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:13,880
When the sun hasn't completely...

1139
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,010
- risen yet.
- Right.

1140
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,349
- Yes. We have to take a picture.
- Okay.

1141
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,619
- It'll only take a minute.
- Okay.

1142
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:23,619
Put your hats on, and we'll get out,
take the photo, and get back in.

1143
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,789
Okay. Go.

1144
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,489
Yes!

1145
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,559
- Come on.
- Yes.

1146
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,929
We should go far.

1147
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,059
That's what I'm talking about.

1148
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,699
(Excited)

1149
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:37,300
All right. Let's take one here.

1150
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:41,239
(They stop in the middle of the road...)

1151
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:44,710
(and take a group photo.)

1152
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,110
This moment is straight out of a movie.

1153
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,510
We were driving with music on,

1154
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,679
and we were wearing cowboy clothes
and headed to a ranch.

1155
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:56,389
I wanted to remember this moment.

1156
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:57,760
(A beautiful view
presented by the dawn in Texas)

1157
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,320
- Oh, my.
- Geez.

1158
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,590
That's magnificent.

1159
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:05,360
It's the time when the sky is pretty,
isn't it?

1160
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,360
Yes.

1161
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,170
- That's like a pictorial.
- What is that?

1162
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,639
That turned into the main poster.

1163
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,869
- You're right.
- Awesome.

1164
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:16,840
- Fabulous.
- Yes.

1165
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,380
It was a good thing that we stopped there.

1166
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,780
(The three brothers stared
at the sky for a while.)

1167
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,820
It's so calming.

1168
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:31,059
- Let's go.
- Great.

1169
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:35,059
This is so funny.

1170
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:38,559
There it is. "Devine."
We'll be there in five minutes.

1171
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:42,269
- "Devine."
- It must be a quiet town.

1172
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,769
The houses are so far apart.

1173
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,269
I've always been curious...

1174
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:51,079
about the characteristics of their music
coming from the freedom,

1175
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:53,780
life, and responsibility...

1176
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,480
that nature presents them.

1177
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:59,079
The songs that cowboys used to sing
when they worked...

1178
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:02,389
became the roots of country music.

1179
00:48:02,389 --> 00:48:04,619
That was how it all started.

1180
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,030
So, I'm looking forward to that.

1181
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:09,559
I hope we find inspiration
in country music.

1182
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:10,900
You know,

1183
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,400
I don't think
it has to be about country music.

1184
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,829
If anything inspires me,

1185
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:17,840
I can build a story from there.

1186
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,769
It doesn't have to be country music.

1187
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:21,570
- They live...
- Yes.

1188
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,139
- in nature, right?
- They do.

1189
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:26,940
I hope watching the cowboy lifestyle...

1190
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,380
- in real life...
- Yes.

1191
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,079
- will inspire you.
- Right.

1192
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,079
We're almost there,

1193
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:35,789
so I'll give Eddie a call and tell him.

1194
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:38,190
He must also get up quite early.

1195
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,389
I know. I'm nervous.

1196
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:41,989
- Why?
- I don't know.

1197
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:43,760
I was pretty nervous...

1198
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,000
because I was entering
the moment and culture...

1199
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,269
that I've always dreamed of.

1200
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:53,440
- "Hey, what's up, bro?"
- "Hey!"

1201
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:57,409
Yello!

1202
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,980
Hey. Howdy, Teo... It's Teo.

1203
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,050
Man, you had me worried.
I didn't think you were going to show up.

1204
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,579
No, I'm going to show up.

1205
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:07,380
We're on the way.
We got stuck a little bit on the way.

1206
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,019
We're like five minutes away.

1207
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:10,320
- Okay.
- All right

1208
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,659
Sounds good. Let me know
when you're at the gate.

1209
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,489
There's going to be "HB..."

1210
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:17,659
on the gate.

1211
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:20,460
Okay. I'll look out for the HB.

1212
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,269
- HB, yes.
- All right. Thank you.

1213
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,570
We need to find a gate that says HB on it.

1214
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,710
- HB?
- Yes.

1215
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,940
I think the pin was...
Maybe there are several gates.

1216
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,010
I see.

1217
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,579
Take a right down there.

1218
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:36,179
There's literally nothing here.

1219
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,480
- This one isn't it.
- I think that's the one.

1220
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:40,820
"HB."

1221
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,320
- Gosh.
- How did you...

1222
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,119
Even the HB sign looks cool.

1223
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,260
It does look cool.

1224
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,559
"Houston Bros Ranch."

1225
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:51,000
A ranch by the Houston brothers.

1226
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,559
- It looks like a logo.
- For a designer brand, right?

1227
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,969
Is that him?

1228
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:57,170
- He's on a horse.
- Gosh.

1229
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,639
He welcomed you guys on a horse.

1230
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:00,300
He was suddenly showing off.

1231
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,409
Hey, how is it going?

1232
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:05,409
He looked totally different
from when I saw him at the bar.

1233
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,079
Okay.

1234
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,110
(Open, Ranch.)

1235
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,679
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1236
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:13,119
(Enter slowly!)

1237
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,820
He said to follow him slowly.

1238
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,349
Follow the road? Okay.

1239
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:17,860
It's huge!

1240
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,460
The ranch was extensive.

1241
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:20,559
The horses are cute.

1242
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,789
The three of them are in one frame.

1243
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,460
(Amazed)

1244
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:28,099
(Riding along with the truck)

1245
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:29,369
That's incredible.

1246
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:31,800
- It's what we'd see in movies or games.
- Yes. It's right before your eyes.

1247
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:33,570
That's fantastic.

1248
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,469
(Yeehaw!)

1249
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:39,980
This is picturesque.

1250
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,050
Look at how big the field is.

1251
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,750
It's no field. It's a meadow.

1252
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,550
It's so surreal.

1253
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,650
Gosh. It's so cool.

1254
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,889
I finally realized that we had arrived.

1255
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:54,159
You must have been so excited.

1256
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,699
"HB. Houston Bros."

1257
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,260
We have to park the truck here.

1258
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,570
(They're inside the ranch in no time.)

1259
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:02,630
All right.

1260
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:05,400
(Reminiscing)

1261
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:07,070
We're here.

1262
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,940
- Hello!
- You brought some friends.

1263
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,440
Hello.

1264
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,449
How are you? I didn't think
you were going to make it, man.

1265
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,280
He's the guy we met at the bar.

1266
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,980
A cowboy called Eddie.

1267
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,420
Hey. This is my buddy, John Paul.

1268
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,420
- John Paul? I'm Teo.
- JP.

1269
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:25,460
Nice to meet you. My name is Kian84.

1270
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:27,159
- Kim? I'm Quatro.
- Yes.

1271
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,860
Quatro?

1272
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,960
- He says his name is Quatro.
- Quatro?

1273
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,300
- Quatro?
- Yes. What's your name, buddy?

1274
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,429
- Pani. Yes.
- Pani?

1275
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:35,670
- Quatro. Nice to meet you.
- Is it Quatro...

1276
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:37,969
- from "uno, dos, tres, quatro?"
- That's right. Yes, sir.

1277
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,570
- I see.
- And Pani? What does that mean?

1278
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,110
- Water?
- Yes.

1279
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,010
We need some water. That's what we need.

1280
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:46,139
- They're a number and water.
- Friends?

1281
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,980
- We're friends. We work together.
- Friends.

1282
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,449
This is his place.
We're going to help him gather cattle.

1283
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,019
We're here to help him, so...

1284
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:54,789
Man, you brought
a big enough crew to help,

1285
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:56,489
so we should get the job done today.

1286
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,650
Yes. Hopefully.

1287
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,960
Oh, it wasn't Eddie's ranch.

1288
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,730
Today's ranch is owned by Quatro.

1289
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:05,059
They were all running
a ranch of their own nearby.

1290
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,699
Quatro had some work
to get done at his ranch,

1291
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:10,570
so he asked his friends for help.

1292
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,239
Then, Eddie must have said,

1293
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:14,710
"I met some guys. I'll bring more hands."

1294
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,769
That's what happened.

1295
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:17,610
- It's like an exchange of labor.
- It is.

1296
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,380
You guys work cows for a living?

1297
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,639
No, we don't.

1298
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,750
So, I'm an actor.

1299
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:26,320
He's a writer. A comic book writer.

1300
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,449
Don't tell them that.

1301
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,489
What else would he tell them?

1302
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,389
- Just don't.
- What else...

1303
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:33,389
- could he tell them?
- Just call you a celebrity?

1304
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:35,389
He's a travel YouTuber.

1305
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,059
And he has over two million followers.

1306
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:39,530
Oh, that's
who I need to make friends with.

1307
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,900
What do you think about our getup?

1308
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,570
- Man, I...
- We went shopping.

1309
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,969
You guys definitely fit the part.
I like it.

1310
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:49,039
I'm going to steal every one
of your shirts because I like them.

1311
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,739
At a glance, they were sweaty.

1312
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,909
Their clothes and hats were all sweaty.

1313
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:57,110
It was sweaty overall.

1314
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,949
I could feel the air when I saw them.

1315
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:03,250
It was like watching a ripe pickle.

1316
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,320
But we've got to get a few things
ready over here.

1317
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,130
I'll get you three to come around with me
side by side.

1318
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,730
We'll just go and check out the place.

1319
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,659
I'll show you what we're going to do
this morning.

1320
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:14,699
The ranch was so big
that he wanted to show us around,

1321
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:16,400
so we went with him.

1322
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:17,769
We can just follow him for now.

1323
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:18,769
- Okay.
- Okay.

1324
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:21,269
I know what you said, but I really...

1325
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:23,840
What was it? Wrench?

1326
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,010
- "Wrench?"
- "Wrench?"

1327
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,380
- Eddie.
- Eddie. Laminates?

1328
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:31,579
Yes. I got knocked out...

1329
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:33,420
- I also got laminates.
- At first encounter!

1330
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,150
- The bulls knocked mine out.
- Yes.

1331
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,619
His bulls knocked his teeth.

1332
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:38,619
Bulls?

1333
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:40,489
What did you do? In a fight?

1334
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:43,860
No. I got them for beauty.

1335
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,460
- "For beauty."
- "For beauty."

1336
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,099
- He's a celebrity, indeed.
- For beauty purposes.

1337
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,130
- For beauty?
- Yes.

1338
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,400
I was about to say,

1339
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,699
- "This guy's a big fighter!"
- I know!

1340
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,739
He thought you broke them in a fight.

1341
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,639
That would have made me the real deal.

1342
00:53:54,909 --> 00:53:56,340
We'll see. You guys ready to go, then?

1343
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,210
- Yes, let's go.
- Have at it.

1344
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,679
- We'll meet back here in a bit.
- This is an actual ranch.

1345
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:04,920
My laminates would have been cool
had I broken my teeth in a fight.

1346
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,250
The ranch is so large that
you have to get around on horses or carts.

1347
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:11,920
Quatro, how old are you?

1348
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:14,929
Me? In September, I'll be 34.

1349
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:17,590
- Thirty-four?
- Thirty-four, yes. Born in 1990.

1350
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:18,829
All right.

1351
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,699
Yes, 34. But I'll tell you what.

1352
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,369
So, did you guys meet Eddie in Bandera?

1353
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,369
Yes. We met him at the Arkey's.

1354
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:27,469
Okay.

1355
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:29,269
What did you all think of Bandera?

1356
00:54:29,409 --> 00:54:31,039
- I think it's beautiful.
- Yes?

1357
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:32,480
- Yes.
- Kind of like a Western...

1358
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,980
Yes, like the Western town.

1359
00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:38,019
We grew up here.
This is my dad's family's ranch.

1360
00:54:38,019 --> 00:54:42,420
It's been in this family,
I bet, close to a hundred years.

1361
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:47,190
And we run cows,
we ride lots of horses and do daywork.

1362
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,889
We do ranches, rodeos,
and stuff like that.

1363
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:53,360
His family has been running this ranch
for 100 years for 3 generations.

1364
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,969
They raise cows too.

1365
00:54:54,969 --> 00:54:56,969
He was really proud of his ranch.

1366
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,699
He's a master, so to speak.

1367
00:54:58,699 --> 00:54:59,699
(Master Quatro)

1368
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:02,610
My dad has this fake symbol of a Bigfoot.

1369
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:05,380
His dad put a fake Bigfoot...

1370
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,409
- on purpose.
- Really?

1371
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:07,710
(Laughing)

1372
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,710
(Increasing the speed)

1373
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:14,750
(Thrilled)

1374
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:20,460
(An exciting off-road ride in the ranch)

1375
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,630
(Smiling brightly)

1376
00:55:22,929 --> 00:55:24,960
How many cows?

1377
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,300
I've got 40 mama cows
and 40 babies right now.

1378
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,130
So, we've got about 80 altogether.

1379
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,369
Eighty? Is that eight hundred?

1380
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:34,070
- No, eight, zero.
- I see.

1381
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:37,269
That's a longhorn over there.

1382
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:38,840
That one is. Yes, I'm going to...

1383
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,909
I'm going to take you
to see a bigger herd.

1384
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:42,010
Look at those horns!

1385
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,579
That's the symbol of Texas.

1386
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:45,420
Look, Pani. It's horns...

1387
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:47,679
- That's called a longhorn.
- Longhorn?

1388
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:50,489
Yes, longhorn.
It's a Texas breed of cattle.

1389
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:51,489
Because it's got long horns.

1390
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:54,190
- A Texas cow?
- Yes.

1391
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,929
You could never see that in Korea.

1392
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,059
(A Texan specialty, longhorn)

1393
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:01,199
(Various symbols of longhorns...)

1394
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:02,400
(all over Texas)

1395
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
That's awesome.

1396
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,070
- Gosh.
- That's so cool.

1397
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,309
(And a longhorn parade
that reenacts a cattle drive)

1398
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,809
- Even in sports teams.
- It's an actual symbol.

1399
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:13,809
(People of Texas love it so much
that they use it for sports teams.)

1400
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,380
"Longhorn." How cool.

1401
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:21,250
Over here,
when we get closer in a minute...

1402
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,820
That must be them.

1403
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,260
They're butting heads.

1404
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,460
- The horns are...
- It's like the horns of the devil.

1405
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,460
It is.

1406
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:29,889
(Making a noise)

1407
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,230
(Mooing)

1408
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:36,969
- They're coming.
- They're coming to see us.

1409
00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:38,469
(He makes their sound,)

1410
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:39,639
(and they come one by one.)

1411
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:40,670
Why are they coming?

1412
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,369
Quatro feeds them every morning,

1413
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:45,909
so they come when he calls them.

1414
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,409
(This longhorn is
ahead of every other longhorn.)

1415
00:56:49,849 --> 00:56:52,119
- That must be their leader.
- Right.

1416
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:53,780
I think it's a male.

1417
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,250
He's standing before them
and protecting them.

1418
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,559
(Turning)

1419
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,360
- They all follow when he goes.
- They do.

1420
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,329
The leader is protecting them.

1421
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:05,699
(Following their leader)

1422
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:07,159
Is that a house for living purposes?

1423
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,400
Not this one, but the one down there is.

1424
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,039
- I see.
- Yes. That one...

1425
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:14,809
Sometimes, we'll stick hunters in there
that come down to...

1426
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:17,309
I always have a lot of work.
If you run into...

1427
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:19,880
If the sun is down,
and I still have work to do,

1428
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,980
you all are welcome to stay there,
so you can keep working.

1429
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,409
- Yes.
- How much work does he have for you?

1430
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,980
It's too hot to work when the sun is up,

1431
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,550
so it must be like a resting place.

1432
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,690
My place over this way is
where I keep these cattle.

1433
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:34,860
Over there,
there's a tree line back there.

1434
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:37,159
My place still goes further past that.

1435
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:39,760
- Okay.
- How big is that ranch?

1436
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,130
Quatro. How many do you...

1437
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,000
- How many do you have...
- Acres?

1438
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:46,469
Land? Yards?

1439
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:48,510
- Yes, how many acres?
- One thousand.

1440
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,570
It's 1,000 acres. How big is that?

1441
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:51,980
I don't know what acres transfer to.

1442
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,110
- Me neither.
- Acres?

1443
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,409
This little square
that we're sitting in...

1444
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,150
is about 30 acres.

1445
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,380
- Thirty.
- To give you an idea.

1446
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,280
How large is that in pyeong?

1447
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,449
- That's how I know.
- What was the size in acres?

1448
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:03,349
A thousand. If this is 30 acres,

1449
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:04,590
- Thirty acres?
- we can do a quick math.

1450
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:07,719
This is 30 acres, and he has 1,000 acres.
Hold on. Let's see.

1451
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:10,460
This must be over 10,000 pyeong.

1452
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,030
Or 20,000 pyeong?

1453
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,260
(Measuring the size by eye)

1454
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:15,329
It's 33. Is that 660,000 pyeong?

1455
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:16,329
Hold on.

1456
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:18,940
Hey, it's 2,000,000m².

1457
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:20,199
- It's 2,000,000m²?
- Yes.

1458
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:22,510
- You can measure that?
- I did the math.

1459
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:24,610
- You're a genius.
- This should be about 20,000 pyeong.

1460
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:25,710
By eye measurement.

1461
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,510
An acre is 1,200 pyeong, or 4,000m².

1462
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:33,519
- It's 1.2 million pyeong?
- It was 4,000,000m².

1463
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:35,349
- That's huge.
- He must need a lot of extra hand.

1464
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:36,920
- So that's...
- How big is that?

1465
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,320
Right. It's 153 times
Jamsil Baseball Stadium.

1466
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,659
It's 153 times that?

1467
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,960
This is way too big.

1468
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:46,500
It's literally heritage.

1469
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:49,570
You must constantly have work to do
with such a large place.

1470
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,599
They don't have cattle like that in Korea?

1471
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:53,699
No.

1472
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,070
We have a different type.

1473
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:58,039
There are some deer right there.
Some baby deer.

1474
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,880
The mama deer were having babies.

1475
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,409
- Adorable!
- There are deer too.

1476
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:03,980
The female deer had babies.

1477
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,420
(The deer leisurely eat breakfast.)

1478
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,880
That's gorgeous.

1479
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,989
This is like a safari.

1480
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:11,090
- Yes!
- You own a safari.

1481
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,289
(Horses)

1482
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:15,460
(Longhorns)

1483
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,159
(Cows and donkeys)

1484
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:18,300
Even donkeys?

1485
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,500
It's like having nature
in your front yard.

1486
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,570
I went to...

1487
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,269
Disney World one time,
and that's what it was like over there.

1488
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,039
A big safari.

1489
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:31,369
It was nice to see
how they weren't locked up like in zoos.

1490
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:35,309
You don't have a farm?

1491
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:37,050
- A pond? Water?
- A farm.

1492
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,820
- Yes.
- Yes, right here.

1493
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,750
No, I mean a farm.

1494
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,090
- Oh, a farm!
- Yes, farms.

1495
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,789
I thought he was saying "Pond." We have...

1496
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,960
ponds for fish if you fish.
If you all do fishing...

1497
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,389
We've got fish all over.

1498
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:49,590
- Fish?
- We can even catch fish here.

1499
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,659
Good!

1500
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:52,900
There's catfish and bass.

1501
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,230
What doesn't he have?

1502
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,130
- Bass?
- Yes, bass.

1503
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,599
- We have bass in Korean rivers.
- There's bass.

1504
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,170
So, bass isn't...

1505
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,170
- an exotic species here.
- Right.

1506
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:04,340
You see those purple things on the cactus?

1507
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,380
- So...
- That, we have in Korea too.

1508
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,409
- Oh, you have that?
- Yes.

1509
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:10,179
So, over here,
a lot of people make jelly out of it.

1510
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:12,250
- Yes, you can eat them, right?
- Yes. I'll show you.

1511
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:14,420
That's a cactus fruit.

1512
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:17,889
I wish I could pick one and eat it.

1513
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,360
(Gulping)

1514
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:20,820
It's a cactus fruit.

1515
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:21,929
- This is a cactus fruit?
- Yes.

1516
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:24,329
Don't touch them because...

1517
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,260
they have a lot of thorns on them.

1518
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:28,099
But if you get one off...

1519
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:30,170
We could find everything in nature.

1520
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:31,739
- Free fruits.
- Then, you can take it.

1521
01:00:32,969 --> 01:00:35,039
I'm going to cut it right here.
I'll show you.

1522
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:37,110
You take it and split it down.

1523
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,179
- A cactus fruit!
- Yes, a cactus fruit.

1524
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:41,280
- And all that stuff right there...
- Yes.

1525
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:44,349
- It looks like a fig.
- Yes, a fig.

1526
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,349
That looks sweet.

1527
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,349
- All these little thorns right here?
- Yes.

1528
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:49,420
- They're so little. These right here.
- Yes.

1529
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,489
And they'll get in your fingers,
and it'll hurt.

1530
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:52,489
It must be dangerous.

1531
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,230
He's just picking it with his hands!

1532
01:00:55,329 --> 01:00:56,329
- It'll hurt.
- It's too dangerous.

1533
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:58,500
I should pick one too.

1534
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,230
- Oh, no.
- Don't do that.

1535
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:03,429
But I didn't hear him say...

1536
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:06,239
- that I couldn't pick it with my hands.
- Oh, it's going to hurt so much.

1537
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:07,800
It'll be so painful.

1538
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,710
(Putting it on top)

1539
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,639
- Very sweet.
- Did you pick it with your hands?

1540
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:12,679
Yes, with my hands.

1541
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,139
(Amazed)

1542
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:16,780
It won't hurt you. It's really sweet.

1543
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,579
Watch the thorns on the side.
It's got thorns.

1544
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,380
- It tastes like a fruit.
- You need to be careful.

1545
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,389
He says we can't work
when we get thorns on our hands.

1546
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,820
If you ever get them on your...

1547
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:28,690
(Laughing)

1548
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,190
Watch your lips!

1549
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,829
- But there are thorns.
- Hold it carefully.

1550
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,570
They have thorns. No, they have thorns!

1551
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:36,570
What about the thorns?

1552
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,940
(Oh, man.)

1553
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,969
Quatro is startled.

1554
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:42,340
They don't worry about thorns.

1555
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,940
It's fine. It doesn't matter.

1556
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,440
It's sweet, though.

1557
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,880
- It is sweet.
- It's bitter but sweet.

1558
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,679
(Smacking his lips)

1559
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:54,679
What do you call grasshoppers in English?

1560
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,050
- Grasshopper.
- Yes, the grasshoppers.

1561
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,190
- Koreans eat grasshoppers.
- It's good?

1562
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,489
- Koreans eat them.
- Yes.

1563
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:02,460
I used to fry them and eat them
when I was little.

1564
01:02:02,929 --> 01:02:04,789
- How do you make them?
- You just fry them.

1565
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,260
You're going to get us
to eat a grasshopper.

1566
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,230
- Yes.
- Right.

1567
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,369
- Here's one.
- They're quick.

1568
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:12,369
- Did you catch one?
- Yes.

1569
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:14,739
- That's a baby.
- That looks like a Bombay locust.

1570
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:15,969
But he says it's a baby.

1571
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:19,409
What if they're poisonous,
unlike Korean grasshoppers?

1572
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,579
- Right?
- You don't care, though.

1573
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:25,250
- They are different.
- Hey, I still care about poison!

1574
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:26,849
You're going to eat it, anyway.

1575
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:29,550
I can't eat poison. It'll kill you.

1576
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,960
Yes, you need to stay away from poison.

1577
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,889
(Cleaning the cactus fruit leftovers)

1578
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,260
You all are crazy. You like it, though.

1579
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,599
We'll have to make some jam.

1580
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,699
He keeps calling us crazy...

1581
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:43,599
for eating that with bare hands.

1582
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:46,139
He told us not to eat the cactus
because it was thorny,

1583
01:02:46,139 --> 01:02:48,070
and Kian84 at the whole thing.

1584
01:02:48,409 --> 01:02:51,110
I love how they can
just pick a cactus fruit...

1585
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:53,210
and make food out of it.

1586
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,650
- Jam sounds good.
- There are so many.

1587
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,010
They must grow the cacti...

1588
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,719
for the fruit.

1589
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:01,920
- I think they naturally grew.
- It grew naturally.

1590
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:05,690
What do you think it'd be like
when Eddie, JP, and I went to Korea?

1591
01:03:05,889 --> 01:03:08,530
I think it'd be fun.
Three cowboys in Seoul.

1592
01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:11,659
- Because it's a very modern life.
- Is it?

1593
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:13,030
- They can come to Jeju Island.
- Yes, Jeju Island.

1594
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:15,170
- And ride horses.
- There's an island...

1595
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,769
What's that?

1596
01:03:17,469 --> 01:03:19,800
- This is a very authentic cabin.
- Yes.

1597
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,309
This front piece was actually made off...

1598
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:24,840
- of an 18-wheeler from a trailer.
- An 18 million...

1599
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,110
This is where cowboys come to rest.

1600
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,579
- The big trucks on the highway.
- Yes.

1601
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:32,780
If you look, it's made off of a truck.

1602
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,150
This piece right here is
an 18-wheeler trailer.

1603
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,489
It's a Transformer!

1604
01:03:37,489 --> 01:03:40,559
- Oh, it is.
- Oh, it's a trailer.

1605
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:41,619
You're right.

1606
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:43,630
They made a house out of a trailer.

1607
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:45,900
- Check out those hats.
- Texas hats.

1608
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,500
(The hats cover the ceiling.)

1609
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:50,730
This looks pretty nice.

1610
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,300
(Other than the hats on the ceiling,)

1611
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,239
(there are cowboy props everywhere.)

1612
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:56,440
It's like an artwork.

1613
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,940
You could take care of everything here
even if the world came to an end.

1614
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,909
He was already preparing
for a nuclear war.

1615
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,949
Man, you're not even a rancher.
You're an artist.

1616
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:07,980
Yes, that comes from my dad's side.

1617
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,489
You've got to be careful in some places.
There are bees.

1618
01:04:10,489 --> 01:04:13,559
Yes. There are hornets.
Watch out for those.

1619
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,789
It's a hornet.

1620
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:17,760
- They're building a hive.
- There's a bee hive.

1621
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,329
Korean hornets are certainly bigger.

1622
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:21,869
That one looks skinny.

1623
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:25,670
This is where I can hook you up
if you want to stay.

1624
01:04:26,139 --> 01:04:28,510
If you all want to stay,
this is where you come.

1625
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:30,239
Is it real?

1626
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,480
Yes, it's a 22. Just a little bolt-action.

1627
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,710
It's older, though.

1628
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:37,079
- Guns are legal in Texas, right?
- Yes, they're legal.

1629
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:39,119
They need to shoot...

1630
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,250
wild boars or bears
to protect their families.

1631
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,989
Nice.

1632
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:47,760
I realized what cowboys thought
were important.

1633
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,130
The first one is land.

1634
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:53,400
The police take too long to come
when others come to take it away,

1635
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,900
so they started owning guns.

1636
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:56,800
You need land to raise cattle.

1637
01:04:57,269 --> 01:05:00,039
And you need cattle
to put bread on the table.

1638
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:02,610
So, they live and die on this land.

1639
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:05,179
It all boiled down to the land.

1640
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:10,710
I find their principle pretty amazing.

1641
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,480
(A cowboy's heart, land)

1642
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:13,719
This is interesting.

1643
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,949
The price of ammo increased,

1644
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:18,519
(Due to the price increase of ammo)

1645
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:19,820
so there won't be a warning shot.

1646
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,590
(Do not expect a warning shot)

1647
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:22,989
- So, be careful.
- They won't fire a warning shot...

1648
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:23,989
since ammo is expensive.

1649
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,460
It means they'll shoot right away, right?

1650
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,059
- It means not to mess with them.
- Yes.

1651
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:29,130
Like, "Don't come in here." That's Texas.

1652
01:05:29,369 --> 01:05:30,369
Pani.

1653
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,699
Pani sounds like an Indian name.

1654
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:35,170
- Pani?
- He caught on.

1655
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:38,679
Quatro turned out to be
pretty playful and talkative.

1656
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:41,710
Did you ever see the movie
"Ninja Turtles?"

1657
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:43,650
- Yes.
- Michelangelo?

1658
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:47,219
He says you resemble
Michelangelo in "Ninja Turtles."

1659
01:05:47,219 --> 01:05:48,650
(The face of a turtle)

1660
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,519
- He does!
- I love "Ninja Turtles."

1661
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:52,690
Cowabunga!

1662
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:56,360
You look like the character
from "Toy Story."

1663
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,730
Was it Judy?

1664
01:05:57,929 --> 01:06:00,760
- Woody?
- Woody!

1665
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,630
Last year for Halloween,
I dressed up as Woody.

1666
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:04,300
- He dressed up as Woody!
- He did.

1667
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:06,670
What a coincidence.

1668
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,710
(Speeding up)

1669
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:11,039
This is pretty fast.

1670
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:13,440
(Don't let its size fool you.)

1671
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,510
Rock and roll!

1672
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:18,550
(Letting out a loud cheer)

1673
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:21,750
(They feel the morning breeze of the ranch
with their entire bodies.)

1674
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,289
- Don't tell us to go fast!
- All right!

1675
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,420
(Yeehaw)

1676
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,130
Now, we're going on a drive!

1677
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:33,500
(The ranch tour ends with a cool breeze.)

1678
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,269
That was fun.

1679
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,599
- You all ready to ride?
- Yes.

1680
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,010
Eddie and JP brought horses for us.

1681
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:45,380
They're showing us how cowboys live...

1682
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,880
in the 21st century so well.

1683
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:50,050
- Let's get to work.
- That sounds good.

1684
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:51,050
Yes, let's get to work.

1685
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:52,980
- Kian84.
- Kian84.

1686
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,619
All right, Kian84. This is your horse.

1687
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:56,019
- Got it?
- Yes, got it.

1688
01:06:56,019 --> 01:06:57,050
- Follow me.
- Nice.

1689
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:01,559
You need to be able to ride a horse
when you work at a ranch.

1690
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:04,789
So, they put us on horses without notice.

1691
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:06,829
They didn't even give you time
to mentally prepare yourself...

1692
01:07:06,829 --> 01:07:08,730
- and gave you actual work.
- Yes.

1693
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,829
- It's trained really well.
- Let me check your brake.

1694
01:07:10,829 --> 01:07:12,369
- Stop her.
- Stop.

1695
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:13,500
(Stopping her with the reins)

1696
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,900
Okay. Cool.

1697
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,780
(He starts riding it instantly.)

1698
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,980
(Slowly.)

1699
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:24,750
You're all right.

1700
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:27,079
- Stop.
- Okay.

1701
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,650
- How am I supposed to...
- Come to me.

1702
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,090
Look at me. Don't look at your horse.

1703
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,090
Okay.

1704
01:07:33,159 --> 01:07:35,159
(Clip-clop)

1705
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:37,090
Okay. Sit down.

1706
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,300
- Your groins must have hurt.
- Yes, you need to be able...

1707
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,929
- to groove to the rhythm.
- It hurts your back so much.

1708
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:45,369
(Whoa84 communicates with "whoa.")

1709
01:07:45,739 --> 01:07:46,900
Why?

1710
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:50,510
She's driving automatically
out of the blue.

1711
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:53,409
- Is that a Tesla?
- I wanted to see what it did.

1712
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:56,380
(Automatic Driving Mode)

1713
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:59,880
- Autopilot!
- He said, "Autopilot!"

1714
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,949
It's going wherever it wants.
Where are you going?

1715
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:06,059
- Yes, do what you want. I'm curious.
- She's following him. Look at Kian84.

1716
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:07,119
Yes, graze some grass.

1717
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:08,590
Oh, my.

1718
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,130
They have dung beetles!

1719
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:11,329
(Horse poop)

1720
01:08:11,329 --> 01:08:14,000
- That was so touching.
- Pani. Dung beetles.

1721
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
- There are dung beetles?
- The way of nature.

1722
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,929
- Look! Dung beetles!
- Dung beetles.

1723
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,840
There are dung beetles.

1724
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:22,610
- Look. It's so cute.
- I've only seen them in documentaries.

1725
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:24,840
- They actually move like that.
- There were so many.

1726
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,179
(Fascinated)

1727
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:29,179
There are so many dung beetles.

1728
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:31,880
He's filming a movie by himself.

1729
01:08:33,019 --> 01:08:34,619
(Everyone's eyes go to...)

1730
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,320
(Teo on a white horse.)

1731
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,059
Pull that.

1732
01:08:39,389 --> 01:08:41,659
His hair is waving in the wind. Awesome.

1733
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:43,829
That's an award ceremony.

1734
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:46,960
It's like a movie here.

1735
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,130
It's a scene from a movie!

1736
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:52,539
- The studio turned into a theater.
- There you go.

1737
01:08:53,139 --> 01:08:54,670
It's easier to do it.

1738
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:57,369
I'll show you how to do it.
But you're doing a good job.

1739
01:08:57,469 --> 01:09:00,809
Kiss her a little bit. Keep coming.

1740
01:09:00,809 --> 01:09:03,309
- Now, stop. "Whoa."
- Whoa.

1741
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,250
Good job.

1742
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:07,250
I got on the horse,

1743
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,820
and I had never ridden a horse
before that in my life.

1744
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,690
It felt like a lie,

1745
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,789
but I could ride it so well
in such a short time.

1746
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:17,489
I couldn't even believe it.

1747
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:19,329
I was like, "Is this really happening?"

1748
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,760
You're doing a really good job.

1749
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,500
You're a professional.

1750
01:09:24,599 --> 01:09:26,300
Let me saddle you up...

1751
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,599
- with a different one.
- Okay.

1752
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,909
- All right. Cool. Thanks.
- I'll be right back.

1753
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:31,940
(They decide to give him a faster horse.)

1754
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,639
(Proud)

1755
01:09:33,639 --> 01:09:35,380
You're lucky. That horse...

1756
01:09:35,809 --> 01:09:37,980
was the number-one champion Mexican horse.

1757
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:40,179
It was a horse that has won...

1758
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,920
so many traditional Mexican competitions.

1759
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:43,389
It's blonde.

1760
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:45,920
- I'm going to try.
- The champion?

1761
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:47,559
That one looks great.

1762
01:09:48,389 --> 01:09:51,460
He was such a good rider
that they brought a faster horse.

1763
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,599
(The rising star gets on another horse.)

1764
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,470
(Pacing with a new partner)

1765
01:09:56,069 --> 01:09:58,770
- It looks like a horse from a myth.
- It understood everything.

1766
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,239
(A good reverse)

1767
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,270
Turn him around.

1768
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:02,409
(He even perfectly steers it.)

1769
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:03,409
There you go.

1770
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,640
Perfect. Really good.

1771
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,239
That's a lot better. It looks really good.

1772
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,979
What do you have going on, Quatro?

1773
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:11,810
- We're going to gather the cattle.
- Gather the cattle?

1774
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,479
We're gathering the cattle?

1775
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,050
The gate is located...
Do you see where the road is going?

1776
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,460
- This road?
- Yes, sir. You see that road down there?

1777
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,430
- Yes.
- Stop them right there.

1778
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:25,460
- It's kind of going into a horn.
- They're going straight to work.

1779
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,060
That must not be easy on a horse.

1780
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,930
(Herding cattle is
gathering the scattered cows.)

1781
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,939
(An old cowboy tradition)

1782
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:35,000
Herding cattle.

1783
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:37,470
New cowboys...

1784
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,739
often use drones and ATVs...

1785
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,350
to herd the cattle.

1786
01:10:42,449 --> 01:10:45,350
But Quatro sticks
to the traditional way...

1787
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:48,220
because the exhaust and sound can...

1788
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,090
- stress out the cows.
- I can see that.

1789
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:51,949
So, he wants to minimize the stress.

1790
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:55,689
We're going to form a half-moon formation.

1791
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:58,789
There's a road going uphill.

1792
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:00,329
- Okay.
- We have to gather...

1793
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:03,069
- the cows up the hill.
- Okay.

1794
01:11:03,069 --> 01:11:04,699
We're going in a half-moon shape.

1795
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:07,640
The land was so large
that they had a lot of work to do.

1796
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,670
You cowboys ready?

1797
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:10,310
Yes.

1798
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,739
- Yes.
- We're going to fan out.

1799
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:16,250
- Eddie is going to take the left wing.
- Okay.

1800
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,250
That's the left wing.

1801
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,119
Quatro and Pani are going to take
the right wing.

1802
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:20,119
Okay.

1803
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:22,289
- You and I are going this way.
- Okay.

1804
01:11:22,819 --> 01:11:24,149
- You and I are taking the middle.
- Okay.

1805
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:26,220
- So, that's left, middle, and right wing.
- Right.

1806
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,829
The cowboys need to work as a team.

1807
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:34,529
(While appreciating the view
that makes their jaws drop...)

1808
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:38,600
When these cows see us,
they're going to go...

1809
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,100
And they will come to pretty much
where we are going.

1810
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,140
(The cowboys start spreading in pairs.)

1811
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,039
What do you think of the land?
Do you like it?

1812
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:46,640
- It's so beautiful and large.
- It's nice and different, right?

1813
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,380
It's different.

1814
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:51,850
I mean,
anything could happen in the world.

1815
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,550
- If you're here, you can just survive.
- Yes, right.

1816
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:58,350
That's a good thing
about being raised here.

1817
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:01,020
I mean, of course, it makes you
feel convenient to go to stores.

1818
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:04,430
But we have cattle to make meat
for our own beef and stuff like that.

1819
01:12:04,829 --> 01:12:06,359
- It makes a little bit easier.
- Yes.

1820
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,630
Totally. It's homegrown.

1821
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,029
"Homegrown." That means cowboys.

1822
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,340
Oh, nice.

1823
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,539
Oh, there are really cows over there.

1824
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,539
(Fascinated)

1825
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:18,270
(Cows are all over the land.)

1826
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,340
There are so many of them.

1827
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,010
There you go. Perfect.

1828
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:23,149
(He searches for the target like a hawk.)

1829
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,479
- He's going for it too.
- I guess...

1830
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:27,880
- Teo was truly skilled in riding.
- He looks very competent.

1831
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,119
(Mommy!)

1832
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:31,319
That's cool!

1833
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:33,659
Gosh. Slowly!

1834
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:37,430
(Whoa84 is also running after Teo.)

1835
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,899
Hey, stop!

1836
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,060
Let's go!

1837
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,770
- Oh, they're really...
- Yes. That's it.

1838
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,300
Perfect.

1839
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,369
(Teo pushes the cattle from the center.)

1840
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:50,369
Each is taking their role very well.

1841
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:52,539
(Giddy up!)

1842
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:53,939
(Nice!)

1843
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,409
Oh, the cattle are driven by the horses.

1844
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,819
(So that's how it goes.)

1845
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:03,420
They look cool. Oh, what was that?

1846
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,119
- It was like an advertisement scene.
- That was really cool.

1847
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:07,989
(Forget the hat. Let's go!)

1848
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:10,430
- Gosh!
- What's that?

1849
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:11,890
- What's that?
- Oh, my.

1850
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,630
(He overwhelms the cattle
with his shouting.)

1851
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:16,930
(Giddy up!)

1852
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,630
- Let's go!
- Yes, you cowboy!

1853
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:19,840
Yes, I'm a cowboy!

1854
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,899
(Yes, cowboy!)

1855
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,539
It was one of the most fabulous works
I haven't seen before.

1856
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:28,079
Come on this side, a little bit wider,
so we can push them that way.

1857
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:30,810
(Teo blocks the backside.)

1858
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:34,850
(Hey, boys. Stop!)

1859
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,149
(He quickly takes the cow
that was out of the line.)

1860
01:13:37,149 --> 01:13:38,289
He literally dashed into it.

1861
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,789
(Finally, the cattle are together.)

1862
01:13:41,789 --> 01:13:44,390
- Go.
- Let's go!

1863
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:47,630
(The last cows also move to the hill.)

1864
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,270
(Gathering)

1865
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:52,170
Are they going back to the pen?

1866
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:53,270
- Yes, right.
- Perfect.

1867
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,970
We got them down there.
They're going in the right direction now.

1868
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:58,510
- Yes.
- So, let them just go.

1869
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:00,680
- Stay in the line.
- Stay in the line.

1870
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,310
- Stay in the line.
- They should stay in our own line.

1871
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:03,880
- These are...
- Pani.

1872
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:07,079
- Are you confident enough?
- He's testing his horse.

1873
01:14:07,449 --> 01:14:08,579
All right.

1874
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,989
You need to keep him.
Slow him down. Slow down.

1875
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:13,020
- Did he fall off?
- No!

1876
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,960
- I feel uneasy.
- What's going on?

1877
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,989
- What was it?
- You're okay.

1878
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,029
- Darn.
- You're okay.

1879
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:21,329
- Stand up.
- He started dashing.

1880
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,130
- He scared me.
- You're fine.

1881
01:14:25,329 --> 01:14:28,170
- Darn.
- It's okay. You just lost your balance.

1882
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:30,640
- Gosh. It's not that easy.
- Get on it.

1883
01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:32,140
- Just follow me.
- Okay.

1884
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,010
Take it easy, boy. Let's go slowly.

1885
01:14:35,909 --> 01:14:37,850
I was poor at handling the horse.

1886
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:40,750
- Where is he, by the way?
- He's so fashionable.

1887
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:41,850
Your glasses look too fancy.

1888
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,090
It seems like he was sightseeing.

1889
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:45,420
- It's like...
- He suddenly looks so fashionable.

1890
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,890
It's like he's interviewing
on someone else's car.

1891
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,060
- That's so cool.
- It's too fancy.

1892
01:14:48,189 --> 01:14:50,060
(I don't like normal.)

1893
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,189
I was poor at handling the horse.

1894
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,630
I felt like the horse didn't get...

1895
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,199
what I wanted him to do.

1896
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,239
I was fine. Nothing bad happened.

1897
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,939
That was my first fall off from a horse.

1898
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:03,270
Is it called a horse dealer?

1899
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:05,609
- A fall from a horse!
- He said a "horsedealer."

1900
01:15:05,609 --> 01:15:08,079
Oh, yes.
What I said means something different.

1901
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,750
- He got suddenly excited.
- No way!

1902
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,220
- It started crying and...
- I'm fine!

1903
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,680
- I'm okay. I'm fine.
- Why? You fell off?

1904
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,750
(Hee-hawing)

1905
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:18,850
You're a true cowboy now.

1906
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:20,289
- You fell off?
- Yes, I did.

1907
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,329
They seemed to like it
after hearing I fell off from a horse.

1908
01:15:23,329 --> 01:15:25,960
- I've heard it could be a hazing to them.
- I see that.

1909
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,060
As they liked it too much,

1910
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,829
I felt like I should fall off too.

1911
01:15:29,369 --> 01:15:31,770
- Actually, I was also envious.
- I felt they didn't give me the title.

1912
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,739
(The falling-off cowboy)

1913
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:39,180
(He makes Pani Bottle comfortable
with a high five.)

1914
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:42,479
- He almost got hung up on the side.
- Are you okay?

1915
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:43,649
I'm totally fine.

1916
01:15:43,649 --> 01:15:44,880
- Are you okay?
- Yes, sure.

1917
01:15:44,949 --> 01:15:46,720
- Goodness.
- He landed on the sand.

1918
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,020
He was in slow motion when he went down.

1919
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:51,850
Oh, yes. That's fun, man.
That's what a cowboy is.

1920
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:54,520
I think falling off once
is important to them.

1921
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,590
- You bought some land, Pani Bottle?
- Sorry?

1922
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:59,399
- You bought some land where you fell off?
- Yes.

1923
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:01,329
- It's your land now.
- Okay.

1924
01:16:01,329 --> 01:16:04,369
- When you fall off from a horse,
- Yes?

1925
01:16:04,369 --> 01:16:07,069
- it means you bought the land.
- I see.

1926
01:16:07,069 --> 01:16:09,739
- Their jokes are funny.
- Their culture is quite interesting.

1927
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:13,109
- We say hey!
- Hey!

1928
01:16:13,109 --> 01:16:14,409
(Let's do it together. Hey!)

1929
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:17,750
- Say it to the cattle.
- Hey, you son of...

1930
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:20,449
- You can do it?
- Can you do it?

1931
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,989
- Hey!
- Hey, look ahead. It's your mama.

1932
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:26,189
We have been told to scare them
so they can go back.

1933
01:16:26,189 --> 01:16:27,659
- That's it.
- Oh, so it's about vigor?

1934
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:29,789
- They don't move if blocked.
- We had a staring contest, so to speak.

1935
01:16:29,789 --> 01:16:32,289
- Hey!
- Hey, move!

1936
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:34,329
- The calf is so cute.
- All right!

1937
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:35,630
Here we go. Let me close the gate.

1938
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:37,600
- Let's go!
- Take them over there.

1939
01:16:38,069 --> 01:16:40,300
Don't go. Come back around here.

1940
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,369
- You got more room.
- Okay.

1941
01:16:41,369 --> 01:16:42,739
They drove the cattle, finally.

1942
01:16:43,569 --> 01:16:45,770
I think
the cowboys value their tradition...

1943
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:48,479
and do what they've done...

1944
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:49,880
for a long time.

1945
01:16:50,109 --> 01:16:52,010
Taking care of their cattle...

1946
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:55,180
and riding the horses on the ground.

1947
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:57,890
It's kind of romantic,

1948
01:16:58,449 --> 01:16:59,859
and I'd call them romantic ranchers.

1949
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:04,229
- Once we drive them inside the fence,
- Okay!

1950
01:17:04,229 --> 01:17:05,899
- the work is done.
- That's how it works.

1951
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:08,159
- Teo, we're going to work now.
- All right.

1952
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,130
JP and Eddie,
and maybe one of your guys...

1953
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:13,000
will lead the horseback.
We'll have to bring...

1954
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,939
a little bit out of time, to right there.

1955
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:18,539
- Okay. I see.
- They'll sort the babies of the mom.

1956
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,210
- They need to take preventive measures.
- That's right.

1957
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,979
They check the cattle are healthy.

1958
01:17:22,609 --> 01:17:23,609
(Oh, my)

1959
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:24,649
It sounds difficult.

1960
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:25,850
You mean with the horse?

1961
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,420
How can we do that?

1962
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,920
So, I will open up my horse,
and I will let it look.

1963
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:33,289
(If the calf comes...)

1964
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:34,720
(My goodness!)

1965
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,590
- If the calf comes...
- Oh, my.

1966
01:17:36,789 --> 01:17:37,789
Just like that.

1967
01:17:37,789 --> 01:17:39,060
(He blocks the way.)

1968
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,659
- The horse moves sideways.
- Yes.

1969
01:17:41,659 --> 01:17:43,300
He moves sideways like a crab.

1970
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,699
Can you do that?

1971
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:45,869
(In awe)

1972
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:49,569
(When the talented cowboy
drives them to the gate,)

1973
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,770
(JP cuts the entrance.)

1974
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:56,250
It's like
the horse became his best friend.

1975
01:17:56,850 --> 01:17:57,949
Back off a little bit.

1976
01:17:57,949 --> 01:17:59,920
(Once the calves' moms are separated
from the group...)

1977
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,920
Circle around these calves
and push them in there.

1978
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,319
- Go ahead.
- Hey!

1979
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,520
- Hey.
- Perfect.

1980
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,159
- Hey, baby!
- Go!

1981
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:13,130
- Hey, little one!
- Go!

1982
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,829
- Go in!
- Hey!

1983
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:18,170
- Go in!
- Hey!

1984
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:19,500
(Suddenly, a bully appears.)

1985
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,270
That's how we could lead them.

1986
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,039
- To inside.
- Oh, because they are scared?

1987
01:18:23,569 --> 01:18:24,670
- Go in!
- Let's go!

1988
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:26,510
(Pani Bottle and Kian84 lead
the direction.)

1989
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,710
- I told you to go inside!
- Go!

1990
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,250
(Teo blocks the way.)

1991
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,949
Come to this room!

1992
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:33,180
- Boys!
- Hey!

1993
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,779
- Come on, baby!
- Come back home!

1994
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:37,590
- Now let's go and get this one.
- Okay.

1995
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:39,420
(He does it without the help of JP.)

1996
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,520
Here we go.

1997
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:42,930
(He blocks one in a second.)

1998
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:45,789
- He moved even backward.
- He's truly skilled.

1999
01:18:45,789 --> 01:18:48,029
- He's good at it.
- He's so cool.

2000
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:49,699
It looks like you are a real cowboy here.

2001
01:18:49,699 --> 01:18:51,069
(Amazed)

2002
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:52,199
He might have lived here for long.

2003
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,039
(Anyone can tell he's the cowboy here.)

2004
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,609
Teo is surely cool, but we...

2005
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:00,210
- That's what I thought too.
- With this plastic paddle...

2006
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:01,909
(That plastic paddle...)

2007
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:04,909
The cowboys already knew
who could handle things better.

2008
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,220
- He's...
- We're demoted.

2009
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,789
already promoted.

2010
01:19:10,989 --> 01:19:12,989
(Charismatic)

2011
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:14,819
It looks like he found...

2012
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:16,329
a new path in his life.

2013
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:21,000
Teo was already absorbed in it...

2014
01:19:21,729 --> 01:19:24,770
and found his true passion.

2015
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,800
I really liked those moments.

2016
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,840
We worked as a team...

2017
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:33,939
and had no rivalry or something.

2018
01:19:33,939 --> 01:19:35,909
We were literally a family.

2019
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:40,619
It was so fun, and I even felt like
I was doing this job in my previous life.

2020
01:19:40,619 --> 01:19:41,979
It was amazing.

2021
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:43,720
I truly appreciate those moments.

2022
01:19:44,689 --> 01:19:46,689
Teo, have you done this work before?

2023
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,460
- It's my first time.
- That's pretty good.

2024
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,789
- You're good at this.
- Thank you. I try to get the feel of it.

2025
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:53,829
That's what we love it, man.

2026
01:19:53,829 --> 01:19:56,470
(While Teo is becoming a true cowboy...)

2027
01:19:58,869 --> 01:20:00,970
Why are they gathered like this again?

2028
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,810
Just relax! It's all okay!

2029
01:20:07,409 --> 01:20:08,939
Relax.

2030
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:12,750
(He also has a dog and a cat.)

2031
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,819
(Bringing back memories)

2032
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:17,319
Hey, what do you think of being happy?

2033
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:18,489
(To make his pets happy...)

2034
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:22,319
My skin once tore up and bled
because my dog licked me so much.

2035
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:23,390
After that, I let it lick my tongue...

2036
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:26,130
since the tongue doesn't go dry
and tear up.

2037
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:29,829
Kian84 always empathizes with animals.

2038
01:20:29,899 --> 01:20:32,270
They looked okay when set free,

2039
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:35,670
but I could see them stressed out
when crowded.

2040
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:38,869
But we had to do the work...

2041
01:20:38,869 --> 01:20:41,140
- That's right.
- to prevent the cows from getting ill.

2042
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:45,250
(Beside Sweet84,)

2043
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,520
(is he choking up too?)

2044
01:20:49,689 --> 01:20:52,449
I shouldn't be like this, but seeing them,
I feel like having a steak.

2045
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,189
- How come?
- Really?

2046
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:56,930
I feel so hungry.

2047
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:58,260
I came here without eating anything.

2048
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,800
- He worked hard. That's understandable.
- Right.

2049
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:03,470
I say I pity them, but I eat beef too.

2050
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:06,300
- It's all right!
- They're timid.

2051
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,300
(Leaving their various emotions behind)

2052
01:21:07,539 --> 01:21:08,640
I'll do it for you first.

2053
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,039
- Yes, you first.
- You just come like this,

2054
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:11,510
- you look at the cow,
- Demonstration.

2055
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:12,880
(Spraying parasiticide!)

2056
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,079
That's it. One time.

2057
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:15,310
- Okay, just one time.
- One time. One more.

2058
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:17,210
It's not an injection.
You can just spray it.

2059
01:21:17,949 --> 01:21:20,079
There you go. There it is. Yes.

2060
01:21:20,079 --> 01:21:21,149
It must be refreshing.

2061
01:21:21,649 --> 01:21:23,550
Don't be surprised.

2062
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:24,819
You're big, so a bit more.

2063
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,189
- Spray it...
- What's this? Gosh.

2064
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:29,560
Spraying it surprises them
that they hit their heads.

2065
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,329
Calm down. I'm sorry.

2066
01:21:32,899 --> 01:21:34,600
- Sorry, everyone.
- Calm down, man.

2067
01:21:34,699 --> 01:21:35,930
There you go, buddy.

2068
01:21:36,369 --> 01:21:38,369
- Calm down.
- Work.

2069
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:40,369
- Let's go.
- This one got two scoops.

2070
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:41,600
- What?
- This one got two.

2071
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,770
I wanted to spray some more for it.

2072
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:44,739
Hey, you...

2073
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:46,479
Watch your back, guys.

2074
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:48,079
(Hit by the door)

2075
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:50,010
Goodness, buddies.

2076
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,279
It hit its head.

2077
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:55,050
- Is it going to be fine? It must hurt.
- Goodness.

2078
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:56,250
(The scene can make him cry.)

2079
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,949
Lots of them got hurt. They were wounded.

2080
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:02,289
- He has a tender heart.
- That's true.

2081
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:05,130
I'm extremely inconsistent.

2082
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:08,430
I find cows and their eyes so beautiful.

2083
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,170
That's what I think,
and right after thinking that,

2084
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:13,270
I find myself enjoying beef.

2085
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:17,510
Whenever I see them,
I have mixed feelings...

2086
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:18,939
like that.

2087
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:20,939
I can understand how Kian84 feels,

2088
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:23,909
but the cowboy life needs to continue.

2089
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:25,550
- Sure.
- The most important thing is...

2090
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:27,979
- that their families live on that.
- Goodness.

2091
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:29,890
- It's their means of living.
- Their lives depend on it.

2092
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:35,619
Hey, the horse I rode here
looks very happy to meet its friends.

2093
01:22:36,829 --> 01:22:40,630
(Goodbye, everyone)

2094
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,430
- She's happy.
- Are they playing?

2095
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:43,430
Yes, they're playing.

2096
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,899
As a new horse, it may say,
"Who are these horses?"

2097
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:47,470
It's happy.

2098
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:48,470
(Don't worry, Sweet84.)

2099
01:22:48,869 --> 01:22:50,069
- Okay. Finished.
- Okay.

2100
01:22:50,069 --> 01:22:51,970
(Hygienic management
for the last cow is completed.)

2101
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:53,340
- This is the last one.
- The last one.

2102
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,710
(Satisfied)

2103
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:59,210
I think cleaning up cow dung
or helping out with chores would suit me.

2104
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,680
Teo was working hard,
and what we did was, in fact...

2105
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:04,590
- You thought it was a small work?
- I wondered if there were other chores.

2106
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:05,590
(Kian84 was sorry feeling
only Teo was going through a lot.)

2107
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,189
I like to do chores.

2108
01:23:08,289 --> 01:23:09,689
Now we're going to do the fun part.

2109
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,960
(Chore84 was looking for some hard work.)

2110
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,970
This water... How come it's so green?

2111
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:21,939
It's like a well spotted around the ranch
so that cows can drink water.

2112
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:23,939
Do we have to drain the water
and clean it?

2113
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:27,109
(However, even at a glance,)

2114
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,609
Right. It's dirty.

2115
01:23:29,609 --> 01:23:31,250
(the water tank looks like
it hasn't been clean for quite a while.)

2116
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:32,909
I got to go.

2117
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,989
(Removing water plants!)

2118
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,020
- Shall I take out this?
- "Take out this."

2119
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:40,020
"Take out this."

2120
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,189
Yes, this is my style!

2121
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,689
The chore cowboy.

2122
01:23:43,689 --> 01:23:44,829
(The chore cowboy is ready to go.)

2123
01:23:44,829 --> 01:23:45,859
This kind of work suits me.

2124
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:48,760
As expected. Kian84 is good at cleaning
once he decides to do it.

2125
01:23:52,369 --> 01:23:53,369
(Sniffing)

2126
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,600
I thought he was eating it. I was stunned.

2127
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:58,340
The plants grew so much.

2128
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,380
- It was mossy.
- Not good smell!

2129
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:02,539
(Astonished)

2130
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:08,149
And at the bottom, the water feels warm,
and it's unpleasant.

2131
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,189
Are they pooping inside this?

2132
01:24:11,789 --> 01:24:12,819
(Screaming)

2133
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:13,960
Are they pooping inside this?

2134
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,460
(A huge amount)

2135
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:20,800
(I can't do this with bare hands.)

2136
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:22,159
I like a shovel.

2137
01:24:24,199 --> 01:24:25,270
"I like a shovel."

2138
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:26,270
(He became a shoveling cowboy.)

2139
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,800
Gosh, this is a big one.

2140
01:24:28,069 --> 01:24:29,069
That's insane.

2141
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:33,739
I will scrape here...

2142
01:24:33,739 --> 01:24:35,279
(Scraping the bottom)

2143
01:24:36,609 --> 01:24:37,609
It's like outer leaves.

2144
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:41,920
My goodness.

2145
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,020
(Thrilled)

2146
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,489
Its color looks similar
to the horse dung we saw earlier.

2147
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,489
But if you look at this plant...

2148
01:24:50,029 --> 01:24:51,090
(Sniffing)

2149
01:24:51,489 --> 01:24:52,960
Aren't you going to taste this one?

2150
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,159
- Aren't you tasting it?
- You eat it.

2151
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,000
- I couldn't eat that one.
- Why would you eat it?

2152
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:01,399
(Even Kian84 gave up eating
the water plant.)

2153
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,640
Is he eating it? Gosh.

2154
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:06,779
(Eating?)

2155
01:25:07,539 --> 01:25:09,640
- Why?
- Come on.

2156
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,210
- Just a bit.
- There you go.

2157
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,819
I'm sure it's cleaner
than the Ganges River.

2158
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:15,649
(Pani Bottle is getting worse
than Kian84.)

2159
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,319
What's this?

2160
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:19,090
(And their next task is...)

2161
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,819
(scooping out water using a bucket.)

2162
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:23,489
Scoop the water using this? Okay.

2163
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:25,689
- In 1, 2...
- Gosh.

2164
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:29,229
(Pouring out)

2165
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:30,699
Darn it.

2166
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:34,340
- It must feel refreshing.
- Let's see.

2167
01:25:34,899 --> 01:25:35,970
I need something to step on.

2168
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:39,739
(Screaming)

2169
01:25:40,109 --> 01:25:41,180
Splash!

2170
01:25:42,739 --> 01:25:44,850
It's on his shoes.
It must feel uncomfortable.

2171
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:46,750
Chores are the toughest job to do.

2172
01:25:47,079 --> 01:25:50,390
I didn't have to taste it.
Water gets in my mouth doing this work.

2173
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:52,189
(Working hard as they share
the drinking water with cows)

2174
01:25:52,989 --> 01:25:54,319
Wait. What shall we do with the frogs?

2175
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:56,319
Frogs are crawling out there.

2176
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:58,460
They're surprised.

2177
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:00,699
- It's now...
- How come it's so big?

2178
01:26:00,699 --> 01:26:02,800
- It's a disaster movie for them.
- They're surprised.

2179
01:26:03,529 --> 01:26:04,529
The frogs are surprised.

2180
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:06,329
Their home is being broken.

2181
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,369
It's a frog in a well.

2182
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:12,670
(Stop it now!)

2183
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:13,680
It's cute.

2184
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,310
The frogs are astonished.

2185
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,909
One escaped.

2186
01:26:19,979 --> 01:26:21,520
(Bring my home back!)

2187
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,520
It's so big.

2188
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,350
(Pani Bottle scoops out water
without mercy.)

2189
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:30,829
It will dry up and die somewhere else.
It'd be better to stay here.

2190
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:33,659
(Kian84 is sensitive.)

2191
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:35,729
For animals, Kian84 is...

2192
01:26:35,729 --> 01:26:37,229
There's a big one over there.

2193
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:43,210
(He ran away, and he isn't coming back.)

2194
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:45,510
(Honey, please forgive me.)

2195
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:48,479
- Goodness.
- Oh, my. That's heartbreaking.

2196
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:51,380
(He wrote a webtoon episode
while scooping water out.)

2197
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:54,550
Here's one.

2198
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:56,750
I will keep it safe.

2199
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:01,520
(The frog is taking refugee
until the cleaning is over.)

2200
01:27:03,159 --> 01:27:05,560
Okay. I got you. Relax.

2201
01:27:08,329 --> 01:27:09,329
(Cute frog)

2202
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:10,729
- That's so big.
- It's big.

2203
01:27:11,329 --> 01:27:13,199
(Patting)

2204
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:15,699
(Laughing)

2205
01:27:15,699 --> 01:27:16,770
Is he going to eat it?

2206
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,770
It's cute!

2207
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:22,340
All right.

2208
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,750
(Humoring it, not eating it)

2209
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:25,909
The big cleanup surprised the frogs.

2210
01:27:25,909 --> 01:27:27,979
(We'll bring you a new home soon.
Don't be surprised, frog.)

2211
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:31,689
(He keeps patting it and...)

2212
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,060
(Kissing)

2213
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:36,529
(The frog is puzzled.)

2214
01:27:36,529 --> 01:27:37,529
It's cute, right?

2215
01:27:37,859 --> 01:27:43,300
The frog turns into a prince
after being kissed, doesn't it?

2216
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:46,029
It becomes a prince after being kissed.

2217
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,899
- It turns into a human.
- The frog becomes a prince.

2218
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,409
I guess this one
is not from a royal family.

2219
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:51,970
- Did you kiss it?
- Yes.

2220
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:54,539
A woman should kiss it.

2221
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:55,579
- A woman?
- Yes.

2222
01:27:57,649 --> 01:27:58,710
Wouldn't it work if a man kissed it?

2223
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:00,149
In today's work, it can work.

2224
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:02,949
Did you think it would turn into Nicole
if you kissed it?

2225
01:28:04,819 --> 01:28:06,319
- Come on.
- No, I didn't.

2226
01:28:07,319 --> 01:28:08,819
I'll put it back in the tank
after we fill the water.

2227
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:09,890
(The frog stays in the bucket
for a moment.)

2228
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:14,760
I guess this is enough.

2229
01:28:14,899 --> 01:28:15,930
- All right.
- Okay.

2230
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:18,000
- Shall I turn on the water?
- Yes.

2231
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,800
- Good job. You worked so much.
- Yes.

2232
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,270
(Is the frog doing all right?)

2233
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:24,670
Gosh, it ran away.

2234
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:27,779
- Where is it?
- Put it back here.

2235
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:30,279
You'll die if you go outside!

2236
01:28:31,449 --> 01:28:33,050
- It's here.
- We need to find it.

2237
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:34,819
Catch it!

2238
01:28:37,649 --> 01:28:38,890
All right.

2239
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:39,890
(Fortunately, it was caught right away.)

2240
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,119
Relax.

2241
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,189
I want it to look at the sky
now that it's outside.

2242
01:28:46,189 --> 01:28:47,460
It's been a frog in a well.

2243
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:50,369
- Oh, my.
- He's so sweet.

2244
01:28:50,369 --> 01:28:51,399
My goodness.

2245
01:28:52,069 --> 01:28:54,170
(Going on the airplane)

2246
01:28:54,699 --> 01:28:57,869
("World Adventure by Escape")

2247
01:28:58,869 --> 01:29:00,140
"The world is so big."

2248
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:02,279
You're carrying a frog like it's a GoPro.

2249
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:03,579
It needs to see the big world.

2250
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:05,250
Its heart is beating now.

2251
01:29:05,649 --> 01:29:07,180
(Excited?)

2252
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:08,420
You might kill it.

2253
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,850
- Stop torturing it.
- He's so sweet.

2254
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:12,619
He's taking it aboard a plane.

2255
01:29:12,619 --> 01:29:13,689
"You'd better kill me."

2256
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:15,960
From the frog's perspective,
it'd say, "Just kill me."

2257
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:19,130
You're coming back home. Here you go.

2258
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:20,229
(Safely coming back to the clean home)

2259
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:23,470
Okay.

2260
01:29:23,869 --> 01:29:25,630
Pani Bottle, you have such a warm heart.

2261
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:26,670
It went home safely.

2262
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:27,869
Good job.

2263
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:30,739
(At that time, the real cowboy is...)

2264
01:29:30,739 --> 01:29:32,210
He looks like he's filming a movie.

2265
01:29:32,869 --> 01:29:35,710
(The next task is calling me!)

2266
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:38,250
So all he's going to do is this.
They will wrap the back feet.

2267
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,279
What that does is that
it stops it from running.

2268
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:42,119
(Quatro trusts Teo
and assigns a harder work.)

2269
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,520
Come in.

2270
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,390
Eddie, you're going to help it.

2271
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,590
I don't want to break my darn leg.

2272
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,229
It's a task that makes everyone nervous.

2273
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:54,529
- I could feel it.
- It was a tough task.

2274
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:56,100
(The cowboys suddenly get nervous.)

2275
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,000
Close the gate. Give me the gate.
You all go ahead.

2276
01:29:59,529 --> 01:30:00,539
Watch your back!

2277
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:01,539
- Watch your back!
- Is he okay?

2278
01:30:01,699 --> 01:30:02,869
- Watch out!
- Look back!

2279
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,939
(The newbie cowboys face...)

2280
01:30:06,539 --> 01:30:09,140
(the rough backstage of a ranch?)

2281
01:30:09,909 --> 01:30:13,050
(The brothers are mired in confusion.)

2282
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:15,220
(Shouting)

2283
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:17,489
(My leg!)

2284
01:30:17,789 --> 01:30:21,560
(Can they be born again as real cowboys?)

2285
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,760
It'll be over soon.

2286
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,329
(The ranch's tough life
crushes the newcomers.)

2287
01:30:24,329 --> 01:30:25,329
What a shocker.

2288
01:30:25,729 --> 01:30:28,729
(A new mentor to save them appears?)

2289
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:30,600
(It's me.)

2290
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:32,630
(Little cowboys)

2291
01:30:33,399 --> 01:30:35,199
(Holding ropes instead of toys)

2292
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,409
(Flicking whips since birth)

2293
01:30:38,109 --> 01:30:39,170
(Get up, everyone!)

2294
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:40,239
(Sir?)

2295
01:30:40,279 --> 01:30:41,979
(Professionals are not tired!)

2296
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,250
(Thrown into the real deal right away)

2297
01:30:44,949 --> 01:30:46,010
(But...)

2298
01:30:47,979 --> 01:30:49,050
(Screaming)

2299
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,850
(The messy disciples...)

2300
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,560
(have a long way to go
for their cowboy lives.)

2301
01:30:53,859 --> 01:30:55,090
(I'm not a professional.)

2302
01:30:55,489 --> 01:30:56,520
I'm sad.

2303
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,529
(Dear deity,
why are you making us suffer?)

2304
01:30:59,989 --> 01:31:04,199
(A special disciple
makes the frustrated mentor smile.)

2305
01:31:04,869 --> 01:31:06,500
(It's me.)

2306
01:31:06,899 --> 01:31:08,770
(It's you, my successor!)

2307
01:31:09,569 --> 01:31:12,369
(The discovery of the only hope
moves him to tears.)

2308
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,840
(I did it!)

2309
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:19,649
(The hot summer of Texas)

2310
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,550
(For the cowboy mentor)

2311
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:24,949
(The bunch of disciples' harmony)

2312
01:31:25,619 --> 01:31:28,460
(Music Adventure by Accident's
second song will be revealed.)

2313
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:32,130
(Music Adventure by Accident)
