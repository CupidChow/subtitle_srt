1
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,110
You're now setting off for rock.

2
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:26,809
Do you know anything about heavy metal?

3
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:28,950
Not really.

4
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:32,850
What I know is more of rock and roll.

5
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,649
- I mainly listened to 80s and 90s rock,
- Okay.

6
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:38,359
so Guns N' Roses and Aerosmith.

7
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,990
They are legends.

8
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:42,330
Aren't they too...

9
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,330
You've got dust on you.

10
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,300
(Wiping his nose)

11
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,030
I listened to them.

12
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,300
Influenced by my friend,
I listened to intense music,

13
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,970
- like Korn.
- Korn.

14
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,970
(Nu metal band Korn)

15
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,339
- "Blind."
- You know some songs.

16
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:55,839
Of course. I was in the band club.

17
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,440
- And them, too.
- I listened to Nirvana.

18
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,409
But Nirvana's genre...

19
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:01,949
is alternative rock.

20
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:03,709
Isn't it different from heavy metal?

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
It is.

22
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:08,349
I've never been to a heavy metal concert.

23
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:10,250
Heavy metal.

24
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,959
This will be my first heavy metal.

25
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:13,159
Metal.

26
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,159
Hold on. Is this the place?

27
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:16,659
- Is it?
- What?

28
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:19,430
- We're here.
- Is it a restaurant?

29
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,430
It's this place.

30
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,729
- Isn't that a restaurant?
- Is it inside?

31
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,769
- This is the place.
- A heavy metal concert in such a place?

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,940
This is the place.

33
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,610
It's the place the music shop recommended.

34
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,640
(The heavy metal concert poster
recommended by the music shop)

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
Isn't it a bar?

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,840
I wasn't sure, either.

37
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,940
- Maybe we need to go in.
- Is it inside?

38
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,280
We're going to sit down over there.
Okay. Thank you.

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,349
Are you going to drink a pint of beer?

40
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:38,349
- Yes, sir.
- Is that okay?

41
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:39,780
- I'll bring you water.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,789
Let's drink something first.

43
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,759
I'm going to get this one. "Tecate."

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,860
- "Tecate?"
- "Tecate."

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,730
"Mexican lager."

46
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,060
- Yes.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,959
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

48
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:57,399
(Squeezing in a lime)

49
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,500
(Then it goes into his mouth.)

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,369
It's sour, right?

51
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,110
(Frowning)

52
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,409
It's waking me up.

53
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,280
I can hear music from the back.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,349
You can hear something.

55
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,720
Do they play the guitar in the restaurant?

56
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,890
The concert must be in the back.

57
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,519
- Shall we go, Teo?
- Shall we?

58
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,519
Yes.

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,929
I don't know what to expect.

60
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,300
Is the chef playing the guitar?

61
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:26,800
- Is it here?
- Here?

62
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,500
- The sound of drums.
- That's amazing.

63
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,769
Is this...

64
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,709
(Without realizing it,
they enter the unknown place.)

65
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,779
Just look at the sight.

66
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,850
- Wait.
- That's so cool.

67
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,719
(In the restaurant's corner...)

68
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,519
(is a highly stimulating
heavy metal concert.)

69
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,320
- That's real heavy metal.
- Yes.

70
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,660
(Confused)

71
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,130
(Having fun)

72
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,130
You guys have to shake your head!

73
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,499
- Goodness.
- Here, too?

74
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:03,130
(Headbanging like mad)

75
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:07,339
I thought the genre had disappeared,
but it existed.

76
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:08,640
There are many die-hard fans.

77
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,279
(An explosion of growling)

78
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,809
It sounds like a plane taking off.

79
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,709
They must be a death metal band.

80
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,920
(Death metal?)

81
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:21,749
"Heavy metal. Rock and roll."

82
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:23,550
(A powerful beat
and everything played by the band itself)

83
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,260
(Death metal is rougher and more extreme
than heavy metal.)

84
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:29,230
It's a legendary concert.

85
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,230
(The flower of rock spirit, metal)

86
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,730
(And...)

87
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,999
That was the life I had dreamed of.

88
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:34,999
A rock star.

89
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,399
Goodness, isn't that a good life?

90
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:41,510
There's no better place to feel
your sense of worth than that.

91
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:43,439
(The guy who admired...)

92
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,439
(rock stars in the corner of his room...)

93
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,010
(is now screaming
in the birthplace of rock.)

94
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,510
You look like you have high self-esteem.

95
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,519
(In response,
the band explodes with rock spirit.)

96
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,350
Die! Destroy!

97
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,189
Worship me!

98
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,360
(Immersed)

99
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,559
(Charismatic)

100
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,830
(Cheering)

101
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:11,999
- How cool.
- You must've been hit with dopamine.

102
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,969
(Bemused)

103
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:15,969
He's stunned.

104
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:17,369
(Screaming)

105
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:20,140
(People are screaming
from here and there.)

106
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,149
How pure!

107
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:25,350
- It was pure.
- What was that?

108
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,450
- He surprised me.
- You're really pure.

109
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,950
- You actually said that out loud.
- Listen.

110
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,890
The people enjoying the culture...

111
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,559
looked very pure.

112
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:33,459
They screamed together...

113
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,860
and helped each other from getting hurt.

114
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,960
In the past, nobody cared about others.

115
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,329
- They pushed each other and went all out.
- Yes.

116
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,670
- How pure!
- You're the purest, Teo.

117
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,069
(Pure Boy)

118
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:49,270
So, in case you guys just came in
or you guys already know,

119
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,840
we are Solemn Vision.

120
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,309
- Solemn Vision.
- The band is called Solemn Vision.

121
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:54,309
(Cheering)

122
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,650
Formation time. Let's do it.

123
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,980
Listen. Let's go. Let's roll out.

124
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,020
All together?

125
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,420
Let's go.

126
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:05,189
Walk around that pillar.
Show me how you do it.

127
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:07,119
- They must be doing something.
- He's leading them.

128
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,259
(The audience walks around.)

129
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,530
Do they gather after circling around?

130
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,629
(The audience walks around)

131
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,569
- Is it slamming?
- Let's go.

132
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,699
(They keep walking around the pillar.)

133
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,809
Aren't they total strangers?

134
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:23,110
Slam?

135
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,879
(As if he's used to the culture)

136
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,220
- He jumped in?
- Kian84 did.

137
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:34,920
(Screaming)

138
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,189
(The promising rockstar enjoys slamming.)

139
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,389
(Slam)

140
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:42,689
(Those who enjoy it, run and slam.)

141
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:45,360
- It's war.
- That's how intense it is usually.

142
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,400
That's intense.

143
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,670
(Slam, enjoying rock with the whole body)

144
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,429
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

145
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,100
(I love slamming!)

146
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,610
He's being scary.

147
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,610
Watch out.

148
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:01,449
(He's fine even if someone pushes him.)

149
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,780
(Amazed)

150
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:06,220
(Screaming)

151
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,119
(The promising rockstar is in his zone.)

152
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,189
Put it down.

153
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,300
This place is perfect for Kian84.

154
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,329
(Screaming)

155
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,069
(Screaming)

156
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:28,470
(Rock and roll, baby!)

157
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,170
Not until I say, "Go."

158
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,309
(He looks refreshed.)

159
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:32,379
- You must feel refreshed.
- You ready?

160
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,739
- Yes.
- Not until I say, "Go."

161
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,309
- Make it more intense!
- Three, two, one, in.

162
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:37,980
- Please look out for that.
- More intense!

163
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,949
(Meanwhile, Teo is...)

164
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,949
(covering his ear.)

165
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:45,360
(Would you like to slam, too?)

166
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,290
(Confused)

167
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,360
He looks shocked.

168
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Go for it, Teo.

169
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:50,989
Go.

170
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,360
Be careful.

171
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,540
(Slamming)

172
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,340
That's it. That's what slamming is.

173
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,569
(Hastily)

174
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,739
Are you okay?

175
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:05,509
- Push!
- He's doing well.

176
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,280
He's back to where he was.

177
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:10,850
(Pause)

178
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,920
- He's confused.
- Teo returned to his spot.

179
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,550
(Get out of my way.)

180
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,389
(Banging his head
like he's venting his anger out)

181
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:28,170
Doing that must help you destress.

182
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,069
(Hey!)

183
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,939
- Hey!
- Hey!

184
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:34,139
- Hey!
- Hey!

185
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,309
Rock and roll.

186
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:41,780
(Getting in contact with somewhere
as if possessed)

187
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,050
Die.

188
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,020
I'm scared.

189
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,590
Simon Dominic, Jang Do Yeon,

190
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:51,590
- Lee Seung Hoon, Lee Si Eon,
- What?

191
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,520
- Hold on.
- and Pani Bottle, die!

192
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,189
Simon Dominic, Jang Do Yeon,

193
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:59,030
- Lee Seung Hoon, Lee Si Eon,
- Hold on.

194
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,730
and Pani Bottle, die!

195
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,730
- Why?
- Kian84.

196
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,069
- Wait.
- I'm keeping my manner.

197
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,840
In death metal,
you have to tell others to die.

198
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,569
- But we're enjoying the show.
- All people die one day.

199
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:12,639
Si Eon would be watching this at home.

200
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,179
- Kian84.
- He's told...

201
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,579
- to die all of a sudden.
- "Kian84."

202
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,220
- Go to the fiery pit!
- Why?

203
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,550
- Fiery pit?
- Why?

204
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,420
- Just why?
- Shouldn't someone stop him?

205
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:24,989
(Meanwhile,)

206
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:26,059
Okay.

207
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,119
(the concert is reaching the climax.)

208
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,530
(I'm passing by.)

209
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,770
(Teo is still trying to adjust.)

210
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,629
(Screaming)

211
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:39,499
Die!

212
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,569
He's scaring me.

213
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:42,970
(Devoting to the death metal's nature)

214
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,970
Stop him.

215
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:45,110
Die!

216
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,879
Die!

217
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:49,749
Isn't he possessed by a ghost?

218
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,949
Everything that gets in my way,

219
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:54,150
die!

220
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,849
(Wiping his nose)

221
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:01,959
(Cheering)

222
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,459
(In a daze)

223
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,800
I mean it when I say thank you so much!

224
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,800
- Thank you so much.
- He lost himself.

225
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:12,270
It was death metal, Teo.

226
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,170
I listened to it a lot
back in high school.

227
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,339
Most lyrics are like,

228
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,939
"I'll take out your guts
and use it like a jump rope."

229
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,349
"I'll bury you."

230
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:25,520
I wanted to respond to him,

231
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,949
but my ears were ringing.

232
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,620
Okay. This is an old one.

233
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,819
This song is called "A Perch for Demons."
Here you go.

234
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:33,859
(The title is "A Perch for Demons.")

235
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:39,199
(Slowly walking in)

236
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,199
"Slowly."

237
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,770
(He grabs the pillar as if possessed.)

238
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:49,640
(Connects with the evil penguin spirit)

239
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
He's using the pillar.

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,979
- The penguin is so random.
- "Penguin?"

241
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:56,880
Doesn't he feel dizzy?

242
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,920
Because nobody was joining him,
he enjoyed it by himself.

243
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,920
Oh, no.

244
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,760
It's like he's praying alone.

245
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,359
(Here it comes. Here it comes again!)

246
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:11,390
- What's wrong with him?
- Where did they find that?

247
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,660
"The second possession?"

248
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:15,170
(Screaming)

249
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,199
It'll make you lose weight.

250
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,240
(Shouting out all the evil things)

251
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,609
He's an exorcist.

252
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:23,910
(Screaming)

253
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,880
(Goodbye, penguin.)

254
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,910
(Dumbfounded)

255
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:32,079
You got your butt kicked today, right?

256
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,849
- What a show.
- Yes, right?

257
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,150
Goodness.

258
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:38,050
- Who didn't get to dress up their hair?
- Me.

259
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,819
- "Me?"
- Me.

260
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:40,859
Fan service.

261
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,229
- They're saying bye, Teo.
- What?

262
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:44,229
They're saying bye.

263
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,599
Thank you.

264
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Thank you.

265
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,929
- Yes. It was a good song.
- Thank you.

266
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:52,569
- Is this death metal?
- Yes.

267
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,069
- Death metal? Goodness.
- Nice to meet you.

268
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:57,170
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you so much for coming out.

269
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,839
He looks like a good-natured person
with the lights on.

270
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,250
Didn't you say
this was your first metal show ever?

271
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,609
Your guitar was fantastic.

272
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,120
- It was no joke.
- He looks sweet.

273
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:10,790
I saw you guys in the pit too.
I saw you running around.

274
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,790
(Laughing)

275
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,819
Did it feel good?

276
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,219
- You guys weren't scared?
- No.

277
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,189
I was a little scared.

278
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,160
- You had a good time, yes?
- Yes.

279
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,969
It was July 4,
so the usual people weren't here.

280
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,599
We usually have bigger crowds.

281
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,540
- What a bummer.
- That was really great.

282
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,469
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

283
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,410
- Let's go.
- It's a shame to leave.

284
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,140
Kian84.

285
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,449
I saw you bang your head for real.

286
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,179
- What?
- You bang your head for real.

287
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,449
I thought that was me keeping my manners.

288
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,859
We... How do I put it?

289
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:48,790
We keep our manners to our ancestors
on national holidays, right?

290
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,530
Becoming wicked is practicing
good manners in this place.

291
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:54,870
It was my first show, and I was shocked.

292
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,729
I observed, joined in,
and then observed again.

293
00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:01,069
Back in the old days, musicians...
I forgot the word.

294
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,209
- Stage diving.
- Right.

295
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:05,510
Fights broke out.

296
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,979
I heard that was accepted
as a part of the culture.

297
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,280
I'll listen to some death metal...

298
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,020
- before bed.
- Okay. Let's go.

299
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,250
- Korea should have a death metal band.
- You're right.

300
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,849
(Screaming)

301
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:19,490
You look like the evil possessed you.

302
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,520
(You look like the evil possessed you.)

303
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,630
I can't help but laugh.
Is it the aftereffect of death metal?

304
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,260
(Screaming)

305
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,229
You're still into death metal, aren't you?

306
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,040
(Full of the afterglow)

307
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,839
Rock feels like freedom and liberation.

308
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,079
But death metal is closer to destruction.

309
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,209
The once-popular death metal...

310
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,380
is still barely surviving in the US.

311
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,449
- I see.
- He's right.

312
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,750
It felt like the US version of
"In Search of Our Music."

313
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,319
- I thought it was gone.
- Tradition, right?

314
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,550
- It was so much fun, Teo.
- Yes, it was.

315
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,459
Body slamming.

316
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,530
(Death metal was fun!)

317
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,300
We can see fireworks.

318
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,569
I can hear it from afar.

319
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:07,400
Goodness.

320
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,939
You can't get bored in the US.

321
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:09,939
(They stumble upon fireworks.)

322
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:10,939
How pretty.

323
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,979
In the neighborhood? Go for it!

324
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:23,689
There's a rooftop party going on.

325
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,620
It's for the Independence Day.

326
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,719
(Independence Day
is celebrated everywhere.)

327
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,059
That was fun.

328
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,699
Hey!

329
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:36,000
- The Brooklyn night is very beautiful.
- Thank you!

330
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,740
Goodness.

331
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,170
I'm beat.

332
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:45,740
You sound like a local.

333
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,809
(Tailored to the country)

334
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:49,309
My ears are still ringing
from all that loud music.

335
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,819
My body...

336
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,719
- is burning with passion.
- I didn't know you'd love it.

337
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:57,219
(Blood pumping)

338
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:59,760
- You'll get a good sleep.
- Let's go to bed early after a shower.

339
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,829
We need to get up at 5:30 a.m. or 6 a.m.

340
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,559
(Last night)

341
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,559
(Pani Bottle?)

342
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:07,530
- Good morning.
- Finally!

343
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,130
- Where are you?
- I'm in Switzerland.

344
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:11,469
- "Switzerland?"
- Yes.

345
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:13,569
When are you coming to the US?

346
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,770
I'll arrive in Denver the day
after tomorrow. Shall we meet in Denver?

347
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,809
- "Denver?"
- "Denver?"

348
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,679
Do you know Denver in Colorado?

349
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,479
The Rocky Mountains are in Colorado.

350
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,620
Let's go to the Rocky Mountains...

351
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,120
and get musical inspiration
while we're in nature.

352
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,890
The vibe is totally different
from New York.

353
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,859
New York is a forest of buildings
while that place is an actual forest.

354
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:36,929
Yes.

355
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,030
(Mother Nature gave musical inspiration
to many singers.)

356
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,400
("Rocky Mountain High" by John Denver)

357
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,170
The singer John Denver loved Denver
to the point...

358
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,510
he named himself John Denver.

359
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,740
(Because he loved Denver.)

360
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,079
(About the nostalgia of Suffolk in the UK)

361
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,750
("Castle on the Hill" by Ed Sheeran)

362
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,120
(Rookie singer, Kian84 heads to
Denver to get some motivation.)

363
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
It looks amazing.

364
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,920
- John Denver, Ed Sheeran, Kian84.
- Kian84.

365
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,260
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

366
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,329
(I'm embarrassed.)

367
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,699
- I'll turn off the lights.
- Okay.

368
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:16,870
(For another musical journey,)

369
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,000
(good night, for tomorrow.)

370
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:32,020
It's 5:30 a.m.

371
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,979
(Let me get up.)

372
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,819
(He stretches his neck
as soon as he wakes up.)

373
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:40,559
- He shook his head too much yesterday.
- He was about to have a slipped disc.

374
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,959
My slipped disc...

375
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:43,630
got better after head banging.

376
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,660
- What?
- That's unexpected.

377
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,829
I felt better.

378
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,459
Maybe the disc got ruptured.

379
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,929
I should do it more often.

380
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,599
(Getting his clothes on)

381
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:55,740
(He changes to the same outfit
as yesterday.)

382
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:58,979
(He puts on Pani's drum too.)

383
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,479
(Looking around)

384
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:03,280
I took a good rest. Thank you.

385
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,010
(Bowing)

386
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,650
(After thanking
the comfortable accommodation,)

387
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,589
(they head to Denver to meet Pani.)

388
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,260
Going to Denver. Go!

389
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,329
- I'll call a taxi.
- Okay.

390
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,160
- We should wait there.
- My goodness.

391
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,059
Would I be able to come back?

392
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:21,059
(Would I be able to come back?)

393
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,069
To Brooklyn.

394
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,270
(Heading out with a heavy heart)

395
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,809
This car is nice.

396
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,209
It's nice.

397
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,579
Let's go!

398
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,179
Do you or your wife cook at home?

399
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,550
I'm in charge of the kitchen.

400
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,089
At home,

401
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:45,089
we make jamon sometimes.

402
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:46,620
The German dish?

403
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,959
- Jamon?
- For real?

404
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,429
- The German dish.
- Yes.

405
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,729
Drying a whole hind leg...

406
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,660
takes a long time because
the moisture takes a while to evaporate,

407
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:58,199
so I once tried drying it for 18 months.

408
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:00,400
If it's a pork neck,
a three-kilogram piece...

409
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,140
should develop a nice flavor
after drying for about three months.

410
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,109
Jerky isn't the same as jamon
but is the closest equivalent.

411
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,410
But jerky is dried,

412
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,079
- and then lightly cooked.
- Yes.

413
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,079
Kian84 somewhat...

414
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,050
spreads this energy...

415
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,719
that wants people to communicate...

416
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,959
and explain for him to understand.

417
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,359
I felt excited.

418
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,260
He's a good listener.

419
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,800
I thank him for taking care of me.

420
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,470
But he's very talkative as well.

421
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:35,770
(Feeling dizzy)

422
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:38,609
He's kind and sweet.

423
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:42,109
When we talk about something,
he explains too much in detail.

424
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:43,609
He's too kind.

425
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,849
His kindness makes him talkative.

426
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:47,879
(Yawning)

427
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:49,020
It's all good, though.

428
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,089
Teo lived in many countries.

429
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,990
- He has a lot of knowledge.
- Right. It's natural.

430
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,190
Teo, it's a misunderstanding.

431
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:57,359
(I'll trust you.)

432
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:01,970
(After chatting with Teo on the road...)

433
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,099
This...

434
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,839
looks different from the airport
that we arrived at.

435
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,500
(They arrived at LaGuardia airport.)

436
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,409
- Shall we go in?
- Yes, let's go.

437
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,480
Goodbye, New York.

438
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,919
It's LaGuardia airport.

439
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,520
Unlike the airport that we went to,

440
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,619
- there are many franchise restaurants.
- My goodness.

441
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:29,690
Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks.

442
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,960
Isn't this something like McDonalds?

443
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,260
But this isn't a franchise.

444
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,530
Hi.

445
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,270
I just wanted to say hi.

446
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,599
- I wanted to say I'm a big fan of you.
- She recognized him.

447
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,369
- Oh, thank you.
- I watched "Past Lives."

448
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:42,609
Thanks.

449
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,040
- My gosh!
- Thank you so much.

450
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,079
In New York.

451
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,240
The man at the back seems
to be her boyfriend.

452
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,280
(The man at the back seems
to be her boyfriend.)

453
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,180
- Thank you so much.
- He doesn't look happy.

454
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:54,480
- No.
- Thank you so much.

455
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,149
- The fans recognize me even here.
- Bye.

456
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:57,190
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

457
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,460
- Thank you. Bye. Safe travels.
- Bye.

458
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:01,960
Then,

459
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,730
we'll head to Denver.

460
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,730
(It's time to go to Denver now.)

461
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,500
What I know about Denver is...

462
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,669
A long time ago, there was a big gum
which was five cents.

463
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,169
- The dinosaur gum.
- Yes.

464
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,500
- You know, right?
- Gum!

465
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,109
- I can make a bubble this big.
- It's so big.

466
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:19,139
There's a dinosaur
from "Denver, the Last Dinosaur."

467
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,250
That's the only Denver I know.

468
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,309
I used to chew that gum a lot.

469
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:26,480
Anyway, we'll move to Denver.

470
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:28,379
(Bye.)

471
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,750
(On the flight to Denver)

472
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,460
(Taking out something)

473
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,000
(He took out his lyrics note
as soon as he got inside the plane.)

474
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,930
Kian84 kept writing lyrics on the plane.

475
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,800
You wrote your draft there.

476
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:49,639
(He's spontaneously sharing...)

477
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:53,079
(his impressions and experiences
from New York.)

478
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:55,109
Kanye West writes his music
on the plane too.

479
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:57,379
- Is it?
- Yes, you're Kian84 West.

480
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:03,720
(This densely filled lyric notebook...)

481
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,730
(transformed into Kian84's
debut solo track, "Dandelion.")

482
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:13,599
(His song, "Dandelion,"
is spreading far away.)

483
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,829
(The flight was
4 hours and 13 minutes long.)

484
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:19,069
(Arriving in Denver with a dandelion seed)

485
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,740
(New York, 2:09 p.m.)

486
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,669
There's a time difference.

487
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:24,710
- It was two hours earlier.
- I see.

488
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:26,339
Finally,

489
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,309
we're in Colorado.

490
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,119
Since we came from Brooklyn to Colorado,

491
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,649
I think I need to change my outfit.

492
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,119
He's taking a lot of care
of his outfits for this trip.

493
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,419
There are many nice Colorado outfits.

494
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,930
As if I'm a resident of Colorado.

495
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:47,700
I'll buy this.

496
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,470
- Colorado.
- That's cute.

497
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,629
It's quite expensive.

498
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:52,899
(Colorado T-shirt: 35 dollars)

499
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,240
Okay.

500
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,970
(Going to meet Pani
after buying an expensive T-shift)

501
00:21:56,569 --> 00:21:59,639
Pani is at 410.

502
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:00,980
- He already arrived?
- Yes.

503
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,879
He arrived quite some time ago.

504
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,010
- Oh, is it?
- Yes.

505
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,349
It's my first time to meet him.

506
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:07,149
It's his first time to see Pani.

507
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,889
- You're meeting him in the US.
- Yes.

508
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:10,849
It's my first time to see him
after the video call.

509
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,919
- It's your first time to meet him.
- Yes.

510
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:14,290
He's a nice person.

511
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,190
He gets aggressive sometimes.

512
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,559
What do you mean?

513
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,329
He sometimes gets angry.

514
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:21,300
But he doesn't do that
to people with a lot of muscles.

515
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:22,569
- "People with a lot of muscles."
- He won't do that to you.

516
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,300
He's a researcher.

517
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:26,500
It's here, 410.

518
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,710
- Kian84!
- Pani!

519
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,210
- Meeting him in a foreign country.
- Hello!

520
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,409
They're finally meeting.

521
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:34,609
(They finally met Pani across the road.)

522
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:35,849
Hello.

523
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,480
(He's a human turn signal.)

524
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,819
- It feels safe to be around him.
- He's a human navigator.

525
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,750
It feels safe to travel with him.

526
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,750
(He adapts so well with the locals.)

527
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,159
Pani Bottle is back.

528
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,159
(First trip, second trip...)

529
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,220
It's already the fourth.

530
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,389
- Right. My gosh.
- My goodness.

531
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,129
(The good-singing friend followed him
to Music Adventure by Accident too.)

532
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:55,059
He's good at singing.

533
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,730
I knew from long ago that
Kian84 is a person...

534
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,740
who wants to experience many things.

535
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,970
The fun part is watching someone
who couldn't do it before...

536
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:04,809
improve together with Kian84.

537
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,780
Both me and Kian84 are rookies.

538
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,250
I think it would be nice
to achieve this together.

539
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:13,220
I'm here to rent a car.

540
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,720
I have a reservation.

541
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,750
It's the first time to rent a car.

542
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,819
- We only rented bikes before.
- You're right.

543
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:21,460
Public transportation in the US
isn't well-developed.

544
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,629
So it's almost a must to rent a car.

545
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:24,629
- Yes.
- You're right.

546
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,260
My gosh.

547
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:29,569
- An off-road vehicle.
- He rented a good car.

548
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:30,730
Since we're in the US,

549
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,669
I rented a big Land Rover.

550
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:34,740
It looks cool.

551
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,740
(He parked it at the airport...)

552
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:41,010
(and waited for them
while making himself pretty.)

553
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,879
When are they coming?

554
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,619
It's here, 410.

555
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:48,020
- Kian84!
- Pani!

556
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,050
(Finally, the three people met.)

557
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,050
Hello!

558
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,659
Now, we're three. It's a real start.

559
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,020
Hello!

560
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,490
Let me record their awkward moments.

561
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,599
Hello.

562
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,270
Let's get off the road.

563
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,270
- It's our first time to meet.
- Yes.

564
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,839
- Say hello first.
- Yes.

565
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,440
- It's your first time to see him.
- I said hello just now.

566
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Hello. We're in the middle of the road.

567
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,839
Come here.

568
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,280
It was a little awkward at first.

569
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,609
I didn't know what to say.

570
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,950
His body was thick.

571
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,619
I could feel that
he was physically strong.

572
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:21,780
He was an alpha male.

573
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,760
- An alpha male.
- He was a person from a different world.

574
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,790
Denver airport is so big.

575
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,659
You couldn't make eye contact?

576
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,260
At first.

577
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,159
- This drum is yours.
- Two.

578
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:34,659
- What's that drum?
- I bought it.

579
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:37,099
This is for you.

580
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:39,069
- Do I need to play it?
- Yes, later.

581
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:41,440
You can load your luggage there.
The car is there.

582
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,669
I can feel the awkwardness.

583
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:44,710
You're like his tour guide.

584
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,710
(Like a tour guide
that he met for the first time)

585
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,780
He's in his guide mode.

586
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:48,950
It's awkward. He has nothing to say.

587
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,879
Why did it take so long?

588
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:54,020
(Teo said he doesn't socialize
with people a lot.)

589
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,490
(Do you spend time alone?)

590
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:00,319
(He liked Teo as they had
many things in common.)

591
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,790
No.

592
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,859
(I'll help them to get closer.)

593
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:03,859
He's enjoying it.

594
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:06,399
I enjoy watching people feeling awkward.

595
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:09,869
When did you arrive?

596
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:11,169
- I arrived yesterday.
- Yesterday?

597
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:12,639
- I arrived yesterday.
- You must be tired.

598
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,240
I rested a lot.

599
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:15,569
- Is it?
- I rested a lot.

600
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:17,609
- I arranged my things.
- What did you do in Switzerland?

601
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:19,639
- In my accommodation?
- No, in Switzerland.

602
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:20,879
Oh, in Switzerland.

603
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,349
They're chatting.

604
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:24,510
He looks unhappy
seeing them conversing well.

605
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,079
After meeting an evil being yesterday,
my mind has become twisted.

606
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:30,990
It wasn't interesting anymore
when they got closer.

607
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:33,889
He wanted to be the middleman
to break the ice.

608
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,829
- We shared the same accommodation...
- I see.

609
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,960
- and stayed.
- It must've been nice.

610
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,159
They never stop talking.

611
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,230
He's jealous now.
His mouth is protruding again.

612
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,399
An evil being is still in me.

613
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:49,010
But the weather wasn't nice.
It kept raining.

614
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,339
- Oh, is it?
- But Denver... How was New York?

615
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:53,040
It was hotter than here.

616
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,339
They broke the ice with no problem.

617
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:58,849
These sociable people.

618
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,919
My gosh. An offroad vehicle!

619
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,520
I rented it.

620
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,619
- Give me your luggage.
- Traveling with a rented car...

621
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:07,960
- feels totally different.
- Yes.

622
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,829
I felt thankful to Pani
for preparing everything.

623
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:11,829
I'll start driving.

624
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,859
He's driving too.

625
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:16,030
- I like driving. It's interesting.
- I see.

626
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:19,899
- Pani, where are we going?
- Yes.

627
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,440
We're going to hike the Rocky Mountains.

628
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,909
- Hiking?
- Hiking?

629
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:26,139
It's not long. It's a short course.

630
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,639
- As soon as arriving?
- After that,

631
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,579
we're going to sleep at a lodge.

632
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:31,710
- Lodge?
- What's that?

633
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,180
Shall I say it's a hut?

634
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,990
The US is very hot nowadays.

635
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,859
Playing in the open, refreshing nature
of the Rocky Mountains...

636
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,730
while also improving their singing skills.

637
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,230
I think Pani tried to plan an itinerary...

638
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,700
so that we can have a good experience.

639
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,700
I felt comfortable.

640
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:54,000
We're going to spend a night there,
but there's nothing.

641
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,069
But we need to eat.

642
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:57,309
- Let's buy groceries first.
- Okay.

643
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:58,909
- Oh, groceries.
- Then we will go for hiking.

644
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:01,079
(While getting out of the airport)

645
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,180
My gosh, I can see the mountains.

646
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,680
Yes, that's the Rocky Mountains.

647
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:07,919
- Gosh, I can breathe easily.
- Me too.

648
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,250
- I can breathe easily.
- Why?

649
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:12,520
Because of the concrete in Manhattan.

650
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,220
It must be really stuffy over there.

651
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,659
Seeing the scenery heightens
my sensitivity and emotions.

652
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:20,399
I love this.

653
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:21,829
This is great.

654
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:24,800
(Escaping the skyscrapers of New York,)

655
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,669
(they now arrived
in the vast natural city of Denver.)

656
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:29,369
- It's different.
- It's peaceful.

657
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:33,339
Denver, the capital and largest city
of Colorado, is located...

658
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:35,309
slopes of the Rocky Mountains
and serves...

659
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:37,349
as the central hub for tourism.

660
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:39,649
It's known
as the "Queen City of the Rockies"

661
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,980
Although it's a major city, it is known...

662
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,889
for its sparse population density
and great natural scenery.

663
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:46,059
It's famous for
its clean water and pristine environment.

664
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,389
Gosh, that place is...

665
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:48,419
It'll make people be kinder.

666
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,730
- It's a therapeutic place.
- Yes.

667
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Denver.

668
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,700
- My gosh.
- This is nice.

669
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,869
Oh, right. You haven't eaten lunch, right?

670
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,030
Right.

671
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,740
There's pizza at the back. I bought it.

672
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
- Pizza?
- Yes.

673
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,669
- Is it for advertisement?
- No.

674
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:05,210
- "Is it for advertisement?"
- MOD.

675
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,809
I can't live without a pizza.

676
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,980
- Did you eat?
- I ate.

677
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:11,680
Thank you.

678
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,020
I bought thinking
you would get out sooner.

679
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,050
(He's happy.)

680
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:17,990
I'll cook dinner tonight.

681
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,790
Yesterday, Kian84 cooked.

682
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,990
I'll cook today.

683
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,190
Kian84 cooked?

684
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,629
Doesn't he cook?

685
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:26,430
- It's my first time to hear this.
- For real?

686
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:28,399
I've never seen him cook,
and I heard it for the first time too.

687
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,369
I didn't know it was special...

688
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:32,230
to eat Kian84's food.

689
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,440
It won't be easy in the future.

690
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,409
We're here. It's written in Korean.

691
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,079
Let's buy some drinks first.

692
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,079
(They're going to the liquor store first.)

693
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,579
- Hello.
- Hello.

694
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:45,919
(In the US, you can only buy alcohol
in liquor stores.)

695
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:49,149
There are many bottles of soju here.

696
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,050
- There's soju?
- This alcohol...

697
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,389
- is in the US too.
- My gosh.

698
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
I'll go with this one.

699
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,859
- It's zero sugar.
- It's zero sugar.

700
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,460
They must sell it to the US.

701
00:28:58,589 --> 00:28:59,829
It's all in English.

702
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,000
- Together?
- Yes.

703
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,599
One bottle for six dollars.

704
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,040
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

705
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,440
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

706
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,210
- Enjoy.
- Let's go for groceries.

707
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,210
- Groceries.
- Yes.

708
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,210
(Heading to the grocery store nearby)

709
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,010
What do you want to eat for dinner?

710
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,180
Which dish are you confident in?

711
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:18,050
I'm confident in everything.

712
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,280
- Korean dish?
- Chef.

713
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:20,450
- Korean cuisine.
- Yes.

714
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,980
- The dish that you feel confident.
- Okay.

715
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,050
- Since we bought soju...
- There's a Korean mart.

716
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,520
it'll be nice to have
stir-fried spicy pork or bulgogi.

717
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,589
- I want pork belly.
- Sounds good.

718
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,730
- This is a Korean mart scent.
- It's so big.

719
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,730
(They're excited
to enter the Korean mart.)

720
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,329
- It's huge.
- The Korean mart in the US.

721
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:37,669
- Teo!
- Yes.

722
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,169
What should we do? Pork belly barbeque?

723
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,040
- Let's fry kimchi with pork belly,
- Okay.

724
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:46,980
- and doenjang jjigae.
- My goodness.

725
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,710
Right. It's about time
you crave Korean food.

726
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,849
(Chef Yoo is famous for
his good cooking skills.)

727
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:53,319
He's famous for being a good cook.

728
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,520
- His cutting skills.
- My goodness.

729
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,849
He even makes his own jamon.

730
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:58,149
- Did you cook everything?
- Yes.

731
00:29:58,149 --> 00:29:59,619
He made sausages.

732
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:04,329
We need to buy one by one efficiently.

733
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:06,329
- Look for some potatoes.
- Okay.

734
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:09,530
There's a mushroom set.

735
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:14,700
It's so big. Why is everything so big?

736
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,010
They only sell onions in bulk.

737
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,349
I think they'll sell individually
at the front.

738
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,750
One onion. This is efficient.

739
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,450
One tofu for jjigae.

740
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:32,520
Potato, okay.

741
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:35,159
I hope there's a good knife at the lodge.

742
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,159
You buy only what you need
in small portions...

743
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,930
- to reduce leftovers.
- Yes.

744
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,960
Minced garlic.

745
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,230
There are so many garlic.

746
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,430
I can only buy the minced version.

747
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:49,099
We won't eat this much for one meal.

748
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,139
Buying seaweed
would be considered a luxury.

749
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:53,680
It's from China.

750
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,579
(On the other hand,
the ones who had missions...)

751
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:56,579
It looks delicious.

752
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,149
(It's tasty.)

753
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,619
(He eats just like Kian84.)

754
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,190
Is there a tasting corner in the US too?

755
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,190
Yes, there was.

756
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,460
Since this was a Korean mart...

757
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,460
One more, please.

758
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,819
(Naengmyeon soup is dribbling.)

759
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,129
Throw it here.

760
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,230
It must be tastier
than what you eat in Korea.

761
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,669
- Thank you.
- Are you in the US?

762
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,129
- Yes, goodbye.
- Their naengmyeon was better.

763
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:20,270
It was so good.

764
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,839
It's there.

765
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,240
(Is Kian84 finally buying an ingredient?)

766
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,050
Cod jeon.

767
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:33,619
Dumplings and fried chicken.

768
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,190
Looking at them made me buy them.

769
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,319
We shouldn't go for groceries
when we're hungry.

770
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,790
Pollack roe.

771
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,290
(He adds one pollack roe too.)

772
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,230
- We bought too much.
- Yes.

773
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,760
- Let's go now.
- Let's go.

774
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,800
We bought too much.

775
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,159
Why did you buy so much? What's this?

776
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,930
- Teo.
- Is that pollack roe?

777
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,470
- This won't be enough.
- Dumplings.

778
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,500
- What's this?
- Chicken.

779
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:57,409
Teo bought onions individually
to reduce leftovers.

780
00:31:57,409 --> 00:31:58,440
I know, right?

781
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,780
I was out of my mind.

782
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,550
I always think about not wasting food.

783
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,950
But I lost my mind.

784
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,220
When you're in a foreign country,
you go crazy...

785
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,520
- looking at Korean food.
- You go crazy.

786
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
It's inevitable.

787
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,919
Choose one between the two.

788
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,020
- Really?
- Yes.

789
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,059
- Chicken is okay?
- Still...

790
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,159
- Dumplings.
- Let's put these back.

791
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,960
We'll only cook one dinner.

792
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,599
We shouldn't waste food.

793
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,200
- Okay.
- Goodness.

794
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,139
We won't die of hunger in the US.

795
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:30,510
- That's true.
- We won't need to buy a lot.

796
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,740
Where are they?

797
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:39,309
They put things in the basket
but didn't really buy them.

798
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:40,849
I liked that.

799
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:42,349
It could create conflicts.

800
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:44,950
He's like a younger sibling or a baby.

801
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,520
He wants what's right in front of him,

802
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,720
but if it's out of sight,
he forgets about it.

803
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,889
They should have spoons, right?

804
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,460
- Spoons?
- Will they have utensils?

805
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,800
- They'll have knives, right?
- They should have.

806
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,399
- Cooking utensils. Okay.
- Yes.

807
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,599
How much, 102 dollars?

808
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,169
It's 102.84 dollars.

809
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,470
It was 102.84 dollars.

810
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,339
Compared to the many things we bought,

811
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:03,609
it wasn't that expensive.

812
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,510
Yes, it's cheaper than eating out.

813
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:10,409
Korean newspaper.

814
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,819
The Korean news leader of Colorado.

815
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:15,720
- How Koreans live here.
- It's nice to see that.

816
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
It's surprising.

817
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:20,389
It's something like Find All Newspaper
of Colorado Korean community.

818
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,089
Housing rent and second-hand cars.

819
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:25,790
They do fortune-telling in Denver.

820
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,099
This fortune teller will do it.

821
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:30,800
He went all the way to Denver?

822
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:33,139
He received divine guidance
from the Rocky Mountains.

823
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,169
Let's bring it and read it.

824
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:37,510
It's a second-hand market.

825
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,010
- Let's go.
- Let's get moving.

826
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,280
- Teo.
- Yes?

827
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:43,879
Do you want to check your fortune today?

828
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,210
Of course.

829
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,550
What's your zodiac sign?

830
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,119
Me? Aries. My zodiac is a rooster.

831
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,349
Even if you don't agree with someone,

832
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:55,389
it is important to have the generosity
to respect their opinion.

833
00:33:56,629 --> 00:33:58,859
Are you saying that because he didn't
let you buy what you want?

834
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:00,129
No, I just read it.

835
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,700
Did you imagine it?

836
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,930
No, I read what was written.

837
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,069
(He's asking for generosity.)

838
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,169
- Is it from your heart?
- No, it's written here.

839
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:14,909
Even though he wanted a cod jeon...

840
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,280
(Laughing)

841
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
He's just saying what he wants to.

842
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,109
No, it's written here.

843
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,079
Look. It's written there.

844
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,950
Seriously. Look.

845
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:25,790
Even if you don't agree with someone,

846
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,119
- He was right.
- It was for real.

847
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,119
(It's really written as such!)

848
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,359
- See?
- So we bought one pack of cod jeon.

849
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,359
Okay.

850
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,899
- They're comfortable now.
- They're friends.

851
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:34,899
Shall I read mine?

852
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:37,329
Let's get going.

853
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:38,329
Okay.

854
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:40,169
It takes 1 hour and 20 minutes.

855
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,869
- 1 hour and 20 minutes?
- Yes.

856
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:43,339
In the US, 1 hour and 20 minutes...

857
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:45,139
- is very near.
- It's super near.

858
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,839
Don't the clouds look cool here?

859
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:50,950
The air is fresh too,
so you can see far ahead.

860
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:54,419
There are no tall buildings,
and the country is big.

861
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:57,020
So the sky is really beautiful.

862
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,050
(The clear sky just amazes them.)

863
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,319
- Kian84, why...
- Yes?

864
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,760
How did you come to start
"Music Adventure by Accident?"

865
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,690
It's a bit embarrassing to say.

866
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:07,829
My childhood dream was to become a singer.

867
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,069
Why are you embarrassed about that?

868
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:11,669
- That's right.
- It's your dream.

869
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,569
While traveling,

870
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,470
we always get inspiration.

871
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:18,940
So if I get inspired from here,

872
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,379
I want to go back to Korea...

873
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,040
and make a song.

874
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,210
Even if you don't become a singer,

875
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:26,579
men all have the dream
of being able to play...

876
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,450
- You need it.
- one instrument in their life.

877
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,589
So I started playing the piano
and stopped half-way.

878
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:34,990
I tried playing the guitar, but I quit
because my fingers hurt too much.

879
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,359
You can't play because your fingers hurt
and because you don't have time.

880
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:39,289
I gave up on playing the guitar too.

881
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,359
My mom let me go
until I was in grade four.

882
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,970
When I was in grade five, she told me to
quit piano and go to English classes.

883
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:47,370
- You learn Korean, English, and math.
- Right.

884
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,609
My dream of learning the piano...

885
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:54,280
was substituted by English classes
by Oh Sung Sik.

886
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,709
But my English...

887
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:56,780
(But his English...)

888
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,080
(You know how dare mart?)

889
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:02,450
(He has rude English speaking skills.)

890
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:05,120
(Cash or credit card?)

891
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,189
(Opening crap?)

892
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:08,720
(His English listening skills are poor.)

893
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,959
It wasn't that worth it.

894
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:14,160
I don't think Mr. Oh Sung Sik
will like this.

895
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,200
He didn't do anything wrong.

896
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,729
You're good.

897
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:21,169
- Am I all right?
- Yes. You can communicate.

898
00:36:21,169 --> 00:36:23,910
I think I get more confidence
because you're next to me.

899
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,010
You can just do it.

900
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:27,439
I...

901
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:31,050
also took ten years to learn Korean.

902
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,220
When did you start learning Korean?

903
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,950
When I was young,
I would go to a Korean school...

904
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,319
in Germany once a week.

905
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:40,919
Three hours of Korean school
every Saturday. That's all.

906
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,789
I improved a lot after moving to Korea.

907
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:46,660
The weather is so good.

908
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,260
(They drive through the road
while chatting.)

909
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,330
It's amazing.

910
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,499
(KJ Kian84 turns the music on.)

911
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,209
(Exclaiming)

912
00:36:57,569 --> 00:36:59,039
(Exclaiming)

913
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,439
Now it feels like we're traveling America.

914
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,950
("Take Me Home, Country Road"
by John Denver)

915
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,550
(Teo turns his camera on.)

916
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:13,890
Look at the freight train.

917
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:17,330
- It's very cool.
- There are windmills too.

918
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,930
(They see the world's largest
American freight train.)

919
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,100
Why is it so long?

920
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,640
This is a gold mine.

921
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,539
Is this where the gold rush was?

922
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:36,280
(The gold mine we saw
in the history books is right here!)

923
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,450
It has a great atmosphere.

924
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:43,050
It really is the countryside.

925
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,359
(Pani Bottle also feels great.)

926
00:37:47,419 --> 00:37:49,189
<i>Growing like a breeze</i>

927
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,129
<i>Country road</i>

928
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,129
<i>Take me home</i>

929
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:57,300
That's Mr. Oh Sung Sik's student.

930
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,470
(A direct translation of the song
that would shock the original singer)

931
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,499
<i>I belong</i>

932
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:04,470
<i>Yeoju</i>

933
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:06,780
- Yeoju.
- Yeoju people.

934
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:09,680
<i>Take me home</i>

935
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,379
<i>- Country road</i>
<i>- Country road</i>

936
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:14,019
(The song ends with Kian84
looking for Yeoju in the US.)

937
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:17,649
- That's right.
- This is the intro.

938
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:19,519
(DJ Kian84's next song)

939
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,260
("Wonderwall" by Oasis)

940
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,530
Nice.

941
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,729
<i>By now, you should've somehow realized</i>
<i>what you gotta do</i>

942
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,729
That just happens when men
are in a car together.

943
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,939
- Right.
- <i>Feels the way I do</i>

944
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:39,669
(He records the two of them first.)

945
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,709
It would be nice. The scenery also keeps
changing as you go.

946
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,379
The scenery is really good.

947
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:51,620
(Teo TV full of sentiment)

948
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:53,760
Goodness.

949
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,589
- Amazing.
- Goodness.

950
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,890
(Covering his mouth)

951
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,899
The sign for Colorado.

952
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:01,060
(They see Mother Nature's signboard
far ahead.)

953
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,129
It's amazing.

954
00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:05,729
(Stretching from Canada
to the Western United States)

955
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:08,999
(The great mountain range
stretches over 4,500km.)

956
00:39:09,669 --> 00:39:13,010
(Perennial snow
and dense forests coexist.)

957
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,510
(They head toward the Rocky Mountains.)

958
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,810
<i>I said maybe</i>

959
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,780
It was strange.
It's not like I don't like New York,

960
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,450
but it felt as though...

961
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,950
I needed this trip.

962
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,959
I was on an off-road car
heading to the nature...

963
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,660
listening to music.

964
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:33,229
It felt so good.

965
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:34,600
It was so good.

966
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,229
I look happier there.

967
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:38,999
You seemed happier than
when you were in New York.

968
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:40,769
- Right.
- Yes.

969
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:44,240
When I get to hear country music
in the future,

970
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,879
I think I will remember the time...

971
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:49,410
I drove to Colorado with Kian84 and Teo.

972
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,950
I think it will be a strong memory
that becomes a bookmark in my life.

973
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,879
(I think the memory will become
a bookmark in my life.)

974
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,519
- It's telling us to leave.
- Yes.

975
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,919
(They leave the highway.)

976
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:04,060
(They head to the deep mountains
with lots of trees.)

977
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,729
It looks like a scene in a movie.

978
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,959
I want to film a movie
in a place like this.

979
00:40:10,129 --> 00:40:15,870
(Climbing up through
dense coniferous trees)

980
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,839
The road is very curvy.

981
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:20,740
It's just like Daegwallyeong.

982
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,850
It's like we were
in a very large Yangpyeong.

983
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,249
You can see snow at the top.

984
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,580
The perpetual snow.

985
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,819
- I saw the perpetual snow.
- Perpetual snow.

986
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:33,459
(They can see a bit
of the perpetual snow.)

987
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:36,490
They had made a hiking course.

988
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,330
A hiking course that's not too long.

989
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:40,800
We're currently going up.

990
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,729
- They're turning.
- Right.

991
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:44,800
(Opening his mouth)

992
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:46,740
(Opening his mouth)

993
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,839
My ears are a little...

994
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:48,939
- I think the altitude here is high.
- I guess he's feeling it now.

995
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:50,069
It's because we're going up.

996
00:40:50,169 --> 00:40:52,870
Actually, it was my first time
going up somewhere so high.

997
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,109
There is some altitude here.

998
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,080
- We went to many high mountains.
- Right.

999
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,979
I think I can guess the altitude here.

1000
00:40:58,379 --> 00:41:00,180
- Based on the pressure?
- The pressure.

1001
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,180
With the pressure I feel in my ears.

1002
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:05,589
It's about 2000...

1003
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,789
Let's see, Ear Pressure84.

1004
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:09,890
It would be about 2000m.

1005
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,390
It's a bit more than 2000m. It's...

1006
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,359
about 2,700m?

1007
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:17,999
My watch has a barometer.

1008
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,700
My watch...

1009
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,169
(No way)

1010
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:23,939
says it's 2,700m.

1011
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:25,410
(He got it correct.)

1012
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,109
- Really?
- Really?

1013
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,640
Kian84 travels a lot these days.

1014
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,310
- So his ears barometer developed.
- Ask me if you're curious.

1015
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,979
(Ask Ear Pressure84 for the altitude
at all times.)

1016
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,319
(Tapping)

1017
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:41,120
(They head toward an altitude of 3,500m.)

1018
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:42,959
(Teo seems uncomfortable.)

1019
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,530
It's quite dry.

1020
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,289
(Teo seems uncomfortable.)

1021
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,100
I think I've become strong
when it comes to high mountains.

1022
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,030
I need to go somewhere 4,000m high...

1023
00:41:52,129 --> 00:41:53,129
Then you would get a nosebleed.

1024
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:54,640
(The experienced hikers seem fine.)

1025
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:58,039
It feels much drier here.

1026
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:00,080
(The non-experienced person
is getting stiffer.)

1027
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,439
It's here.

1028
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
We're here.

1029
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,209
Here...

1030
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,050
- There are many cars.
- We're here.

1031
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,879
I guess it's a hiking point for tourists.

1032
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:12,519
It looked like many local people
came here for trekking.

1033
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:14,789
- Arrived.
- Thank you.

1034
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,629
- Well done.
- You did a good job.

1035
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,200
Let's go.

1036
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:22,700
It's refreshing.

1037
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:25,269
(As soon as they get out)

1038
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:26,269
It's so good.

1039
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:28,669
It's exactly 3,160m.

1040
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:31,769
How is there no fine dust at all?

1041
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,910
- The air is amazing.
- It's crazy.

1042
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,749
You would have felt great.

1043
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,810
The sun is hot,

1044
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,050
and the wind is cold.

1045
00:42:42,379 --> 00:42:43,490
I should have brought long pants.

1046
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,749
(The two older brothers get prepared
for the cold wind.)

1047
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,060
(And the youngest prepares his stomach.)

1048
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,689
- Pizza.
- The air is perfect.

1049
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:50,959
(Eating)

1050
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:52,459
Let's go.

1051
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:54,200
Let's go.

1052
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,269
(They head off.)

1053
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,399
(Panting)

1054
00:42:59,399 --> 00:43:01,370
- Gosh.
- I'm in trouble.

1055
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:03,370
I only walked ten steps.

1056
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,370
This is trouble.

1057
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:07,180
It really is high.

1058
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:09,180
I get out of breath quickly.

1059
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:12,850
How far do we have to go
to where the snow is?

1060
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,780
- Sorry, we're Chinese.
- Okay.

1061
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,580
- Sorry, we're Chinese.
- Okay.

1062
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,419
But...

1063
00:43:18,419 --> 00:43:20,459
- I thought they were Korean.
- Walk your own way.

1064
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:22,620
Good day!

1065
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:25,560
(He wraps it up politely.)

1066
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,430
It's dry. My throat is getting dry.

1067
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,100
- Trail entrance.
- Trail entrance.

1068
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:34,999
Trail entrance.

1069
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:39,669
This is the Rocky Mountains.

1070
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,740
Why are there so many people?

1071
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,410
- It must be a named mountain.
- What is this?

1072
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,749
They hike in comfortable wear.

1073
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:50,649
- It's like they're walking in their town.
- Right.

1074
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:53,220
- Bikini?
- She walked down in her bikini.

1075
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,990
They just come down as if it's nothing.

1076
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,430
Just like going to a mountain
behind your house.

1077
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,959
There's a high chance of finding
somewhere you can swim.

1078
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:02,999
Either a swimming pool or a lake.
There wouldn't be an ocean.

1079
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:04,629
That's why they wore bikinis.

1080
00:44:05,899 --> 00:44:07,069
Goodness.

1081
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:11,640
How could the sky be so blue?

1082
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,780
That's why Bob Ross...

1083
00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:17,550
- kept saying ultramarine.
- That's right.

1084
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:20,550
There was a reason he kept looking
for ultramarine.

1085
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:22,050
This is nice.

1086
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:23,819
Look at the trees.

1087
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,019
Bob Ross would really like them.

1088
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:27,160
(They see the tree that Bob Ross
painted with dots!)

1089
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,959
The design is different
compared to trees in Korea.

1090
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:30,959
(The trees and sky have
a refreshing American design.)

1091
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,530
It has an American design.

1092
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:36,930
- The sound of the trees is so nice.
- The sound of the wind.

1093
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:42,439
(Whooshing)

1094
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:43,939
The American wind sounds.

1095
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:45,240
(The refreshing sound of the wind
that seems to be welcoming the three)

1096
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,839
The sound of the wind is amazing.

1097
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,649
(Breathing heavily)

1098
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:51,950
(Panting)

1099
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:54,220
Oh, man.

1100
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,149
(Someone is panting with him.)

1101
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,990
(Breathing heavily)

1102
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,560
(Exclaiming)

1103
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,729
- Why am I the only one...
- Oh, no. He's out of breath.

1104
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:05,689
I didn't know there was
such a high mountain in the US.

1105
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,229
There's a surprise wherever I go.

1106
00:45:08,229 --> 00:45:09,229
(This man tries to stay composed.)

1107
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,100
(Though he doesn't have
altitude sickness,)

1108
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,499
- That was so...
- How are you so shameless?

1109
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:14,539
(but his nose will bleed.)

1110
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:15,600
His nose is bleeding!

1111
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,870
(I...)

1112
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,240
(don't have altitude sickness,)

1113
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,180
(but I do get out of breath.)

1114
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:22,010
(That's what we call altitude sickness.)

1115
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,580
How many times are you showing us this?

1116
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,050
My altitude sickness isn't that severe.
I'm serious.

1117
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,479
It has to be at least 5,000m for me.
Please air this.

1118
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,220
We're airing it loud and clear.

1119
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:35,959
But there was no mountain that's higher
than 3,000m at the range that we went.

1120
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,729
It was tough,

1121
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,330
but that was due to my old age.
It wasn't altitude sickness.

1122
00:45:40,629 --> 00:45:41,930
"That's due to my old age."

1123
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:44,470
- "Old age?"
- Oh, I'm the youngest here.

1124
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:45,930
(I didn't mean you.)

1125
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,470
(Panting)

1126
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:48,470
Still,

1127
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:50,810
- it's a good workout.
- It's so high.

1128
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:52,910
- This is nice.
- Goodness.

1129
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:54,709
- Oh, boy.
- Look at that.

1130
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:57,979
Teo, are you all right?

1131
00:45:58,249 --> 00:45:59,310
I'm all right.

1132
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,220
(Breathing heavily)

1133
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,249
I think he's struggling as well.

1134
00:46:03,249 --> 00:46:04,819
This was his first time
at a high mountain.

1135
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:05,950
It looks like it.

1136
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,289
(At one moment, he's keeping up,)

1137
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:10,490
(but he stops.)

1138
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,490
(Exclaiming)

1139
00:46:12,959 --> 00:46:15,100
My joints are in pain.

1140
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,769
(Teo used to be a basketball player
back in school.)

1141
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:23,709
(But due to injury,)

1142
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:26,240
(I had to get knee surgeries twice.)

1143
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,479
(His knee joints have been bad
since he was young.)

1144
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,680
(He paces himself due to his joints.)

1145
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,050
But it was the day
that he got off the airplane.

1146
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,550
Yes. It was a tight schedule,
so it must have been tough.

1147
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,459
(Exhaling)

1148
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:45,459
(He tries to keep up,
though he's out of breath.)

1149
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,499
This is...

1150
00:46:47,499 --> 00:46:48,660
(Stopping)

1151
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,030
(This is...)

1152
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,600
Smell that cypress.

1153
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,740
- Okay.
- Okay.

1154
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,769
I love it.

1155
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,370
("Taking a Field Trip
Now That He's Behind")

1156
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,439
- It's a segment within a segment.
- A segment within a segment.

1157
00:47:00,439 --> 00:47:01,539
I love it.

1158
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:05,209
If you take a look at this grass...

1159
00:47:05,209 --> 00:47:06,310
Oh, my.

1160
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,479
(Period 1: Smelling flowers)

1161
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,180
- It's nice.
- That's so cute.

1162
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:12,419
I love the sound of the wind.

1163
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,019
I didn't know you were...

1164
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:16,560
on a field trip behind us.

1165
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:18,859
This looks gorgeous.

1166
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,600
The rays of the sun come through.

1167
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,100
It's beautiful.

1168
00:47:24,169 --> 00:47:25,729
- Let's go!
- You startled me.

1169
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,800
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1170
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,669
- All right.
- He's like a rural boy.

1171
00:47:29,669 --> 00:47:31,240
I know, right? He looks so innocent.

1172
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,810
(He forgets about his pain
and turns into a rural boy.)

1173
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,010
That one seems the highest.

1174
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,979
- Right?
- That looks like the Mount Bukhan.

1175
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,780
I feel like there will be places...

1176
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,350
that sell barley rice, cheonggukjang,
thistle rice, and makgeolli.

1177
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,359
(There must be a place that sells those.)

1178
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,390
That sounds delicious.

1179
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,160
- I feel like we should play...
- Yes.

1180
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,030
trot music on a Bluetooth speaker.

1181
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,060
(The Rocky Mountains turn
into the Trot Mountains.)

1182
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,160
- Turn everything into Korean stuff.
- My gosh.

1183
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,970
- What a patriot.
- Yes.

1184
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,169
Gosh.
It turns out that Americans are the same.

1185
00:48:02,669 --> 00:48:04,740
- What do you mean?
- They also stack stones.

1186
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,640
They make wishes.

1187
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,709
I think it broke down...

1188
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:13,280
- due to a flood or something.
- They weren't making wishes?

1189
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,479
(He takes a look
at the stone wall, and...)

1190
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,019
(Is he collecting stones?)

1191
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,359
(It was to do...)

1192
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,399
Balancing the stones?

1193
00:48:30,399 --> 00:48:31,669
(Actually, Teo was...)

1194
00:48:31,669 --> 00:48:33,129
- What?
- What is that?

1195
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:34,399
What?

1196
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:37,769
- What was that?
- What?

1197
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:38,810
- That's...
- What?

1198
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,780
- You did that too?
- Are you a magician?

1199
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,209
- He has supernatural powers.
- That's a superpower.

1200
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:43,439
Those are my Instagram posts.

1201
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,879
(It was a reversed video.)

1202
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,890
It's a hobby of mine.
It's called rock balancing.

1203
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,950
- I do it from time to time.
- I see.

1204
00:48:53,689 --> 00:48:55,620
Teo has the innocence of a child.

1205
00:48:55,819 --> 00:48:57,060
- He's so innocent.
- Yes.

1206
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:01,359
- I think that's good enough.
- Goodness.

1207
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,129
Let's make a wish.

1208
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,769
- You should make a wish too.
- I just did.

1209
00:49:06,229 --> 00:49:07,870
Is your wish a secret?

1210
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:09,899
- My wish?
- What did you wish for?

1211
00:49:09,899 --> 00:49:11,539
- To stay healthy.
- Health.

1212
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:13,609
The guardian spirit
of the Rocky Mountains.

1213
00:49:13,879 --> 00:49:16,740
Please look over Teo's knees.

1214
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,580
He has bad joints.

1215
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,479
Please thicken...

1216
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:24,050
Teo's knee cartilage.

1217
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,120
He kept saying that he had bad joints.

1218
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,789
I appreciate it.

1219
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,859
(But before they know it,)

1220
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,959
(the oldest gets ahead of them.)

1221
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:38,930
(Are they keeping up?)

1222
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:41,370
I wasn't warmed up enough earlier.

1223
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:45,539
I think I'm starting to get warmed up now.

1224
00:49:45,669 --> 00:49:47,979
- My joint pain is disappearing.
- What?

1225
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:49,939
- Did your wish come true?
- As soon as I prayed...

1226
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,450
The guardian spirit of the Rocky Mountain
must have granted his wish.

1227
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,950
(With the grace of the guardian spirit...)

1228
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,720
Pani, where are we now?

1229
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,649
- We're at 3,270m.
- At 3,270m?

1230
00:49:57,649 --> 00:49:59,789
I think we're almost there.
Look at the trail.

1231
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,359
Wait. I see snow.

1232
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:04,530
I see it too.

1233
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:07,830
It still perseveres in the summer.
Perseverant Snow.

1234
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,530
- Goodness.
- That's magnificent.

1235
00:50:10,129 --> 00:50:11,899
(Exclaiming)

1236
00:50:11,899 --> 00:50:14,370
It's so interesting.
It doesn't look like it's below zero.

1237
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,100
- How is it not melting?
- I know, right?

1238
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:19,470
The sun is scorching,
and the snow doesn't melt.

1239
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,280
(Fascinated)

1240
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,450
Wait. There are so many people.

1241
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,310
Could this be the lake?

1242
00:50:26,479 --> 00:50:28,680
There's a lake that deep in the mountains?

1243
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,120
Seriously?

1244
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,419
(Below the snow-covered mountain...)

1245
00:50:32,919 --> 00:50:35,160
Is this the lake that people swim in?

1246
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,729
Are you serious? There's a lake?

1247
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:38,760
Hang on.

1248
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,390
I want to see it too.

1249
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,300
(Rushing)

1250
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,300
There's a lake!

1251
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,470
- Is there?
- Awesome.

1252
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:46,970
- There it is.
- It is a lake.

1253
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,439
- Oh, my gosh.
- What is that?

1254
00:50:49,439 --> 00:50:50,439
(An emerald lake)

1255
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,439
(The grandeur created by melted snow
at an altitude of 3,300m)

1256
00:50:52,439 --> 00:50:54,310
That's magnificent.

1257
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:55,379
Oh, my.

1258
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,280
(The highlight
of hiking the Rocky Mountains)

1259
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:03,580
(Saint Mary's Glacier)

1260
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,720
- Do Yeon, notebook, check.
- Notebook, check.

1261
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,689
At a high altitude
and with low temperatures,

1262
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,289
Saint Mary's Glacier
in the Rocky Mountains is...

1263
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:11,930
a place where the snow
doesn't melt year-round.

1264
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,160
Even in the middle of summer,

1265
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,629
you can enjoy dazzling winter sports
like skiing, snowboarding, and sledding.

1266
00:51:16,629 --> 00:51:18,830
It's a swimming pool
and a ski slope combined.

1267
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:21,439
The summer and winter coexist,

1268
00:51:21,439 --> 00:51:23,069
- so you can enjoy both.
- Right. That's fascinating.

1269
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,769
(Surprised)

1270
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:27,910
There's no way!

1271
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,379
This is impressive.

1272
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,609
- Oh, my gosh.
- Gosh.

1273
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:33,649
(Am I dreaming?)

1274
00:51:33,649 --> 00:51:35,319
- Oh, my gosh.
- Gosh.

1275
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,289
Gosh.

1276
00:51:39,189 --> 00:51:42,019
(They're drawn to the water.)

1277
00:51:42,459 --> 00:51:44,089
What? Look.

1278
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:46,729
(Nice to meet you,
water of the Rocky Mountains.)

1279
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:50,100
You wash your face
every time you see water.

1280
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:51,569
(Next,)

1281
00:51:52,129 --> 00:51:54,370
(say hello to my stomach.)

1282
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,870
It almost tasted like Evinue.

1283
00:51:57,439 --> 00:51:59,169
- Do you mean Evian?
- Evian?

1284
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:00,470
- Evian.
- Evian.

1285
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,709
At least you got
the first three letters right.

1286
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,580
Yes, Evian.

1287
00:52:06,879 --> 00:52:07,950
How's the temperature?

1288
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:11,749
It's about six degrees.

1289
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:13,319
- Six degrees?
- Yes.

1290
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:15,459
Gosh.

1291
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,129
Those people swam in this cold water?

1292
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:19,930
- I can't swim here.
- Good Lord.

1293
00:52:20,089 --> 00:52:22,060
The water's dirty, though.

1294
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,459
- What?
- Don't drink it.

1295
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,999
I already drank it.

1296
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,169
Telling him not to drink it is
pointless...

1297
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:29,470
because he drank the water
at the Ganges River.

1298
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,740
- He drank the Ganges River.
- He's got strong guts.

1299
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,470
No, the water tastes fine. Try it.

1300
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:35,810
No, you drink it.

1301
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:38,109
- "You drink it."
- You can have it.

1302
00:52:38,479 --> 00:52:40,109
Such a good friend.

1303
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,749
But I already drank it.

1304
00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:44,019
- I'll just taste it.
- Yes, taste it.

1305
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:45,089
(A dip)

1306
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,189
(A whole bucket)

1307
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:49,660
This is fine.

1308
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:53,359
- This is nice.
- How come the trees starved to death?

1309
00:52:53,689 --> 00:52:54,729
You're right.

1310
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:56,629
(Do not drink that, human.)

1311
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,729
It certainly is cold.

1312
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:03,499
Although it's grand, it's no Alps.

1313
00:53:03,499 --> 00:53:04,569
What?

1314
00:53:04,569 --> 00:53:06,370
It surely is amazing. But...

1315
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,280
- But it's not as good as the Alps?
- Right.

1316
00:53:08,439 --> 00:53:11,280
- Just some snow doesn't make it...
- He's cold-hearted.

1317
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,180
You're pretty good
at ruining the moment too.

1318
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,419
You ruin the moment from time to time.

1319
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:20,789
(He's incredibly honest.)

1320
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:24,129
- He's innocent.
- And he's not pretentious.

1321
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:27,899
The US is a country of freedom,

1322
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:29,499
so I understand.

1323
00:53:30,229 --> 00:53:31,830
I've never been to the Alps,

1324
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:34,140
so this is more beautiful than the Alps.

1325
00:53:35,939 --> 00:53:37,669
Can I watch them as they fish?

1326
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,410
How do I say, "Did you catch anything?"

1327
00:53:40,879 --> 00:53:42,410
- Pani.
- Yes?

1328
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:44,550
"What type of fish can you catch here?"

1329
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,479
- "What kind of fish?"
- I think that's about it.

1330
00:53:47,479 --> 00:53:49,950
What kind of fish?

1331
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:52,120
- Trout.
- "Tral?"

1332
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,120
Yes.

1333
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,260
- "Tral?"
- It's trout.

1334
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,490
- Trout.
- There's trout?

1335
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,990
- Isn't that "salam" in English?
- Trout is...

1336
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,589
- That's "salmon."
- "Salmon?"

1337
00:54:00,589 --> 00:54:02,499
- Salami.
- Salami is salmon?

1338
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:05,330
Sliced... Wait. Salami is a type of ham.

1339
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:06,470
It's salmon.

1340
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,140
Are they all suffering
from altitude sickness?

1341
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,800
I got confused. It was salmon.

1342
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,569
- Oh, that's altitude sickness.
- I was confused.

1343
00:54:11,569 --> 00:54:13,669
I guess it affects
your linguistic ability too.

1344
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,240
I'm getting confused too.

1345
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:17,649
Why am I teaching him
when I'm not fluent in English?

1346
00:54:17,649 --> 00:54:18,780
- I can't let this happen.
- It's fine.

1347
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,979
I can't let him learn
wrong English from me.

1348
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:21,649
Amazing.

1349
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:23,249
(They stop the English class
and watch as they fish.)

1350
00:54:23,249 --> 00:54:24,319
What is that?

1351
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,019
Look. They're doing it over there.

1352
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:28,289
They're fly-fishing.

1353
00:54:28,289 --> 00:54:29,419
(Fly-fishing)

1354
00:54:29,419 --> 00:54:30,689
- That's awesome.
- It was amazing.

1355
00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:32,660
They're like Brad Pitt.

1356
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,129
It's a cool way to fish.

1357
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:35,859
Fly fishing sounds fun.

1358
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,030
I'd love to try that once.

1359
00:54:38,569 --> 00:54:40,200
I wish I could fish here...

1360
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:41,999
And use the trout we caught...

1361
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,539
For dinner...

1362
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:45,269
Cook it.

1363
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:48,439
- We were all thinking the same thing.
- We really were.

1364
00:54:49,439 --> 00:54:52,580
Fishing and a nap.

1365
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,120
There's also a hammock.

1366
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:55,479
Someone was sleeping there.

1367
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,419
That's amazing.

1368
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,649
I was so jealous.

1369
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,859
Look!

1370
00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:03,390
(He spotted something.)

1371
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:04,430
What?

1372
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:08,300
(A snowboarder slides down
from the snowy mountain across them.)

1373
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,030
- A snowboard?
- That's...

1374
00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:12,600
- That's a snowboard.
- It's pretty steep.

1375
00:55:13,069 --> 00:55:15,999
That's some Red Bull stuff.

1376
00:55:16,769 --> 00:55:19,109
How are they snowboarding in July?

1377
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,339
- And that's authentic snow.
- That's...

1378
00:55:23,709 --> 00:55:25,550
They're fishing and snowboarding
in one place.

1379
00:55:26,209 --> 00:55:28,050
They're living life.

1380
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,919
(This gives me a dopamine rush.)

1381
00:55:29,919 --> 00:55:31,189
This place was a great choice, Pani.

1382
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:34,189
- We have to have this.
- That's incredible.

1383
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:36,660
(What did he bring to his hiking trip?)

1384
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,660
What is it?

1385
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:40,760
- I have a question for you.
- Sure.

1386
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,700
Do you have leftover rice sacks?

1387
00:55:43,499 --> 00:55:44,999
- For sledding?
- Yes.

1388
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:46,700
Those look good. Thank you.

1389
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:50,300
(Traditional Korean sled)

1390
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:53,910
(Korean rice sacks are
as good as snowboards.)

1391
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,649
Americans don't know the fun
of sledding down on a rice sack.

1392
00:55:58,649 --> 00:56:01,220
They don't. Had they known,

1393
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:03,350
he would have brought a rice sack.

1394
00:56:03,649 --> 00:56:05,490
Let's give them a taste
of the Gyeonggi rice sack.

1395
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:07,620
Let's take a sled ride.

1396
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:10,859
I bet we were the first ones
to ride a rice sack down the Alps.

1397
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:13,089
- You must have been.
- Yes. It's Korean sledding.

1398
00:56:13,629 --> 00:56:14,800
(Shall we go up?)

1399
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,800
Hi.

1400
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,069
(The tourists welcome them.)

1401
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:19,069
We're great!

1402
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,569
This amazing scenery.

1403
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:24,069
It's gorgeous.

1404
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,640
(Exclaiming)

1405
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,609
This is freaking good!

1406
00:56:33,379 --> 00:56:34,379
It's altitude sickness.

1407
00:56:34,379 --> 00:56:35,850
It has to be.

1408
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:38,450
The innocent boy turned
into the freaking boy.

1409
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:40,819
He means that he's extremely happy.

1410
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,789
(The freaking boy shouts.)

1411
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,499
(Shouting)

1412
00:56:48,499 --> 00:56:49,600
(Exclaiming)

1413
00:56:49,899 --> 00:56:51,870
(He starts making noises
on top of a rock.)

1414
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:52,970
Were you feeling all right?

1415
00:56:53,069 --> 00:56:54,569
How come I don't remember doing that?

1416
00:56:54,569 --> 00:56:56,269
- He doesn't remember!
- It's the altitude sickness.

1417
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:01,439
Goodness. I'm so embarrassed.

1418
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,410
I've never seen anyone make
Kian84 flustered before.

1419
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,910
(Only 10 minutes ago,)

1420
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,280
(he said it was no Alps.)

1421
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:13,990
(It's beautiful!)

1422
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,189
You look like the most excited one there.

1423
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,530
(Whistling)

1424
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:21,729
(Whistling)

1425
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,600
Oh, my. He's in his element.

1426
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,629
It's so loud.

1427
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,069
I'm ashamed for some reason.

1428
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,269
I wish I could hide.

1429
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:31,870
(Teo's passion makes them want to hide.)

1430
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:35,609
I want to say hello to the tourists,

1431
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,740
but Teo is...

1432
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:40,749
He wanted Teo to speak to them in English.

1433
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:43,819
(He's not crazy.)

1434
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,149
- Welcome to Colorado!
- Welcome to Colorado!

1435
00:57:47,149 --> 00:57:49,089
- "Cololulu!"
- Thank you!

1436
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:51,890
They still gladly wave at them.

1437
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:53,560
They're certainly Americans.

1438
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:55,700
All Americans are extroverts.

1439
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,800
- There aren't any introverts.
- You're right.

1440
00:57:58,899 --> 00:58:00,470
(The super extrovert reappears.)

1441
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,269
He's not done yet.

1442
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:04,769
(Screaming)

1443
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,510
(One innocent marmot)

1444
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:07,510
He's a marmot.

1445
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:08,539
(One innocent marmot)

1446
00:58:08,979 --> 00:58:10,910
(Flustered)

1447
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:14,209
I think Teo is suffering
from altitude sickness.

1448
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,479
He didn't drink soju by yourself earlier,
did he?

1449
00:58:16,479 --> 00:58:18,519
- No.
- What?

1450
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:20,249
- No.
- What?

1451
00:58:20,249 --> 00:58:21,720
- He's suffering from altitude sickness.
- What was that?

1452
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:22,819
Something fell on me.

1453
00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:23,959
(What is that?)

1454
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,390
(Take this!)

1455
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,729
It's a snowball fight in July!

1456
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,600
(Merry early Christmas!)

1457
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,229
Oh, he's so innocent.

1458
00:58:31,499 --> 00:58:33,600
- Bring it!
- It's ice.

1459
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,769
(They can't handle his innocence.)

1460
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:35,769
Come up.

1461
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,269
- You drank, didn't you?
- What?

1462
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:39,069
- He drank, didn't he?
- No, he didn't.

1463
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:44,080
It had been so long
since I traveled with colleagues,

1464
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,749
and I got emotional all of a sudden.

1465
00:58:47,879 --> 00:58:49,819
So, I screamed, "Look, we're here!"

1466
00:58:49,919 --> 00:58:52,490
It was fun as we were together.

1467
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,060
(His ball control is surprising.)

1468
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,260
That's so funny!

1469
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,089
- It was actually...
- My bad, Pani.

1470
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:01,100
- No, it didn't hurt.
- I'm sorry.

1471
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,729
(What?)

1472
00:59:03,399 --> 00:59:05,370
And he met Pani
for the first time that day.

1473
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:07,300
- I mean...
- It hit the back of my head.

1474
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,269
(Hitting the back of his head
at first encounter)

1475
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,839
This must be dangerous, though.

1476
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,680
It looks too dangerous to sled down.

1477
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:15,839
He's back to being himself.

1478
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,749
I'll test it out first.

1479
00:59:19,109 --> 00:59:20,979
I'm good at riding rice sacks too.

1480
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,720
What?

1481
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:27,019
Americans and their extreme sports.

1482
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:33,689
I find it more surprising
that they brought it all the way up here.

1483
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,269
Are you always riding snowboards...

1484
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:39,370
during this time of the year?

1485
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:41,069
It's my second year in Denver.

1486
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:43,740
Really? You're crazy!

1487
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:45,569
You're insane!

1488
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,140
We're looking for adventures, man.

1489
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:49,939
Looking for adventures is what it is.

1490
00:59:49,939 --> 00:59:51,209
- Right.
- You've got to work for it.

1491
00:59:51,209 --> 00:59:52,910
- It's an extreme sport.
- That's so cool.

1492
00:59:53,609 --> 00:59:54,979
There are no other ski slopes
with this view.

1493
00:59:58,089 --> 00:59:59,789
- Amazing.
- Won't our dopamine level...

1494
00:59:59,789 --> 01:00:00,789
rise too much on our way down?

1495
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:04,560
Shouting as you sled down will...

1496
01:00:04,959 --> 01:00:06,789
- probably help you find your voice.
- Okay.

1497
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:08,899
Good idea.

1498
01:00:10,459 --> 01:00:11,470
Like a rocker.

1499
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,870
(I'm going to become a rocker
in the Rockies.)

1500
01:00:14,129 --> 01:00:16,470
- All right. First athlete.
- Athlete.

1501
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:18,069
Here I come!

1502
01:00:19,169 --> 01:00:22,240
- Age, 36. Park Jae Han.
- Look at the backdrop.

1503
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,609
That's incredible.

1504
01:00:23,979 --> 01:00:24,979
Let's go!

1505
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:27,050
(Screaming)

1506
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:29,050
(Sledding down)

1507
01:00:30,149 --> 01:00:31,149
Gosh.

1508
01:00:31,149 --> 01:00:32,149
(Just sledding down opens up
your vocal cords.)

1509
01:00:32,149 --> 01:00:34,089
(Excited)

1510
01:00:34,289 --> 01:00:37,560
(Sounding like a nightingale)

1511
01:00:38,229 --> 01:00:40,589
- That's Farinelli.
- I was finding my voice.

1512
01:00:41,229 --> 01:00:42,999
(Singing passionately)

1513
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:46,669
(He sings his heart out in Mother Nature.)

1514
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:48,100
(Excited)

1515
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,169
That looks fun!

1516
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,439
(The main vocalist is motivated.)

1517
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,539
You're dead.

1518
01:00:53,709 --> 01:00:54,709
Let's go!

1519
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:56,410
(Shouting)

1520
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:57,950
(Sledding down)

1521
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,350
Your back must have hurt.

1522
01:01:01,879 --> 01:01:03,180
What if he hurts his hips?

1523
01:01:05,189 --> 01:01:08,260
(Don't forget about why we're sledding.)

1524
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,720
(Finding his voice)

1525
01:01:10,919 --> 01:01:13,060
(In this tough Mother Nature,)

1526
01:01:13,729 --> 01:01:15,760
(he shouts as loudly as he wants.)

1527
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,129
- Let's give it a go.
- Here goes Teo.

1528
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:20,999
Let's just go. Whatever.

1529
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:22,539
(Screaming)

1530
01:01:23,669 --> 01:01:25,370
(Screaming hysterically)

1531
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,209
(Behind the guy who's practicing singing,)

1532
01:01:28,879 --> 01:01:31,580
(Teo tries to catch up.)

1533
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:34,410
Take off your diaper.

1534
01:01:35,249 --> 01:01:36,419
Take it off.

1535
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:39,319
(They're newly born,
thanks to the special lesson.)

1536
01:01:41,689 --> 01:01:44,220
(They all arrive safely.)

1537
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,990
- It was so fast.
- I've arrived!

1538
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,600
(Shouting)

1539
01:01:48,899 --> 01:01:50,359
(Shouting)

1540
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,999
I'm here, Rockies!

1541
01:01:53,899 --> 01:01:55,339
(The 3 students even shout the same way.)

1542
01:01:55,339 --> 01:01:57,640
- See?
- They're turning into each other.

1543
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,539
- Nice!
- You guys are crazy.

1544
01:02:01,939 --> 01:02:04,080
- This is Korean...
- Craziest guys on the mountain.

1545
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:06,450
He called the craziest guys.

1546
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,479
- What were you riding?
- Yes. You?

1547
01:02:08,919 --> 01:02:10,050
- What is that?
- Do you want one?

1548
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,990
This is better than my snowboard, though.

1549
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,189
- Isn't it?
- I'll trade you.

1550
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:14,189
- Okay.
- I'll trade you.

1551
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,189
- Change?
- I take this one,

1552
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,620
- and you take this one.
- Okay. Thank you.

1553
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,760
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1554
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,760
Let's go.

1555
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,990
Korean rice ski.

1556
01:02:21,399 --> 01:02:22,399
It says, "Number one."

1557
01:02:22,399 --> 01:02:24,260
- Yes. It's number 1.
- Number 1.

1558
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,430
- "Gluten-free, GMO-free."
- Yes.

1559
01:02:26,629 --> 01:02:28,140
- Just like you, right?
- Korean...

1560
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,069
- "GMO-free."
- "Gluten-free!"

1561
01:02:31,069 --> 01:02:32,640
- And my friend right here.
- Yes.

1562
01:02:33,939 --> 01:02:35,240
You're the crazy guy now.

1563
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,039
- I am, I guess. Thank you.
- You're crazy.

1564
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,350
Just like the rice.

1565
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,010
No brake.

1566
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,419
- No brake. That's what I'm saying!
- Yes.

1567
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,379
- Someone's coming down.
- He just went for it!

1568
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:45,289
He's got nothing.

1569
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:46,319
(He doesn't even have a rice sack?)

1570
01:02:46,419 --> 01:02:47,890
He slid down with just his body.

1571
01:02:48,919 --> 01:02:49,959
That's Kian84.

1572
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,760
- That's so American.
- Yes.

1573
01:02:52,089 --> 01:02:54,459
- All Americans are excited.
- Crazy guy.

1574
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:56,330
Crazy guy!

1575
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,269
- Should we go together?
- Let's go!

1576
01:02:59,229 --> 01:03:01,069
- Bro, what's your name?
- Ali.

1577
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,339
- Ali?
- Yes, sir.

1578
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:03,740
I'm Pani.

1579
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:06,510
I speak some Hindi. So, Pani means water.

1580
01:03:06,769 --> 01:03:08,379
Pani Bottle. Yes.

1581
01:03:08,379 --> 01:03:09,839
You're Hindu?

1582
01:03:09,939 --> 01:03:12,479
- I'm Pakistani, but I speak Hindu.
- Oh, Pakistan!

1583
01:03:12,609 --> 01:03:15,220
- Thank you for hanging out with us.
- "Shukriyaa."

1584
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,180
Yes, "shukriyaa."

1585
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,890
- All right.
- Is he going without the sack?

1586
01:03:19,289 --> 01:03:20,589
Oh, he let Ali have it.

1587
01:03:21,459 --> 01:03:22,459
Here we go.

1588
01:03:22,459 --> 01:03:24,089
We're going with a new friend.

1589
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:26,030
Okay. Don't hurt yourself.

1590
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,300
Three, two, one.

1591
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,769
- Go!
- Go!

1592
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:34,939
(It's only been 3 minutes since they met.)

1593
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:37,569
(But they time-travel
back to 30 years ago.)

1594
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:38,569
My butt hurts, just watching them.

1595
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:40,510
It's cold!

1596
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,039
(Immersed in excitement)

1597
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,080
It's cold.

1598
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,780
(On an adventure with no equipment)

1599
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,479
He's really fast.

1600
01:03:47,979 --> 01:03:49,519
(My hands are cold.)

1601
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,850
(But the cold hands can't stop him.)

1602
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:52,850
There's a rock!

1603
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:55,760
(No obstacles...)

1604
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,930
(can stop Kian84 with no sack.)

1605
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,289
(A casual roll)

1606
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,890
He's so fast.

1607
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:02,859
(A shaved ice place)

1608
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:04,899
"A shaved ice place."

1609
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,330
He's at Sulbing.

1610
01:04:06,629 --> 01:04:08,269
That's amazing.

1611
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:09,269
(You guys serve some great shaved ice!)

1612
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:14,209
(Enjoying Mother Nature
with their entire bodies)

1613
01:04:14,709 --> 01:04:16,979
(Ali is also into it.)

1614
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,510
(Didn't I tell you?
Adventure belongs to those who seek it.)

1615
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:20,609
Look at Ali!

1616
01:04:20,609 --> 01:04:21,680
(Respect!)

1617
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,749
I didn't know he did that.

1618
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,350
(Pani Bottle screaming)

1619
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:27,319
(Kian84 screaming)

1620
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,490
(They ride to the bottom...)

1621
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,700
(and embrace the energy
of the Rocky Mountains.)

1622
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,959
When would you ever get
to experience that?

1623
01:04:37,629 --> 01:04:40,700
(We did it!)

1624
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,370
(You're alive, bro.)

1625
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:45,669
You're crazy.

1626
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,839
That was more fun, though.
I'm not going to lie.

1627
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,379
That was more fun.

1628
01:04:50,939 --> 01:04:52,050
Hey, I'm keeping this.

1629
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,780
- Yes. It's yours.
- I'm keeping this. It's mine.

1630
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,879
- It's a gift for you.
- No more snowboarding. Thank you.

1631
01:04:56,879 --> 01:04:58,490
If you want more, I can give you one.

1632
01:04:58,490 --> 01:04:59,649
- Thank you.
- For your girlfriend.

1633
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:01,789
- I got one more, baby.
- But...

1634
01:05:01,789 --> 01:05:03,220
why does it feel
like we're giving him trash?

1635
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,519
You're giving him trash.

1636
01:05:05,459 --> 01:05:07,189
(Oh, no)

1637
01:05:07,189 --> 01:05:09,959
(It's a misunderstanding, Ali.)

1638
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,030
I felt bad
because he was too happy about it.

1639
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,330
That's insane.

1640
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,669
- Why... He wants them?
- No, he wants them.

1641
01:05:16,669 --> 01:05:17,740
Really?

1642
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,010
I appreciate it.

1643
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:21,839
- I appreciate it too. Thank you.
- Thank you for hanging out with us.

1644
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,109
Safe travels, my brothers.

1645
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:25,010
- Thank you.
- Have another one.

1646
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:26,080
Thank you. I have three!

1647
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,720
I feel bad for Ali.

1648
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:32,390
- Isn't he such a good guy?
- Ali is so innocent.

1649
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,189
- Thank you, brother. Ali.
- Thank you.

1650
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,959
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Ali.

1651
01:05:36,959 --> 01:05:38,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1652
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,490
I'm all wet.

1653
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,129
Are my shorts okay?

1654
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,100
- No, they're not.
- Oh, his pants are wet.

1655
01:05:46,669 --> 01:05:47,669
Careful.

1656
01:05:47,899 --> 01:05:50,339
- Be careful. Don't hurt yourself.
- I can't feel my butt.

1657
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:52,010
(He can't feel his butt.)

1658
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:53,069
My butt.

1659
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:54,269
My hands hurt too.

1660
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:57,310
- Teo.
- Welcome to Music Adventure by Accident.

1661
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:58,850
- And you can't bail on us.
- Stop talking to me!

1662
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:00,510
(Shouting out of the blue)

1663
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:03,379
- He's become strange again.
- You can't bail.

1664
01:06:03,379 --> 01:06:04,649
- His altitude sickness is back.
- What's wrong with him?

1665
01:06:04,649 --> 01:06:06,689
(The oldest one relapsed
into his altitude sickness.)

1666
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,120
It was fun, though.

1667
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,189
When would we get to sled down
on a rick sack in the Rocky Mountains?

1668
01:06:10,189 --> 01:06:11,220
- You're right.
- Yes.

1669
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,629
- The adrenaline rush is insane.
- Right.

1670
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,399
They're still swimming.

1671
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,370
- People are swimming?
- Yes. Over there.

1672
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:25,240
They're watching people swim
in a lake made of melted ice.

1673
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,310
I love water, so...

1674
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:28,609
(Refreshing)

1675
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:30,180
Should we...

1676
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,950
- take a dip in the lake?
- Should we?

1677
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:35,720
- I'll go if you go.
- I'll go for a dip if you go.

1678
01:06:35,879 --> 01:06:37,850
Do you have to...

1679
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:41,249
How could I try to go in before you do?

1680
01:06:41,249 --> 01:06:42,560
(Shifting the responsibility
to each other)

1681
01:06:43,919 --> 01:06:45,830
Won't it be too deep?
The water was ice-cold, though.

1682
01:06:46,689 --> 01:06:49,800
- I am scared, in fact.
- It was like 6°C.

1683
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:52,370
Teo, will you just watch?

1684
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,100
- Me?
- Yes.

1685
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,669
- I'll watch.
- Okay.

1686
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,109
I'd love to,
but I shouted too much earlier.

1687
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:02,740
(He gave as many innocent shouts
as he wanted...)

1688
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:04,740
(and got drained.)

1689
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:05,749
Goodness.

1690
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:07,479
(Are you feeling okay?)

1691
01:07:07,479 --> 01:07:10,280
Maybe it was all the shouts,

1692
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,450
- but my body started to ache.
- Oh, my gosh.

1693
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:14,120
You look gaunt.

1694
01:07:14,689 --> 01:07:16,519
His mustache grew back.

1695
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:18,859
His mustache grew in the meantime.

1696
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:21,830
- It's heartbreaking to watch.
- I'm crying again.

1697
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,160
As if he had been locked up for hours.

1698
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:26,330
- I think I'll be sick as I'm too tired.
- All right, then.

1699
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:28,370
I think they're going swimming.

1700
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:29,970
(The two younger ones approach them.)

1701
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:31,970
I'd do it.

1702
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:35,080
- Sure. Let's give it a go.
- Good.

1703
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,310
Let's just try it.

1704
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,979
(He resolutely decides to go for a dip.)

1705
01:07:37,979 --> 01:07:39,010
We came all the way here, after all.

1706
01:07:39,479 --> 01:07:41,280
I thought I'd regret it if I didn't go in.

1707
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,879
Right. You'd regret it.

1708
01:07:42,879 --> 01:07:45,550
(He gets ready to dive
so that he doesn't regret it.)

1709
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:46,749
It should be about 6°C.

1710
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,620
It's currently 7°C.

1711
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,660
- It's 7°C?
- Yes.

1712
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,660
- Wait. It's 7°C?
- The water...

1713
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,390
The water should be about 4°C.

1714
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:57,999
- That's literally ice water.
- I am scared, though.

1715
01:07:57,999 --> 01:07:59,569
(They're starting to get scary.)

1716
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,899
- Or we should just dip our feet.
- Good.

1717
01:08:02,899 --> 01:08:04,640
- Just do a foot bath.
- We have our microphones.

1718
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,140
What are they doing?

1719
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:10,240
- You're getting into the water?
- Yes.

1720
01:08:10,609 --> 01:08:12,649
- Awesome.
- Why not?

1721
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:14,749
Because it's cold!

1722
01:08:14,749 --> 01:08:16,120
(Are you scared?)

1723
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,680
- See?
- Look at him!

1724
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,120
- That's an American!
- Right.

1725
01:08:19,789 --> 01:08:22,689
(They nonchalantly enter
the ice-cold water.)

1726
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,890
I've already been swimming in it.

1727
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:27,530
(They go forward without hesitation.)

1728
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:28,530
That's wild.

1729
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:30,930
(They're going in so easily.)

1730
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,569
(Diving)

1731
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:37,100
In the US, young people have
a rubdown with cold water.

1732
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:38,870
I thought only older people in Korea
did it.

1733
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,510
- That's what I'm talking about.
- It added fuel to him.

1734
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:46,109
- He can't resist that.
- It motivated him.

1735
01:08:47,379 --> 01:08:49,580
(He enjoyed the snow
with his bare bottom.)

1736
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,589
- He's making that face again.
- He is.

1737
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:58,019
I do like water, though.
I always dive in when I see one.

1738
01:08:58,019 --> 01:09:01,260
- Yes, he's been into every one of them.
- You can't miss this one.

1739
01:09:01,999 --> 01:09:04,970
I must have been an amphibian
in my previous life.

1740
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,669
(The Korean amphibian is on the move.)

1741
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,169
(Screaming)

1742
01:09:10,169 --> 01:09:11,200
Let's go.

1743
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:12,970
- All right.
- Yes!

1744
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,209
(Groaning)

1745
01:09:16,209 --> 01:09:17,680
Pani, wait.

1746
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:19,010
Something's not right.

1747
01:09:19,209 --> 01:09:20,410
(Laughing)

1748
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,220
- It must have been so cold.
- It was freezing.

1749
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:24,479
(Surprised)

1750
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,120
He's out of his mind.

1751
01:09:27,919 --> 01:09:30,490
(Pani Bottle also dips his feet.)

1752
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:32,760
It hurts.

1753
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,189
You know how it stings when it's too cold?

1754
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:35,229
- Right.
- Yes.

1755
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,129
(Thrilled)

1756
01:09:38,669 --> 01:09:41,129
Come on. Just dive in.

1757
01:09:41,129 --> 01:09:42,369
- No.
- Yes.

1758
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,600
(The older one goes first.)

1759
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,709
(His shorts are dirty.)

1760
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:48,339
- Oh, my.
- Show us.

1761
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,480
Come on.

1762
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,510
- Okay?
- The faster you do it, the better it is.

1763
01:09:53,249 --> 01:09:55,520
- Just dive in. Jump in.
- Yes.

1764
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,350
(He just dives in.)

1765
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,350
Nice!

1766
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:59,850
(He just dives in.)

1767
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:01,520
That must be refreshing.

1768
01:10:02,659 --> 01:10:03,659
Yes!

1769
01:10:04,919 --> 01:10:06,430
(I'd rather not watch.)

1770
01:10:07,129 --> 01:10:08,800
- Pani Bottle!
- It stings.

1771
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,060
(He tries to ignore him.)

1772
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:13,600
(Look at me.)

1773
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,699
Come here!

1774
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:16,600
- "Come here."
- His eyes are...

1775
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:18,739
(The younger one turns away.)

1776
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:22,140
Why did he dive in?

1777
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:24,279
This is crazy.

1778
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,619
(The locals swim
through the glacier lake.)

1779
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,150
(This Korean amphibian follows.)

1780
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:32,150
Kian84!

1781
01:10:32,989 --> 01:10:34,289
Why am I crying already?

1782
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:37,159
(He gets wet, even before he dives in.)

1783
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,390
Teo, give me CPR if I ever faint.

1784
01:10:40,489 --> 01:10:41,489
- Sure.
- Good.

1785
01:10:41,589 --> 01:10:44,300
I heard that you'd have to do it
so hard that my ribs break.

1786
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,600
Sure.

1787
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
(Make me your honorary lifeguard.)

1788
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:49,440
(He takes his clothes off
in front of the lifeguard.)

1789
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,499
(Taking them off)

1790
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:51,770
(Underwear)

1791
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,339
- Hold on. Wait.
- This is for real.

1792
01:10:53,339 --> 01:10:54,440
- Why...
- Why would you blur that?

1793
01:10:55,739 --> 01:10:57,940
- His underwear...
- It's the same color as his skin.

1794
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:00,050
Are we allowed to be on TV
with only our underwear on?

1795
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,310
No one told me.

1796
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:03,320
Why didn't anyone warn him?

1797
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,249
- Why didn't you warn me?
- Why...

1798
01:11:05,249 --> 01:11:07,890
- It's so natural.
- It's cute, though.

1799
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,959
- "Underwear Bottle?"
- The color of his underwear...

1800
01:11:10,959 --> 01:11:12,730
You wore a fancy one this time.

1801
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,999
(He habitually takes his shirts off.)

1802
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,999
(He once ran through the rain
in his underwear.)

1803
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,869
(Diving)

1804
01:11:21,869 --> 01:11:22,940
All right!

1805
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:25,440
(Today, I run in a glacier lake.)

1806
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,510
(That's my younger brother!)

1807
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,579
He went in, after all.

1808
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:34,650
- Nice.
- Pani Bottle.

1809
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:36,879
(Screaming)

1810
01:11:36,879 --> 01:11:37,949
Are you all right?

1811
01:11:37,949 --> 01:11:39,449
(A shiver that reaches deep
into his bones)

1812
01:11:39,449 --> 01:11:40,850
(Shivering)

1813
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,659
(His madness level rises
when he's in his underwear.)

1814
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:43,959
(Grunting)

1815
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:47,360
(The innocent guy loves it.)

1816
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,360
This is hilarious.

1817
01:11:49,659 --> 01:11:51,230
Mom.

1818
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:54,430
- It's only tough in the beginning.
- You're impressive.

1819
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:55,940
It gets better with time.

1820
01:11:57,570 --> 01:11:59,869
(While the younger one is screaming,)

1821
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,579
(the older one leisurely enjoys
the water.)

1822
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:04,379
- That's amazing.
- He's relaxed.

1823
01:12:04,379 --> 01:12:07,010
Look at him go.
He's going for the distance.

1824
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:08,879
(One with nature)

1825
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,680
I always prefer
actually experiencing it...

1826
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:13,449
over just watching it.

1827
01:12:13,749 --> 01:12:15,659
The Ganges River was called Mother Ganges.

1828
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,989
I could only become one with it
by going into it.

1829
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,260
You have a lot of mothers
all over the world.

1830
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:22,760
Goodness.

1831
01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:25,629
The whole world embraces Kian84.

1832
01:12:27,029 --> 01:12:29,940
I put myself in the Rocky Mountains,

1833
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:32,610
and I actually experience it.

1834
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:34,270
I feel like I'm one with nature
only if I'm in the water.

1835
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,550
I can't seem to get used
to the temperature.

1836
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:42,020
- You look in shape.
- It makes you fit.

1837
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,079
Pani Bottle also looks swoll
all of a sudden.

1838
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:47,249
We look
like an unpopular pro-wrestling duo.

1839
01:12:47,589 --> 01:12:49,489
(And there's always something missing
for them.)

1840
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,930
An unpopular pro-wrestling duo
that works for livelihood.

1841
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:54,329
- Those are muscles for survival.
- Yes.

1842
01:12:55,629 --> 01:12:57,400
- Oh, my gosh.
- Pani Bottle.

1843
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,730
(Feeling dizzy)

1844
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:00,800
It's so...

1845
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:04,869
I can't believe how long
those Americans are staying there.

1846
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:07,209
- I'm starting to feel...
- You guys win.

1847
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,739
Good.

1848
01:13:09,739 --> 01:13:10,810
(They admit their defeat.)

1849
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:12,279
It feels like...

1850
01:13:12,279 --> 01:13:13,449
(Sniffling)

1851
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:17,050
(The younger one immediately gets
his clothes.)

1852
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,789
Gosh.

1853
01:13:19,449 --> 01:13:21,520
Guys with that body type are surely...

1854
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,119
He dries his hair with his pants.

1855
01:13:23,489 --> 01:13:25,589
He's learned a lot from Kian84.

1856
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,089
I'm his direct junior.

1857
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:30,029
Gosh.

1858
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,800
Oh, man.

1859
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,930
(Poor Pani Bottle)

1860
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:35,169
Wait. I'll give you a jacket.

1861
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,100
Once I get out, I feel okay.

1862
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,140
But you better have it.

1863
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:40,970
- Goodness.
- He's so kind.

1864
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:43,039
It's a good fit for him.

1865
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:44,079
(He gives his clothing right away
for Pani Bottle.)

1866
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:46,110
How dare you show a weak attitude?

1867
01:13:47,709 --> 01:13:49,050
Pani Bottle, let's go down
without such a thing!

1868
01:13:49,449 --> 01:13:51,820
- Then, you will get a cold!
- Let me just wear this one.

1869
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,350
How can you go down
just with the underpants?

1870
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:55,860
- The only issue here is mosquitoes.
- I will go down as is.

1871
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,459
No way!

1872
01:13:57,589 --> 01:13:59,430
You will catch a cold!

1873
01:13:59,629 --> 01:14:01,589
This cold is nothing to me!

1874
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,060
- It's warm, isn't it?
- It's very warm!

1875
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,369
(He's fighting against the cold alone.)

1876
01:14:07,369 --> 01:14:09,300
(Glancing)

1877
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,070
Where did you get the long clothing?

1878
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,440
(Kian84, where did you get it?)

1879
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,010
I took it before we moved.

1880
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:19,709
- Why?
- I was the fool.

1881
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,619
He told me not to wear such a thing!

1882
01:14:22,949 --> 01:14:25,249
(He has everything
from short to long clothes.)

1883
01:14:25,589 --> 01:14:27,520
Didn't you say you will go down as is?

1884
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,089
- It was just a joke...
- He even had long clothes.

1885
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:31,659
(I should survive too.)

1886
01:14:32,589 --> 01:14:34,690
(While he's covering his gap of saying
with a full of clothes...)

1887
01:14:35,129 --> 01:14:36,459
My lower half is freezing!

1888
01:14:36,659 --> 01:14:38,499
- I don't feel anything on my feet.
- As you two jumped into the water,

1889
01:14:38,499 --> 01:14:39,930
I will make the stew.

1890
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:41,129
- I can drink soju...
- I'm expecting it!

1891
01:14:41,129 --> 01:14:42,440
- from the bottle with it.
- Sure.

1892
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,239
- I'm so hungry.
- I will make a spicy one this time.

1893
01:14:44,369 --> 01:14:47,409
(After having fun in the water,
they move to the warm lodging.)

1894
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:50,339
(Oh, my goodness)

1895
01:14:50,339 --> 01:14:52,050
I like cars.

1896
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:54,550
Oh, it's very good.

1897
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:57,249
(He's truly feeling the warmth
inside the car.)

1898
01:14:57,249 --> 01:14:58,279
(Yes, this is it!)

1899
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:00,690
Good!

1900
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:03,459
(Feeling happy)

1901
01:15:03,459 --> 01:15:05,089
Pani Bottle, it was a good idea
to come over here today.

1902
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,129
The view of the Rocky Mountains
was amazing.

1903
01:15:07,129 --> 01:15:08,159
Thanks to you,

1904
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,629
I could get the chance
to swim in the lake there.

1905
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:14,570
I have a frog in my throat now
as I shouted too long before.

1906
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:17,169
You suddenly changed then,

1907
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,739
shouting out too loud.

1908
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:21,070
It startled me.

1909
01:15:21,169 --> 01:15:22,409
I hadn't seen Teo before,

1910
01:15:22,409 --> 01:15:23,980
so I didn't know he was like that.

1911
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,310
It was so much fun.

1912
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:26,749
(He left a strong first impression.)

1913
01:15:26,949 --> 01:15:29,020
- We're off.
- Let's go!

1914
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:30,320
(Pani Bottle drives this time as well.)

1915
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,249
(Anyway, we were all satisfied
with Pani Bottle's course.)

1916
01:15:34,249 --> 01:15:36,489
- That's right.
- It was just so good.

1917
01:15:36,489 --> 01:15:38,959
As they liked my plan,
I was also quite excited, leading them.

1918
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:41,589
Once I take the shower,
I will start cooking.

1919
01:15:41,789 --> 01:15:42,959
I don't think I need to take a shower.

1920
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,999
Because you were in the lake?

1921
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:47,800
I already took a shower in the water
from the Rocky Mountains.

1922
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,070
- It's the Rocky shower.
- "Rocky shower."

1923
01:15:49,239 --> 01:15:50,739
It was holy water.

1924
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:52,140
- "Rocky Vicky!"
- Yes, it's "Rocky Vicky."

1925
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,440
"Rocky Vicky?"

1926
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,940
It's Rocky Vicky!

1927
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,079
(Their trip to Denver is so Rocky Vicky.)

1928
01:15:57,079 --> 01:15:59,850
It's a very peaceful village.

1929
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,249
(It's a quiet village in the woods.)

1930
01:16:02,249 --> 01:16:04,879
- We moved further deep into the forest.
- There's no sign of a human being.

1931
01:16:04,949 --> 01:16:07,789
So, you were entering Mother Nature.

1932
01:16:07,789 --> 01:16:08,820
(They go deeper to feel Mother Nature.)

1933
01:16:09,659 --> 01:16:11,589
I think it's a hidden place
even for Americans.

1934
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:13,459
- It's at the end...
- Is it an unpaved road?

1935
01:16:13,459 --> 01:16:14,690
It's at the end of the road.

1936
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:16,459
I see it now.

1937
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,529
(Exclaiming)

1938
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:22,570
We've arrived. The view is amazing.

1939
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:24,339
You've done so well.

1940
01:16:24,339 --> 01:16:26,610
Thanks for your efforts!

1941
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:27,669
(The driver, Pani Bottle,
had hard work all day.)

1942
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:29,940
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1943
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:33,909
We've arrived.

1944
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:38,079
This is the lodging Pani Bottle booked.

1945
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:41,190
Is it a pension?

1946
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,289
- Goodness.
- That is...

1947
01:16:44,289 --> 01:16:46,129
- I can't imagine a lodging in the forest.
- It's so good!

1948
01:16:46,129 --> 01:16:47,860
- You rented the whole house?
- Yes, it's for us only.

1949
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,360
That's so cool.

1950
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,699
I guessed they didn't get a full sleep
in a hostel in New York,

1951
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:55,400
so I put comfort at the top list,
even though it's expensive.

1952
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,539
(Smelling)

1953
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:00,070
It's cool.

1954
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,539
(They enter the lodge,
taking a deep breath of phytoncide.)

1955
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,680
(This is amazing!)

1956
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:07,150
Let's turn on the light.

1957
01:17:07,879 --> 01:17:09,680
- Goodness.
- It's so huge.

1958
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:12,119
- I can't believe we are here.
- Where is the kitchen?

1959
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:13,350
Let's go upstairs.

1960
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:14,890
As we are in the mountain areas,

1961
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:16,959
we're on the first floor,

1962
01:17:16,959 --> 01:17:18,520
that's the second.

1963
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,659
We can get there through the stairs.

1964
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,199
- Gosh!
- This is the living room!

1965
01:17:24,499 --> 01:17:25,829
(The size of the 2nd floor made them
all startled.)

1966
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:27,270
Gosh!

1967
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,169
- Oh, my!
- It's huge!

1968
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,570
It's the greatest lodge
we haven't seen in this program.

1969
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:32,940
It looks so fancy!

1970
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:35,440
- This place is literally amazing.
- Gosh!

1971
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,079
- Is that the kitchen?
- Yes, it is.

1972
01:17:37,339 --> 01:17:40,680
- It's like a place we see in movies.
- That's right.

1973
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:43,720
(The valley that took the beauty
of the Rocky makes it even more perfect.)

1974
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:47,489
I will start cooking soon.

1975
01:17:47,489 --> 01:17:48,860
- Yes.
- You two are hungry, right?

1976
01:17:49,089 --> 01:17:52,159
- Let's change our clothes as we are wet.
- It's cold.

1977
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:53,329
(What's this?)

1978
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:54,789
We even have a fireplace.

1979
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,629
- Gosh!
- I liked that so much!

1980
01:17:56,629 --> 01:17:58,430
- That's so nice.
- It gives a cozy vibe.

1981
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:00,300
- Can you light it now?
- As we have firewood...

1982
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,839
- Let's burn it.
- We should use it. It's too cold.

1983
01:18:03,339 --> 01:18:05,039
- It's a good idea!
- I will...

1984
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:07,169
- Shall we begin?
- This is my seat!

1985
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,209
- You mean cooking?
- The light is...

1986
01:18:09,709 --> 01:18:10,739
Okay.

1987
01:18:10,739 --> 01:18:13,879
I have one habit whenever I cook.

1988
01:18:13,879 --> 01:18:15,850
I need to listen to music.

1989
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,180
- Nice.
- That's good.

1990
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:20,020
- I've got a good Bluetooth speaker.
- It's like we are in the movie scene.

1991
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,959
- I will prepare while listening to music.
- I got it.

1992
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:24,589
I need to change clothes first.

1993
01:18:24,589 --> 01:18:27,360
- Is this the Bluetooth speaker?
- That's right.

1994
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,829
It fits well with a military look.

1995
01:18:29,829 --> 01:18:31,560
It's more like a camping vibe.

1996
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,570
It also looks like a robot.

1997
01:18:34,129 --> 01:18:35,600
(Music on)

1998
01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:37,400
The sound quality is good!

1999
01:18:37,699 --> 01:18:39,539
- The sound was really good.
- I like it.

2000
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,310
(After turning on the speaker,
which can help him cook,)

2001
01:18:42,739 --> 01:18:45,339
(he moves to the kitchen.)

2002
01:18:46,709 --> 01:18:48,350
(Let's see.)

2003
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,749
We need to light it.

2004
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:52,249
- I will do it, Kian84!
- Do you know how to?

2005
01:18:52,249 --> 01:18:53,589
All I need is a lighter.

2006
01:18:53,589 --> 01:18:55,089
I will do it once I change my clothes.

2007
01:18:55,089 --> 01:18:57,159
I only need to change my pants.

2008
01:18:57,390 --> 01:19:00,560
As I came all the way
from Brooklyn to Colorado,

2009
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,789
I need to refresh my feelings.

2010
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:04,629
Should I help you, Teo?

2011
01:19:04,829 --> 01:19:06,829
- Don't worry. I can handle it all.
- Everything is okay?

2012
01:19:07,029 --> 01:19:08,499
- Take some rest first!
- I got it.

2013
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,699
I'm so tired.

2014
01:19:10,699 --> 01:19:11,770
(Thanks to him,
Pani Bottle gets some rest.)

2015
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:13,409
- He drove too long.
- Gosh!

2016
01:19:13,409 --> 01:19:14,539
Due to a cold...

2017
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:15,980
(Getting up)

2018
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,039
This is...

2019
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:20,010
(We need warmth right now!)

2020
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:21,550
- That's it!
- Yes.

2021
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:23,820
We need to put it here.

2022
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:26,050
- Pile them slowly.
- I know.

2023
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:27,119
(They need warmth so bad
after the swim in the lake.)

2024
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:29,289
(Please, we need you so bad!)

2025
01:19:29,289 --> 01:19:30,289
We did.

2026
01:19:30,289 --> 01:19:33,260
If we hadn't entered the lake
in the Rocky,

2027
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,760
we wouldn't have felt this warmth now.

2028
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,029
- Rocky Vicky!
- Rocky Vicky!

2029
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,629
The way of feeling happiness
from a hard experience!

2030
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:40,999
It's burning well!

2031
01:19:41,629 --> 01:19:42,669
Gosh!

2032
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:43,940
(Happy Bottle)

2033
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:44,970
It's like a paradise.

2034
01:19:46,209 --> 01:19:47,270
That's good.

2035
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,270
(They completed the fireplace
that will melt down them.)

2036
01:19:48,879 --> 01:19:49,879
(While they are feeling happiness
after experiencing cold...)

2037
01:19:49,879 --> 01:19:51,079
This is so good.

2038
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,209
Nice!

2039
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,050
Let's begin!

2040
01:19:58,749 --> 01:20:01,820
(He starts with boiling water.)

2041
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:04,220
I need a strong broth for the start.

2042
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,789
Did you even make your own broth?

2043
01:20:05,789 --> 01:20:07,489
(He added a lot of ingredients to it.)

2044
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:11,629
(He's showing great skill
in cutting with his thick muscles.)

2045
01:20:11,629 --> 01:20:13,999
- His skill is amazing.
- He's very sexy!

2046
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,770
And he does everything very quickly.

2047
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:18,909
(He prepares quickly,
worrying about the two.)

2048
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:23,039
(He finished the doenjang stew
in a second.)

2049
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,050
(While his dishes are being completed...)

2050
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:28,150
(Blowing)

2051
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,850
Gosh. It's out now.

2052
01:20:32,249 --> 01:20:34,190
We need to add left firewood again.

2053
01:20:34,619 --> 01:20:36,589
- What are you going to do tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

2054
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,560
We can think about it later.

2055
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,230
- Kian84, didn't you say...
- Yes?

2056
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:42,329
you wanted to see a tornado?

2057
01:20:42,329 --> 01:20:43,400
- A tornado?
- Yes.

2058
01:20:43,829 --> 01:20:44,930
"Tornado?"

2059
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,100
- Yes, he did many times.
- Tornado?

2060
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,669
He even wanted to be in the middle of it.

2061
01:20:48,669 --> 01:20:50,070
- Really?
- He said that. I remember as well.

2062
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,100
(He noticed a small size of a whirlwind.)

2063
01:20:51,839 --> 01:20:54,070
(It's one of my wishes to be
in the middle of it before I die!)

2064
01:20:54,339 --> 01:20:56,610
(He heard Kian84's desperate wish.)

2065
01:20:56,879 --> 01:20:58,610
(Come here!)

2066
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,150
Just seeing it drives me crazy.

2067
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,419
- You didn't see it anyway, did you?
- I still dream of it when I sleep!

2068
01:21:04,419 --> 01:21:05,749
- You mean a tornado?
- Yes!

2069
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:08,850
I don't even dream of my ex anymore...

2070
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,820
but of tornados.

2071
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,730
As I saw one before,
so if you want to see it...

2072
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:16,659
- Did you see the column?
- I did.

2073
01:21:17,329 --> 01:21:19,629
I envy you so much.

2074
01:21:19,629 --> 01:21:21,930
It needs more than luck.

2075
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:24,869
Some people I was with had been there
over 14 times,

2076
01:21:24,869 --> 01:21:26,369
but I saw it in six days.

2077
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:29,110
You are a lucky guy.

2078
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,079
People who chase those are called
storm chasers.

2079
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:34,449
- "Storm chasers."
- If you do want to try it,

2080
01:21:34,449 --> 01:21:36,350
- I know a contact of those guys.
- I see.

2081
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:38,249
After I finish the tour,

2082
01:21:38,249 --> 01:21:40,850
I thought I wanted
to recommend this to you.

2083
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,619
I also got some details.

2084
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:46,829
But we need to try that while
we're on the way to shooting this program.

2085
01:21:46,829 --> 01:21:49,629
But tornadoes are not waiting for us.

2086
01:21:49,629 --> 01:21:51,060
They find storms.

2087
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,169
They even have their own gears
in their cars.

2088
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:55,800
Then, they check the weather forecast
every day.

2089
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,440
"It will come in this direction!"

2090
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,310
- Then, they rush into their cars.
- Really?

2091
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:02,140
If they see a tornado,
they're lucky on that day,

2092
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:03,510
if not, they see a storm at least.

2093
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,239
Of course, there are lightning.

2094
01:22:05,779 --> 01:22:07,579
- There are a lot of lightning.
- "Lightning?"

2095
01:22:07,579 --> 01:22:09,680
- Things we saw in Madagascar?
- That was a joke!

2096
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,320
- Seriously?
- You can clearly see it.

2097
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,749
I'd be struck by lightning, then.

2098
01:22:14,489 --> 01:22:16,659
- If you're lucky.
- Yes. If I'm lucky enough.

2099
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:19,560
Then shall we have a call?
I have the number.

2100
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:22,190
Hello?

2101
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:25,360
- Hello?
- Yes. Hello.

2102
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,230
Are you the storm chaser?

2103
01:22:29,169 --> 01:22:30,699
Sorry? Hello?

2104
01:22:30,699 --> 01:22:32,039
What's it?

2105
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,270
- Yes, I am.
- Yes.

2106
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:37,839
If we want to see a tornado tomorrow,

2107
01:22:37,839 --> 01:22:40,110
where do we have to go?

2108
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:44,249
Yes. You can meet me
in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

2109
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:46,249
(Disconnected again)

2110
01:22:46,249 --> 01:22:47,320
Okay.

2111
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,560
- Hello?
- Oh, sure.

2112
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:50,919
Can't he hear me?

2113
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:53,860
- Because he's around a tornado?
- Are you...

2114
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,760
Wait...

2115
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,129
Could you please send me the location
for me?

2116
01:22:59,129 --> 01:23:01,300
- Yes, I will send it right now to you.
- Okay.

2117
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:03,669
- The connection is...
- See you tomorrow.

2118
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:04,999
Okay.

2119
01:23:05,499 --> 01:23:06,940
- The connection isn't good.
- I see.

2120
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:10,510
As I already had seen one,

2121
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:12,650
- I do want to go.
- you please go instead of me.

2122
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:13,680
(He's so desperate.)

2123
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:17,419
When someone told me about a concert,
I was not envious.

2124
01:23:17,949 --> 01:23:20,789
For example,
NewJeans concerts or whatever.

2125
01:23:20,789 --> 01:23:23,119
- I don't feel anything.
- I'm envious of it.

2126
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:26,360
But tornadoes...

2127
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:29,230
They are not something I can see
even if I want.

2128
01:23:29,499 --> 01:23:31,999
As I already saw one,
you please go instead of me.

2129
01:23:31,999 --> 01:23:34,029
What you said is so annoying.

2130
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:35,940
It makes me angry.

2131
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,400
- I felt envious so much.
- I almost missed it, seriously.

2132
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,709
He said it was his wish.

2133
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,980
- Kian84.
- Yes?

2134
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,310
- Pani Bottle.
- Yes.

2135
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:47,949
I ran a bath for you downstairs.

2136
01:23:48,409 --> 01:23:51,249
Take a warm bath while I'm cooking.

2137
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,550
As expected.

2138
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:55,919
Teo will do that every day
for someone who marries him.

2139
01:23:55,919 --> 01:23:57,860
- He's married already.
- I know.

2140
01:23:58,789 --> 01:24:00,489
- I feel sorry.
- He feels sorry.

2141
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:02,930
It's a shame.

2142
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:06,300
(Seeing Pani Bottle
is coming down with a cold,)

2143
01:24:07,329 --> 01:24:11,869
(Teo ran a bath as soon as he came back.)

2144
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,539
Goodness, he's so sweet.

2145
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:18,579
I caught a cold, so he ran a bath
for me like this.

2146
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:20,249
Great.

2147
01:24:20,909 --> 01:24:23,879
Gosh, darn it. It's too hot.

2148
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,379
I didn't know it was that hot.

2149
01:24:25,379 --> 01:24:27,520
(Teo's heart feels too hot.)

2150
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:31,119
Gosh, it's hot.

2151
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:36,300
(Resuming bath again
after calming down for a while)

2152
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,499
Among men I've seen in my life,

2153
01:24:38,499 --> 01:24:40,329
you're the one whose naked body
I saw the most.

2154
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:43,739
It's the most naked scene
available on MBC.

2155
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:46,539
- It's the most.
- Your naked body and my naked body.

2156
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:47,570
(They share the most natural look
of each other.)

2157
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:49,440
I've seen your naked body really a lot.

2158
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,610
(His naked body feels familiar now.)

2159
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:52,279
(Conscious)

2160
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,150
(Cool Man Bottle
fights back with his face.)

2161
01:24:58,150 --> 01:24:59,220
A cool man.

2162
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,249
(Feeling hot)

2163
01:25:00,249 --> 01:25:01,520
Why are we looking at this?

2164
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:03,060
- They played it in slow.
- This is so funny.

2165
01:25:04,289 --> 01:25:05,890
He suddenly got handsome.

2166
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,029
He never leaves the kitchen
and keeps cooking.

2167
01:25:10,329 --> 01:25:12,400
(Adding kimchi)

2168
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:14,529
(A combination loved by Korean people)

2169
01:25:14,529 --> 01:25:15,970
Looking at it makes me feel hungry.

2170
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:18,140
(This is it.)

2171
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,669
(Cooking two dishes at the same time)

2172
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:24,079
He's using two burners at the same time.

2173
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:26,409
(Tasting)

2174
01:25:28,579 --> 01:25:29,949
- I'm hungry.
- I feel hungry.

2175
01:25:30,249 --> 01:25:31,419
I suddenly got hungry.

2176
01:25:40,289 --> 01:25:42,959
He doesn't measure the ingredients.
It looks good!

2177
01:25:42,959 --> 01:25:43,959
Kimchi and pork belly.

2178
01:25:43,959 --> 01:25:45,829
It looks really good.

2179
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,430
It looks just right.

2180
01:25:49,169 --> 01:25:51,900
(Almost done)

2181
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:56,839
(The dish is cooked so easily.)

2182
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:00,209
(Holding dishes in both arms)

2183
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:05,180
It looks good.

2184
01:26:06,589 --> 01:26:07,650
He cooks easily and quickly.

2185
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:09,860
I could tell he's been cooking
for a long time.

2186
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:11,060
(Embarrassed)

2187
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:13,289
(The stew is a finishing touch.)

2188
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:16,629
- It looks really good.
- His dishes are really good.

2189
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:17,900
(A meal cooked by Teo is completed.)

2190
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,369
It's what Kian84 bought.

2191
01:26:19,629 --> 01:26:21,629
- There's radish kimchi too.
- Goodness.

2192
01:26:22,169 --> 01:26:23,739
(A hearty meal)

2193
01:26:23,739 --> 01:26:24,739
It's a sumptuous feast.

2194
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,470
- Come here. Let's eat.
- Okay.

2195
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,779
(A meal?)

2196
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:33,810
(Soft and Clean Bottle comes out quickly.)

2197
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:34,810
Soft and Clean Bottle.

2198
01:26:35,949 --> 01:26:37,520
(Licking his lips)

2199
01:26:37,779 --> 01:26:40,919
Goodness, Teo.
You're really quick with his hands.

2200
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:43,989
They're really like a family.

2201
01:26:44,089 --> 01:26:46,690
It was like a meal my mom cooked.

2202
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:47,890
(Proud)

2203
01:26:47,989 --> 01:26:49,089
Thank you for the meal.

2204
01:26:49,089 --> 01:26:50,860
(Mommy Teo gives food
to the youngest first.)

2205
01:26:51,329 --> 01:26:53,100
- Gosh, I feel so hungry.
- I love mushrooms.

2206
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:54,699
(Licking his lips again)

2207
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:57,369
They have a drink too.

2208
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:58,940
Teo.

2209
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,239
(They purchased Korean soju.)

2210
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:02,510
These days, soju without sugar is popular.

2211
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:03,709
All right.

2212
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:05,310
Let's drink.

2213
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:06,550
- All right.
- Cheers.

2214
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:07,579
Cheers.

2215
01:27:07,579 --> 01:27:10,249
- It looks good.
- It must have been the happiest moment.

2216
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,489
(Exclaiming)

2217
01:27:15,289 --> 01:27:16,289
Goodness.

2218
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,860
I cooked the stew spicy on purpose.

2219
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,560
I want to try.

2220
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:23,459
(Mesmerized)

2221
01:27:23,459 --> 01:27:24,459
The broth is so deep.

2222
01:27:24,529 --> 01:27:26,499
It's the taste
that can completely cure his cold.

2223
01:27:26,499 --> 01:27:28,199
You know, the doenjang stew
with deep broth.

2224
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:29,199
Right.

2225
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:33,339
- It tastes like spicy fish stew.
- That's what I'm saying.

2226
01:27:34,039 --> 01:27:35,810
How can I have such a deep-tasting stew
in America?

2227
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,909
(Spicy)

2228
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:42,079
- Three of us are tired,
- Right.

2229
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:45,050
and we have cold symptoms
since it's dry here.

2230
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:47,119
So we need to eat something spicy.

2231
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,419
You thought that and cooked it spicy?

2232
01:27:50,419 --> 01:27:51,419
Of course.

2233
01:27:51,419 --> 01:27:52,419
(He picked the menu
considering others' condition.)

2234
01:27:52,419 --> 01:27:53,489
He's the best.

2235
01:27:53,489 --> 01:27:54,890
(Sweet)

2236
01:27:55,089 --> 01:27:57,430
(He doesn't stop eating.)

2237
01:27:57,959 --> 01:27:59,029
This is so good. I mean it.

2238
01:27:59,629 --> 01:28:02,770
It tastes good in Korea, and it will be
even better in a foreign country.

2239
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:03,900
It looks really good.

2240
01:28:05,499 --> 01:28:07,510
You should try this.

2241
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,310
I feel hungry.

2242
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:12,310
(Kian84 takes a big bite too.)

2243
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:14,279
(Impressed)

2244
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:17,650
Teo, there's a Korean restaurant
in Madagascar.

2245
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:20,489
Your food tastes similar to
the food the owner cooked.

2246
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,850
(He agrees.)

2247
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:22,890
The place where he sang.

2248
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:25,289
(The same touching feeling felt in Denver)

2249
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:27,959
- This is so good.
- When I was in New York...

2250
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:31,329
as an actor without much money,

2251
01:28:31,329 --> 01:28:32,999
I had so many part-time jobs...

2252
01:28:32,999 --> 01:28:34,770
and worked in restaurants too.

2253
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:36,140
- Korean restaurants?
- Yes.

2254
01:28:36,839 --> 01:28:37,839
Korean restaurants?

2255
01:28:37,839 --> 01:28:39,810
No, I never worked in a Korean restaurant.

2256
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:42,940
While cooking in other restaurants...

2257
01:28:43,839 --> 01:28:45,310
(Taking a big bite)

2258
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:47,879
(Digging in as he pretends to listen)

2259
01:28:47,879 --> 01:28:48,879
Goodness.

2260
01:28:48,879 --> 01:28:50,079
(Coughing)

2261
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:51,079
Are you choking on the food?

2262
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:52,279
Don't eat too fast.

2263
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:54,390
(That shows your food is so good.)

2264
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:56,560
(Taking a big bite)

2265
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:58,419
Teo, what are you going to do tomorrow?

2266
01:28:58,989 --> 01:29:01,860
I recommended chasing tornado to Kian84.

2267
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:03,800
I made a search.

2268
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:07,199
There's a magazine
called "Cowboys and Indians."

2269
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,199
The cowboys in Western movies.

2270
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:11,499
- Cowboy?
- Yes, "Cowboys and Indians."

2271
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,440
And fortunately, in tomorrow evening,

2272
01:29:15,169 --> 01:29:18,980
they have a cowboy event in Bandera.

2273
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:20,510
- Bandera?
- Bandera.

2274
01:29:20,749 --> 01:29:22,879
I guess they have a kind of festival.

2275
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,749
And that's tomorrow evening.

2276
01:29:25,379 --> 01:29:27,020
Are there still cowboys these days?

2277
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,350
They call a ranch manager a cowboy.

2278
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:30,560
Cow and boy.

2279
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,029
And I got to know the magazine,
"Cowboys and Indians,"

2280
01:29:33,029 --> 01:29:35,860
from someone I met at the Oscar Awards.

2281
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,829
He was a supporting actor
in a Scorsese movie.

2282
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,470
His name is Tatanka Means.

2283
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:42,730
He's a native American,

2284
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:45,839
and I got acquainted with him
that we contact each other.

2285
01:29:45,999 --> 01:29:48,409
That's how I got the information.

2286
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:49,409
That's amazing.

2287
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,839
And that's tomorrow evening.

2288
01:29:52,779 --> 01:29:55,980
What I'm most interested in...

2289
01:29:56,379 --> 01:29:58,579
is my instinct.

2290
01:29:58,579 --> 01:30:02,820
And my instinct starts from
the survival instinct.

2291
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:06,560
The cowboy culture
is one of the cultures...

2292
01:30:06,789 --> 01:30:09,829
that has to survive in nature.

2293
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:12,430
I was curious about
what music cowboys play...

2294
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,640
and how they hang out on the ranch.

2295
01:30:17,699 --> 01:30:22,610
The cowboys in America, ranchers,

2296
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:25,810
the workers that come to the ranches
and work.

2297
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:28,079
I'm interested in cowboy culture.

2298
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:30,320
They use a gun or a bow and arrows...

2299
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,449
and catch wild pigs and cows in reality.

2300
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:35,850
That's a fantasy for me.

2301
01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:37,659
Grand ranch lives.

2302
01:30:39,529 --> 01:30:42,459
(A cowboy follows his instinct in life.)

2303
01:30:43,129 --> 01:30:46,270
Bandera is a world capital of cowboys.

2304
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:47,930
- A capital?
- Yes, Bandera.

2305
01:30:48,669 --> 01:30:52,400
(Cowboy culture has been
Teo's fantasy for a long time.)

2306
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,339
In the cowboy life,

2307
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:57,279
they have country and folk music.

2308
01:30:57,279 --> 01:30:58,480
(You can't miss out country music.)

2309
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:03,350
(Country music shows joys and sorrows
of American rural areas.)

2310
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:05,949
It's in the Texas State.

2311
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:07,820
- Texas State.
- Yes.

2312
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:10,360
We need to go down to Bandera.

2313
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:13,260
Isn't Texas too far to drive?

2314
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:15,260
- They're both far.
- Right.

2315
01:31:15,489 --> 01:31:17,060
South Dakota is far,

2316
01:31:17,529 --> 01:31:20,869
and the place where Teo wants to see
is far away too.

2317
01:31:20,869 --> 01:31:22,369
We need to return the car
at the airport anyway.

2318
01:31:22,369 --> 01:31:23,739
We should purchase...

2319
01:31:23,839 --> 01:31:26,339
the domestic airline tickets,

2320
01:31:26,669 --> 01:31:29,239
- Let's decide...
- and let's travel separately tomorrow.

2321
01:31:30,539 --> 01:31:33,079
(Let's travel separately tomorrow.)

2322
01:31:33,079 --> 01:31:34,180
Travel separately?

2323
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,650
Alone?

2324
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:37,320
Is he really going to
see the tornado alone?

2325
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,320
Are you going to work as a unit already?

2326
01:31:39,749 --> 01:31:42,150
- Let's decide...
- Let's travel separately tomorrow.

2327
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:43,419
- Let's decide...
- Let's...

2328
01:31:43,419 --> 01:31:46,119
(Let's travel separately tomorrow.)

2329
01:31:46,119 --> 01:31:47,560
(You want to travel separately?)

2330
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,029
Aren't you going to go with him?

2331
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:51,329
It's because...

2332
01:31:51,329 --> 01:31:52,329
(Conscious of Kian84)

2333
01:31:52,329 --> 01:31:53,529
I've seen a tornado.

2334
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:56,199
Have you?

2335
01:31:56,199 --> 01:31:59,839
So, I'll go to Texas with Teo,

2336
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:02,339
and we can travel separately for a while.

2337
01:32:03,409 --> 01:32:06,449
(He wants to see a tornado,)

2338
01:32:06,449 --> 01:32:08,810
(but he doesn't want to go separately.)

2339
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,820
Saying goodbye right after meeting...
That happens.

2340
01:32:13,289 --> 01:32:14,390
- I see.
- I've seen a tornado.

2341
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,220
(Lonely)

2342
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:19,629
You can go see a tornado...

2343
01:32:19,629 --> 01:32:20,959
What if I don't see it?

2344
01:32:21,589 --> 01:32:23,329
I guess I should go back to Brooklyn.

2345
01:32:24,699 --> 01:32:25,959
(That's where my friends are.)

2346
01:32:25,959 --> 01:32:27,129
Then you're saying goodbye to us.

2347
01:32:27,829 --> 01:32:29,070
Let's go separately.

2348
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:30,839
(Teasing)

2349
01:32:32,369 --> 01:32:35,739
- Well, then... Did you really see it?
- All right.

2350
01:32:35,739 --> 01:32:36,779
It's true.

2351
01:32:36,779 --> 01:32:39,180
If it's a lie, it means you hate me.

2352
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:41,879
- Why would I tell a lie?
- Not to go with me.

2353
01:32:41,879 --> 01:32:42,879
(Thinking hard)

2354
01:32:42,879 --> 01:32:45,379
Okay. Then let's do that.

2355
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:46,550
I think...

2356
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,860
you can go to South Dakota,

2357
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:51,419
(Going across America)

2358
01:32:51,419 --> 01:32:53,390
and we can go to Texas tomorrow.

2359
01:32:53,829 --> 01:32:55,930
I've never experienced cowboy culture.

2360
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:57,230
(They're going to
completely different places!)

2361
01:32:57,699 --> 01:33:01,400
Shall we travel separately
for one day and meet again?

2362
01:33:01,499 --> 01:33:02,499
All right.

2363
01:33:02,669 --> 01:33:05,369
Kian84 wanted to see a tornado.

2364
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:07,839
Actually, there's no one-day tour.

2365
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,940
But we discussed it
with the production crew...

2366
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:12,940
and made a special request
so that he could do the tour.

2367
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:14,379
It's a Pani Bottle chance.

2368
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:17,150
Then where shall we meet again?

2369
01:33:17,619 --> 01:33:18,879
(Teary eyes)

2370
01:33:18,879 --> 01:33:20,919
Goodness. His eyes look sad.

2371
01:33:21,489 --> 01:33:24,760
We can get in touch again
after the tour is over.

2372
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:27,360
- Can we?
- We're not going to leave forever.

2373
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,900
I mean, there's no hard plan.

2374
01:33:30,029 --> 01:33:32,560
- No way we go separately forever.
- There's no hard plan.

2375
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,770
He needs to be soothed.

2376
01:33:34,329 --> 01:33:35,329
We'll get in touch...

2377
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,270
- We can always plan to gather somewhere.
- I feel sad.

2378
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:39,600
(A short goodbye for their dreams)

2379
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,610
- You got a text message.
- What?

2380
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:44,909
(Who is it?)

2381
01:33:45,909 --> 01:33:46,909
Right.

2382
01:33:46,909 --> 01:33:47,909
- The storm chaser?
- From earlier?

2383
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:52,579
This person
is chasing after a storm right now,

2384
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,749
so his signal is weak.

2385
01:33:54,289 --> 01:33:56,050
That was why
we couldn't get in touch earlier.

2386
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:59,690
"The chances of seeing a tornado are..."

2387
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:01,129
"quite good right now."

2388
01:34:01,129 --> 01:34:02,959
- It's quite good.
- It's quite good.

2389
01:34:02,959 --> 01:34:04,100
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

2390
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,629
- The chances are not bad...
- Yes?

2391
01:34:06,629 --> 01:34:07,699
as of tonight.

2392
01:34:07,699 --> 01:34:08,770
- Really?
- Yes.

2393
01:34:09,169 --> 01:34:10,300
You can see one.

2394
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,499
I got excited.

2395
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,739
He wants to meet
at Sioux Falls Regional Airport.

2396
01:34:14,739 --> 01:34:15,810
- Yes.
- Okay.

2397
01:34:15,869 --> 01:34:16,909
"Sioux Falls?"

2398
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:20,209
Sioux Falls is a city in South Dakota.

2399
01:34:20,749 --> 01:34:23,520
It may sound unfamiliar. From what I know,

2400
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,220
the population is low in South Dakota.

2401
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,289
I've never heard of it before.

2402
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:29,119
It was new to me, too.

2403
01:34:31,059 --> 01:34:34,229
(Unfamiliar even to the locals,)

2404
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:36,129
(Sioux Falls is a mysterious city
in the central US.)

2405
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,530
One of my biggest goals...

2406
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:40,599
was to see a tornado.

2407
01:34:40,599 --> 01:34:43,000
(A supernatural phenomenon
caught in that city?)

2408
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:50,009
(Can he really witness
the unbelievable sight?)

2409
01:34:53,309 --> 01:34:55,509
(Cowboy, the symbol of freedom and dreams)

2410
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:58,179
(Following their traces,)

2411
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,950
(they go to Bandera in the southern US.)

2412
01:35:02,889 --> 01:35:04,389
(For their bucket list,)

2413
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:07,389
(they each head deeper into the US!)

2414
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,960
(Going after the tornado he dreamed of)

2415
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,200
(Storm Chaser84 sets off!)

2416
01:35:11,729 --> 01:35:12,729
Let's go!

2417
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:16,400
(It's peaceful?)

2418
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:18,170
(I'm done for.)

2419
01:35:18,939 --> 01:35:20,009
You can't see a thing.

2420
01:35:20,769 --> 01:35:24,410
(A tornado is heading
to the cowboy chasers?)

2421
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:28,179
(Just enjoy it!)

2422
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:29,979
(They get through the rain
and arrive in Bandera!)

2423
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:32,549
(They come across
the Texas-style huge barbeque.)

2424
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:35,889
(Refueling happily)

2425
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:38,059
(Overflowing with energy)

2426
01:35:38,759 --> 01:35:40,229
(The two who are happy to tears)

2427
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:43,089
(The storm chaser who wants to cry)

2428
01:35:46,769 --> 01:35:47,830
(Shocked)

2429
01:35:47,969 --> 01:35:49,370
(Is the tornado finally here?)

2430
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:51,639
(Amazed)

2431
01:35:51,639 --> 01:35:52,670
(Shocked)

2432
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:53,769
(I can't believe it.)
