1
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,510
(Bedtime after dinner)

2
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,579
I'm wiped.

3
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,049
(Poking around)

4
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,479
(Approaching Kian84 playing with fire)

5
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,280
Kian84. Keep playing with fire,
and you'll wet your bed at night.

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,549
I'm not playing with fire.

7
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,590
- You'll become Pee84.
- "Pee84."

8
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,989
You'll become Urinate84.

9
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:49,430
We'll get sick tomorrow morning
if we don't keep warm.

10
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,860
(Worried)

11
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,660
I felt the aftermath
of diving into the water earlier.

12
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,399
I can't believe such a worrywart
drank the Ganges water.

13
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,669
(Embarrassed)

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,169
- Go to bed, Kian84.
- I will.

15
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:03,309
- Good.
- Great job.

16
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:04,809
- You too.
- Good job.

17
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:05,809
(Worried about Kian84)

18
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:09,410
(Heading to bed after wishing each other
a good night's sleep)

19
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,010
(A single room on the 2nd floor)

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,749
(A single room on the 1st floor)

21
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,290
(Ready to sleep well
in each of their rooms)

22
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,690
(Thudding)

23
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,400
- What's that?
- What's that sound?

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,629
Maybe someone came.

25
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,999
Goodness. Sir!

26
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,999
Stop with the loud noise!

27
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,540
(Meanwhile on the 2nd floor)

28
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,210
- What is he doing?
- Making firewood.

29
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,279
- Come on.
- Look at him.

30
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,510
(Splitting firewood is causing the noise.)

31
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,650
I didn't know it was that loud.

32
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,680
I was on the first floor.

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
(An unexpected noise problem)

34
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,719
Good grief.

35
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,219
I won't get any sleep.

36
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,389
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:55,559
(It's okay.)

38
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,430
(After splitting all the firewood)

39
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,900
- I was cold.
- Were you cold?

40
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:01,999
Yes.

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,439
(After staying near
the fireplace for a while,)

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,409
(it's finally lights out...)

43
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,309
(in Denver.)

44
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,309
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

45
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:20,650
(Between...)

46
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,180
(the extensive conifers)

47
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,650
They were in the middle of nature.

48
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,859
Sleeping in a place like that
must make you refreshed.

49
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:28,859
Right?

50
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:29,859
(The morning greeted by Mother Nature)

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,059
- Wake up.
- What?

52
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,499
I think Teo's up.

53
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,570
(Meanwhile, Teo has woken up.)

54
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,410
(Eating strawberries
after waking everyone up)

55
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,709
(Eating)

56
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:46,980
(Eating)

57
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,010
(Eating)

58
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,049
(Emptying the strawberries)

59
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,579
He's digging in.

60
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,380
(Emptied a bowl)

61
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:56,750
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

62
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,290
(After fueling up with strawberry)

63
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,519
- Go.
- Let's go.

64
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,690
(They all leave for the airport.)

65
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,290
It'll take an hour and three minutes.

66
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,429
(Pani Bottle takes the wheel.)

67
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,299
He drove the car every day.

68
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,929
How about breakfast at the airport?

69
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,799
- I'm in.
- Good.

70
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,570
(Heading off for their longtime dreams)

71
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,410
Only 833 people live in Bandera.

72
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,810
Since Bandera is the city of cowboys,

73
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,280
the place has numerous ranches.

74
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,280
(Under the blazing sun)

75
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,820
(The symbol of overflowing wild beauty)

76
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,989
(Teo's longtime dream, cowboy)

77
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,260
So the ranches welcome guests.

78
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,959
What is a ranch?

79
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,299
- It's like a big farm.
- A farm.

80
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,660
Are you going to book for one?

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,630
I won't book for one.

82
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,570
There are several bars
where locals gather...

83
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,139
- in that place.
- Okay.

84
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:55,040
I'll talk to the cowboys
doing music at the bar...

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,380
and then see which ranch...

86
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:58,679
we can stay in.

87
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,820
- Taco is a must in Texas.
- Taco?

88
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,889
- Taco?
- Yes.

89
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,549
Texas taco is different from Mexican taco.

90
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:06,820
- You're right.
- The hard shell taco.

91
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,820
I want to try it.

92
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,760
- In Texas.
- I haven't had...

93
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,260
proper Tex-Mex food before.

94
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,700
Are you going to eat it in Texas with Teo?

95
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,329
- You mean taco?
- Yes.

96
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:18,429
We will.

97
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:19,799
What about me?

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,769
(Embarrassed)

99
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:22,869
- You?
- Yes.

100
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:26,109
The storm chaser will take care of you.

101
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:27,980
You need to chase after the tornado.

102
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
Why am I wearing glasses?

103
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:31,950
I'm wearing sunglasses.

104
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,450
(Glasses made out of the sun)

105
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,549
I had no idea.

106
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,989
You need to chase after the tornado,
so it's impossible to go to a nice place.

107
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,489
It's a real chase.

108
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,220
Let's hope you have good luck.

109
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,859
Hoping I have good luck feels wrong.

110
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:46,930
Tornado is...

111
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,130
- a part of nature.
- It's a sensitive topic.

112
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,229
- Right?
- I asked the storm chaser.

113
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,170
To locals, it's a natural disaster.

114
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,969
- You're right.
- So I asked...

115
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:56,769
if they didn't like
visitors coming to watch it.

116
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:59,510
I was wrong. Tornadoes usually form...

117
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,279
- in rural areas.
- Yes.

118
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:03,010
Not a lot of people live there.

119
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,979
Storm chasers visiting fuel up their cars,

120
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,849
- enjoy food, go to restaurants, and all.
- Yes.

121
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,089
They help with the regional economy,
so the locals don't hate it.

122
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:15,320
Well, tornadoes can't be stopped
by humans.

123
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,190
You're right. There's no need to worry.

124
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,389
It was a relief.

125
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:20,300
Okay.

126
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,000
(They arrive at the airport.)

127
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,269
Look at all those cars.

128
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,240
This is the drop-off area.

129
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,310
- Goodness. We're here.
- Thanks.

130
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,240
- Thanks.
- All good.

131
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,750
<i>Unconditionally</i>

132
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,750
(They get off
while singing in excitement.)

133
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:40,779
Goodness.

134
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,579
How nice.

135
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,950
That's what this show is like.

136
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,360
Although the trip isn't easy,
it's unforgettable.

137
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,229
- We should be happy.
- I agree.

138
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,589
- Of course.
- Yes, we should.

139
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,599
Let's take the bus to the airport.

140
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,070
- Let's eat upstairs.
- Okay.

141
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,269
(Eating together before splitting up)

142
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,039
I'll send you a picture
if I see a tornado.

143
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,039
Please do.

144
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,440
- If I do, the deity will have helped.
- Right?

145
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,579
The locals would see tornadoes
quite often.

146
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,420
Are you the actor?

147
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:15,349
Yes, I'm an actor.

148
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,550
As expected from him.

149
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,120
How cool.

150
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,159
Thank you.

151
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:21,820
Thank you.

152
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,990
How nice.

153
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:25,659
He's sulking.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,159
I guess his face is charming globally.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,070
Whenever this happens,

156
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,599
Kian84 gets upset.

157
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
- Me? That's not true.
- Yes.

158
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,469
When they recognized you,

159
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,110
- Kian84 was like this.
- No, listen.

160
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:42,380
It's only natural. Teo got an award
at an international film festival.

161
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:45,310
- Greed is endless.
- It's endless.

162
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,820
I'm going to let the tornado
take some away today.

163
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,190
Oh, right. You know the guy I talked to
on the phone yesterday?

164
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,690
The storm chaser.

165
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,589
(Last night, through Pani Bottle)

166
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:00,599
Pani Bottle asked around last night.

167
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,570
- The guy you're meeting.
- He won't understand me.

168
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,029
Can you tell him where we'll meet?

169
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,570
- You two will meet at the airport.
- Okay.

170
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,969
"A T-shirt wearing Colorado will go."

171
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,039
A T-shirt will go.

172
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:13,779
Let me take a photo.

173
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,050
- Okay.
- That's a must.

174
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,250
(Looking gentle)

175
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,849
That's a nice photo. You look friendly.

176
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:22,849
(An amicable face)

177
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:25,250
(This friendly-looking man will go.)

178
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,360
(I'm looking forward to it.)

179
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,459
Be careful.

180
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:29,930
- Really.
- I hope you see one.

181
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,159
- Bye.
- Bye.

182
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,159
(Off to each of their destinations)

183
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
(Denver International Airport)

184
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,659
(1 hour and 40-minute flight)

185
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,430
I hope Kian84 sees one
with all that traveling.

186
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,430
(Sioux Falls Regional Airport)

187
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,839
- That's a new sleep mask.
- In place of a sleep mask.

188
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,209
(While sleeping with a new sleep mask on)

189
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,180
(Outside of the plane window)

190
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,079
(A vast field)

191
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,880
(A tranquil and relaxed place)

192
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:55,519
(A small peaceful city of 170,000 people)

193
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,519
Traveling to small cities
has its own charm.

194
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,589
(Instead of urban noise,)

195
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:04,959
(the place is full of nature's sound.)

196
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,360
- "Sioux Falls."
- "Sioux Falls."

197
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,670
I'm finally at...
I can't even remember the name.

198
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,870
I've finally arrived at Sioux Falls.

199
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,139
I get the state mixed up, too.

200
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,010
"South Dakota."

201
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:25,810
I got his phone number.
Let's give him a call.

202
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:29,019
It's my first time
calling an actual foreigner.

203
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,089
(Nervous)

204
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:33,620
Excuse me.

205
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,959
I'm at Sioucotalli Airport.

206
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,200
I hope the weather is bad today.

207
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,029
Wishing for it is strange.

208
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,170
I only have a few days.

209
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,940
I'll just leave it to luck.

210
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,139
I can't see it simply because I want to.

211
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,579
This airport is really small.

212
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,320
- Todd?
- Hello, this is Todd.

213
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,890
Excuse... Hello.

214
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,859
- I'm Pani Bottle's friend, Kim.
- Mr. Kim.

215
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:09,829
(Friendly-looking Mr. Kim)

216
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,089
I'm finished at the airport.

217
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,329
"Finished?"

218
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:14,560
(I'm finished at the airport.)

219
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,729
Okay. I'll be right there.

220
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:18,369
- You...
- He understood.

221
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,800
- Is that you?
- I'll walk towards you.

222
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,040
(They successfully met.)

223
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,609
He was right at the exit
because the airport was small.

224
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:26,609
That's good.

225
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,709
Directions weren't needed.
He was there when I exited the airport.

226
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,950
- What a relief.
- I didn't have to call him.

227
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,619
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

228
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:36,790
- Are you ready to go tornado chasing?
- Yes.

229
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:38,989
- I'll load it in the car and get going.
- Okay.

230
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,219
Oh, your car.

231
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,089
- Here.
- Okay.

232
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,290
(Giving him the bag
and getting ready to leave)

233
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,329
Thank you.

234
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,729
How are you doing?

235
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm fine.

236
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:55,070
(Stuck before asking Todd back)

237
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,739
(Using the translator)

238
00:10:58,739 --> 00:10:59,739
Who are those behind you?

239
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,609
The production crew joined us...

240
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:04,180
so we could communicate better.

241
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,109
- To interpret?
- Yes.

242
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,849
What are the chances of seeing a tornado?

243
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,050
Tornado? It just depends.

244
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
What do you think?

245
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:15,589
(Laughing)

246
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,190
The forecast says the supercells
have pretty large hail.

247
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,900
- With this storm system...
- Yes?

248
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,499
If it holds together like this,

249
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
the chance increases for a tornado.

250
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,400
(When warm air meets cold air,)

251
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,310
When you're actually there,
you can feel a sudden cold air.

252
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,509
(air current ascends.)

253
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:34,280
- That's where it happens.
- Right.

254
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,709
It's like the first part of a blockbuster.

255
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,079
(When the supercell hits the ground,
a tornado forms.)

256
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,550
(Storm chasers are professionals
pursuing tornadoes.)

257
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,749
They are so cool.

258
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,249
(Storm chasers are professionals
pursuing tornadoes.)

259
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,790
(Todd will be chasing together today)

260
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,690
- With this storm system...
- Yes?

261
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,589
The supercells will still be around
the York area.

262
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,729
We're going to start heading towards...

263
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,200
- York, Nebraska.
- Okay.

264
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,270
- This is where we are.
- Usually, even if you start...

265
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,900
at one point, the destination
is decided on that very morning.

266
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,170
- He's right.
- By watching the forecast,

267
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,680
the chances of tornadoes are calculated,
like 5 percent or 3 percent.

268
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,109
Then that's the destination.

269
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:09,109
It's spontaneous.

270
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:10,379
Yes, there's no planning.

271
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,550
- Are you ready to go?
- Let's go.

272
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,910
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

273
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,489
(The tornado chase begins.)

274
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,390
This town is beautiful.

275
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,489
Because the land is large,

276
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:28,599
it looks like the sea.

277
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,869
(A vast green earth like the sea)

278
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:31,900
A straight road.

279
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,900
(Dashing like swimming in the blue earth)

280
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,640
(I can't miss photos here.)

281
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,440
Wherever you take photos here,
it's like the Windows background image.

282
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,009
The image wasn't edited.

283
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,290
(The landscape that was on the computer)

284
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,589
Oh, you're right.

285
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:57,290
It was green everywhere.

286
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,660
(Cutting across the green land
that makes the eyes clear)

287
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:03,770
(He's become very bright.)

288
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,170
Around 20 years ago,

289
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,209
a photo of a tornado in the Central US...

290
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,609
became a trend on social media
for the first time.

291
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:16,079
- The sight was...
- "No illegal sharing."

292
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,680
unrealistic, like the colors
and everything.

293
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:22,520
I looked at the photo absent-mindedly.

294
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:24,650
Despite...

295
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:27,089
the numerous beautiful landscapes...

296
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,190
I saw on TV or in photos,

297
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,560
that left the strongest impression.

298
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,800
I wanted to go to such a place one day.

299
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,869
Giving something a shot is fun in itself.

300
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,270
My nickname while serving in the army...

301
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,680
- was Tornado.
- What?

302
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,879
When I made a mistake,

303
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,780
that small incident
would eventually become big...

304
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,550
- The butterfly effect?
- and mess up the whole barrack.

305
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,489
That was how I was nicknamed Tornado.

306
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:01,489
I had a flash of memory.

307
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:02,859
(I was like a tornado back then.)

308
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,030
How long have you been chasing tornadoes
as a job?

309
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,959
Back in the early 1990s...

310
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,530
- as part of the weather forecast team.
- Over 30 years.

311
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,339
Back in the day when I started,

312
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,339
before the days of the Internet,
it was a lot harder.

313
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,910
In the beginning, he chased after them
just by looking at the clouds.

314
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,969
We didn't have real-time data.

315
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:22,479
You would only see a handful of chasers...

316
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,849
out chasing storms.

317
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:25,849
With the movie "Twister" that came out...

318
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,749
Yes, the movie "Twister." It was fun.

319
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,190
("Twister" is about storm chasers
released in 1996.)

320
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,050
(Oh, my moo.)

321
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,320
("Twister" is about storm chasers
released in 1996.)

322
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:38,190
A lot more people
got into storm chasing...

323
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,359
and became interested.

324
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:41,359
On a big chase day,

325
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:44,129
there are 75 to 100 chasers on a storm.

326
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:45,129
I see.

327
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,910
(Driving across farmlands while chatting)

328
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:53,680
What are these crops?

329
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,680
- The taller one is corn.
- Corn.

330
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,579
Yes. The other taller one is soybean.

331
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,979
Soybean?

332
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,089
In my hometown,

333
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,520
people farm rice.

334
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,129
(Yeoju once again)

335
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:12,690
Should I go into a cornfield?

336
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,900
(Mother Nature reminds him
of his hometown.)

337
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,499
Look at the size of the farms.

338
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:20,070
- There's a deer.
- So all the...

339
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,640
There's a deer.

340
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,239
(I'm passing by.)

341
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,910
- Goodness.
- A cow farm.

342
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,910
(From wild animals to big ranches)

343
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,550
- That many?
- The cows are feeling hot.

344
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,950
(It's indeed the land of life!)

345
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,989
This is the country road.

346
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,089
There are bean fields, ranches, and all.

347
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,920
It's beyond beautiful here.

348
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:46,629
(Enjoying the freedom)

349
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:47,629
Good.

350
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,570
(Appreciating the nature for a while)

351
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,400
The weather is great.

352
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,270
The weather is great.

353
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,749
(No signs of a tornado)

354
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,950
(Can we see one today?)

355
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,320
We'll be stuck in the car all day.

356
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:11,950
It's like I'm going to
my grandparents' house...

357
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,320
during the holidays...

358
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,660
but can't seem to get there.

359
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,759
(An endless chase after a tornado)

360
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,489
The weather is amazing.

361
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:20,030
It was my first time feeling sad...

362
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,430
about the great weather.

363
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,499
It was really sunny,

364
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,499
which got me worried.

365
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:28,400
(Are there none?)

366
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,709
(Why isn't there one?)

367
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:34,209
(Only the sun welcomes them.)

368
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,009
(No matter how far they drive,)

369
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:40,579
(the sun is above them.)

370
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:41,879
The sun almost burned us to death.

371
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,249
(The heat of the sun...)

372
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:45,249
He's become quiet.

373
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,790
(is killing his hopes.)

374
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,129
We're screwed.

375
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,190
(His bright face...)

376
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,800
(is becoming gloomy.)

377
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,229
(But it's suddenly raining?)

378
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:58,229
What?

379
00:16:58,499 --> 00:16:59,999
- For real?
- What?

380
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,300
At this rate,

381
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,910
- We might see one.
- we might see a tornado.

382
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,910
What is it?

383
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:07,910
- They're in the opposite situation.
- What?

384
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,009
- I didn't know it rained.
- We should see the weather forecast.

385
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:15,119
- My goodness.
- Did you see the lightning?

386
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:17,119
- Was there one?
- Yes, in a flash.

387
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,920
I can't see a thing. Hold on.

388
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,920
Two hours ago.

389
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,290
(Sioux Falls)

390
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,530
They split up right there.

391
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,430
(San Antonio)

392
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,170
Bandera was an hour away
from San Antonio Airport,

393
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,469
so we went to San Antonio.

394
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,599
(San Antonio Airport, Texas)

395
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,609
You look cool.

396
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:39,440
(The Texas brothers came to rent a car.)

397
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:41,180
It's a Ram.

398
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:42,609
"Ram?"

399
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,410
(A huge pickup truck)

400
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,410
It's massive.

401
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:48,719
The US has a lot of pickup trucks.

402
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,589
There's something crucial.

403
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:52,920
I must check if my foot can reach...

404
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,420
the brake from the driver's seat.

405
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:57,390
I have short legs.

406
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,959
(Struggling)

407
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:02,099
(Gets in with his short legs)

408
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,499
I need to pull it forward.

409
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:05,229
It's more than enough.

410
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:06,499
(His foot can reach it!)

411
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
I can step on it.

412
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,940
(Barely reaches the brake)

413
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,999
That's a relief.

414
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,170
Nice.

415
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,680
It's high up.

416
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,749
- Let's hit the road.
- Let's go.

417
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:20,650
- That truck is dreamy.
- It's cool.

418
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,150
I get to ride a pickup truck in my life.

419
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,450
(As they exit the airport,)

420
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,190
(the wide-open landscape
of Texas comes into view.)

421
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,530
How was the car ride?

422
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,029
- It felt like riding a rhino.
- I see.

423
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,170
I guess this is what Texas is like.

424
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:42,440
I'm most excited about
Bandera on this trip.

425
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
(Heading to Bandera to find a cowboy)

426
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:45,870
It's burning.

427
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:47,910
It's beyond hot. It's burning.

428
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,779
It was very dry and hot.

429
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,580
- Oh, hot like that.
- Hot like a desert.

430
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,549
- To avoid getting my face tanned,
- Yes.

431
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,819
I have no choice but to wear a cowboy hat.

432
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,090
- Right. Because it's sunny.
- I need to cover...

433
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,690
myself from the sun.

434
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,190
- I'll wear a hat to cover my face.
- Yes.

435
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,959
- I'll wear a denim shirt and denim pants.
- Yes.

436
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,289
(A hat, a denim shirt, and denim pants)

437
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,499
Since I'm here,

438
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,769
shall I dress as a cowboy?

439
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,900
A hat, a denim shirt, and denim pants.

440
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,469
From the start, I said...

441
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:18,640
- I was interested in cowboy culture.
- Yes.

442
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,880
In the photos,

443
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,209
I saw people riding horses.

444
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:23,239
On the road?

445
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,749
Oh, my.

446
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:25,809
(They ride horses
rather than driving a car.)

447
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,479
My goodness. That's cool.

448
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,890
I was curious about it.

449
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:33,549
I lived in the US.

450
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,090
I've never experienced the cowboy culture.

451
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,930
- So I was very curious.
- I see.

452
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,160
Look at the car next to us.

453
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,900
The wheels.

454
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,330
(They're huge.)

455
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,400
- They're huge.
- My goodness.

456
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,640
It's the kind of car
you'd think only exists in the US.

457
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:50,870
- There are so many trucks.
- Yes.

458
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:54,840
(There are many trucks here and there.)

459
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,940
The cars here are all huge.

460
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,150
- The sign boards are huge too.
- Yes.

461
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,620
There's no way we'll miss it.

462
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,580
(The huge sign boards
always get the drivers' attention.)

463
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:05,850
Americans said the same thing.

464
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,789
"In Texas, everything is bigger."

465
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,789
- That's what they say.
- Everything is bigger.

466
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,489
Texas, located in the southern part
of the US,

467
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:14,600
is the second-largest state after Alaska.

468
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,600
The phrase "Texas-sized" reflects...

469
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,969
the pride Texans take in size,

470
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,799
with massive Texas barbecue,
giant hamburgers,

471
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,870
and oversized trucks
being well-known symbols of the state.

472
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,709
Also, Texas is known as the birthplace
of the American frontier era.

473
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,680
It's often called
the "home of the cowboy."

474
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,709
(Home of the cowboy, Texas)

475
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,789
Oh, my! That's a prickly pear cactus!

476
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:39,850
- A prickly pear cactus?
- A prickly pear cactus?

477
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,019
- What's a prickly pear cactus?
- Yes.

478
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:43,830
It's the red fruit that grows
on top of the cactus.

479
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,789
I've never seen a wild one on the road.

480
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,559
It's shocking.

481
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,670
I was surprised that
I could see it in real life.

482
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,130
This is my first time seeing it.

483
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:55,400
I want to try eating it.

484
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,670
(Salivating)

485
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,309
If there's one in Bandera, we can try.

486
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,709
- There must be another one.
- Yes.

487
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,410
(Adding one more to the bucket list)

488
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,709
I want to try shooting a gun.
The cowboy gun.

489
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:08,350
It would be best to find a place
that provides an old and authentic gun.

490
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:11,690
(Enjoying the Texan landscape,
filled with dreams)

491
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,219
(Looking carefully)

492
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:17,959
It's fun to watch and observe.

493
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,229
(At Times Square,)

494
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:23,459
(he was unenthusiastic.)

495
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,269
(In Texas, he looks joyful
just being present.)

496
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:26,430
His eyes are brighter.

497
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,640
- He prefers the countryside.
- It's like a desert.

498
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,110
It's amazing to see sceneries
that I only watched in the movies.

499
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:34,779
This exquisite atmosphere of Texas.

500
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,539
(Exquisite atmosphere of Texas)

501
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,180
(It feels like being inside
a Western movie.)

502
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,180
It's nice.

503
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:43,789
It's romantic.

504
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:44,890
(While they were enjoying
the Texas scenery...)

505
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,989
The weather is getting cloudy.

506
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:49,390
- It's getting cloudy.
- It's not sunny.

507
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,430
- Oh, my.
- What's going on?

508
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:54,400
(Raindrops drizzle down little by little.)

509
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,200
- It's raining.
- As soon as we say something about it.

510
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,769
(His eyes widen.)

511
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,630
Did you see the lightning?

512
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,100
- Did you see the lightning?
- The lightning!

513
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,209
- In the end, we'll get to see it.
- We'll be seeing a tornado.

514
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:07,180
- We might see a tornado here.
- Tornado.

515
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,410
(The rain gets heavier.)

516
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:14,049
The weather is amazing.

517
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:15,080
(He's jealous.)

518
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,950
I kept thinking of Kian84.

519
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,160
I think we should check
the weather forecast.

520
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,190
My goodness.

521
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,719
What's going on all of a sudden?

522
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,789
(Feeling nervous)

523
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,229
I can't see anything. Wait.

524
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:30,630
- Isn't it dangerous to drive?
- It's dangerous.

525
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,729
It was raining a lot.

526
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:32,729
(Actually, on this day...)

527
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:36,039
(A hurricane hit Texas.)

528
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,910
- It came out in the news.
- Oh, my goodness!

529
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,910
Seriously?

530
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,910
When we arrived,

531
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,410
there was a hurricane in Texas.

532
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:46,680
- That's why it was raining.
- Oh, my.

533
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,180
Wasn't it dangerous?

534
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:50,519
The place that we were at was okay.

535
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,590
- We were on the outskirts.
- It was only rain.

536
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:55,989
(It's raining more and more heavily.)

537
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,489
(Can we...)

538
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:01,600
(find a cowboy?)

539
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,630
(They're getting more and more anxious.)

540
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,670
This is crazy.

541
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,200
Oh, no.

542
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,370
(What is he doing with the windows down?)

543
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,110
It was hot but the outside looked so cool.

544
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,180
So I rolled down the window.

545
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:18,580
(Laughing)

546
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:21,880
(He washes his face in the rain
because he feels hot.)

547
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,850
(It's pure.)

548
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,749
(He shouted about being pure in New York.)

549
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,120
(He expresses his happiness as it is.)

550
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,190
(The real Pure Boy of this era.)

551
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,360
He's pure.

552
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,529
It's cooling.

553
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,900
It hurts a bit, but it's cooling.

554
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,330
(He rubs his face.)

555
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,799
(He doesn't mind at all.)

556
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,840
I should bring a towel next time.

557
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,910
(After washing the face in the rain,)

558
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,080
(the sky is getting sunnier.)

559
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,150
It seems like the heavy rain has passed.

560
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,090
It's a bit sunny now.

561
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:01,059
There's no sign of rain here.

562
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,590
That's a relief.

563
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,590
(The sun is blazing
as if it never rained.)

564
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,229
I think Bandera starts from here. Right?

565
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:07,299
Yes.

566
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,759
It has a countryside vibe.

567
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,370
It's cool.

568
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,670
(In front of them...)

569
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,539
(is the scenery of the Texas countryside.)

570
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,009
- Welcome to Bandera.
- Welcome to Bandera.

571
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:25,709
(Finally, they arrived at Bandera.)

572
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:27,850
Finally, they arrived at Bandera.

573
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:32,549
- The village is quite spacious.
- It's really a village.

574
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:35,319
- It's like a set in Western movies.
- Yes.

575
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,229
(The birthplace of cattle herding...)

576
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,860
Yes, that's how it appears in the movies.

577
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,729
(and the gathering place
of cowboys in the 1800s)

578
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,700
(It's where the history
of cowboys started.)

579
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,799
My goodness.

580
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,440
(The city of cowboys, Bandera)

581
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,709
Bandera.

582
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,779
- Let's go to the hotel first.
- Let's do that.

583
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,549
- Hello.
- Hello.

584
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:03,080
- We have a reservation.
- Yes.

585
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,019
There weren't many accommodations
in Bandera.

586
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:08,120
So we quickly reserved a room
that was available.

587
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,219
It's huge!

588
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:13,029
Everything really is big in Texas.

589
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:15,229
- Oh, my.
- Everything is big in Texas.

590
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,130
(He dives into the huge bed.)

591
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,840
Let's go to eat.

592
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,340
(Going to fill their stomachs)

593
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,069
The atmosphere is unique here.

594
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:26,509
It's not entirely empty.

595
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,539
I think that's an antique shop.

596
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:30,539
Yes.

597
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,650
I think there are many secondhand shops.

598
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,950
(The stores look very traditional.)

599
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,049
The sign boards look like
the ones in Western movies.

600
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,590
Look at the cowboys. They're cool.

601
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,590
Even children wear them like that.

602
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,499
- They wear the hats.
- Oh, my.

603
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,999
- He's so cute.
- He's so cute.

604
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,170
Oh, my. The locals.

605
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,400
This is the downtown area.

606
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,840
This is the center.

607
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,739
- The main intersection.
- Yes.

608
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:58,370
On the main road,

609
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,910
there are cowboy stores, live bars,
and everything.

610
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,709
- Salons and restaurants.
- Restaurants. I see.

611
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:03,709
(Cowboy-related stores come in sight
in every step they take.)

612
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,279
- It was easy to travel.
- Yes.

613
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,350
We just had to walk down the street.

614
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,479
Everything was within ten minutes
walking distance from the hotel.

615
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:10,580
That's so nice.

616
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,860
The locals come here too.

617
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:18,289
- Picardie's barbecue.
- This place is...

618
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:19,459
(They found
a crowded barbecue restaurant.)

619
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,430
I'm looking forward to experiencing
the cowboy culture.

620
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,499
Barbecue.

621
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:24,969
It must be legit.

622
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:26,170
- Absolutely.
- We're open.

623
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:28,840
I can smell the barbecue.

624
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:30,840
The seasoning smell.

625
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,140
(The restaurant is filled with
the smell of barbecue.)

626
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,209
(People are having barbecue parties.)

627
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:38,180
I feel hungry smelling this.

628
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,350
(Eating)

629
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,580
They look delicious.

630
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,350
It looks delicious.

631
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,749
- Hi.
- How can I help you?

632
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:46,249
That smells so good.

633
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:48,690
So we want to have a three meat platter...

634
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,959
- with a double brisket extra.
- Okay.

635
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:54,400
Does it come with any sandwiches?

636
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,959
- How about the grilled cheese?
- The grilled cheese?

637
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,630
- Okay. With the grilled cheese.
- Okay.

638
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,769
- It was so nice having Teo.
- You look like his son.

639
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:01,140
You looked like his son just now.

640
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:03,569
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.

641
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:04,569
(The barbecue arrives
as soon as they order.)

642
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:05,569
Oh, that smells good.

643
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:06,910
(Smelling)

644
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,779
(Ta-da)

645
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:11,479
- Oh, my.
- Is it grilled?

646
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,479
(It's huge.)

647
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,680
Is this the meat?

648
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,819
Everything is bigger in Texas.

649
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:17,120
They did something to the top, right?

650
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,390
Yes, it's seasoned.

651
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,219
They smoked it with some seasoning.

652
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:22,519
(It's an aftermath
of caramelized seasoning.)

653
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,229
It smells so good.

654
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,660
This is crazy. It looks so delicious.

655
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,469
I'm tearing up with joy.

656
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:32,700
I'm really happy.

657
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:37,640
(The tear-jerkingly delightful
barbecue...)

658
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:41,209
(was smoked on a grill.)

659
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,080
(It's smoked for about 6 to 7 hours.)

660
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,180
- Smoked on a grill inside the shack.
- That's crazy.

661
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,380
- My goodness.
- Brisket is...

662
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,019
smoked for a long time
to tenderize the meat,

663
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:53,519
- which is a Texan barbecue style.
- I think it will melt in the mouth.

664
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,890
It's a must to eat it in Texas.

665
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,090
My goodness.

666
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,090
They slice it into big but thin pieces.

667
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:01,299
My goodness.

668
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,430
I love barbecue.

669
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,170
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

670
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,299
It's a feast.

671
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,799
Wow.

672
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,940
(Trying the meat first)

673
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:12,469
(Taking a huge bite)

674
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,650
How does it taste?

675
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,979
My goodness.

676
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,549
- Seriously.
- Is it good?

677
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:22,580
It's delicious.

678
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,450
I'm only going to have the meat
for my first bite.

679
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,989
(Teo takes a big bite too.)

680
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:32,330
(Satisfied)

681
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,690
I can tell it's good
just by looking at his face.

682
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,459
Darn.

683
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:38,299
Oh, my gosh. This is so good.

684
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,969
(He pours the sauce
while praising the food.)

685
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,739
I can't describe this.

686
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,709
It's so good.

687
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,110
Is it juicy? Is it not tough?

688
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,580
It's really tender.

689
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,350
Dogs play with a bone all day.

690
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,190
The bone is tasty.

691
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,660
(Sucking)

692
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
We had a...

693
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:07,390
- It's so delicious.
- The meat comes off the bone so cleanly.

694
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,959
Shall I try this?

695
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,569
(He takes a huge bite
of the brisket sandwich.)

696
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:17,640
- It must be delicious.
- I'm getting annoyed.

697
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,509
- I'm so jealous.
- It's driving me crazy.

698
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,910
How can a simple dish be so delicious?

699
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,380
It's cheese toast.

700
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,620
(He's addicted to briskets.)

701
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,150
He's addicted to the bone.

702
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,249
(He's addicted to the bone.)

703
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:31,350
Isn't it a harmonica?

704
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,789
There's some in there.

705
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:33,890
I think music will be played.

706
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,259
(He's playing with the bone.)

707
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,489
(Rubbing his stomach)

708
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,459
He's full.

709
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,860
It's so delicious.

710
00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:44,499
I'm full.

711
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:46,529
(While the Texas brothers
are filling up their stomachs...)

712
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:49,769
- What's that? Is that a cookie?
- What's that?

713
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:50,769
Why are they...

714
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,539
Why are they comparing
this scene with ours?

715
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:54,640
Oh, no.

716
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,739
It's a sandwich.

717
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,350
- It's brisket.
- Isn't it a toy?

718
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,120
(It's a tiny version
of a brisket sandwich.)

719
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,789
(He finishes in one bite.)

720
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:06,190
There's a reason.

721
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,660
When tracking, you need to move quickly.

722
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,090
- There's no time to stop.
- Of course.

723
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,959
On top of that, Kian84 has only one day.

724
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:13,559
If there was a restaurant nearby,
I would go and eat.

725
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,130
(Chewing)

726
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:22,539
(Same meal, but different size)

727
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:25,269
- Why are they comparing?
- The camera is full of meat.

728
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,509
It's delicious.

729
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:28,940
- This is Texas.
- It's delicious.

730
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
He must be thirsty.

731
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,920
(Unlike Texas,
his meal is done with one bite.)

732
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,390
(He feels bitter.)

733
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:45,229
(They're happy.)

734
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:46,229
They're the opposite.

735
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:49,130
(Texas brothers went to a bar nearby.)

736
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,860
(Welcome.)

737
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,670
(There's a fun live performance too.)

738
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:59,910
(Clapping)

739
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,140
Where do you live?

740
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,950
We're from South Korea.

741
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,850
- In Seoul?
- Yes, in Seoul.

742
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,920
- Yes?
- You've been a musician all your life?

743
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:13,319
- Off and on.
- Off and on?

744
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,789
Since I'm retired,
I play all the time now.

745
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:17,789
Yes.

746
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,130
(He gets along very well
with the musician he just met.)

747
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,830
That's what guys do. Like us.

748
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,529
People were friendly.

749
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:24,499
- They engage in a lot of small talk.
- Right.

750
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,370
You're having beer?

751
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
It must be refreshing.

752
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,509
What brought you to Texas?
What made you guys come down here?

753
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:35,940
Well, Texas was kind of my choice.

754
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,979
Because I have a dream of cowboy culture.

755
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,180
He blew up about five years ago
and now he's like...

756
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,350
- Okay.
- Yes. And...

757
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,350
You were in "Past Lives," right?

758
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,559
Oh, yes. You watched "Past Lives?"

759
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:49,789
(This is amazing.)

760
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:52,430
- My goodness!
- In the countryside!

761
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:54,900
- I got goosebumps.
- I was shocked.

762
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
No...

763
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,259
(He was an Academy Award nominee
for Best Actor after all.)

764
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,670
Oh, my goodness.

765
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:03,140
He's really famous.

766
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,340
- My goodness.
- A star visited the countryside.

767
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
(He's a superstar.)

768
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,239
Do you know any good ranches
that we can visit?

769
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:13,209
Original and real cowboy ranch.

770
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,279
You go across the street.
There's a place called Arkey Blue's.

771
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,319
- Yes.
- There's one door.

772
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,450
- Okay.
- You may find some real cowboys in there.

773
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,759
- All right.
- Yes.

774
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:24,390
We're an old-time-friendly kind of bar.

775
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,660
Old time, have a good time.

776
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,959
- Right.
- Yes, you'll like it.

777
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,130
We'll check it out. Thank you.

778
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,959
- Yes.
- Yes.

779
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:33,529
I mean your music was so nice
when we passed by.

780
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:34,569
(One person is too quiet.)

781
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,700
It's my first time seeing him so quiet.

782
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,569
I couldn't understand.

783
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,009
How could you be quiet?

784
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,410
- Oh, nice.
- Where you can play...

785
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,940
(Coughing)

786
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,850
- He's coughing.
- My cold.

787
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,209
- You suddenly have a cold.
- Your cold came back?

788
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:47,309
(What are they talking about?)

789
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:48,680
"What are they talking about?"

790
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:52,989
(He suddenly doesn't feel good.)

791
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,259
- Would you like some water?
- Yes, please.

792
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
(Sighing)

793
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:01,959
(Coughing)

794
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,360
(Is he okay?)

795
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,330
That's a Texas thing.

796
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,969
They're talking nonstop.

797
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,309
It was difficult for me
to understand their accent.

798
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:13,370
I had to focus.

799
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,979
I was trying to translate for him
but they kept talking.

800
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:18,850
So I couldn't translate for him.

801
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:20,709
I felt so bad.

802
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,279
(It's okay.)

803
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,789
So that's... We have a record player.

804
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:26,350
- Right.
- The people can pick a record.

805
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,190
- Oh, pick and then listen.
- He must be surprised to see him.

806
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,420
I was a phenomenal guitarist.

807
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,259
- You too?
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.

808
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,860
They were just having a beer
in their local bar,

809
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,900
and a famous Hollywood actor walked in.

810
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:40,499
Are you listening to Spotify too?

811
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:42,340
Oh, yes.

812
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:44,709
There are several good ones around.

813
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:47,239
(Coughing)

814
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,239
- What's this?
- Oh, no.

815
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,340
(There's one person uninvited.)

816
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
Are you outside?

817
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,549
- Pani Bottle.
- Why do you look so sad?

818
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:54,519
Go to a hospital.

819
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:57,920
- Pani Bottle.
- Wasn't it like 20 minutes?

820
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,019
Have you ever experienced not being able
to understand a single thing?

821
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,690
I was daydreaming.

822
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,200
It felt like a three-hour-long
English listening test.

823
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,330
It reminded me of my past.

824
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,299
When Kian84 asked people in India,
"How there?"

825
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:15,999
I criticized him for that.

826
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:19,269
(During the India trip...)

827
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,809
(Ice how there?)

828
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,680
(Please stop saying "How there?")

829
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,549
(It sounds like "How dare.")

830
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,850
(In the past,
he corrected Kian84's English.)

831
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,519
Thinking about it,
I now wonder how I dared criticize him.

832
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,789
It was okay to be wrong.

833
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,620
So I reflected on myself.

834
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,959
I thought about Kian84's feelings...

835
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,559
and realized I shouldn't have done that.

836
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,029
(Kian84, I apologize for my past.)

837
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:48,700
You're the best English teacher to me.

838
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,100
- Right.
- You have the wrong idea.

839
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,870
Why is he feeling so small?

840
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,910
(Don't feel small, my English teacher!)

841
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,279
He's a fan of Pani.

842
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,580
(Thank you, Kian84 student.)

843
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,380
- Any of them would be good.
- Right.

844
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,410
All for sure.

845
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:01,680
My friend also wants to shoot some guns.

846
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,150
I don't know where we should go.

847
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,049
- Go to Airways.
- To where?

848
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:07,590
- He asked for me. I see.
- Where?

849
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,190
I heard the stories about the movies.

850
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,529
(It's inaudible for him.)

851
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,860
(He still coughs alone.)

852
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,959
I miss Kian84 all of a sudden.

853
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,029
(Kian84, do you want to go to
an English academy with me?)

854
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:22,200
(A message sent by Pani Bottle to Kian84.)

855
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:25,569
(Kian84, where are you
and what are you up to?)

856
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,940
(Me?)

857
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:31,380
I have no clue where I am.

858
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,410
This is crazy.

859
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,580
(The time: 2:42 p.m.
Distance traveled: 126km)

860
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,649
- Oh, no.
- He traveled 126km.

861
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,189
The weather is so good.

862
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:41,790
It's sunnier than before.

863
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:44,120
I got to get fuel.

864
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,960
Is there a gas station here?

865
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,290
A gas station? Okay.

866
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,299
(They stop at the gas station to fuel up.)

867
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,799
We drove for an hour to chase a tornado.

868
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:56,270
The moment I obsess over this,

869
00:35:56,739 --> 00:36:00,439
my desire to see a tornado...

870
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,339
does not become beautiful.

871
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:06,450
What's important is that
the scenery here is gorgeous.

872
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,549
I'm not sure where I am.

873
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,350
I like this unfamiliarity.

874
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,350
(I like this unfamiliarity.)

875
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:17,689
Traveling isn't something planned.

876
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,560
It doesn't go as planned either.

877
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,859
I'll have a cup of coffee.

878
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,169
Cold coffee.

879
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,529
- One large coffee?
- You'll get a very cold coffee.

880
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,399
Yes.

881
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:31,770
- Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Yes.

882
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,410
(He's happy.)

883
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,210
- Okay. Thank you.
- Have a good day.

884
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,210
Yes, have a good day.

885
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,080
- How can they all be smiling?
- Have a good day.

886
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,509
They're so friendly.

887
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:42,980
I ordered an iced coffee.

888
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:45,790
But it's super hot.

889
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:49,660
I got a very hot coffee.

890
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:51,660
He said cold two times.

891
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:54,430
(Laughing)

892
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,230
This is the beauty of traveling.

893
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:00,770
I ordered iced coffee,
but I got hot coffee instead.

894
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,569
An unexpected moment like this
is like a part of life.

895
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,410
We have a quote of the day.

896
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,080
This is too hot.

897
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,210
(After receiving his hot life coffee,)

898
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:11,950
One beer.

899
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,950
(he obviously picks his beer.)

900
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,950
Oh, my. It's hot!

901
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,779
- Oh, my.
- Oh, no!

902
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:18,719
(Another unexpected situation happens)

903
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,850
It's hot!

904
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,120
- It's hot.
- Oh, no.

905
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Oh, my. That must be really hot.

906
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,319
I almost died.

907
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:26,129
My goodness.

908
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,460
I need a tissue.

909
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,230
Is there no tissue here?

910
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:33,029
Paper?

911
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:35,540
"Paper?"

912
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:37,339
At least a paper.

913
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:40,339
- Like calling a waiter.
- Paper.

914
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:41,339
(He orders a paper with confidence.)

915
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:42,379
I need to learn English.

916
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:45,580
(Luckily, he found some toilet paper.)

917
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,580
I shouldn't cause trouble
in a foreign country.

918
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,589
For goodness' sake.
I bought this yesterday.

919
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:53,689
(He brought trouble to his new shirt
that he bought yesterday.)

920
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,489
For goodness' sake. I got burned.

921
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,989
But still. Did I know
I would get my arm burned?

922
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,899
I didn't know.

923
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:05,500
If everything goes as planned,

924
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,930
my trips won't be fun.

925
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,169
I just learned a lesson from you.

926
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,439
- Okay. Here.
- For goodness' sake.

927
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,270
Here's the model.

928
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,680
- Here's the forecast model for later.
- Yes.

929
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:18,210
- Radar model.
- Yes.

930
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,410
And this is where we're heading.

931
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,879
(He was studying the forecast alone.)

932
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:24,120
- He was researching alone.
- He was constantly looking into it.

933
00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:26,020
(Thinking)

934
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,290
(Did he find good news?)

935
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,819
- He found it.
- It's there.

936
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:30,819
Todd.

937
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,629
At 5 p.m., the storm is on the very south.

938
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:38,500
- Because this has warm air feeding in,
- Yes.

939
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:40,129
blowing into the storm...

940
00:38:40,129 --> 00:38:41,770
We could get a big tornado.

941
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:43,370
(We could get a big tornado.)

942
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,370
What?

943
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,239
- Great news.
- Let's go.

944
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:47,910
You can never expect what will happen
when you're traveling.

945
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:50,410
- At 5 p.m.
- That's where...

946
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,049
Could we get there by that time?

947
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:53,509
We could be there...

948
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:55,750
around 5:51 p.m.

949
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,350
- You can see it at 5 p.m.
- So we have to hurry.

950
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,189
- At 5:51 p.m.
- Let's go there. Okay.

951
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,520
- Let's go.
- Okay.

952
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,560
- Yes.
- Thank you.

953
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:05,259
But...

954
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:07,730
from the way he's saying it...

955
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:10,460
He would say it
because it's doable, right?

956
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,169
I had hope.

957
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,029
I was looking forward to it.

958
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,899
(Resuming the tornado chase)

959
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,239
- It's become a bit darker there.
- Nice.

960
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,350
(It's like warm coffee
that he didn't expect he'd get.)

961
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,049
The warmth has its charms.

962
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:28,419
(The warm charm of the unexpected trip)

963
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:31,919
- "Carpe diem."
- It had to be there.

964
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,160
(Enjoying mode is on.)

965
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,060
It's enjoyable because I'm clueless.

966
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
(He goes to welcome the tornado
with excitement.)

967
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,000
The scenery...

968
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:43,830
is the one from that movie.

969
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,899
The scenery in "The Wizard of Oz"
had farms like this.

970
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:51,469
I guess it was set in the Central US.

971
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,410
I really like the movie
"The Wizard of Oz."

972
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:56,439
I don't know when it was released.

973
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,710
It came out in 1939.

974
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,580
That's way before we were born.

975
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:03,819
Dorothy.

976
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,649
I know the story,
but I've never watched the movie.

977
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:09,419
(Find yourself a place
where you won't get into any trouble.)

978
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:11,989
(Some place
where there isn't any trouble.)

979
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,560
(It's not a place you can get to
by a boat or a train.)

980
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,730
It's not a place you can get to
by a boat or a train.

981
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,029
(It's far away.)

982
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:20,069
It's far away.

983
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,600
(Behind the moon.)

984
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,770
Behind the moon.

985
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:24,939
(Beyond the rain.)

986
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:26,009
Beyond the rain.

987
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:28,009
(Somewhere over the rainbow)

988
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,279
- This is such a legendary song.
- This is where it came from?

989
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:32,580
- This song was from this movie?
- It's a legendary song.

990
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:34,549
(He's immersed.)

991
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:35,879
Somewhere over the rainbow.

992
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:40,290
The sky in the background as she sings...

993
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,290
is also not clear.

994
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,529
It's like she's singing under the sky
that's just about to form a tornado.

995
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,029
(She was actually swept by a tornado.)

996
00:40:51,029 --> 00:40:52,100
I didn't know that.

997
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,899
It's because the house flew away...

998
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,939
The world in the movie is very dream-like.

999
00:40:56,939 --> 00:40:59,069
It's interesting. It crash-lands.

1000
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:01,239
(There she meets...)

1001
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,939
(a colorful mysterious world.)

1002
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:04,109
It changes to color.

1003
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,649
(It starts with being swept away
by a tornado.)

1004
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,779
(Dorothy's adventure in a fantasy world)

1005
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:10,819
It's a world tour.

1006
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:12,450
(Dorothy's adventure in a fantasy world)

1007
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,719
I also wanted to enter...

1008
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:17,290
a fantasy world.

1009
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:20,060
A 41-year-old Dorothy.

1010
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,859
I hoped something dream-like...

1011
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,469
would happen.

1012
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,839
It's what I dreamed of
ever since I was young.

1013
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:31,640
It's enjoyable
that I'm making the attempt.

1014
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:35,680
You only imagined about it before,
but you can live it in real life.

1015
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
(His childhood dream could come true.)

1016
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:38,180
It's a bit...

1017
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,379
exciting.

1018
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:44,450
If a tornado forms in another region,

1019
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,189
do you get calls?

1020
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,989
No. We can...

1021
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,830
We can see it on the display here.

1022
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,689
This yellow box is a severe thunderstorm.

1023
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:57,100
I see. The yellow box...

1024
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,430
is where the tornado is forming.

1025
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,500
(The yellow box indicates
a potential tornado.)

1026
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,270
If there's a tornado,

1027
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,799
they have a red box.

1028
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,439
The red box is where there is a tornado.

1029
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:07,439
(It changes into a red box.)

1030
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,040
Right now, there is no red box.

1031
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
(There is no red box now.)

1032
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,950
- Half an hour ago, there was one.
- Really?

1033
00:42:14,149 --> 00:42:15,620
It's real-time information.

1034
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,080
- It's gone now?
- Yes.

1035
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
(The tornado disappeared
within 30 minutes.)

1036
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:20,250
Tornadoes form quickly
and disappear quickly.

1037
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,560
- It's just a short event.
- Yes.

1038
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,160
You wouldn't know at all.

1039
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,189
That's why you have to chase after it.

1040
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
There is still the warm air
that's feeding into it.

1041
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,129
So you got a tornado forming...

1042
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:36,140
here in this yellow part.

1043
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,710
- There are lots of yellow parts.
- There are lots of yellow parts now.

1044
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,439
So there's a high chance.

1045
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,339
Okay. Focus on driving. Sorry.

1046
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:44,980
His face is getting brighter.

1047
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,210
Todd...

1048
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,680
talks in a way that gets you excited.

1049
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:52,989
"If you see here,"

1050
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,719
"there is warm air coming from below."

1051
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,290
"So there's a big tornado forming."

1052
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,460
"It's extraordinary."

1053
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,600
He talks positively.

1054
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,230
- I'm sure he wanted to find him one.
- Of course.

1055
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,299
- Rain.
- These over here...

1056
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:10,439
- There are some raindrops.
- are what you call...

1057
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:11,810
The weather is finally becoming bad.

1058
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,569
(What?)

1059
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:16,779
There's a red box here.

1060
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:18,910
A red one.

1061
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:20,750
Yes. That's a tornado warning.

1062
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,649
If the radar indicated it
or if the public...

1063
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:26,649
Yes.

1064
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,660
One just got formed.

1065
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,219
(Tornadoes keep forming like this.)

1066
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
We have to hurry.

1067
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,259
It is currently 3:36 p.m.

1068
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,759
At 5 p.m.,

1069
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:39,969
the storm is on the very south.

1070
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:41,129
You have 1 hour and 20 minutes left.

1071
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:42,200
(Current time 3:36 p.m.
Estimated time of the tornado 5 p.m.)

1072
00:43:42,439 --> 00:43:45,669
We have 1 hour and 40 minutes left
according to the navigation system.

1073
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,370
I wonder if we'll make it.

1074
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,439
(They're about 20 minutes behind.)

1075
00:43:48,939 --> 00:43:50,410
I'm somewhat...

1076
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,779
getting nervous.

1077
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,680
- I'm getting tense.
- It's tense.

1078
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,919
It's a matter of time.

1079
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,790
We've traveled for
about four and a half hours.

1080
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,089
It's the distance from Seoul to Busan.

1081
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:06,359
You drive across states
when you chase tornadoes.

1082
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,660
I went across three states in one day.

1083
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,129
Did I come all the way to Texas?

1084
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,270
(Welcome)

1085
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,200
I was talking
about "The Wizard of Oz" earlier.

1086
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
The movie was filmed...

1087
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,169
in Kansas,

1088
00:44:20,669 --> 00:44:23,810
which is a region near here.

1089
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,839
(They reach Kansas if they drive
for 2 more hours.)

1090
00:44:25,149 --> 00:44:27,980
That's how often tornadoes form here.

1091
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,149
That's a huge one.

1092
00:44:30,779 --> 00:44:32,819
It doesn't feel like
I'm going there for fun.

1093
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:36,089
I think I will feel really small
in front of nature.

1094
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,960
I think I'll be able to feel...

1095
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,390
how marvelous nature is.

1096
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,529
I hope...

1097
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:45,669
I get to see one.

1098
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,669
(15 minutes before the estimated time
of the tornado)

1099
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:52,710
It started to rain.

1100
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,580
There is a storm for sure.

1101
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:57,680
This radar shows...

1102
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,379
how intense the hail
inside the thunderstorm is.

1103
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:03,250
It's a quarter-size.

1104
00:45:03,379 --> 00:45:06,219
- It's a quarter-size.
- It's hailing.

1105
00:45:06,689 --> 00:45:09,189
The atmosphere is unstable.

1106
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:12,589
There's lightning.

1107
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:13,660
There's lightning.

1108
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,500
(Flashing)

1109
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,500
It keeps flashing.

1110
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,230
There's lightning.

1111
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,600
(It really is the land of Oz.)

1112
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,969
(Laughing)

1113
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,109
The worse the weather gets,
the brighter Kian84's face gets.

1114
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:27,939
So the new warning.

1115
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,379
This one has ping-pong-sized hail.

1116
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:33,450
- Ping pong?
- That's huge.

1117
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,080
Why is it getting bigger?

1118
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,580
It was a quarter size earlier
but now it's a ping pong size.

1119
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,589
- It's real.
- That's interesting.

1120
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,549
It looks like his car is new.

1121
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:43,759
He only drove 4,000km.

1122
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:46,430
Wouldn't it get ruined if we went there?

1123
00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:50,330
(He didn't hear that
because he was focusing.)

1124
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,169
He would...

1125
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:53,270
It's not far enough.

1126
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,870
I think he's excited too.

1127
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,439
- His face is red.
- It's red.

1128
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,569
Is it interesting?

1129
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,980
Yes. We didn't go far enough.

1130
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,250
We have to go more to the south.

1131
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,350
I'm sure he's excited too.

1132
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,450
(Driving fast with the red-cheeked Todd)

1133
00:46:09,649 --> 00:46:12,049
I think we're starting to see it
over here.

1134
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:13,049
- Yes.
- What?

1135
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,359
The edge over there.

1136
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,460
That's the edge of the supercell.

1137
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,359
- That's the supercell.
- Finally.

1138
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,359
A clear view.

1139
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:22,660
That's right. It came down a bit.

1140
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,700
(The edge of the supercell
is about to touch the ground.)

1141
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,600
That's where a tornado is likely to form.

1142
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,700
(If it reaches the ground,
a tornado is formed.)

1143
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:29,939
That's...

1144
00:46:29,939 --> 00:46:31,169
(Speechless)

1145
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:33,140
That really is a supercell.

1146
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,009
I've only seen that in pictures.

1147
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,710
I don't know how it would be
to see it from close by.

1148
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:41,549
I'm nervous.

1149
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,180
I hope I have beginner's luck.

1150
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,560
- You start driving fast from now.
- You never know when it will disappear.

1151
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,689
No?

1152
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,629
- Why?
- No?

1153
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,129
- What?
- You can't go in?

1154
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,799
The road was under construction.

1155
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
We should go one block further.

1156
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,270
What?

1157
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,710
Is the road blocked again?

1158
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,680
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1159
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:11,279
Gosh.

1160
00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:12,779
(The road is blocked 2 times in a row.)

1161
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:13,779
We're almost there.

1162
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:16,580
Every second counts right now.

1163
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,719
Oh dear.

1164
00:47:18,379 --> 00:47:19,549
No.

1165
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,290
No.

1166
00:47:23,419 --> 00:47:25,560
It's not the time to go north.

1167
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:28,160
(Pouting)

1168
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,230
The road was blocked,

1169
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,830
so we're going north again.

1170
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:36,140
- This time...
- You're going away.

1171
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,640
The road going down was blocked,
so we're heading up.

1172
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:44,540
We don't have time.

1173
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:48,279
We don't have time.
It shouldn't go like this.

1174
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,520
I felt nauseous.

1175
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,250
Baobab trees are there.

1176
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,290
- For 2,000 or 5,000 years.
- Right.

1177
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,259
They're there alive.
I just need to go there.

1178
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:02,060
But tornadoes...

1179
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,830
might not be there at all.

1180
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,430
Or might appear suddenly.

1181
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:09,770
- It's like a legendary Pokemon.
- Like a mirage.

1182
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:12,509
- It's like fame.
- Fame.

1183
00:48:14,009 --> 00:48:15,410
Fame, Pokemon.

1184
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,439
(You never know when the tornado
will disappear.)

1185
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,480
That's why I was more desperate.

1186
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,180
(Sighing)

1187
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,279
(Sighing)

1188
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:25,819
- Yes.
- He's anxious.

1189
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,120
Todd, cheer up.

1190
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,489
"Cheer up."

1191
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,830
He had been driving for too long,

1192
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,460
- so he looked really exhausted.
- Of course.

1193
00:48:34,989 --> 00:48:37,000
- He must be so tired.
- We'll make it.

1194
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:40,870
Will the cloud move slowly?

1195
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:41,870
Yes.

1196
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:44,870
I guess the clouds aren't moving too fast.

1197
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:45,910
(Fortunately, the clouds
are moving slowly.)

1198
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,109
Are they waiting for us?

1199
00:48:49,379 --> 00:48:50,680
I hope they don't disappear.

1200
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,620
(They took longer as they took a detour.)

1201
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,750
They might not make it.

1202
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,549
- Wow, 624km?
- They drove for 624km?

1203
00:49:01,549 --> 00:49:02,620
(At 6:20 p.m.,
their travel range is 624km.)

1204
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:05,460
What's that?

1205
00:49:06,629 --> 00:49:09,359
Are they all waiting for the tornado?

1206
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,629
Are they tornado hunters?

1207
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:14,230
- Are they chasers?
- Yes, there are so many.

1208
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,399
- What is it?
- The sound.

1209
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:18,439
They got a warning.

1210
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:20,210
It's like the emergency alert message.

1211
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,839
Here it comes.

1212
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,580
(He senses that something is going on.)

1213
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:28,480
(The tornado hunter's instinct kicks in.)

1214
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,149
(Scouting ahead with all five senses)

1215
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,520
- What?
- Goodness.

1216
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,089
Oh, my.

1217
00:49:39,629 --> 00:49:40,689
Oh, my gosh.

1218
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:43,330
- What is it? He saw something.
- Does he see it?

1219
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:44,460
(What's going on?)

1220
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,899
I saw something.

1221
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:46,930
(Did they actually find it?)

1222
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,500
No way.

1223
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:51,040
- Are they going to stop the video here?
- No way.

1224
00:49:51,339 --> 00:49:53,640
- Bye-bye.
- Oh, come on!

1225
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,710
Bye-bye.

1226
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,410
(What are you doing here, Pani Bottle?)

1227
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,609
- Oh, jeez.
- Wouldn't I be criticized this way?

1228
00:49:58,609 --> 00:49:59,779
- Why...
- No.

1229
00:49:59,779 --> 00:50:01,710
- It's our fault.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

1230
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,379
I'm going to be criticized
for something I didn't do.

1231
00:50:03,379 --> 00:50:06,819
Some viewers are wondering
if you still feel lonely.

1232
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,620
(Please don't be hard on me.)

1233
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:11,960
- Bye-bye.
- It was nice to meet you too.

1234
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,129
Thank you for everything.

1235
00:50:13,129 --> 00:50:15,359
- Take care.
- Take care.

1236
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:18,730
There's a horse.

1237
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,230
(There's a horse.)

1238
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,839
- Goodness.
- It's a cowboy.

1239
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:24,770
That's exciting.

1240
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,739
A cowboy.

1241
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,569
Fascinating.

1242
00:50:30,009 --> 00:50:32,040
Oh, it's true.
It's like a means of transportation.

1243
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,950
They actually ride horses to get around.

1244
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,620
(His eyes are fixed on it.)

1245
00:50:37,649 --> 00:50:40,950
I looked at the photos,
and people went around on horses.

1246
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,560
I wondered if we could...

1247
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,319
communicate with the horses.

1248
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:48,529
(The cowboys in his imagination
are right before his eyes!)

1249
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:51,460
I saw the cowboys on horses.

1250
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,569
It was like a scene from a movie.

1251
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:57,200
(It was like a scene from a movie.)

1252
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:00,370
- Can you go and ask them?
- I was about to.

1253
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,580
To see if we can experience being cowboys.

1254
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:05,180
We couldn't just walk by
when we had gone all the way there.

1255
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,350
- Exactly.
- Right.

1256
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:07,609
(He approaches the cowboys
with excitement.)

1257
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:09,779
- How are you guys doing?
- Hi. Good evening, sir.

1258
00:51:09,779 --> 00:51:12,620
We just saw you with the horses
and thought...

1259
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,219
that you were real cowboys.
So, I wanted to say hi.

1260
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:16,460
- Oh, yes!
- Yes.

1261
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,460
- Hi.
- I'm Tony.

1262
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,930
Tony. My name is Teo. Nice to meet you.

1263
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,330
- Good to meet you. Where are you from?
- Yes.

1264
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,589
I'm from South Korea.

1265
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:22,700
- Really?
- Yes.

1266
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,060
- Hello.
- This is my friend, Pani.

1267
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,299
- Pani.
- Oh, yes!

1268
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,270
(Amazed)

1269
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,469
- What?
- What is it?

1270
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:35,939
He's doing a trick out of the blue.

1271
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:38,279
Yes. He showed us a trick out of nowhere.

1272
00:51:38,439 --> 00:51:40,009
- Goodness.
- That's awesome.

1273
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:41,480
That's so fun.

1274
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,580
(How a cowboy greets people)

1275
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,219
(What's your name?)

1276
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,290
- Rosy.
- Rosy?

1277
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,089
- Rosy.
- Hi, Rosy.

1278
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:50,660
- Are we allowed to pat them?
- Oh, yes.

1279
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,219
- Okay.
- Yes, go ahead.

1280
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:53,660
- Hey, Rosy.
- So cute.

1281
00:51:54,189 --> 00:51:55,290
She's got great teeth.

1282
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,399
(Patting)

1283
00:51:56,399 --> 00:51:57,430
Oh, man.

1284
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,469
Is she going to bite me?

1285
00:51:59,629 --> 00:52:00,700
She's gorgeous.

1286
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,669
(Pani also pats her.)

1287
00:52:03,669 --> 00:52:05,770
See, where we're from,
we don't see this...

1288
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,109
(Nice to meet you.)

1289
00:52:07,109 --> 00:52:09,140
She wants you to pat her more
like a puppy.

1290
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,439
- Why did you smell it?
- Why did you smell it?

1291
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:12,450
I smelled her saliva.

1292
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,480
(Checking her saliva smell)

1293
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:14,910
Wow.

1294
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,480
See, where we're from,
we don't see this...

1295
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,489
this type of lifestyle,

1296
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:22,089
- so it's really nice.
- It's a little different, isn't it?

1297
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:25,060
Do you mind me asking
what you do to maintain this lifestyle?

1298
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,589
What do we do?

1299
00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:27,790
- Yes.
- Well...

1300
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,500
They were obviously real cowboys.

1301
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,899
Are they actual cowboys?

1302
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:32,700
I'm actually a software engineer.

1303
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,100
- You are?
- A soft engineer?

1304
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,469
I'm a software engineer during the day...

1305
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:39,410
and do this at night. I have a ranch.

1306
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:40,640
- You have your ranch?
- Yes, by night...

1307
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,710
- He works during the day.
- Oh, he also owns a ranch.

1308
00:52:43,879 --> 00:52:45,750
- Oh, yes?
- You guys going to go get a drink?

1309
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,009
Yes, we want to stop by the bar.

1310
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,319
Okay. Well, we're going to tie up.
We'll come down.

1311
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:52,489
- Okay.
- Yes.

1312
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:53,589
- Cool.
- That's amazing.

1313
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:56,390
They're going to join us for the show.

1314
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,089
They happened to be going to the same bar.

1315
00:52:58,089 --> 00:52:59,089
(The cowboys are going to join them.)

1316
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,330
- Is that how they park their horses?
- Yes.

1317
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:03,399
Interesting.

1318
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,370
- They actually tie them up.
- Yes, they tie their horses.

1319
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,500
(Parking their horses
on the side of the parking lot)

1320
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,169
There aren't full-time cowboys now.

1321
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:14,140
It's like their side job now.

1322
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,410
It smells like an Internet cafe.

1323
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:17,379
It smells like an Internet cafe?

1324
00:53:17,379 --> 00:53:20,549
- The old cigarette smell...
- Oh, the stale smell of cigarettes.

1325
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,819
(Amazed)

1326
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:26,890
(People enjoy the music in a dark bar.)

1327
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,319
It's huge!

1328
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,620
That's nice.

1329
00:53:31,189 --> 00:53:34,029
Apparently, it's the oldest bar
in Bandera.

1330
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:36,930
- It's been 100 years!
- Legendary musicians...

1331
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,029
used to come here and perform.

1332
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:43,799
(The Texas brothers take a seat.)

1333
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,739
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

1334
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,870
He's saying hi.

1335
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,379
Just enjoying the evening!

1336
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:53,950
They're performing live.

1337
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,080
(There's a live performance in the bar.)

1338
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,180
<i>My evergreen</i>

1339
00:54:00,589 --> 00:54:03,419
The music is so nice that I'm drawn to it.

1340
00:54:03,419 --> 00:54:04,620
(I'm drawn to the music.)

1341
00:54:05,259 --> 00:54:09,399
(They enjoy the music in their own ways.)

1342
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,259
This place seems really old.

1343
00:54:13,399 --> 00:54:14,500
The ceiling and everything.

1344
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,939
It gave off a true Southern Texas vibe.

1345
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:20,469
The dark atmosphere,

1346
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:23,080
the props, and the song.

1347
00:54:23,279 --> 00:54:25,310
It was like a movie set.

1348
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,109
It was straight out of a movie.

1349
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:31,580
It was so local.

1350
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,549
That's so authentic.

1351
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,460
(Feeling the Texan vibe...)

1352
00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:40,060
(Walking by)

1353
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:41,629
He's here.

1354
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,330
- Hey.
- Hey.

1355
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,629
- Tony!
- He actually came and sat with us.

1356
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,899
- What's the beer for?
- Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

1357
00:54:48,899 --> 00:54:50,000
"Beer they didn't even order."

1358
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,410
- What's this?
- They just bought us.

1359
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,439
Really?

1360
00:54:54,609 --> 00:54:56,040
Apparently,

1361
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,450
there's this culture of hospitality
in the southern regions.

1362
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,680
It's to show other people...

1363
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,850
that they're kind, friendly,
and affectionate.

1364
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,620
Just like how we have...

1365
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,589
- affection in the countryside.
- Yes.

1366
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:11,419
We were obviously foreigners,
so they saw us...

1367
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:12,859
and bought us a beer to welcome us.

1368
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:15,629
- That's lovely.
- People are so kind in Texas.

1369
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:17,060
There's nothing like that
in New York, right?

1370
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,330
(There's nothing like that
in New York, right?)

1371
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,169
They don't even let you use
the bathroom in New York.

1372
00:55:20,169 --> 00:55:21,469
(They don't even let you use
the bathroom in New York.)

1373
00:55:21,469 --> 00:55:24,339
You must have been
very disappointed by that.

1374
00:55:24,339 --> 00:55:25,910
There's no affection in big cities.

1375
00:55:27,609 --> 00:55:28,640
Hi. What's your name?

1376
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,080
- We haven't said hi.
- I'm Tom.

1377
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,580
- Tom. Teo. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1378
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,910
I'm Pani.

1379
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,310
- Pani?
- Yes.

1380
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,350
- Rosy, right?
- Tammy.

1381
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:40,089
Oh, Tammy. I'm sorry. Rosy was the horse.

1382
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:42,319
The name of the horse!

1383
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:45,020
It's like calling a person, "Puppy!"

1384
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,689
- Hi, Puppy.
- "Hi, Puppy."

1385
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:48,960
It happens.

1386
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,399
You're so pure.

1387
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:57,069
(A pure bottle of beer)

1388
00:55:57,939 --> 00:55:59,239
How long are you guys here?

1389
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:02,509
- We just dropped in for the day.
- Okay.

1390
00:56:02,509 --> 00:56:04,540
It was my idea to come down to Texas...

1391
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,009
because I loved cowboy culture.

1392
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:07,350
- Nice.
- Right.

1393
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,279
We also want to visit a ranch in between.

1394
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:12,080
- Yes?
- With real cowboys.

1395
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,649
I let them know
that we were looking for ranches.

1396
00:56:14,649 --> 00:56:17,719
Because they could give you
genuine information.

1397
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,430
She's a full-time cowgirl.

1398
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,830
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

1399
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,129
It's Tammy.

1400
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,660
How long have you been doing it?

1401
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:27,129
- Three.
- Since you were three?

1402
00:56:27,129 --> 00:56:28,200
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1403
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,569
- She's from a family of cowboys.
- She's a true cowgirl.

1404
00:56:30,899 --> 00:56:32,540
We want to buy hats.

1405
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:34,210
Like yours.

1406
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:35,640
Yes.

1407
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,140
(These hats?)

1408
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,540
(Putting it on him)

1409
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,950
That's...

1410
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:42,210
(She puts her hat on his head.)

1411
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:43,680
(Cheering)

1412
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,480
How does that happen
by just wearing a hat?

1413
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,620
It's too small!

1414
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,359
- Yes, it's too small.
- Might fit you.

1415
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,919
(Pani also tries on the hat.)

1416
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,489
(Silent)

1417
00:56:53,489 --> 00:56:54,930
Why doesn't anyone cheer for me?

1418
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,129
- I'm used to that treatment.
- You looked cute in it, though.

1419
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,200
(Do Yeon cheers him up.)

1420
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,339
People here are so friendly.

1421
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,540
I already feel like a local.

1422
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:11,210
I felt so nice. I was fascinated.

1423
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:14,410
I listened to music
with a bottle of beer in my hand,

1424
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,649
and the cowboys talked to us...

1425
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:18,419
and asked us why we were there.

1426
00:57:18,879 --> 00:57:21,919
I had finally found the people
that I wanted to meet.

1427
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,719
It was exhilarating.

1428
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:24,759
I bet.

1429
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:27,790
(Cheering)

1430
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:30,500
(The band plays an exciting song.)

1431
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,299
(Humming)

1432
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:37,839
(It's getting exciting.)

1433
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,109
(Approaching)

1434
00:57:40,109 --> 00:57:43,009
Cowboys have a certain swagger.

1435
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:44,910
- It's so romantic.
- It is.

1436
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,410
(Tammy is immersed in dancing.)

1437
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,879
(Let's see.)

1438
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:51,950
"Come on out."

1439
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:53,890
Here goes our dancer.

1440
00:57:55,149 --> 00:57:57,020
We can't miss his dance moves.

1441
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,419
(Did you call for me?)

1442
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,759
(The dancer from old times goes.)

1443
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:05,969
I don't know how to dance.

1444
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,270
It's just this.

1445
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,330
(He hides his past for now.)

1446
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:09,370
It's a three-step.

1447
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,700
Watch my feet.

1448
00:58:10,899 --> 00:58:12,910
One and three.

1449
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,069
One and three.

1450
00:58:15,069 --> 00:58:17,180
One and three.

1451
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,180
One and three.

1452
00:58:19,649 --> 00:58:20,649
You're good.

1453
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:23,520
This is like an American TV show.

1454
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,219
(In Texas, people dance in pairs.)

1455
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:27,750
I hear it's natural to dance
in pairs in Texas.

1456
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,520
(Grinning)

1457
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,560
(Spinning)

1458
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:35,759
Dancing Teo.

1459
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:37,500
(He said he was a bad dancer,
but he dances in unity.)

1460
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:39,930
How is he so good?

1461
00:58:40,129 --> 00:58:42,500
(Scratching)

1462
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:46,109
I didn't know that he used to be a dancer.
I was amazed.

1463
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,379
- Nice.
- So cool.

1464
00:58:50,379 --> 00:58:51,379
(And a grand finale)

1465
00:58:51,379 --> 00:58:53,480
It'd be amazing
if they kissed behind the bar.

1466
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,980
- After the dance.
- Yes.

1467
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,080
And her dad comes with a rifle.

1468
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,180
"How dare you kiss my daughter?"

1469
00:58:59,419 --> 00:59:01,250
(It's a whole TV series.)

1470
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,250
Thank you.

1471
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,819
Do you dance as well as I do...

1472
00:59:04,819 --> 00:59:06,660
but look better
because you're good-looking?

1473
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:08,930
Pretty good.

1474
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:11,230
(High-five)

1475
00:59:12,029 --> 00:59:14,430
- You should also...
- I hate dancing.

1476
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,140
Do you want to dance?

1477
00:59:17,899 --> 00:59:18,899
Do you want to dance?

1478
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,040
Yes!

1479
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:23,680
- No, I can't dance.
- Go!

1480
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,910
Show them, Pani.

1481
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,410
He might be so happy
when he actually dances.

1482
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,379
But I don't even know how to dance.

1483
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,680
What should I do?

1484
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,750
I can't dance.

1485
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:36,120
(She'll teach you.)

1486
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:38,660
(Creaking)

1487
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,359
- Oh, no.
- Turn.

1488
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:41,859
I look terrible.

1489
00:59:41,859 --> 00:59:42,930
(Come here.)

1490
00:59:43,029 --> 00:59:44,859
(In her arms)

1491
00:59:44,859 --> 00:59:45,899
That's so cute.

1492
00:59:48,569 --> 00:59:50,569
- He looked like an infant.
- That was an infant.

1493
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,509
I can't watch this.

1494
00:59:53,509 --> 00:59:54,739
(Embarrassed)

1495
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,580
Turn.

1496
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,040
(He's in her arms like he's an infant.)

1497
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,210
(Then, he spins.)

1498
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,609
- How cute.
- It's adorable.

1499
01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:05,379
They like it.

1500
01:00:05,379 --> 01:00:06,390
(He finally gets the Southern cheer.)

1501
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,120
- You have to go like this.
- Okay.

1502
01:00:13,029 --> 01:00:14,129
Where did he fly off to?

1503
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:16,460
It looks like you're doing jiu-jitsu.

1504
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,129
Jiu-jitsu?

1505
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,370
She threw him right away.

1506
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,799
(Knocking her hat off)

1507
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,500
Why did you knock her hat off?

1508
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,310
I felt so bad for Tammy.

1509
01:00:28,669 --> 01:00:31,480
But people liked it more when Pani danced.

1510
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,279
- They seem to like it.
- They do.

1511
01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:34,279
That's a relief.

1512
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,580
You were the life of the party.

1513
01:00:36,879 --> 01:00:39,520
(The life of the party runs away.)

1514
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,450
Come on out.

1515
01:00:43,089 --> 01:00:44,359
No.

1516
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:46,759
Come on. Go!

1517
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,629
No.

1518
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,430
- "No."
- That's hilarious.

1519
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:54,469
What is that?

1520
01:00:56,399 --> 01:00:58,100
(Sealed twice)

1521
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:00,839
How am I so bad at dancing?

1522
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,210
You managed to spin.

1523
01:01:03,439 --> 01:01:04,439
It's over.

1524
01:01:04,439 --> 01:01:05,879
(At least the finale is perfect.)

1525
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:09,850
(A thunderous applause)

1526
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:13,350
- Well done.
- Bravo!

1527
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:15,419
That was funny.

1528
01:01:15,649 --> 01:01:16,660
Sorry.

1529
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,189
No, you did great.

1530
01:01:20,489 --> 01:01:23,500
(He's exhausted
after pouring his soul into it.)

1531
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,000
- I was so...
- Isn't it exhausting?

1532
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,969
It's so exhausting.
I don't even know what I did.

1533
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:29,069
Good job.

1534
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,000
- "Good job?"
- Good job.

1535
01:01:31,299 --> 01:01:32,939
- Are you serious?
- That was good.

1536
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:35,710
Thank you.

1537
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:36,739
(Missing her hand)

1538
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:37,839
We're out of sync until the end.

1539
01:01:38,879 --> 01:01:40,910
But they cheer harder if you're bad.

1540
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:42,450
They cheer you on for attempting.

1541
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,680
I was so thankful.

1542
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,919
Hey, how's it going?
Good. What's your name?

1543
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:47,819
You were the person who danced out there.

1544
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:49,960
- Yes.
- I don't reckon you're from...

1545
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,989
We're from South Korea.

1546
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:55,160
What's going on now?

1547
01:01:55,689 --> 01:01:57,700
- I see.
- It's Eddie Pena.

1548
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,100
- Eddie? Eddie Pena.
- Yes, sir.

1549
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,100
I'm Teo. Nice to meet you.

1550
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,500
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1551
01:02:02,899 --> 01:02:04,140
I just washed my hands.

1552
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm glad you washed them.

1553
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:08,339
It's a pretty cool bar right here.

1554
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:12,310
Yes, it is. I mean,
we just dropped into town today...

1555
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:14,779
and wanted to check out cowboy culture.

1556
01:02:14,779 --> 01:02:16,109
- Cowboy culture?
- Yes.

1557
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,120
- Both music and cowboy culture.
- Yes.

1558
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,149
Okay.

1559
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:21,319
- If you want to cowboy, we can cowboy.
- Yes.

1560
01:02:21,319 --> 01:02:22,719
We cowboy a lot.

1561
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,689
We have all the ranches
on the neighbors and stuff...

1562
01:02:24,689 --> 01:02:25,790
- Right.
- helping each other out.

1563
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:28,160
Like how we exchange labor in Korea,

1564
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,399
they help each other out.

1565
01:02:30,629 --> 01:02:32,460
Would you mind going over there?

1566
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,169
Somewhere we can sit and talk?

1567
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:36,370
Yes.

1568
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:38,799
(The new cowboy friend joins them.)

1569
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:40,239
Where's your ranch?

1570
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:42,040
Over there in Devine.

1571
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:43,910
Devine?

1572
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,509
Teo kept trying to find a cowboy ranch.

1573
01:02:47,509 --> 01:02:49,310
He asked all of them.

1574
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:52,350
The owner of a ranch is called a rancher.

1575
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,419
Ranchers actually go to these bars...

1576
01:02:54,419 --> 01:02:56,759
and scout cowboys.

1577
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,330
So, that's like a labor office?

1578
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,560
Like, "You look like you can work."

1579
01:03:03,129 --> 01:03:04,799
- I like how it's not too formal.
- Yes.

1580
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,399
- A natural interview.
- It's an interview.

1581
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,370
It'll be busy. We could use a hand.

1582
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:13,669
(Is that right?)

1583
01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:15,540
Okay. Type in your number.

1584
01:03:16,279 --> 01:03:17,310
My name's Eddie.

1585
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:19,379
Eddie.

1586
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,080
(He finds the right time
to get his number.)

1587
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,879
(Excited)

1588
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:26,319
Finally.

1589
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,319
(Will his cowboy dream come true?)

1590
01:03:30,759 --> 01:03:33,430
Let's see what happened to the tornado.

1591
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:34,790
I'm driving toward it.

1592
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,359
(What?)

1593
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:40,029
(Kian84 turns his camera on
after spotting something.)

1594
01:03:40,029 --> 01:03:41,069
- Did he see something?
- Does he see it?

1595
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,669
(Surprised)

1596
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,040
(Through the haze...)

1597
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:50,509
- That looks like a loaf of bread.
- What is that?

1598
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:52,310
I think it's gathering.

1599
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,549
Do you see it?

1600
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,410
It's strange.

1601
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,620
(A spectacular scene where the clouds
seem to almost descend to the ground)

1602
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:58,580
How does it look so consistent?

1603
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,189
It's like a cream puff.

1604
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:03,290
Cream puff?

1605
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,520
- What do you call it?
- There's a spark right here.

1606
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,489
- Yes. What is it?
- It's a shelf cloud.

1607
01:04:08,589 --> 01:04:10,230
- Shelf cloud?
- Yes.

1608
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,899
That giant cloud is called a shelf cloud.

1609
01:04:13,899 --> 01:04:17,870
It's a type of cloud that forms
along the edge of a supercell,

1610
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,569
characterized by its unique
shelf-like shape,

1611
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:23,009
which occurs when the storm's updraft
meets warm, humid air.

1612
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:25,140
Oh, my.

1613
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:26,779
Oh, my gosh.

1614
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:30,020
- Oh, my.
- He went back to his childhood.

1615
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,850
That's a genuine expression on his face.

1616
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:33,719
Oh, my goodness.

1617
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,189
"The 41-year-old Dorothy."

1618
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:36,660
Oh, my goodness.

1619
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,060
(Pleased)

1620
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,160
Look, guys.

1621
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:44,529
The cloud stretches
all the way over there.

1622
01:04:45,759 --> 01:04:48,469
Gosh. Unbelievable!

1623
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:55,640
Do you want to stop by for a minute?
Do you want to get out?

1624
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,109
Here? Okay.

1625
01:04:57,379 --> 01:04:58,480
People normally...

1626
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,910
wait by the edge
when they chase tornadoes.

1627
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:05,020
Oh, because it might form in a flash?

1628
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,750
(Rushing)

1629
01:05:09,689 --> 01:05:10,989
Goodness.

1630
01:05:14,629 --> 01:05:17,029
(Amazed)

1631
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,700
That's insane!

1632
01:05:19,969 --> 01:05:21,799
It overwhelms you.

1633
01:05:21,799 --> 01:05:23,239
It's like I'm looking at a UFO.

1634
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:27,009
(In awe)

1635
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:29,879
Driving for hours was worth it.

1636
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:36,879
This is where the hot air...

1637
01:05:37,649 --> 01:05:40,520
meets the cold air.

1638
01:05:40,919 --> 01:05:42,149
So...

1639
01:05:42,149 --> 01:05:44,489
(The mad tornado scientist)

1640
01:05:44,489 --> 01:05:47,689
So, it creates a vortex...

1641
01:05:47,689 --> 01:05:50,259
to start spinning...

1642
01:05:50,259 --> 01:05:52,960
and becomes a tornado
when it hits the ground.

1643
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,299
You sound like an expert.

1644
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:57,640
It was phenomenal.

1645
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,509
When you look, the supercell is so close.

1646
01:06:00,509 --> 01:06:03,680
Only a few hundred meters from the ground.

1647
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,649
This part is hot, right?
But it's so cool inside.

1648
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:08,580
Even the color is different.

1649
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,950
What do you call it?
It's like another world in it.

1650
01:06:12,879 --> 01:06:14,890
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1651
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,520
He couldn't hold back.

1652
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,560
(The scientist is like a baby
who just started talking.)

1653
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,460
It's already overwhelming to see this...

1654
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,790
not just the tornado.

1655
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:26,000
(The wonderness weighs you down.)

1656
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,799
They slowly come.

1657
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:31,270
How should I describe this?

1658
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:35,370
- Pastry?
- He keeps...

1659
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,410
Something that looked like shell bread...

1660
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,410
was coming towards me...

1661
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,310
right above my head.

1662
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,319
(He feels embraced.)

1663
01:06:43,649 --> 01:06:46,080
It was approaching me,
so I looked to the side,

1664
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:49,520
and it stretched out far away.

1665
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,520
(The clouds stretch endlessly.)

1666
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,819
It was exhilarating.

1667
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:57,859
I told you about the part
that looked like shell bread, right?

1668
01:06:58,399 --> 01:07:02,299
The sky is so clear and peaceful
outside of that.

1669
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,669
Like a peaceful library.

1670
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:08,939
But it's a nightclub in the pastry.

1671
01:07:09,569 --> 01:07:12,540
There were sparkles and claps of thunder.

1672
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,149
- You make good analogies.
- Yes.

1673
01:07:14,779 --> 01:07:16,480
I felt overwhelmed.

1674
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,520
(Overwhelmed by the marvelous nature)

1675
01:07:17,919 --> 01:07:20,520
I've been to the Himalayas,

1676
01:07:21,419 --> 01:07:23,719
the Rocky Mountains, Uyuni...

1677
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:25,219
He's tasting every part of Earth.

1678
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:29,290
But the highlight of nature is...

1679
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:30,500
a tornado.

1680
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:33,100
The surreality.

1681
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:38,870
Let's go to the area
where it's not raining.

1682
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:42,339
I want to watch it from outside.

1683
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:45,739
I have to outrun the clouds.

1684
01:07:45,739 --> 01:07:46,850
(He needs to go past the clouds.)

1685
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:51,419
- Very amazing.
- Okay. Where are we going?

1686
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,879
Very amazing.

1687
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,790
We're inside the supercell,

1688
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,620
so it's pouring.

1689
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,160
As if...

1690
01:07:59,719 --> 01:08:01,890
the light bulb is worn out,

1691
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:05,029
the sky is sparkling.
Like it's turning on and off.

1692
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,629
This is so exciting.

1693
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:09,870
Oh, my.

1694
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,140
It's raining cats and dogs.

1695
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:13,640
I can't see anything.

1696
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,540
- Lightning bolt.
- Yes.

1697
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:19,509
We're in a rush.

1698
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:21,149
(He tries to escape
through the lightning storm.)

1699
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:23,549
(And they drive desperately...)

1700
01:08:23,549 --> 01:08:25,219
He still has a long way to go.

1701
01:08:25,219 --> 01:08:27,520
(for a while.)

1702
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:31,790
- We're not making much progress.
- What?

1703
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,790
It's moving about as fast as we are.

1704
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,029
- I see. It's too fast.
- Oh, the storm is moving too fast.

1705
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,600
(Frustrated)

1706
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:39,930
I need to get past the clouds,

1707
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,830
but they've gotten faster.

1708
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:45,439
Darn it.

1709
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,439
Oh, no.

1710
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:50,540
(He starts getting angry.)

1711
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,609
(Tearing up)

1712
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:55,950
Is he actually crying?

1713
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:59,779
It feels so close now that he's there,

1714
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:02,549
but he can't see it.

1715
01:09:03,049 --> 01:09:04,120
I feel bad.

1716
01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:10,129
(Humans go through 5 stages
of accepting grief.)

1717
01:09:10,299 --> 01:09:11,359
(Stage 1: Denial)

1718
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:14,129
If we go a little further...

1719
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:17,370
- Did he say he wanted to go straight?
- Just keep going, please.

1720
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:18,870
He's not giving up.

1721
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:19,939
(Stage 2: Anger)

1722
01:09:20,609 --> 01:09:22,939
Why won't he go faster?

1723
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,640
He's cruising in the overtaking lane.

1724
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:27,810
It'll be too dangerous to overtake there.

1725
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:30,819
I felt so rushed, though.
He was cruising in the overtaking lane.

1726
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:32,819
- It was raining.
- It's too dangerous in the rain.

1727
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,620
(Stage 3: Bargaining)

1728
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,589
I'm wondering...

1729
01:09:39,989 --> 01:09:41,629
if we can cut through...

1730
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:44,200
and watch it.

1731
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,630
We're kind of staying in the same spot.

1732
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:48,000
(He fails to bargain.)

1733
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,069
Oh, no.

1734
01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:50,139
(Stage 4: Depression)

1735
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:52,439
(Oh, no.)

1736
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,840
It looks like a cartoon.

1737
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:57,410
I only got to watch it
in the blink of an eye.

1738
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:01,149
What a bummer.

1739
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:02,479
(Stage 5: Acceptance)

1740
01:10:03,109 --> 01:10:06,349
But our journey is called...

1741
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:09,649
Music Adventure by Accident,
not "Tornado Adventure by Accident."

1742
01:10:10,189 --> 01:10:12,960
- It took you that long to realize that?
- It's really not.

1743
01:10:13,429 --> 01:10:15,559
Just getting the opportunity to watch...

1744
01:10:15,559 --> 01:10:18,800
the great spectacle
of the clouds gathering...

1745
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:21,729
makes me feel grateful.

1746
01:10:23,069 --> 01:10:24,099
(Coughing)

1747
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:27,010
- Oh, no.
- He needs to rest now.

1748
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,210
He's in bad condition,

1749
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:33,210
so I should let him go home soon.

1750
01:10:33,649 --> 01:10:36,309
I wanted to go further,

1751
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:39,819
but Todd looked exhausted.

1752
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,050
- I couldn't...
- Yes, he's done all he could.

1753
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:44,620
I've tried it, and I'd call it a success
if you got to see that...

1754
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,290
only after chasing it...

1755
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:47,429
- for a quarter of a day.
- Right.

1756
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:50,200
Let's get out.

1757
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,359
(He feels bad,
but he decides to pull back.)

1758
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:54,729
We'll go and find lodging nearby.

1759
01:10:56,939 --> 01:10:58,639
(They've traveled 782km now.)

1760
01:10:58,639 --> 01:11:00,910
- That's almost 800km.
- That's insane.

1761
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:03,040
They made a round trip
from Seoul to Busan in a day.

1762
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,510
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's insane.

1763
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:10,250
(The storm chase ends
after a long journey.)

1764
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:13,720
(But...)

1765
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:16,220
(2 hours ago that day)

1766
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:17,290
In Nebraska.

1767
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:21,559
(The tornado was seen 50km ahead of them.)

1768
01:11:22,559 --> 01:11:23,599
(Surprised)

1769
01:11:23,599 --> 01:11:25,330
- From another place.
- There was a tornado?

1770
01:11:25,529 --> 01:11:26,559
It's huge.

1771
01:11:26,559 --> 01:11:27,630
(Gasping)

1772
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:31,069
It's a huge storm. Oh, my gosh!

1773
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:32,939
- Oh, my gosh.
- The tornado!

1774
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:34,340
- That's huge.
- Big tornado!

1775
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:35,470
Big tornado!

1776
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:38,580
Two hours ago, south of where Kian84 was,

1777
01:11:38,809 --> 01:11:41,649
a large tornado formed.

1778
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:44,620
- Such bad timing.
- That's a shame.

1779
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:46,220
- You were just not destined.
- Right.

1780
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,550
- It's about timing, so...
- There's nothing to feel bad about.

1781
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,019
- It's just bad luck.
- It is.

1782
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:51,420
(But he doesn't hear their consolation.)

1783
01:11:54,689 --> 01:11:55,760
I wish I could make him one.

1784
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,130
- At least a small one.
- Kian84.

1785
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:02,929
- Use a soju bottle next time.
- Try it at our get-together.

1786
01:12:02,929 --> 01:12:03,970
(Laughing)

1787
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,569
- Use a soju bottle next time.
- Try it at our get-together.

1788
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:08,609
I've seen that a lot.

1789
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,179
- We'll make you a green tornado.
- A Korean tornado.

1790
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:13,750
(At least I have the Korean tornado.)

1791
01:12:14,809 --> 01:12:17,050
What a bummer.

1792
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:19,720
Also,

1793
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,189
as we drove south, chasing the tornado,

1794
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,319
we crossed a state.

1795
01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:28,290
You'd know if you've seen
the map of the US.

1796
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,160
A state is the size of a country.

1797
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:34,370
I think we'll have to take a plane
from a different airport...

1798
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:36,470
when we go back.

1799
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:40,170
We'll get a cheap motel room
that's nearby...

1800
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:42,739
and drink a bottle of soju before bed.

1801
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:46,179
You know the cheapest...

1802
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:49,349
- The cheapest motel?
- A motel?

1803
01:12:49,349 --> 01:12:50,450
- Yes.
- Omaha is over here.

1804
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:51,779
Omaha?

1805
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:55,050
A punk like me
who can't even spot a tornado...

1806
01:12:55,489 --> 01:12:57,359
doesn't deserve a good hotel room.

1807
01:12:58,920 --> 01:12:59,920
Poor him.

1808
01:13:01,389 --> 01:13:02,389
Maybe there's one here.

1809
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,929
"Motel." Yes. This one.

1810
01:13:05,429 --> 01:13:07,529
He's out of gas.

1811
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,170
It was full, but now it's gone.

1812
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:11,700
- I'll get some gas.
- Yes. Thank you.

1813
01:13:14,109 --> 01:13:16,210
I didn't get to see what I wanted,

1814
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,779
but I'm still hungry.

1815
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:22,050
It's not like I don't deserve to eat
just because I missed a tornado.

1816
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:23,109
Of course not.

1817
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,750
(He blames himself as he buys dinner.)

1818
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,689
No need to beat yourself up.
It took me six days to spot one.

1819
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:30,260
This is Music Adventure by Accident.

1820
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,290
- Right.
- Right.

1821
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,729
- You can sing as you eat.
- It's Music Adventure by Accident.

1822
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:35,830
(You're right.)

1823
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:39,359
Why are you...

1824
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:40,599
(He sees Todd eating outside.)

1825
01:13:40,599 --> 01:13:42,529
- He's eating on his feet.
- Oh, no.

1826
01:13:42,529 --> 01:13:44,340
He's eating while standing
after such a long day.

1827
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,500
It's making me feel bad.

1828
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,939
That must not be enough food.

1829
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,710
Is this how you usually grab a quick bite?

1830
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,080
Yes.

1831
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:53,710
He's eating alone,
and it's breaking my heart.

1832
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:54,710
(Feeling bad)

1833
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:57,779
- It's like watching my father.
- Exactly.

1834
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:01,120
Or would you like to eat with us?

1835
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,790
I don't know this town, so...

1836
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:06,189
It's just a small, little town.

1837
01:14:06,189 --> 01:14:07,859
I don't think they have very much.

1838
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:11,099
- You might have gas station food.
- Gas station food?

1839
01:14:11,599 --> 01:14:14,569
(This is the life of a storm chaser.)

1840
01:14:15,029 --> 01:14:17,470
They don't have a destination,
and he's not used to these roads.

1841
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:18,470
(Feeling the pain of a storm chaser)

1842
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:19,599
Okay.

1843
01:14:19,599 --> 01:14:21,239
(They arrive at a cheap motel nearby.)

1844
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:22,540
(Sioux Falls)

1845
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,010
(They departed from Sioux Falls.)

1846
01:14:24,279 --> 01:14:25,340
(Nebraska)

1847
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,779
(They crossed a state...)

1848
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:30,580
(and arrived at a motel in 7 hours.)

1849
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,450
(Their 835-kilometer-long journey ends.)

1850
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:33,450
That must have been tough.

1851
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:35,950
Are you sleeping here?

1852
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,059
- Yes.
- Yes? Okay.

1853
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,429
The storm chaser, Todd,
was also at a place he'd never been to.

1854
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:43,029
- Right.
- So, we stayed in the same motel.

1855
01:14:43,029 --> 01:14:44,929
- I see.
- I see.

1856
01:14:45,099 --> 01:14:47,200
Thank you for your hard work.

1857
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:49,399
- You're welcome.
- Yes.

1858
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:53,200
Tomorrow, I'll drop you off
at the Omaha Airport.

1859
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,239
- Airport?
- Oh, he drops him off there too.

1860
01:14:55,239 --> 01:14:56,239
That's nice.

1861
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:57,239
- That's so nice.
- Yes.

1862
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:01,309
- How much?
- It's 93 dollars.

1863
01:15:01,309 --> 01:15:04,120
Ninety-three dollars. It's not so cheap.

1864
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,220
(Approximately 130,000 won)

1865
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:09,050
- Todd, have a nice day.
- Yes.

1866
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:12,620
(Worn out)

1867
01:15:12,989 --> 01:15:14,059
Oh, no.

1868
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,929
Tell him he can go to bed now.

1869
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,460
Don't even invite him for dinner.

1870
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,729
- And why is it so dark there?
- Right?

1871
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:23,130
It looks like an attic.

1872
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,370
That's going to be a meme. "Worn out."

1873
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:27,210
I'm sure Todd is thinking,
"Screw MBC" in his seat.

1874
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:29,010
"Screw MBC."

1875
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:33,109
I feel so bad.

1876
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:35,880
He was just doing his job.

1877
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,550
He drove for over 700m.

1878
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:39,179
- We're sorry. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1879
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,220
(While Todd recharges...)

1880
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,120
No tornado.

1881
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,889
(Kian84 goes to his room.)

1882
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:50,160
(Sighing)

1883
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,229
(He's also worn out.)

1884
01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:52,300
He's gone through so much.

1885
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:54,630
Why is the room so dark?

1886
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,269
(Dark)

1887
01:15:57,269 --> 01:15:58,939
- It's like the movie...
- "No Country for Old Men."

1888
01:15:58,939 --> 01:16:01,010
- "No Country for Old Men."
- Goodness gracious.

1889
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,739
"No Tornado for Kian84."

1890
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:05,679
The window doesn't open?

1891
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:07,779
I couldn't open it easily.

1892
01:16:11,019 --> 01:16:14,050
(He can't stop feeling empty.)

1893
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,819
I should eat this.

1894
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,590
(Before they parted ways,)

1895
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,660
(Pani gave him instant bibimbap.)

1896
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,800
- That's our Pani.
- How sweet.

1897
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,000
How wholesome.

1898
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,599
Gas station food won't be enough.

1899
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:31,399
I should...

1900
01:16:31,899 --> 01:16:33,769
stick with the other members
for the remaining time.

1901
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:38,239
(He heats it as warmly as Pani's love.)

1902
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:40,479
- Is it already mixed?
- Yes.

1903
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:41,950
You just need to heat it and eat it.

1904
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,649
That's so convenient for traveling.

1905
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:48,849
(Sitting on the floor)

1906
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:51,220
(He takes a big spoonful.)

1907
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,489
(Taking a bite)

1908
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:57,529
(He enjoys the food while feeling empty.)

1909
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,599
It's good.

1910
01:17:00,929 --> 01:17:04,069
(He takes a sip of alcohol.)

1911
01:17:05,099 --> 01:17:06,670
What a shame.

1912
01:17:08,609 --> 01:17:12,880
(He still feels regretful.)

1913
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,479
(Reaching)

1914
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:20,750
(He plays with the instrument
he bought in New York.)

1915
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:26,559
<i>Somewhere over the...</i>

1916
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:29,889
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow...</i>

1917
01:17:29,889 --> 01:17:31,559
He's not meeting any of the tones.

1918
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:33,970
It's like a scene in a horror movie.

1919
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:37,000
(He's trying to get out
of feeling dispirited with music.)

1920
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,399
It was the day...

1921
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:40,639
I wanted to be Dorothy.

1922
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:44,439
I wanted to go to the world
of adventure and dreams,

1923
01:17:44,609 --> 01:17:46,710
but the gate was still closed.

1924
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,149
But I put it this way.
Happiness on a trip...

1925
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:53,179
doesn't come from completeness.

1926
01:17:53,479 --> 01:17:55,849
Today, I traveled a lot
and many things have happened.

1927
01:17:55,849 --> 01:17:57,660
I ordered an iced Americano,

1928
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:01,029
but I got the hottest coffee
I've ever had before.

1929
01:18:01,029 --> 01:18:02,660
It was also a part of my journey today.

1930
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:05,830
I spilled the coffee
on my shirt from Colorado.

1931
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:08,599
And that was also a part of the journey.

1932
01:18:08,599 --> 01:18:10,130
I didn't get to see a tornado,

1933
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:12,540
but it was a new journey for me.

1934
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:13,870
Oh, he learned something from it again.

1935
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:15,769
Honestly, I've never even thought
I would see a supercell.

1936
01:18:15,769 --> 01:18:18,239
But through that experience,

1937
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,510
I've been inspired,

1938
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,179
and it was a wonderful journey and fun.

1939
01:18:23,979 --> 01:18:27,389
Today, nothing went as I expected.

1940
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:30,189
But this kind of surprise...

1941
01:18:30,689 --> 01:18:31,989
makes it fun.

1942
01:18:32,889 --> 01:18:33,960
He's truly an interesting person.

1943
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,859
He never plans, but the one time he did,
even that didn't go right.

1944
01:18:36,859 --> 01:18:37,859
Oh, that's right.

1945
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,470
If there's another chance,

1946
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:44,269
- I want to try that again.
- Maybe in May next year?

1947
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:46,069
I rather think it was good
that he missed this chance.

1948
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:47,470
- Yes.
- Let's say he goes back next year...

1949
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,470
and if he sees a big one,

1950
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:50,910
- it would be a true pleasure.
- You're right.

1951
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:52,479
- That's it.
- I agree.

1952
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,510
Hey, Pani Bottle.

1953
01:18:55,649 --> 01:18:57,920
- Oh, hey.
- I bet he misses them even more.

1954
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,849
- Yes.
- I guess you are drunk.

1955
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,120
Just a little bit.

1956
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,790
Was it sweet or bitter?

1957
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:05,319
How can it be sweet?

1958
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:06,420
(Laughing)

1959
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,590
I remember he sounded somewhat depressed.

1960
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:10,660
I remember it.

1961
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,099
Did you see a tornado?

1962
01:19:12,099 --> 01:19:14,029
I only saw a supercell.

1963
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,800
- What a bummer.
- You at least saw something.

1964
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,370
Yes, I agree with you.

1965
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:21,309
How about you coming back quickly?

1966
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:25,510
Okay. I think I'll be there
before 3 p.m. tomorrow.

1967
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:27,880
- Okay.
- Yes.

1968
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,910
(After promising
to see each other tomorrow, they hang up.)

1969
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:32,080
It's a video call,
but he's not even looking at us.

1970
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,120
(He hangs up.)

1971
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,149
(He puts his phone away.)

1972
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:36,149
(He goes to bed,
with a sense of frustration.)

1973
01:19:36,149 --> 01:19:37,319
What a shame.

1974
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:38,559
(He feels bad for him.)

1975
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:43,260
(Please, let me have
a tornado dream tonight.)

1976
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:51,800
(The sun is shining, unlike yesterday.)

1977
01:19:53,139 --> 01:19:57,479
(He checks the weather
and packs his backpack.)

1978
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:00,080
- Check out.
- Thank you, sir.

1979
01:20:00,849 --> 01:20:01,910
Todd?

1980
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:04,819
- Hi, there.
- Yes.

1981
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,290
Wait. He didn't sleep there, did he?

1982
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:09,349
No way.

1983
01:20:09,349 --> 01:20:11,660
- I think he slept in that position.
- Why was he...

1984
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:13,389
- No way.
- What happened?

1985
01:20:13,389 --> 01:20:15,489
Did Todd not sleep in a bed?

1986
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:16,830
- No way.
- What happened?

1987
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:18,260
- How dare you?
- No, that's not what happened.

1988
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,599
Did you leave Todd alone there?

1989
01:20:19,599 --> 01:20:21,470
"You don't deserve any bed tonight!"

1990
01:20:22,029 --> 01:20:23,500
Hey, I have manners, all right?

1991
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,340
Would I really leave him there
when I know he drove for seven hours?

1992
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,000
Are you sure you didn't threaten him?

1993
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,609
- How could I...
- "Todd! No tornado!"

1994
01:20:29,609 --> 01:20:31,239
No tornado! No sleep!

1995
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:32,609
No sleep!

1996
01:20:32,779 --> 01:20:34,910
All jokes aside, he slept somewhere else.

1997
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:35,950
Are you sure?

1998
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:38,220
It must've been tough for him.

1999
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,149
- Hi, there.
- Yes.

2000
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:42,250
- Good night! No, I mean...
- Did you...

2001
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:44,359
(Are you going to sleep again?)

2002
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,620
So, we go to the Omaha Airport?

2003
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,989
Yes, Omaha Airport.

2004
01:20:49,229 --> 01:20:51,300
Did you have a good sleep?

2005
01:20:51,559 --> 01:20:53,229
- Yes, slept good.
- Good.

2006
01:20:53,229 --> 01:20:55,429
- He said he had a good sleep.
- What a relief.

2007
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,569
Now that I think about it,

2008
01:20:57,569 --> 01:21:00,170
Todd resembles Warren Buffett.

2009
01:21:01,569 --> 01:21:03,170
Oh, he does!

2010
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:04,979
(A genius in investment
and another genius in finding tornadoes)

2011
01:21:05,309 --> 01:21:06,939
Whenever I get in this car,

2012
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:09,380
I feel like I should chase tornadoes.

2013
01:21:11,019 --> 01:21:12,519
- Shall we move?
- Yes, let's go!

2014
01:21:12,519 --> 01:21:14,720
(He sets off with Todd Buffett.)

2015
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,460
I'm...

2016
01:21:18,519 --> 01:21:21,229
I will travel more.

2017
01:21:21,229 --> 01:21:24,399
From Omaha to Texas.

2018
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:26,029
- Oh, Texas?
- Yes.

2019
01:21:26,029 --> 01:21:28,069
Todd, how old are you?

2020
01:21:28,569 --> 01:21:30,939
- I'm 54.
- You're 54?

2021
01:21:32,069 --> 01:21:33,899
(He's translating the number into Korean.)

2022
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:34,910
Oh, my!

2023
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:35,910
(He finally got how old he is.)

2024
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:38,939
But you look like...

2025
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:40,639
you are 60.

2026
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:43,809
(I thought you were 60!)

2027
01:21:43,809 --> 01:21:44,849
(Missing)

2028
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:47,649
(He compliments Todd,
saying he looks older than he is.)

2029
01:21:47,649 --> 01:21:49,250
Don't say that.

2030
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:52,420
You're so rude, Kian84!

2031
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:53,590
(He realizes his mistake.)

2032
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:55,460
- Why did you say that?
- Why, Kian84!

2033
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,489
How could you say...

2034
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,399
I thought you were 60.

2035
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:01,470
- You mean 60?
- Yes, that's what I thought.

2036
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,500
I thought you were around 60.

2037
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:08,739
It's 84!

2038
01:22:09,309 --> 01:22:12,580
Wait, 84? Are you 84?

2039
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:14,450
(He thought Todd said he was 84 years old.
That's why he said Todd looks like 60.)

2040
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:16,080
- You mean 84?
- Yes, 84.

2041
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:17,580
No.

2042
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,080
Oh, eighty...

2043
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,120
(Oh, my)

2044
01:22:21,319 --> 01:22:23,550
Why on earth did you bring it up again?

2045
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:24,859
Oh, my gosh.

2046
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:29,189
- I was born in 1984.
- You were born in 1984?

2047
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:30,830
- It was 1984.
- Jeez, 824.

2048
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,800
He just wanted to make
small talk with him.

2049
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:35,529
Yes, I was born...

2050
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,970
(But it seems there's no way
he can be good friends with Todd.)

2051
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:40,840
If he's 84 years old,

2052
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:45,939
he was born in the 60s... No, the 50s.

2053
01:22:46,809 --> 01:22:48,580
Was he born in the 40s?

2054
01:22:49,649 --> 01:22:50,779
(He was born in 1970.)

2055
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:52,750
- He was born in 1970.
- Yes, that's right.

2056
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:57,019
I guess he's experienced
the many historical events in the US.

2057
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:01,059
He was young back then...

2058
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,889
when Elvis Presley was active.

2059
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,330
What he's talking about?

2060
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,330
(Elvis Presley died in 1977.)

2061
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:09,630
(He was 7 back then.)

2062
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:13,040
(Imagining)

2063
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:16,370
(As he's opening his fantasy world...)

2064
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,380
Yes, I get off here.

2065
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:19,609
(They arrived at the Omaha Airport.)

2066
01:23:19,609 --> 01:23:22,179
Thanks for your effort.

2067
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:24,109
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

2068
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:28,750
How much is the tornado tour?

2069
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,319
- Your friend Pani Bottle...
- Yes.

2070
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:32,489
recommended this
since you're a friend of his.

2071
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:34,859
Only 300 dollars for guests.

2072
01:23:34,859 --> 01:23:36,660
- It's 300 dollars?
- That's a deal!

2073
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:38,399
I bet the gas cost more than that.

2074
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,069
I paid over 300 dollars for 7 days,

2075
01:23:41,069 --> 01:23:42,569
I guess it was a special deal from him.

2076
01:23:42,569 --> 01:23:43,830
- Yes.
- Oh, he's so kind.

2077
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,170
And this is a small tip for your meal.

2078
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:49,069
Have lunch with this.

2079
01:23:49,069 --> 01:23:51,439
- Have a good lunch with this.
- Okay. Thank you.

2080
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:54,109
- Thank you, Todd. Yes.
- Thank you.

2081
01:23:54,109 --> 01:23:55,779
- Good luck!
- Good luck. Thank you.

2082
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:57,479
He is almost...

2083
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:00,649
as old as my oldest uncle.

2084
01:24:01,189 --> 01:24:04,149
- Stop talking about his age.
- He's not that much older than you.

2085
01:24:04,819 --> 01:24:06,260
I hope he stays healthy for a long time.

2086
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:07,760
(He finishes the tornado-chasing tour
with a misunderstanding.)

2087
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:09,689
So that's why...

2088
01:24:09,689 --> 01:24:10,689
Bye!

2089
01:24:12,059 --> 01:24:13,200
Why are you still there?

2090
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,899
It's like when we visit our relatives
in the country...

2091
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:16,769
and they stay out until we drive off.

2092
01:24:16,769 --> 01:24:17,800
Stay healthy!

2093
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,569
- Thanks to Todd, he saw a supercell.
- Yes, indeed.

2094
01:24:19,569 --> 01:24:20,599
(Goodbye, Tornado! Goodbye, Todd!)

2095
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:24,479
Now from Omaha, I leave for Texas.

2096
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:25,580
(From Omaha Airport
to San Antonio Airport)

2097
01:24:26,109 --> 01:24:28,050
How many cities have I visited so far?

2098
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,210
From New York,

2099
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:32,479
we went to Denver.

2100
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:34,689
Then, Sua...

2101
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,050
- Suari?
- Sioux Falls!

2102
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:39,359
- "Suari."
- Anyway, I was there.

2103
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:43,260
And this is the fourth city.

2104
01:24:43,559 --> 01:24:45,859
It's called San Antonio.

2105
01:24:45,859 --> 01:24:49,170
Pani Bottle and Teo arrived here...

2106
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:51,239
yesterday.

2107
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:53,399
Teo will be here to pick me up.

2108
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,510
So, I should wait.

2109
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:57,809
I thought he'd have been tired
due to the trip,

2110
01:24:57,809 --> 01:24:59,040
so I went there myself.

2111
01:24:59,479 --> 01:25:03,450
As I need to write a song
when I return to Korea,

2112
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:06,220
I said I would send
the inspiration I got here.

2113
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,019
Actually, I sent some today.

2114
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:11,460
- Oh, really?
- In the movie, "The Wizard of Oz,"

2115
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:15,029
A tornado takes Dorothy...

2116
01:25:15,029 --> 01:25:19,429
into a new world
called "The Wizard of Oz."

2117
01:25:19,429 --> 01:25:23,330
I also wanted to see such a world.

2118
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,439
- Hello.
- Please take a seat here.

2119
01:25:26,769 --> 01:25:30,139
I really liked the picture
of this tornado.

2120
01:25:30,139 --> 01:25:32,510
When I think about why I like it,

2121
01:25:33,309 --> 01:25:36,649
I was only in my early to mid-20s
when I saw the picture.

2122
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:39,819
So I was hoping something interesting
would happen in my life.

2123
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,550
But every day was just mundane.

2124
01:25:42,849 --> 01:25:45,720
All I could imagine was just black,
even in the military.

2125
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,189
I wanted to be a cartoonist back then.

2126
01:25:48,189 --> 01:25:49,689
When I went to a bookstore,

2127
01:25:49,689 --> 01:25:52,130
I realized I hadn't achieved anything.

2128
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:53,830
But others my age...

2129
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:56,000
were already releasing their own books.

2130
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,599
Seeing that, I would think,
"I want to be like them."

2131
01:25:57,599 --> 01:25:59,200
"When will my day come?"

2132
01:25:59,739 --> 01:26:02,470
Your debut was somewhat late.

2133
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:04,269
- I just felt inferior.
- I see.

2134
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:07,239
So, my hope that something big
will happen...

2135
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:09,950
is connected with this idea.

2136
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:11,920
- That story is like...
- "Adventure by Accident..."

2137
01:26:12,279 --> 01:26:15,550
That's what "Adventure by Accident"
meant to me.

2138
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:18,489
I entered a world through a tornado...

2139
01:26:18,489 --> 01:26:21,189
- called "Adventure by Accident..."
- Oh, Varanasi!

2140
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:24,859
that never seemed relevant to me.

2141
01:26:24,859 --> 01:26:26,029
(The tornado was a trip
that opened a gate to the new world.)

2142
01:26:26,029 --> 01:26:28,729
That's what I think.

2143
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,830
That is really...

2144
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:32,500
You experienced a lot, Kian84.

2145
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,639
I'm so grateful.

2146
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:38,779
(Now, he doesn't wait
for another tornado.)

2147
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:41,550
A 41-year-old Dorothy.

2148
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,710
(A 41-year-old Dorothy who went
on a journey searching for a tornado)

2149
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:43,779
That's cool.

2150
01:26:44,109 --> 01:26:46,319
As a tornado means something to Dorothy,

2151
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,590
I feel the same about
"Adventure by Accident."

2152
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,559
- Amazing.
- That's cool.

2153
01:26:51,559 --> 01:26:52,559
What's that?

2154
01:26:54,729 --> 01:26:55,830
They found the phrase.

2155
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:57,559
As predicted...

2156
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:01,870
(A life that searches
for a true treasure!)

2157
01:27:03,099 --> 01:27:06,139
It felt like time passed by so quickly.

2158
01:27:06,139 --> 01:27:07,139
(What kind of music will he create
with the inspiration from the tornado?)

2159
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,670
I thought it was time
to reflect on myself.

2160
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,309
Wait. I should call Teo first.

2161
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:12,910
Yes, Teo.

2162
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:15,679
- Hello?
- Yes, Teo.

2163
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:17,779
Hi. Did you arrive all right?

2164
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,019
Yes, I'm at...

2165
01:27:20,519 --> 01:27:24,250
Come outside, turn right, and go straight.

2166
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:25,689
Wait a minute.

2167
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,429
Wait, Teo.

2168
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,160
Turn right?

2169
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,200
It's hot here.

2170
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:34,470
Come to B22.

2171
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:36,429
- B22.
- It's the shuttle pick-up spot.

2172
01:27:36,429 --> 01:27:39,200
- B22, I see.
- Yes, B22.

2173
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,970
I got it. Wait a second. I'm almost there.

2174
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:43,170
A pickup truck?

2175
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:44,979
They've only been apart for one day.

2176
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,510
It must be so nice to see him again.

2177
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:48,979
(The eldest brother he missed)

2178
01:27:49,309 --> 01:27:50,309
I see you.

2179
01:27:50,649 --> 01:27:51,679
(Exclaiming)

2180
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:52,880
(Laughing)

2181
01:27:53,979 --> 01:27:54,989
Why?

2182
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:03,189
(Denim-on-denim and a cowboy hat)

2183
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:04,599
He looks just like a game character.

2184
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:06,359
Yeah, cowboy.

2185
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:07,729
He looks so cool.

2186
01:28:09,029 --> 01:28:10,029
(You are?)

2187
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:14,510
(Yes, I'm Cowboy Teo.)

2188
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:15,910
He looks amazing.

2189
01:28:16,439 --> 01:28:18,010
He's an actor, all right.

2190
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,580
(Embracing)

2191
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:25,819
- He looks cool.
- He looks good in those clothes.

2192
01:28:26,779 --> 01:28:28,220
(Scanning)

2193
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:30,590
These clothes suit you just right.

2194
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:32,760
Let's get inside and talk.

2195
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,290
- It's too hot here.
- Let's get in the car first.

2196
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:35,929
Let's talk with the air conditioner on.

2197
01:28:35,929 --> 01:28:36,929
Yes, let's do that.

2198
01:28:37,689 --> 01:28:39,260
You look great in those clothes.

2199
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:46,000
We were only apart for one day,

2200
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,599
but it feels like it's been a week.

2201
01:28:47,599 --> 01:28:48,609
I know.

2202
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:50,809
One day felt like a week.

2203
01:28:51,609 --> 01:28:53,580
- Let's get going.
- Let's go.

2204
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,149
(They leave after sharing dear feelings.)

2205
01:28:55,779 --> 01:28:57,410
You look like a local, Teo.

2206
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:59,149
(What will happen with Teo
who suddenly became a cowboy?)

2207
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:02,550
(Dorothy84 didn't get to see a tornado.)

2208
01:29:03,019 --> 01:29:06,689
(He's born again in colorful Texas.)

2209
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:10,290
(Showered by Southern hospitality)

2210
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:12,529
(His heart melted away.)

2211
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:14,099
(It's more than warm.)

2212
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:15,399
(It feels hot in here!)

2213
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,170
(You... Solo?)

2214
01:29:17,529 --> 01:29:18,870
(Maybe)

2215
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:20,439
(Do you have a girlfriend?)

2216
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:21,540
(Maybe)

2217
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,040
(Playing mind games)

2218
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:25,510
(Has he met a love tornado?)

2219
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:27,880
(Going deeper into Texas)

2220
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:30,679
(To the cowboy farm)

2221
01:29:31,319 --> 01:29:33,979
(Fantasy is alive...)

2222
01:29:34,689 --> 01:29:35,720
(in the cowboy's wild life.)

2223
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:39,260
(Is this a paradise filled with romance?)

2224
01:29:40,189 --> 01:29:43,189
(It turns out to be a place
filled with chores.)

2225
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:47,899
(They had no idea...)

2226
01:29:47,899 --> 01:29:49,269
(about the tough world of cowboys.)

2227
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:51,130
(They didn't imagine to face...)

2228
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:52,840
(the reality of a cowboy's life.)

2229
01:29:56,739 --> 01:29:59,439
(Music Adventure by Accident)
