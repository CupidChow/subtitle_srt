1
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,340
Last week, the three turning into cowboys,
also known as the wilds' outlaws,

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,579
was a big hit.

3
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,450
In particular,
viewers said Teo's "Texas Summer..."

4
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,379
- was a big gift.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,549
(Music Adventure by Accident's
second song, "Texas Summer")

6
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,050
(Teo's cheerful country music is great.
I love you!)

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,219
(Songs with stories are so touching.)

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,059
(The challenge is as hot
as the Texas heat.)

9
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,259
(Song Joong Ki, Let's make a hit!)

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,129
(Please love "Texas Summer.")

11
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,899
It feels quite empty today.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,639
Where did you go, Pani Bottle?

13
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:50,669
(Where is Youngest Bottle?)

14
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:53,540
Pani Bottle already had plans.

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,879
- I see.
- That's why he's not here.

16
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:57,910
It's his full-time job. Let's excuse him.

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,910
- We understand.
- Yes.

18
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:02,620
Let's watch
how the boys spent the last day...

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,989
after the tearful farewell
with the cowboys they grew fond of.

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,120
Today, we'll go to Houston.

21
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,359
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

22
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:26,529
(To Houston!)

23
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,029
- Tell us when you get sleepy.
- Okay.

24
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,669
- Let me drive next.
- I'll tell you.

25
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,139
- I'll drive as much as possible.
- You shouldn't if you get sleepy.

26
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,439
But dozing off will be dangerous.

27
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,740
I'll miss the beer at this place so much.

28
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,680
It's going to make me cry.

29
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,210
I'll really miss the cowboys.

30
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,279
(The night with the cowboys
was unforgettable.)

31
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:49,120
The cowboys showed me the grasshopper
they caught.

32
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,249
They were very open with us.

33
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,689
(What was it like to you, Kian84?)

34
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,630
- He's sleepy.
- Kian84 is passed out.

35
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:00,430
How cold-hearted.

36
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,299
Tell us when you get sleepy, Pani Bottle.

37
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:06,730
He's sleeping like a baby.

38
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,040
Houston. The way to Houston.

39
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:12,939
(Discovers something)

40
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,639
"Buc-ee's."

41
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,609
(The rest area sign appears just in time.)

42
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,010
Kian84.

43
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,120
Kian84.

44
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,620
Yes?

45
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,090
It's the rest area. We're heading inside.

46
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:27,460
Let's grab a meal.

47
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,859
- Okay.
- Our lunch.

48
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,730
(Glancing)

49
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,329
Look at that.

50
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,430
Goodness.

51
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,529
I've never seen...

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,040
- so many gas pumps.
- What? Is that a gas station?

53
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,310
- What a big gas station.
- Yes.

54
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,179
Everything in Texas is huge. I'm serious.

55
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,709
(Texas-sized gas station)

56
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,109
Guys.

57
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,049
We stopped at a rest area
on our way to Houston.

58
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,519
This is said to be
the biggest rest area in Texas.

59
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,560
Let's check it out.

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,230
Do you see all of that, Kian84?

61
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,130
Goodness.

62
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:08,929
- It's crazy.
- It's crazy.

63
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,299
This place is huge.

64
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,470
- My goodness.
- Rather than a rest area,

65
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,899
- isn't it Costco?
- I know, right?

66
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,369
How nice.

67
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,470
(The place has everything.)

68
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,980
- How is this a gas station?
- Seriously.

69
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,709
Oh, my.

70
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,950
It must have everything.

71
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,480
There's a food court over there.

72
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,519
You're right.

73
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:29,549
Let's pick out some food.

74
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:30,549
You must be hungry.

75
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:33,489
(They add to the shopping basket
without hesitation.)

76
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:37,859
These are all beef jerky.

77
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,260
This place has Korean BBQ-flavored
beef jerky.

78
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,060
(He spots the Korean BBQ flavor.)

79
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,369
- Can I get a quarter pound of that?
- It's for you.

80
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,339
- Thank you so much.
- Take care.

81
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:49,369
I appreciate it.

82
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:50,709
Pani Bottle...

83
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:54,339
and Kian84 must be
picking out their food, right?

84
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:55,679
What should I get?

85
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,310
(Looking around)

86
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,780
The clothes here are all so nice.

87
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,989
How much is it?

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
It's 24 dollars.

89
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,359
I want to buy one.

90
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:09,760
Gosh, look at this one.

91
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,929
- A "Star Wars" shirt.
- That's a style Pani Bottle likes.

92
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,530
You're right.
It's like Pani Bottle's closet.

93
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,230
(Sure enough,
Pani Bottle is exploring his closet.)

94
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,000
Pani Bottle is having a blast.

95
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,669
Texas hunting style.

96
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,579
I don't like it.

97
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,910
Americans will love it if I wear this one.

98
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,419
I'll buy this one and the US flag.

99
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,389
These two.

100
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,419
It's quite big.
I'll get myself a shopping basket.

101
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,959
(Adding a pair of socks)

102
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,859
These pants. Those shirts.

103
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,229
I bought socks.

104
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,229
You're buying some clothes.

105
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,500
- I couldn't help it.
- Me too. Right?

106
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,269
Because I like shirts too.

107
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,639
(Shaking his head)

108
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,670
The display is nice.

109
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,469
- Teo.
- Did you not get any food?

110
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:59,209
- I will do that now.
- Now?

111
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,709
Yes. Look at some clothes.
I'll be right back.

112
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,479
- Got it.
- Choosing clothes won't take long.

113
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,180
- I'm in for some brisket.
- Burgers.

114
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,120
- Burgers.
- Cherry flavored, please.

115
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,180
A cherry coke.

116
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,050
This will be my treat.

117
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,889
- You will?
- Yes.

118
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:17,789
There was so much I wanted.
I'm even buying socks.

119
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,430
Because Pani Bottle had the most to buy,

120
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:25,670
- he said he'd pay for it all.
- How generous.

121
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,539
- It's 193.90 dollars.
- Okay.

122
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,440
He's got it.

123
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,709
(Pani Bottle's card)

124
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,940
Thank you, Pani Bottle.

125
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,479
This is a travel credit card.
I don't need to exchange money.

126
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,510
- Really?
- You just need to pay.

127
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,779
As expected of you
to bring such a card overseas.

128
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,849
I should make one when I return to Korea.

129
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,750
I bought some food
we could share while driving.

130
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,219
You're leaving with hands full of bags.

131
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,329
Take that to Jamaica.

132
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,589
(The big brother
takes care of his siblings first.)

133
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,399
(Try this too.)

134
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,700
(Amazed)

135
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,339
(Digging in)

136
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,670
There are no vegetables inside.

137
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,209
- Here.
- It's all meat.

138
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,279
(The meat is thicker than the bread.)

139
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,149
- Look at the patty.
- It's more or less just meat.

140
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,079
- Texas sure loves meat.
- They fight everything with meat.

141
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,789
(Stops)

142
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,019
Even so, I'm happy to eat meat
for every single meal.

143
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,459
(The real cowboy
loves everything about Texas.)

144
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,500
What will we do in Houston?

145
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,370
- Either way, it's our last night.
- Yes.

146
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,170
Let's go to a live bar.

147
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,670
- "A live bar?"
- Let's go to one...

148
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,570
and sing together
to celebrate our last night.

149
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,339
I went to a camp in elementary school.

150
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,479
My friend sang...

151
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,680
"Come Back Home" by Seo Taiji and Boys
while dancing.

152
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,789
The kids went wild back then.

153
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,190
I realized that the stage
had such ecstasy.

154
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,990
Since then,
my dream was to become a singer.

155
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,500
(He showed his desire to perform
before the trip.)

156
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,769
(He dreamed of becoming a singer
for 41 years.)

157
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,670
(He met a producer.)

158
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,969
(Shall I sing on stage in the US?)

159
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,709
(Something fun.)

160
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,680
(I like how the lyrics are simple.)

161
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,450
(The song he chose was...)

162
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,620
("September" by Earth, Wind, and Fire.)

163
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,420
(A cheerful punk music
released in the 1970s.)

164
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,690
(It's a song that is still loved
by Americans.)

165
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,070
(He practiced hard in Korea.)

166
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,029
(Diligent)

167
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,310
(Sharing his bucket list
with his brothers)

168
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,940
(Let's give it a shot!)

169
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,839
(Gladly)

170
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,110
As Kian84 said, singing "September"
sounded like a lot of fun.

171
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:53,610
Right.

172
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,849
(That was how the US trio was formed.)

173
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:01,620
(Throughout the trip,)

174
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,899
(they practiced to the point
they could easily sing "September.")

175
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,899
(The day before in their room)

176
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,300
Shall we sing "September"
in a karaoke in Houston?

177
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:17,409
Have you been to an American one?

178
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:20,539
Yes, I have. The karaoke is an open bar.

179
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,079
- That's nice.
- Right?

180
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,950
"A live bar? Can ordinary people sing?"

181
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,979
"Okay. Then let's go."

182
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,149
It's a music adventure. We can't
just leave after listening to music.

183
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,349
We should also sing.

184
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:33,519
Because I didn't know the US well,

185
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:39,029
I asked musicians if there were
recommended live bars in Houston.

186
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,229
As I belong to a music agency,

187
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,399
- getting such information is easy.
- He's in AOMG.

188
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,070
- Is this trash?
- Yes.

189
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,800
(Putting on his new item)

190
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,139
You bought sunglasses for the stage.

191
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:53,769
- Is everyone buckled up?
- Yes.

192
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:56,209
Let's get going.

193
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,250
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

194
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,249
Goodness, the weather is great.

195
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:03,680
- The sky is a piece of art.
- It is.

196
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:07,390
Let's go to a nearby hotel first.

197
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,390
- There's a little problem in Houston.
- Yes?

198
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,589
- There's a power outage.
- What?

199
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:15,030
Was there a tornado?

200
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,900
- No. A hurricane, not a tornado.
- What?

201
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:19,729
It passed by, but Houston got struck.

202
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:22,040
It must've been a bad one.

203
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:27,009
(A hurricane hit Houston two days ago.)

204
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,209
Two days ago?

205
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:29,310
(A hurricane hit Houston two days ago.)

206
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,310
Is everyone okay?

207
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,780
(Houston became a wreck.)

208
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,849
That's really bad.

209
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,219
It might not be a complete blackout,
but they have a power shortage.

210
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:44,530
I'm the type to save up money.

211
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,290
But the hotel has no power.

212
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,829
- I looked up some places.
- Okay.

213
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:52,829
Let's head to a place
with a low possibility of a power outage.

214
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:55,499
To think we'd experience
a blackout in the US.

215
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,070
But it could be better than we thought.

216
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,109
(What's that?)

217
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,910
The hurricane must've been bad.
The sign boards are wrecked.

218
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,479
(Tattered)

219
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:07,579
The things on the road
must've been from the hurricane.

220
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,050
(Traces of the hurricane
can be seen everywhere.)

221
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:15,020
(Houston is a metropolis
with skyscrapers...)

222
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,719
(and a cutting-edge city
famous for its space industry.)

223
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,790
Apollo 11 now. This is Houston.
Houston clear.

224
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,060
(Currently, there is severe damage
in various places.)

225
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,629
The utility pole has fallen.

226
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,770
(The collapsed utility pole
has been left unattended.)

227
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,869
Many utility poles have fallen.

228
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:33,140
- It's bent.
- My goodness.

229
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:36,709
Many areas had been swept away
and left unrepaired.

230
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,709
It must've been strong.

231
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,420
- They're bent.
- Yes, you're right.

232
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:42,650
My goodness.

233
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,190
We're here. This is the place.

234
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,690
It looks expensive.

235
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,959
It must cost around 500 dollars per night.

236
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,390
- Look. All the trees fell.
- You're right.

237
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,599
My goodness. They're all knocked down.

238
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,129
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

239
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:57,800
They're all broken into pieces.

240
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,930
- My goodness.
- Look at that.

241
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,200
At this point, it's a relief that
they're even managing to operate.

242
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,140
- Oh, my.
- Let's go rest first.

243
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,979
- Thank you for your efforts.
- Thank you for your efforts.

244
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:09,879
- You must be tired.
- My gosh.

245
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,479
(They arrived after a 4-hour drive.)

246
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,180
Let's check in first.

247
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,420
(Groaning)

248
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,950
(It hurts.)

249
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,790
(Their bodies feel stiff
from the long-distance travel.)

250
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,229
In the US, you spend a day traveling.

251
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,790
You look exhausted.

252
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,030
Your face is full of tiredness.

253
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:31,469
I rolled around at the ranch
and haven't even had a shower yet.

254
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,170
You're drenched.

255
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,499
My pants...

256
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,339
feel like a salt field.

257
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:41,839
It tastes salty.

258
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,310
I better get a shower.

259
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,509
(He's going to shower first.)

260
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,219
(They enter the hotel.)

261
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,749
- Oh, my.
- It seems like the electricity is out.

262
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,119
Or not. It looks dark inside.

263
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,320
- Is it? Yes, it's dark.
- I know.

264
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,119
- It seems to be emergency power.
- Right?

265
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,329
(Not sure)

266
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,930
- There's no electricity.
- I guess there's no electricity.

267
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,400
- There’s a power outage here too.
- I see.

268
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,070
It can't be this dark.

269
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,270
They're using emergency power.

270
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,040
- Hello.
- Let's check in first.

271
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,300
Yes, we have a reservation.

272
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,009
I can't see.

273
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,239
It's dark here, right?

274
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,640
Yes, it is.

275
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,780
Is the light from emergency electricity?

276
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,810
Generator.

277
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,180
- Oh, they're using a generator.
- They're using a generator.

278
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,280
- Yes, it’s just backup power.
- They’re only using the minimum.

279
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,489
You got any idea how long
the electricity's going to stay like this?

280
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:27,759
Hopefully tomorrow...

281
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,420
- it will come back on.
- Tomorrow?

282
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,430
How long will the power outage last?

283
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,430
Then,

284
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,959
I think I will need to check the live bar.

285
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,969
We're not sure...

286
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:40,170
if there's a power outage there too.

287
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,170
You two can rest here.

288
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,440
If everything is fine, I'll text you
to take a taxi or Uber.

289
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,509
- My goodness.
- In a developed country...

290
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:46,570
(Even though he's tired from driving,
he volunteers to check the live bar.)

291
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,440
Four, zero. It's here.

292
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,579
My goodness.

293
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,709
(What will the room situation
be like for the three people?)

294
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:52,749
What?

295
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,050
Is there no air conditioning?

296
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,749
- If there's no air conditioning...
- Let me try.

297
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:59,119
- It's this one, right?
- Yes, let me try.

298
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:01,290
But it should be on automatically.

299
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,619
The power is on.

300
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,060
No.

301
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,629
(Pressing the button)

302
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:08,060
My goodness. Nothing is working.

303
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,459
- Is there no air conditioning?
- No.

304
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:10,459
TV.

305
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:11,770
(Pressing the button)

306
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,930
We can't turn it on?

307
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,040
The lights, the fridge,
the air conditioner, nothing was working.

308
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,869
Everything was out of service.

309
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:17,910
(Everything was out of service.)

310
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,009
- Nothing is working.
- How about the lights in the toilet?

311
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,579
It's weak, but it's on.

312
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,810
(Completely dark)

313
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,009
- Hey.
- Is it not turning on?

314
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:27,079
There's no light here.

315
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,219
You can use your phone.

316
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:31,290
I'm tired.

317
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,349
(So tired)

318
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,119
(Falling on the bed)

319
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:36,619
(Groaning)

320
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:38,890
(Why are we facing such trials?)

321
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,030
He's tired.

322
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,259
- Natural light.
- But...

323
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,099
- Natural light.
- Wait.

324
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,070
What kind of hotel is this hot?

325
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,339
I want to go back to Devine.

326
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,839
(Laughing in despair)

327
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,879
(They've both lost it.)

328
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,410
Will the live bar be open
when there's a power outage?

329
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,910
It's not easy.

330
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,910
(Worried Pani Bottle)

331
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,119
- I'll get going. I'll call you.
- Goodbye.

332
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,150
- Let's listen to the song several times.
- Let's do that.

333
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:09,259
(They warm up their voices
while waiting for Pani Bottle.)

334
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:13,160
(When they were practicing
for quite some time)

335
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,359
- Hello.
- Yes, Pani.

336
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,829
- Kian84, this place...
- Yes.

337
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,599
- You should call a taxi here.
- Okay.

338
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,640
- I guess it's open.
- Come and...

339
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,239
Is it a place
where people can sing freely?

340
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
It's very free.
At least that's what it seems like.

341
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,379
Okay. We'll be there.

342
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,680
- Yes.
- Okay.

343
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,979
That's a relief.

344
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:33,050
Let's go.

345
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,420
- Go.
- Let's go!

346
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,589
(They traveled 15 minutes by car.)

347
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,390
Finally,

348
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,660
(They arrive at the bar.)

349
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,030
- the day has come.
- Finally, the day has come.

350
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,530
(Feeling nervous)

351
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:50,700
- Howdy.
- Hi.

352
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,129
- This is for the runners.
- Yes.

353
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,300
- A runner?
- Yes, did you go running?

354
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,999
- Houston Marathon?
- No, we didn't run.

355
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:59,540
- Yes, the UT health event.
- No.

356
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,680
It's for the people
who participated in the marathon.

357
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,709
It's an open mic for them.

358
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,410
It's called an "Open Mic Night."

359
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,979
Anybody can hold the microphone.
Some people recite poems,

360
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:10,379
- some rap,
- Some people rap.

361
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:13,890
- and some play instruments.
- Really?

362
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,129
(It's like the "National Singing Contest"
where anyone can be on stage.)

363
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:22,160
(Open mic means
it's an open stage to the public.)

364
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,060
There are still people running.

365
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:25,400
Hello.

366
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,070
(Hello, Pani Bottle.)

367
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,570
Hello.

368
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,009
- We're doomed.
- Why?

369
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,709
(Kian84, we're doomed.)

370
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:34,810
There are too many people.

371
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,009
(It's crowded.)

372
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:39,450
It's their first stage.

373
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,180
The air conditioning was working here,
so there were many customers.

374
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,180
My goodness.

375
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,849
There are many people.

376
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,749
It's a good thing
that there are many people.

377
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:49,619
- We're doomed if there are no people.
- Let's practice.

378
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,229
I registered.

379
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,160
There are quite a lot of people
who registered.

380
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:57,660
Should I write pop for the genre?
I'm not sure.

381
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,400
- If you want to...
- You wrote that?

382
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,499
participate in a talent show in the US,
you can register like this.

383
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,839
The microphone sound is
slightly distorted, so they won't know...

384
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,879
- if we can’t sing well.
- They’ll be forgiving.

385
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:11,810
A manager came and said...

386
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,950
we could go upstairs and practice.

387
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:16,849
- Let's go upstairs.
- Yes, we can go upstairs.

388
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,050
There's no space here.

389
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:19,349
They said we could go this way.

390
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:24,060
Oh, the musicians are all waiting here.

391
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,190
It's here.

392
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,300
(They stumbled upon
the second-floor terrace.)

393
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:30,729
Gosh, what a great vibe.

394
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,530
(Why do I hear someone singing?)

395
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,770
(It's crowded.)

396
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:38,770
Is it here?

397
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,239
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

398
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,109
(Laughing)

399
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,640
My goodness. This is crazy!

400
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:46,310
(It isn't an indoor stage.)

401
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,310
- I mean...
- I see.

402
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,420
- The stage is huge.
- I know.

403
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,780
It's not just a bar.

404
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,920
Are you singing in that square?

405
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,219
My goodness. This is too big.

406
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,759
I thought the bar would be the same size
as the bar we went to in Texas.

407
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:03,959
I was surprised that it was so big.

408
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,999
My gosh.

409
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:07,800
I was worried...

410
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,839
that no one would be interested
in our singing.

411
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,410
(It's big, but maybe there will be no one
interested in hearing us sing.)

412
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,540
(The square is full of people.)

413
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,579
It's a good chance,
but they must be nervous.

414
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,180
Why is it so big?

415
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,749
(Singing)

416
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:28,119
The microphone is clear.

417
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,489
- My gosh.
- He's so good.

418
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:32,629
He's a professional singer.

419
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,830
He's very good at singing.

420
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,660
The microphone sound
is not distorted at all.

421
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,229
It's so clear.

422
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:40,799
(He lost his motivation.)

423
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,840
It's so nice.

424
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,370
The previous team
needs to mess up a bit for us.

425
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,539
Then, we can make it work.

426
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,479
(Pani Bottle and Kian84 are shocked.)

427
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,509
Why is he so good?

428
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:52,080
Let's just think of it
as coming to have fun,

429
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,979
- and lift the mood.
- Yes.

430
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,350
- Let's practice now.
- Yes, let's go inside.

431
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,380
(Practice makes perfect!)

432
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:02,160
(They arrive at the practice room
with a mix of anxiety and excitement.)

433
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:06,229
You know the person
who offered to help our practice?

434
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,259
I'll go and find them.

435
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:10,200
- The house band here?
- Yes.

436
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,430
- Hello.
- Hi.

437
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,670
- Yes.
- Oh, yes?

438
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,200
Do you need a band to back you up?

439
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,539
- Can we? Can we use...
- Yes! We can.

440
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,509
We're going to sing a song.

441
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,410
- This song, "September."
- "September?" Okay.

442
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,779
- Yes, we can do that. Yes.
- Yes. Okay.

443
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:29,880
They are a band associated with that bar.

444
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,749
You call that a house band.

445
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,959
They play music for all the participants
if they want.

446
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,319
- They back you up.
- They're a band.

447
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,160
In the last session of "Gag Concert,"

448
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,900
- Yes.
- they're a house band too.

449
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,729
I'll ask if they can play for us.

450
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:47,569
- We can practice together.
- Yes.

451
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:49,170
- That would be better.
- I'll go and ask.

452
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,499
- Pani.
- Yes.

453
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:53,239
- You look very stressed.
- I'm...

454
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,279
There's a reason for that.
I have a severe fear of stages.

455
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,209
So I usually refuse to be on stage.

456
00:19:58,709 --> 00:19:59,950
I won't do it even if they offer me
thousands and thousands of dollars.

457
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,180
- I won't.
- Right? You're usually...

458
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,279
I don't do it.

459
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,150
Pani's face was frozen.

460
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,489
He doesn't sing when we go to karaoke.

461
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:12,130
When we were singing
for Kian84's birthday, he was...

462
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,759
(I'm seriously...)

463
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,759
(I have a severe fear of stages.)

464
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,200
(The stage that Pani was afraid of)

465
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,569
(A karaoke session with three people)

466
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:20,100
(To me, this is a stage.)

467
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,069
(In the end, he sat...)

468
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,910
(and sang with his eyes closed.)

469
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,670
(A surprising high-pitched shouting)

470
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,739
(He's quite good at singing.)

471
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,880
(He ended up sweating a lot.)

472
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:34,450
I'm a bit...

473
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:38,420
I hate going on stage.

474
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:42,019
But...

475
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,059
I'm reminding myself of Kian84's dream.

476
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,090
(He knows that
it was Kian84's long-held dream.)

477
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,160
I just kept telling myself

478
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,600
that we had to show our best performance
no matter what.

479
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,440
I felt...

480
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:58,170
less nervous than usual.

481
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,779
(He returns after finding the house band.)

482
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:02,779
How did it go?

483
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:04,979
- Oh, hello.
- What's up, guys?

484
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,650
(Nice to meet you!)

485
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,479
How's it going? My name is Teo.

486
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,549
- Teo?
- Yes.

487
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:10,580
- Kenny.
- Kenny.

488
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,620
- Oh, nice.
- Kenny.

489
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,350
- Hi.
- Teo, Tyler.

490
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,719
- Having a house band is a great support.
- My name is Kian84.

491
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:19,360
- Yes, nice to meet you.
- It's my friend.

492
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,900
You look like John Lennon.

493
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,700
Don't they all look like
they play the guitar well?

494
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,269
How do you call yourselves, all three?

495
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,340
- It's called "Yay Hi."
- "Yay Hi?"

496
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
- Yes.
- "Yay Hi?"

497
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,670
- Y-A-Y-H-I.
- You can sing however you want.

498
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:38,039
Their band name is "Yay Hi."

499
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,680
- "Yay Hi?"
- "Yay Hi."

500
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,049
PKT!

501
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:43,920
- PKT.
- "PKT" and "Yay Hi."

502
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,120
Later, you can do the thing.

503
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,920
- What?
- The introduction on stage.

504
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:52,330
"Yay Hi" with "PKT,"
a collaborative stage.

505
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,529
He's mixing Korean words.

506
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,469
- We're here.
- My gosh.

507
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:00,670
- Shall we?
- Yes.

508
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,039
(They're going straight to practice.)

509
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:05,709
(He is determined.)

510
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,239
All right.

511
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,209
Attention!

512
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:11,110
(They practiced singing
"September" the whole trip.)

513
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,110
Okay.

514
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,450
- They must be nervous.
- Even I'm nervous.

515
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,080
- Ready? All right. Let's go.
- Let's go!

516
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,420
(PKT Band, let's go!)

517
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:22,059
One, two, three, four.

518
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:28,259
Oh, that works with a guitar.

519
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,959
(Kenny's clean guitar lead)

520
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,200
He's using an icebox as a drum.

521
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:36,569
- He is...
- They played a good harmony.

522
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:38,969
(With a trembling heart,
the first rehearsal begins.)

523
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,779
(Do you remember)

524
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,450
(Teo's steady start)

525
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:47,779
(Let's focus.)

526
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,420
(Missing the beat)

527
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,950
(It's unstable
starting from the first chorus.)

528
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,120
- <i>Chasing the clouds</i>
- It's his first time.

529
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:55,289
(Next is Kian84's part.)

530
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,690
(He missed the beat.)

531
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,590
(But he tries to fix it fast.)

532
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:05,029
(Blue talk and love)

533
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:08,239
He's playing with the beat.

534
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:10,239
(He misses the beat again.)

535
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,170
(Screaming in crescendo)

536
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:15,239
(It's a disaster.)

537
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,809
(He steadies his mind...)

538
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:21,509
(and sings the chorus.)

539
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,620
(Pani)

540
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,190
(Cover for me.)

541
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,059
(The last Pani Bottle's part)

542
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,959
(The bell was ringin')

543
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,959
Oh, gosh.

544
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,330
- His throat isn't warmed up yet.
- His throat isn't warmed up yet.

545
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,799
(His voice sounds metallic because
his throat isn’t warmed up enough.)

546
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,769
(He quickly clears his throat.)

547
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,600
(He starts sweating.)

548
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,309
(Ba-du)

549
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:47,870
(Teo makes a small mistake too.)

550
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,910
This is difficult.

551
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,610
It's their first time.
It's a rehearsal too.

552
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,920
- You can do well on stage.
- Of course.

553
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,779
(PKT Band focuses seriously,
matching the harmony.)

554
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,690
(With tension at an all-time high.
the first rehearsal...)

555
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,690
(is complete!)

556
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,090
- My goodness.
- Yes.

557
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,860
- That helped so much.
- I'm the weak link.

558
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,130
Yes, we were getting on. Oh, my gosh.

559
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,559
I practiced for more than a week!

560
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,559
It gets us together.

561
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,430
Yes, you bring them together.

562
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,069
I can't believe I forgot the lyrics
during such a great performance.

563
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,600
I'm worried about myself.
I forgot the lyrics.

564
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,840
I practiced for about a week in Korea.

565
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,580
It didn't show during the rehearsal.

566
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:26,049
We're in trouble.

567
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,420
We need to perform in an hour.
Will everything be all right?

568
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:31,450
We had no time. We had to practice more.

569
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,850
That's what filled up my mind.

570
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,519
I'm sweating.

571
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,519
(The atmosphere in the practice room
is becoming tense.)

572
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,989
- When you miss the beat,
- I practiced for a week.

573
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:40,390
- it drags everything.
- Why am I missing the beat?

574
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,590
(The atmosphere in the practice room
is becoming tense.)

575
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,299
Their morale has dropped.

576
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:50,340
- The important thing is that...
- <i>Say, do you remember</i>

577
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,569
it's better to sing comfortably
in a way that suits you rather than...

578
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:57,580
forcing yourself
to do something you can't.

579
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,080
That way, the audience will also have fun.

580
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:03,120
I try not to force myself to sing...

581
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,489
in falsetto because it always cracks.

582
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:06,590
So find what's comfortable.

583
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,789
Just find comfortable tones
and sing comfortably.

584
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:10,390
- Yes, let's do that.
- Yes.

585
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,360
For the ba-du part, don't say ba-du.

586
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,259
Let's just cater it to him.

587
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,200
You're singing the best right now.
You're getting completely better, right?

588
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:21,400
Yes. Praise breeds willingness!

589
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Of course.

590
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,509
Teo's presence has been a great support
from beginning to end.

591
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,340
"Don't worry about this."

592
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,140
"I experienced it,
and you don't need to worry about it."

593
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,249
He said it in a charismatic way.

594
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:36,880
I have had a lot of stage experience
through theater.

595
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,719
I tried to set the environment for them,

596
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,090
so I did my best in the practice room.

597
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,190
Teo is definitely the big brother.

598
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:50,630
(Thanks to him,
PKT Band practices even harder.)

599
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,229
It's done.

600
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
What's going on?

601
00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:59,610
We made a choreography too.

602
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,469
- They have a choreography.
- Yes.

603
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,380
(Wait for me, my debut stage!)

604
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,180
(The prior stages finish one by one.)

605
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,450
(Now, it's the 11th stage.)

606
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,890
(The audience's excitement
gradually rises.)

607
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,630
(And everything is being watched by...)

608
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,830
"A lonely musician."

609
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:29,170
- His gaze.
- The gaze.

610
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:30,400
I look like some master artist.

611
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,069
You look like Na Hoon A
before going on stage.

612
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:37,739
- Are you guys ready?
- Yes.

613
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:39,809
- Yes? All right.
- Kind of. Yes.

614
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:42,219
How many teams remain now?

615
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,680
- Oh, I think there's two.
- Two.

616
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,019
This is the most nerve-wracking moment.

617
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:47,019
Okay.

618
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,719
Oh, gosh.

619
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:50,890
I got nervous
when it was almost our turn to perform.

620
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,860
(As the stage approaches,
they get more and more nervous.)

621
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,059
Of course, that makes you nervous.

622
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,370
I'm going to perform a song,
something I never expected to do.

623
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,600
You knew this was about
Music Adventure by Accident.

624
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:06,039
- I'm sorry.
- No, let's go.

625
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:08,069
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

626
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,080
(It's fine.)

627
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,209
We need to go to that side.

628
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Yes?

629
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,249
(They go backstage to wait.)

630
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,259
(The previous performance
comes to an end.)

631
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:25,459
He's good.

632
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
He continues to practice.

633
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,759
- Just now.
- Cramming practice.

634
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,370
(Rookie singers are struggling to relax.)

635
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,700
(The bell was...)

636
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,569
<i>- The bell was ringin'</i>
- Pani, don't be nervous.

637
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,039
Thank you to everybody
who came out to sign up.

638
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,410
- Is it our turn?
- Yes.

639
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,249
- Oh, shoot.
- On every Tuesday is the...

640
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,120
- I'm nervous!
- Thank you, guys.

641
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:50,249
Don't be.

642
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,590
(He relies on Teo more than ever today.)

643
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,890
All right, guys.
Thank you for being here tonight.

644
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,390
We want to introduce our new friends.
They're from Korea.

645
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,459
It's their first time performing live
on a stage.

646
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,529
So make sure you give it up for them.

647
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,739
We'll play a little classic here.

648
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:10,200
(The audience applauds in support
at the mention of their first stage.)

649
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,640
(They finally go on stage!)

650
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,239
- Oh, my goodness.
- Finally.

651
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,180
(Groaning)

652
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,809
Yes, thank you.

653
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,180
(PKT Band is on stage.)

654
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,180
Thank you.

655
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,049
(Good luck with your first stage!)

656
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:27,390
From that moment on,
the tension begins to fade,

657
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,989
and your mind goes blank.

658
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:29,989
You're right.

659
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,090
(Feeling hopeless)

660
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:36,200
(Kian84, introduce our band!)

661
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,430
Oh, well. Oh, yes.

662
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:44,340
(A 4-combo of nervousness)

663
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,039
We're from Korea.

664
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,380
Ki, Pa, and Dex.

665
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Dex?

666
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,479
Oh, I said Dex.

667
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:55,719
- Gosh.
- My goodness. I'm sorry!

668
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,719
- He didn't even go there!
- Ki, Pa, and Dex.

669
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,489
I didn't know you loved Dex so much.

670
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:02,120
He introduced Pani Bottle as Ki
and himself as Pa.

671
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,860
- He was very nervous.
- Because he was nervous.

672
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,559
- I guess I was nervous.
- He's saying something different.

673
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,029
He suddenly speaks of Dex.

674
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:12,569
(Soothing the anxious mind with Dex)

675
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:16,069
With Lee Hi band and...

676
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,769
- Lee Hi?
- Lee Hi?

677
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:20,410
He's in the same company as her.

678
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:24,110
Houston people, nice to meet you!

679
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,650
(Houston people are kind-hearted.)

680
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,150
Do you want to say something?

681
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,420
Thank you for... With us.

682
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:36,059
- Pani is usually good at English.
- I've never seen him like that.

683
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:37,190
He's nervous.

684
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,690
Thank you. Okay. I think we're ready.

685
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,690
(They finished the stage greeting
with great difficulty.)

686
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:44,600
(Now, it's the main performance!)

687
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,229
I was worried about forgetting the lyrics.

688
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:50,539
I'm singing once
and if I forget the lyrics, I'm done.

689
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,509
(This can be his first and last stage.)

690
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:55,610
But I can't back out now,

691
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,940
so I might as well just enjoy it.

692
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,110
Right. You're strong on stage.

693
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,719
But I couldn't say I couldn't do it
when we went all the way there.

694
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:04,819
I thought I should do my best
until the end...

695
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,219
to make Kian84's dream come true.

696
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,019
There was no backing out now.

697
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,190
I went up thinking, "Let's just do it
even if I forget some parts."

698
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,190
(Just going head-on like always)

699
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,860
I think we're ready.

700
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,130
Yes.

701
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,499
(His signature booster move)

702
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,569
(One, two, three, four!)

703
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:23,600
("September" by Earth, Wind and Fire)

704
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,640
Let's go.

705
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:27,009
(Kian84 as main vocal)

706
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,009
(Yoo Teo as main dancer)

707
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:31,410
(Pani Bottle as sub vocal)

708
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:34,650
(PKT Band)

709
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,019
PKT Band.

710
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,279
(Let's make a hot debut.)

711
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,289
(Let's go!)

712
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,819
<i>Do you remember</i>

713
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:41,920
Nice.

714
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,319
-<i> The 21st night of September</i>
-<i> September</i>

715
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,459
(The chorus enters at a perfect timing.)

716
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,729
He's relaxed.

717
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:53,870
(Kian84's solo part follows.)

718
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,940
(The part where he kept
missing the beat...)

719
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:00,110
(and rambled alien language)

720
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,440
(Neat)

721
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,410
(Charming)

722
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,580
(Only blue talk and love)

723
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,650
(Remember)

724
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,650
- He's showing off.
- He's good.

725
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,360
(Boosting in happiness)

726
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:17,120
(Singing)

727
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,989
(Ba-dee-ya)

728
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,989
(The "ba-dee-ya" he's been singing
all throughout the trip)

729
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:22,559
That's a neat falsetto.

730
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,299
(People are moving with the beat!)

731
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:27,569
- <i>Ba-dee-ya</i>
- People are enjoying it.

732
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,400
(It's PKT's highlight part.)

733
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,640
(Let's go, Pani Bottle!)

734
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,779
(The nightingale with a hoarse voice)

735
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,610
<i>The bell was ringin'</i>

736
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,479
- He's good.
- <i>All the souls were singin'</i>

737
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:45,120
- He sang a high note.
- That's amazing.

738
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:47,120
(Our youngest is the best.)

739
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,190
(They carry on with that energy.)

740
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,059
(Are you all ready?)

741
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:52,529
(Ba-du-da)

742
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:54,430
Look at the dance.

743
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,630
(Their cute dance)

744
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,370
People there have started
to enjoy the music.

745
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
They start dancing.

746
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,170
(People come in front of the stage
in excitement!)

747
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,610
Was that an improvisation?

748
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,680
(They're no longer nervous.)

749
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,620
It just feels like a club.

750
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,259
- You did well.
- It's cool. This is like the climax.

751
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,519
(Playful Bottle unlocked)

752
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,430
- <i>Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?</i>
- <i>Ba-dee-ya-dee-ya-dee-ya</i>

753
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,860
- <i>Ba-dee-ya, say, dancing in September</i>
- <i>Ba-dee-ya-dee-ya-dee-ya</i>

754
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,670
(Ba-dee-ya!)

755
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:39,209
(Golden dreams were shiny days!)

756
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,009
- <i>Ba-dee-ya</i>
- We're from Korea.

757
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:42,279
Amazing.

758
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,680
Nice to meet you, Houston people!

759
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,150
You filled in that part.

760
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,850
(It ends with the youngest's shout.)

761
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,650
(PKT Band somehow made its debut.)

762
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,620
- What a relief.
- Thank you. I love Houston!

763
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,229
(Bowing)

764
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:05,299
- Thank you. It was awesome.
- Thank you with...

765
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,400
- Thank you with Lee Hi.
- "Lee Hi?"

766
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,039
- Yay Hi.
- Thank you.

767
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,569
I loved that moment the most.

768
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,410
There was...

769
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,340
a dopamine rush.

770
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:20,509
People recognized me and talked to me.

771
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,880
There was a strange excitement
that felt good.

772
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,390
(The dream of becoming
a singer one day...)

773
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,559
(that made young Kian84's heart beat)

774
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,630
(But others...)

775
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,999
(found that dream immature.)

776
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,299
(But today, in the US,)

777
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,209
The opportunity really came to me.

778
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:48,340
(he really stood on stage!)

779
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,840
He did so well.

780
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,110
It's not easy for people who have
no stage experience to do that.

781
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,519
While we were singing,

782
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,880
people came out to dance.

783
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,420
It was thrilling.

784
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,190
I realized we were doing something
people could enjoy.

785
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,259
I started enjoying myself
from that moment.

786
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:08,360
(The stage spoke to him as well.)

787
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,660
I was touched by Pani Bottle.

788
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,059
- I think he overcame his fear.
- He did.

789
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,569
I was personally satisfied.

790
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:17,940
It feels like I completed
a difficult task. I felt good.

791
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:21,110
Thank you. I love Houston!

792
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,809
(It may have been a poor stage to some,)

793
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:29,580
(but it was the most valuable experience
for those who were in it together.)

794
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,390
- How was it?
- It was fine.

795
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:34,819
Thank you!

796
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,190
It was great.

797
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,789
Thank you. It was great. Great support.

798
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:42,959
(Their first stage
that made them nervous has ended.)

799
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,400
I kept forgetting the lyrics.

800
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,969
- I don't even remember if I did well.
- Only "dancing in September."

801
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,370
- It didn't show.
- No one noticed that.

802
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,440
(Thankful)

803
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,680
- I did my best.
- It made such a great difference.

804
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:58,209
(The second brother
still hasn't come back.)

805
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,150
(Relaxed)

806
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
(Kiss)

807
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:06,049
I did it without realizing it.

808
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,950
I think I was overwhelmed with emotions.

809
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,890
I came to my senses when he kissed me.

810
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,759
(He kissed him
so he could wake up from his dream.)

811
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,529
(Feeling shy)

812
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:18,499
You did well.

813
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,469
It's a relief...

814
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:21,670
I didn't forget the lyrics.

815
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,640
It was so nice. Everything was great.

816
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:27,969
Do you guys want some beer?
I want to buy for you.

817
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:29,039
- I'll take that.
- Okay.

818
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:30,880
- Good.
- I said I'd buy them a beer.

819
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,950
- That's all right, right?
- Beer.

820
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:35,150
- Beer.
- Great.

821
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:36,620
(Cheering)

822
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,520
Yes. Have a nice day!

823
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,950
Thank you very much. Have a good night.

824
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:45,589
- Have a good night.
- They have fans.

825
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:48,129
- Good night. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

826
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,430
I feel happy watching Pani Bottle
because he looks so happy.

827
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:54,370
- I'll buy the drinks.
- Beer.

828
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,870
- I got it.
- You will?

829
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,600
Over there...

830
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,310
I won't stop him from buying.

831
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,339
(Immediately takes the offer)

832
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,379
You're very close to him.
You're friends, right?

833
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,910
- You were good.
- You too.

834
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:11,279
I was very worried,
but it was way better than I thought.

835
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,450
(Feeling proud)

836
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,489
- Very satisfied.
- I feel relaxed.

837
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,689
- We haven't had dinner yet.
- Let's have dinner.

838
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:19,730
Order anything.

839
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,730
Good job.

840
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,330
(They have an afterparty
with a small dinner.)

841
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,129
Thank you so much. It's actually...

842
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,669
It ended so well.

843
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
How...

844
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,640
I honestly thought I'd keep feeling bad
if I missed a line.

845
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,710
But I missed the "dancing in September"
part a few times.

846
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,210
It didn't show, though.

847
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,950
It's because there were three of us.

848
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,180
That's why bands are charming.

849
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,719
We three went up there
and covered each other's weaknesses.

850
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,919
- That's right.
- So we could improve together.

851
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:51,859
If it were just one person,

852
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:53,460
it would have shown
if there was a mistake.

853
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,100
(Touched)

854
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,799
I'm very happy.

855
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,700
It's like you won a golden medal
at the Paris Summer Games.

856
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,569
- Right. It felt like that too.
- "You did well."

857
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:05,600
"No. You did well."

858
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,239
It's like we went on a world tour.

859
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,779
- But I understand.
- Right.

860
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:11,339
I mean...

861
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,109
- I'm so annoying.
- No, you're not.

862
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:14,609
- It was your first stage.
- It makes sense.

863
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:18,350
So, what time tomorrow...

864
00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:19,649
When do you leave?

865
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,160
- We leave at 4:45 p.m.
- At 4 p.m.

866
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,890
We only have eight hours left.

867
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,730
- It would end if we sleep.
- It's the last night.

868
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,730
We're going to the same airport anyway.

869
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,399
We could take you.

870
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,069
- No. Don't take me there.
- Why not?

871
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:34,629
Don't do that.

872
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,000
(An unexpected refusal of kindness)

873
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,770
- Why?
- Sleep more.

874
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,509
- You didn't get much sleep.
- He's considerate.

875
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,109
You drove the whole day.
You woke up at 5 a.m. today.

876
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:44,580
But when you go to Jamaica, make sure...

877
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:46,410
you stay healthy.

878
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:49,080
I'll get more inspiration there.

879
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,049
Make sure you stay healthy.

880
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,790
He keeps picking up weird things to eat.

881
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,460
- I didn't pick them up.
- You did.

882
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,730
- I just ate. I didn't pick them up.
- That's hilarious.

883
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,089
He picked them up.

884
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:02,960
You still haven't
eaten the parasiticides, have you?

885
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,799
- He's worried he'd eat weird things.
- I have to eat.

886
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,239
And I'm very thankful.

887
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:11,500
- I'm thankful too.
- For this moment.

888
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,640
(They're good friends
who joined his journey to his dream.)

889
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,710
You sang it with me.

890
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:16,009
The last one? Cheers?

891
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,009
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Great work.

892
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,210
Great work.

893
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,850
- I want to go there again.
- You ended the last night well.

894
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,919
It's nice.

895
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,049
(They return to the hotel
with no electricity.)

896
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,089
Gosh.

897
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,160
We can't sleep here.

898
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,500
- It was dark.
- It was boiling in there.

899
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:43,640
Charger.

900
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,339
(Wearing his pants)

901
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,810
They had air conditioning in the lobby.

902
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,480
All the guests came
and slept in the lobby.

903
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
(The guests evacuated to the lobby.)

904
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,919
- You paid for the rooms...
- Right.

905
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,319
- and slept in the lobby?
- In the lobby.

906
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:00,489
I've never seen such a sight in Sheraton.

907
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:02,520
But that also became a memory.

908
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,989
- It's a memory.
- Right.

909
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:07,189
It felt like I was in a public bathhouse.
It was nice.

910
00:39:07,189 --> 00:39:08,689
- It's a bonding experience.
- Right.

911
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,960
(I'm here too.)

912
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,529
(The youngest also joins
the lobby bathhouse.)

913
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,100
(They make an unforgettable memory
even on the last night.)

914
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,140
(The day ends like that.)

915
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,089
(The last morning in the US)

916
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,390
It's the morning of farewell.

917
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,060
Would you really be okay
even if we don't take you there?

918
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:44,299
Am I six years old?

919
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,069
Are you taking an Uber?

920
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:48,169
- A taxi?
- It's okay.

921
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,000
Can you take a taxi?

922
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,640
Can you take a taxi?

923
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Goodness.

924
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:54,939
Why wouldn't he be able to take a taxi?

925
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,680
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- No.

926
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,609
I wasn't looking down on you.
I was just worried.

927
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,810
It's becoming an obsession of yours.

928
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,649
That's pretty offensive.

929
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,819
I can take a taxi, man!

930
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:09,219
- I even know how to call an Uber!
- Okay.

931
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:11,520
I'm just worried, that's all.

932
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:13,560
He's so tired
that his shirt is inside and out.

933
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,930
He must be exhausted.

934
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,930
Okay. Thanks for worrying.

935
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,700
Thanks for thinking so far ahead.

936
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,799
Sending you to Jamaica
feels like I'm sending a child away.

937
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,640
We were bickering,

938
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,040
but it felt pretty weird...

939
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,439
- to send him away alone.
- Right.

940
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:32,210
- They didn't want to part ways.
- Yes, you've grown so close.

941
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,810
- I called an Uber.
- Did you?

942
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,980
- I called an Uber.
- We can just wait, then.

943
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,379
Don't get hurt.

944
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:41,950
People always told me...

945
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:45,859
(People have always told the two
that they were different.)

946
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:50,160
(Strangely enough,
they were on the same wavelength.)

947
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,330
Kian84 and I...

948
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,629
seem like people of the same kind.

949
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,939
So, I feel so comfortable around him.

950
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,410
I really do.

951
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,980
(He feels comfortable around Kian84.)

952
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:05,080
It was so nice...

953
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,250
that I could be myself.

954
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:11,980
(He was able to show his innocent side.)

955
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,020
A lot of people said that they found...

956
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,759
Teo's new side through this show.

957
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:22,899
We were able to show
our true selves to each other.

958
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:23,899
(Precious moments
of finding their true selves)

959
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:25,930
They both welcomed me...

960
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,640
and open-mindedly embraced me...

961
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:32,969
so that I could play my role properly.

962
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:34,870
I was so grateful for that.

963
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,910
(He's grateful for them.)

964
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,180
Pani...

965
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,480
is a cute and adorable younger brother.

966
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,350
He works so hard that he inspires me.

967
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,189
(There's pizza in the back. I bought it.)

968
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,290
(Didn't you say
you wanted to see a tornado?)

969
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:51,660
Without having to tell him...

970
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,160
Pani worked so hard...

971
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,430
so that the trip
could be smooth sailing for everyone.

972
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,430
That's his way of being considerate.

973
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,730
He drove the whole time
so that they could rest.

974
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,930
He feels like a tour guide of Earth.

975
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,529
An Earth guide.

976
00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:04,239
- An Earth guide. That's cool.
- An Earth guide.

977
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,410
He's indispensable.

978
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,509
We went on a trip,

979
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:11,480
as Kian84 wished.

980
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,049
(He was getting bored of traveling alone.)

981
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:20,819
(He realized the value
of doing things together.)

982
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,989
(I love Kian84's ideas and everything.)

983
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:27,660
(I obviously root for him.)

984
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,899
(Wherever he wants him,)

985
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,100
(he runs to him and joins him.)

986
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,169
To me, Kian84 is someone...

987
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:41,569
who's sincere about everything.
That sums it up.

988
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:46,009
(He supported Kian84's sincerity...)

989
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,180
(and found the joy of traveling,
which he had forgotten.)

990
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,480
So much has happened.

991
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:53,549
- That was so...
- That's the last scene.

992
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:56,319
I hope Kian84 stays safe in Jamaica.

993
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:59,189
He can either find musical inspiration...

994
00:42:59,189 --> 00:43:00,730
or not.

995
00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:02,930
I just want him to come back in one piece.

996
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,100
(Stay healthy and enjoy the trip!)

997
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,299
Feeling things through traveling
was all good,

998
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:10,500
but I also liked that I had
achieved something in the end.

999
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,739
The three of us...

1000
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,910
had one goal and became one.

1001
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,980
(They became one during this trip.)

1002
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,109
I obviously felt a sense of belonging,

1003
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:20,580
and they were reliable.

1004
00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:22,819
I'm so thankful that I almost feel sorry.

1005
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,120
(I love the days we've spent together)

1006
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,189
What?

1007
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,359
- No way.
- It must be a follow-up song.

1008
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,790
- It's a follow-up song!
- By Kian84.

1009
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,000
Keep your head up.

1010
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,259
- Are you crying because you're moved?
- Are you crying?

1011
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:40,629
Is it a group song?

1012
00:43:40,629 --> 00:43:43,040
It's a group song called "Like a Friend."

1013
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,640
("Like a Friend"
by Kian84, Pani Bottle, and Yoo Teo)

1014
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:59,080
(Let's paint the endless stories
once again)

1015
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,719
(Like the stars filling up the dark night)

1016
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:06,660
(Remember)

1017
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:08,560
(In this long journey called life,)

1018
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,430
(a friend whom you can always rely on.)

1019
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,839
(The happy moments that they shared...)

1020
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,439
(will be a memory
that can console them in hard times.)

1021
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:24,910
It's "Like a Friend."

1022
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:27,410
Though their trip is over,

1023
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:30,620
- we have a new song.
- We do have a new song.

1024
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,950
- "Like a Friend."
- "Like a Friend."

1025
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,219
Liking a friend.

1026
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:36,160
- No, it means that it's like a friend.
- It's like a friend.

1027
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,419
Like a friend.

1028
00:44:37,919 --> 00:44:41,430
You even went to the US!

1029
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,830
There can be various interpretations.

1030
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,200
- Is it Teo's kiss from earlier?
- Yes, it has a double meaning.

1031
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,759
- Yes.
- It has a double meaning.

1032
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:47,969
- He said it was liking a friend.
- I never thought of that.

1033
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:49,500
You're right.

1034
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,299
The group song, "I Liked a Friend."

1035
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,839
(I liked a friend of mine)

1036
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:56,180
Are you all listening to it?

1037
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,239
- Yes.
- Please show your love.

1038
00:44:57,879 --> 00:45:00,080
You're going to miss the flight. Go on.

1039
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,750
(I'll be back!)

1040
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,379
- See you in Korea!
- Okay!

1041
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:10,890
Let's go to bed.

1042
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,730
The living should keep on living.

1043
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,859
- "Let's go to bed."
- I love that.

1044
00:45:17,129 --> 00:45:19,500
- It's perfect to the finish.
- Get some more rest.

1045
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,930
(The second chapter begins.)

1046
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,299
He's back to being alone,
like the start of the trip.

1047
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,140
I can't wait to watch it.

1048
00:45:27,169 --> 00:45:28,169
(Houston Airport)

1049
00:45:28,169 --> 00:45:30,939
(Flight time: 3 hours and 21 minutes)

1050
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:32,210
(Sangster International Airport
in Montego Bay)

1051
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,009
(To Jamaica)

1052
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:38,250
I'm on my way to the final destination,

1053
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,319
Jamaica.

1054
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:42,890
I wonder what kind of country it is.

1055
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:43,960
(He starts to see the unknown land.)

1056
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,560
(The emerald Caribbean Sea)

1057
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,730
That's lovely.

1058
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,560
- Oh, my.
- Awesome.

1059
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,029
(An island covered
with green tropical trees)

1060
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:53,569
Goodness.

1061
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:54,730
No way.

1062
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:56,899
It's different from Madagascar.

1063
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:01,109
(Jamaica)

1064
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,439
(A Latin American island
with a population of 2.82 million,)

1065
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:04,540
(6 times the size of Jeju Island)

1066
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,950
Jamaica, an island nation
in Latin America,

1067
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,080
boasts cultural diversity
and stunning natural beauty.

1068
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,149
(They have ancient traditions.)

1069
00:46:11,149 --> 00:46:13,250
It's a vibrant and wild country
with the emerald blue Caribbean Sea...

1070
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,719
and the lush, green Blue Mountains...

1071
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:18,520
that stay verdant year-round.

1072
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:23,399
Jamaica is familiar to us
as the homeland...

1073
00:46:23,399 --> 00:46:25,060
of sprinting legend, Usain Bolt,

1074
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,700
and the birthplace of reggae,
made famous by the legendary Bob Marley.

1075
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,540
(The homeland of Bob Marley,
the legend of reggae)

1076
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:37,379
(Kian84 in Jamaica)

1077
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,649
(Sangster International Airport
in Montego Bay, Jamaica)

1078
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,250
I've finally arrived.

1079
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,450
Now,

1080
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:47,850
I'm going to exchange the leftover cash.

1081
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,419
(His trip begins by exchanging money.)

1082
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,129
Jamaican money.

1083
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:58,200
I was so thankful that they collected...

1084
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,730
their remaining cash...

1085
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,730
- They did?
- They did?

1086
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,239
so that I could use it in Jamaica.

1087
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,100
What's their currency?

1088
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,969
- They use dollars. Jamaican dollars.
- Dollars.

1089
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:08,270
- Jamaican dollars.
- Jamaican dollars.

1090
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:11,310
One thousand Jamaican dollars...

1091
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,910
is 9,000 Korean won,
which is 9 US dollars.

1092
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,279
So, 1,000 Jamaican dollars is 9 dollars.

1093
00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:18,149
(He exchanged about 540 dollars.)

1094
00:47:18,149 --> 00:47:20,250
The largest bill is a 5,000-dollar bill.

1095
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:23,560
(Looking gaunt)

1096
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:27,390
I arrived in Jamaica on a tight schedule.

1097
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,129
I should get a cup of coffee.

1098
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,899
Most people here are Black.

1099
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:35,969
- Taxi?
- Sorry.

1100
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:38,569
Someone's coming to pick me up.

1101
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:41,270
- Come on, man. Taxi.
- No, my fam...

1102
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,609
(He says no as he needs to get coffee.)

1103
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:43,980
It's been a while since we...

1104
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:46,279
It's been a while since we last saw this.

1105
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:47,950
- You're right!
- I've missed this so much.

1106
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,020
- We haven't seen it in so long.
- I missed it so much.

1107
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,020
Back then...

1108
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,620
That's right.

1109
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,859
He used to be the Pied Piper.

1110
00:47:56,859 --> 00:47:59,089
(The pushover used to have
taxi drivers follow him everywhere.)

1111
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,629
It had been so long
since I last felt annoyed.

1112
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,460
- It feels exactly the same.
- You never get used to it.

1113
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,770
It was a fixed-price system in New York.

1114
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,839
- It was.
- But now he has to bargain.

1115
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,140
- So he must be tired.
- It's another thing to deal with.

1116
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,870
- I was.
- You need coffee right now.

1117
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:15,210
- Yes.
- Come on, man.

1118
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,009
- Taxi.
- No. My fam...

1119
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:18,839
He needs coffee immediately.

1120
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:19,910
Yes.

1121
00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:22,049
"Sure?"

1122
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,649
My family. No taxi.

1123
00:48:24,649 --> 00:48:26,919
- Sorry. No taxi.
- "No taxi."

1124
00:48:26,919 --> 00:48:28,520
No taxi.

1125
00:48:29,549 --> 00:48:31,489
- I'll take you anywhere you want.
- Sorry?

1126
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:35,029
- I'll take you anywhere you want.
- My family is on the bus.

1127
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,730
(Looking)

1128
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,600
I told him like ten times
that I didn't want a taxi.

1129
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,069
- He keeps asking me if I need a taxi.
- You sure?

1130
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,569
- No, thank you.
- "Eleventh time."

1131
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,640
He's persistent.

1132
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,069
(He still won't go.)

1133
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:51,410
I thought I'd be fine,
but without Teo and Pani,

1134
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,250
- it feels pretty lonely.
- It must.

1135
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,279
(Poor him.)

1136
00:48:56,719 --> 00:48:58,020
I feel lonely.

1137
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,350
(I miss Teo and Pani.)

1138
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,419
Coffee will be my joy.

1139
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,759
(He finds a shop.)

1140
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:09,160
"Red Strap?"

1141
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,859
What's your name?

1142
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:13,100
(What is that?)

1143
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,069
- "Red Strip?"
- Red Stripe.

1144
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:18,739
Red Stripe? Jamaican beer?

1145
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:20,040
Okay.

1146
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:22,109
I should try Jamaican beer.

1147
00:49:22,469 --> 00:49:25,009
- How much?
- It's 700.

1148
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:29,350
Why? Because it's so cheap?

1149
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:32,580
Goodness. Unbelievable.

1150
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:34,620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1151
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,160
This is a Jamaican beer.

1152
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:39,790
- This looks like a pesticide.
- Gosh.

1153
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,930
People in Yeoju prefer this design.

1154
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:43,660
It's used as a weedkiller.

1155
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,430
It helps with rice farming,
so they like it.

1156
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:48,299
Guys, guess how much this is.

1157
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:50,299
It was 700 Jamaican dollars,

1158
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:54,910
so it's like 55 or 60 cents.

1159
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:55,910
What?

1160
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:59,040
- I don't think so.
- How do you always get it wrong?

1161
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,410
- It's because you're tired.
- She's right.

1162
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,919
- You haven't had coffee yet.
- It's not as cheap as you think.

1163
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:07,649
Every time I drank it,
I thought, "I'm saving money."

1164
00:50:07,649 --> 00:50:10,560
It's better to drink it with that thought.
It's one less thing to worry about.

1165
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,219
That's true.
What you believe in is correct.

1166
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,790
I can't help but feel joyful
if their beer is 55 cents.

1167
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,399
That's good. "How lucky I am!"

1168
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,200
"It's 55 cents if I think it's 55 cents."

1169
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,629
(Deeply satisfied)

1170
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,669
Let's get a taxi first.

1171
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:27,169
I bet he's excited.

1172
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:28,310
- Taxi!
- Taxi?

1173
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:29,739
- Taxi, yes.
- Come on.

1174
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:31,810
- Wait. It's the same guy.
- No way.

1175
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:32,810
It's him, right?

1176
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,580
What's your name?

1177
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,149
Kian84 went back because he felt bad.

1178
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:37,580
We were going anyway,
so I just agreed to go.

1179
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,120
- What's your name?
- Blue.

1180
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,819
- Blue. Your name is Blue.
- Blue?

1181
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:42,189
- Are you a taxi driver?
- Yes.

1182
00:50:42,189 --> 00:50:43,960
- Nice to meet you.
- You're welcome.

1183
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,719
- Nice to meet you.
- What's your name?

1184
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:47,660
- My name is Kian84.
- Kian84.

1185
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,930
- Yes.
- Okay.

1186
00:50:51,399 --> 00:50:53,430
Turn on the AC.

1187
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,770
It's 34 degrees Celsius?

1188
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,540
It's summer all year long.

1189
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,739
(Let's fasten the seat belt.)

1190
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,770
Wait. Where's the seat belt?

1191
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:04,739
The belt.

1192
00:51:05,379 --> 00:51:07,609
It's not Adventure by Accident
with a working seat belt.

1193
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:08,980
It has to be a rocky start.

1194
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,250
It's not Adventure by Accident
if the car is normal.

1195
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,919
You can't even have windows that open.

1196
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:13,149
- What's with the seat belt?
- You bet.

1197
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,149
- No. It doesn't work.
- No belt?

1198
00:51:16,149 --> 00:51:17,160
- No.
- Okay.

1199
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,060
- I'm a good driver.
- Yes.

1200
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,890
You're the best driver?

1201
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:21,890
- Yes.
- Okay.

1202
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:22,890
I believe you.

1203
00:51:22,989 --> 00:51:25,230
That's Adventure by Accident to you.

1204
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,230
MBC, please understand.

1205
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,100
It's tied up.

1206
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:33,569
It was fair. Both seat belts
in the back seat were broken.

1207
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:34,669
- "Fair?"
- Yes.

1208
00:51:34,669 --> 00:51:37,379
And the seat belt in the passenger seat
was also broken.

1209
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:38,939
Only his belt worked.

1210
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:40,009
(Trustworthy)

1211
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:45,180
I'm familiar with not wearing
a seat belt when I'm abroad.

1212
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,149
It happened in India too.

1213
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:49,689
The missing seat belt wasn't
the problem in Bolivia.

1214
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,120
They didn't have side-view mirrors.

1215
00:51:51,819 --> 00:51:54,359
(During his last trip)

1216
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:56,960
(No side-view mirrors)

1217
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,969
(The car stopped out of nowhere.)

1218
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,299
(He manually got rid of the sign.)

1219
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:06,609
Missing seat belts is nothing.

1220
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,609
It finally feels like
Adventure by Accident...

1221
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:10,640
now that I'm in a taxi
without any working seat belts.

1222
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:12,439
This is Adventure by Accident.

1223
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:14,750
I'm sure he'll drive well.

1224
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:19,350
Is Kingston Jamaica's number-one city?

1225
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,450
Kingston?

1226
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,620
There's Seoul in Korea
and New York in America.

1227
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,919
- Kingston in Jamaica?
- Kingston.

1228
00:52:25,919 --> 00:52:26,930
I see.

1229
00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:31,660
There are more locals than tourists
in Kingston.

1230
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,069
(It's the capital of Jamaica,)

1231
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,770
(but you can experience
the lifestyle of the local people.)

1232
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,339
I wanted to experience
the local lifestyle.

1233
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,210
That is a fishing village.

1234
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,080
- "Fishing?"
- Yes.

1235
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,450
He's your tour guide too.

1236
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:50,580
- What a beautiful sea.
- Yes.

1237
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:55,020
- Very nice.
- Okay.

1238
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,020
(He rolls down the window.)

1239
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,890
(The first thing he sees in Jamaica)

1240
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,359
That's fantastic.

1241
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:05,859
(Blue Jamaica)

1242
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:07,430
- Goodness.
- Beautiful.

1243
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,700
(The ocean view dazzles you
as it's a country of nature.)

1244
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,239
(Facing its nature,)

1245
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,509
(Kian84 appreciates the smell
with his entire face.)

1246
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,350
Is it nice?

1247
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:24,520
Nice. Very beautiful.

1248
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:30,819
(The taxi keeps driving
through the beautiful scenery.)

1249
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,660
(He books a hotel on his way.)

1250
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:37,299
(He checks how much he has,)

1251
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:41,770
(and the taxi is still going.)

1252
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,669
(Knocked out)

1253
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:48,469
(They drove across Jamaican nature
for 2 hours...)

1254
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,609
(to get to the end of the island.)

1255
00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:53,750
He went to the other side.

1256
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,879
Finally. The sun is down.

1257
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:59,680
Kingston is pretty far.

1258
00:54:01,419 --> 00:54:02,450
What's the time?

1259
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:06,989
I feel like we've been driving
for three hours now.

1260
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:15,200
(The taxi is in Kingston now.)

1261
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,600
- Everyone, I'm in Madagascar...
- What?

1262
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:20,609
(No, he's in Jamaica.)

1263
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:22,040
He's too tired.

1264
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,080
He said, "Madagascar."

1265
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:26,850
Just think it's Madagascar.

1266
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,980
He might start saying, "Pani," in the air.

1267
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,980
(He's going to start talking
to imaginary friends.)

1268
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,950
I'm in downtown Madagascar.

1269
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,489
(The taxi heads
to the center of Kingston.)

1270
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:40,129
(But the deeper they go in...)

1271
00:54:40,129 --> 00:54:42,890
It looks pretty dangerous at night.

1272
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:43,899
It's so dark.

1273
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:46,930
- It looks...
- You said you were scared...

1274
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,430
when you first went to Brooklyn.

1275
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:52,870
It seemed far more dangerous
than Brooklyn.

1276
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:58,009
(Laughing awkwardly)

1277
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:00,649
This does not look easy.

1278
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,779
It's like a mixture of Varanasi
and Iquitos.

1279
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:06,750
This smells familiar.

1280
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,750
(Dynamic things are about to happen.)

1281
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,160
Yes. Let's stop here.

1282
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,620
(The taxi stopped at last.)

1283
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,089
Yes. Thank you, driver.

1284
00:55:15,029 --> 00:55:19,060
(He arrived in Kingston after 10 hours,
including the standby at the airport.)

1285
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:25,969
This is the most popular city in Jamaica.

1286
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:28,939
(But for the most popular city,)

1287
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:32,439
(the streets look pretty desolate.)

1288
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,750
The capital isn't...

1289
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,020
I've been in the US for too long.

1290
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:42,689
I thought there would be tall buildings
as it was the capital.

1291
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:44,890
But this is Adventure by Accident.

1292
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,230
(He walks to his hotel for a long time.)

1293
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,230
(Sighing)

1294
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,830
Let's get some food and go to sleep.

1295
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:53,359
(Tired and filthy)

1296
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,129
- He's so tired...
- Poor him.

1297
00:55:56,129 --> 00:55:57,569
when he's in a new place.

1298
00:55:57,569 --> 00:55:58,569
(He's drained from traveling all day.)

1299
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,540
What's this? A local shop?

1300
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,009
(On his way to his hotel,)

1301
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:04,009
(he walks by a street stall.)

1302
00:56:04,009 --> 00:56:05,009
What's that?

1303
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,210
Nice to meet you.

1304
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,049
- Hello. Good night. Jerk chicken?
- Hello.

1305
00:56:08,049 --> 00:56:10,009
- Yes. Chicken?
- Yes, it's chicken.

1306
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:14,149
Jamaican barbecue is incredible, you know.

1307
00:56:14,149 --> 00:56:16,219
I didn't know jerk chicken
was Jamaican food.

1308
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,160
- How much?
- It's 1,000.

1309
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,730
One thousand Jamaican dollars?

1310
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,330
(It's about 9 dollars.)

1311
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,500
It's only 90 cents?

1312
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,169
What is wrong with you?

1313
00:56:29,169 --> 00:56:32,399
I was thinking, "How does she make
a living if she sells them for 90 cents?"

1314
00:56:32,399 --> 00:56:33,399
(He's even worried about the seller.)

1315
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,509
That's cheap. I'll take one.

1316
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,710
It's so cheap.

1317
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:41,509
(His 9-dollar chicken is being cut.)

1318
00:56:41,509 --> 00:56:43,680
That looks nice and plump.

1319
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:46,149
It looks good.

1320
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:47,149
(Excited)

1321
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:50,259
Nice. What's the sauce?

1322
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,259
I have ketchup,

1323
00:56:52,259 --> 00:56:53,689
- and then I have pepper.
- Ketchup.

1324
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:56,129
- Pepper.
- Yes. What sauce would you like?

1325
00:56:56,899 --> 00:56:57,899
Spicy.

1326
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,669
- Tell me when to stop.
- Okay.

1327
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:04,140
- That's it?
- Yes.

1328
00:57:04,569 --> 00:57:08,870
Their prices are the lowest
among all the countries I've been to.

1329
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,339
Should I get one more?
I don't think it's big enough.

1330
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:15,350
- I'll have one more chicken, please.
- Okay.

1331
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,680
- One more.
- Another one?

1332
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,680
Yes.

1333
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:21,020
It's only 1 dollar and 80 cents
for 2 chickens.

1334
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:22,549
(No, it's 18 dollars.)

1335
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:24,859
No. Not the spicy one.

1336
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:28,060
Very cheap.

1337
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,160
Thank you. Good luck.

1338
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,359
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1339
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,700
(He happily walks to his hotel
under a huge illusion.)

1340
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,700
Where's the hotel?

1341
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,600
(He happily walks to his hotel
under a huge illusion.)

1342
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:41,210
I woke up at 6:30 a.m. in Houston
and went to the airport.

1343
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,140
There were so many people at the airport,

1344
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,439
so I waited about three hours there.

1345
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,109
Then, I flew here.

1346
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:49,480
I should check in first.

1347
00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:51,120
Hello.

1348
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,379
- Hello.
- Hi.

1349
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,890
All right. Here you go.

1350
00:57:54,189 --> 00:57:55,520
- Thank you.
- All right.

1351
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,620
(He swiftly checks in as he's tired.)

1352
00:57:59,919 --> 00:58:00,930
It's cool in here.

1353
00:58:01,759 --> 00:58:03,430
Nice!

1354
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,359
(He feels better
as his room is spacious and pleasant.)

1355
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:09,299
I'm sure you've noticed,
but my hotel rooms are getting better.

1356
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,839
- The more tired you get...
- It's tiring.

1357
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:16,710
You slept on the ground at Central Park
on your first day in New York.

1358
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,239
I could do it at first,

1359
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,350
but now I can't sleep
unless it's a five-star hotel.

1360
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,250
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Look how big the bed is.

1361
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,450
- That bed is...
- You could fit five people on it.

1362
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,589
(Large)

1363
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,020
(Taking off)

1364
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:32,419
(Charismatic)

1365
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:35,230
(He shows off his charisma
while he's still tired.)

1366
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:37,029
Man, I'm wiped.

1367
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:43,069
(He washes down his fatigue
from moving for hours.)

1368
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:47,569
- As expected, he sits on the floor.
- It's perfect.

1369
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:49,439
It's what we're familiar with.

1370
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,810
I missed this so much.

1371
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,009
I hope the chicken is good.

1372
00:58:57,279 --> 00:59:00,390
(His jerk chicken
looks properly marinated.)

1373
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:02,149
A bowl of instant rice would be perfect.

1374
00:59:02,149 --> 00:59:03,859
- Chicken and rice.
- Chicken and rice.

1375
00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:04,859
That would be chicken and rice.

1376
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:06,689
- That looks delicious.
- It was delicious.

1377
00:59:06,689 --> 00:59:08,790
- It looks like it.
- And it's only dark meat.

1378
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:09,989
That's what I loved about it.

1379
00:59:10,899 --> 00:59:12,330
(Deboning)

1380
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:14,299
We have marinated chicken in Korea,

1381
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:16,270
- and they have jerk chicken.
- That looks scrumptious.

1382
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:19,200
(He licks his fingers
out of satisfaction.)

1383
00:59:20,669 --> 00:59:22,640
(Toothbrush)

1384
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,640
What's he doing?

1385
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,279
- With a toothbrush?
- It's a beer.

1386
00:59:25,439 --> 00:59:26,879
He popped his beer with a toothbrush.

1387
00:59:26,879 --> 00:59:29,049
(Nonchalantly opening his beer
with a toothbrush)

1388
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:34,219
(That's what I'm talking about.)

1389
00:59:35,189 --> 00:59:37,259
(He can't stop exclaiming.)

1390
00:59:37,259 --> 00:59:39,319
- How many times...
- It felt so good.

1391
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,460
Weren't you the happiest then?

1392
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,790
This is paradise.

1393
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,700
Chicken and beer.

1394
00:59:47,069 --> 00:59:49,700
It felt so nice. To be honest,

1395
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,799
whether I'm traveling, working,
or staying at home all day,

1396
00:59:53,069 --> 00:59:54,509
I finish the day...

1397
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:58,410
with food and a glass of beer or soju
before bed.

1398
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,939
That's what I live for.

1399
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:02,480
- That takes up half the joy in life.
- It's the little things in life.

1400
01:00:02,649 --> 01:00:05,549
I figure it's the same for everyone.

1401
01:00:05,549 --> 01:00:06,819
(The small satisfactions
give him the drive to live.)

1402
01:00:06,819 --> 01:00:08,989
Men who like drinking
and late-night snacks.

1403
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:13,520
(After a long day of traveling...)

1404
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,430
He eats on the floor
wherever he is in this world.

1405
01:00:18,129 --> 01:00:20,700
(It's time for bed now.)

1406
01:00:21,969 --> 01:00:22,969
This is so nice.

1407
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,140
- It was so pleasant. Nice and soft.
- It must feel good.

1408
01:00:26,399 --> 01:00:27,669
Good for you.

1409
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:28,870
(He dives on the bed.)

1410
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:33,910
(His tough first day in Jamaica goes by.)

1411
01:00:35,009 --> 01:00:37,480
(Day 10 of the trip)

1412
01:00:38,419 --> 01:00:42,950
(He meets the morning of Jamaica
for the first time.)

1413
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,460
His first morning in Jamaica.

1414
01:00:48,089 --> 01:00:49,129
(Swollen)

1415
01:00:49,129 --> 01:00:50,359
I guess that chicken was pretty salty.

1416
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,529
(Exclaiming)

1417
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:56,500
(Is he nodding?)

1418
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,370
What's this?

1419
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:05,210
(He's turning the camera around
out of the blue.)

1420
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,339
Is this a panorama?

1421
01:01:06,339 --> 01:01:07,480
(He's turning the camera around
out of the blue.)

1422
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,049
I never imagined I'd come to Jamaica.

1423
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,779
I woke up, and I was in Jamaica.

1424
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:14,950
In Jamaica...

1425
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,719
(He unexpectedly greets
his morning in Jamaica.)

1426
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:18,060
I slept,

1427
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:21,189
and it's time to start the day.

1428
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,100
(He gets ready to head out.)

1429
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,700
(Lying down)

1430
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:30,640
(Checking the room service menu)

1431
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,799
- You're looking at the room service menu?
- Yes.

1432
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:36,939
Excuse me?

1433
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:38,509
Two fried eggs...

1434
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,549
I meant to pack my lunch
by ordering room service.

1435
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:42,609
Thank you.

1436
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:46,080
(He orders his food and steps out.)

1437
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,819
Excuse me?

1438
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,660
I ordered takeaway food...

1439
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,719
through room service.

1440
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:58,500
I should go to the beach
that we talked about yesterday.

1441
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,629
- Taxi.
- Where would you like to go?

1442
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:05,140
I'm going to...

1443
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,109
- Hellshire Beach.
- Hellshire Beach?

1444
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:11,710
(It's the beach
that his taxi driver recommended.)

1445
01:02:12,439 --> 01:02:14,910
(Hellshire Beach)

1446
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,049
(It must be like Haeundae Beach in Korea.)

1447
01:02:17,779 --> 01:02:19,750
(There are a lot of Rastafarians.)

1448
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:23,189
(Rasta?)

1449
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,419
(Like Bob Marley...)

1450
01:02:27,189 --> 01:02:29,560
(The local people wearing dreadlocks?)

1451
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:32,129
I'm going to Hellshire Beach
which he recommended.

1452
01:02:32,399 --> 01:02:34,770
I'll check out the beach
now that I'm here.

1453
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:37,069
Jamaica with the beautiful Caribbean Sea.

1454
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,700
Thank you.

1455
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:42,239
(He gets his takeaway food.)

1456
01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:43,609
He's going to tell you.

1457
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:45,239
You're the driver?

1458
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:47,450
(He moves to take the taxi.)

1459
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:50,980
Here? Taxi?

1460
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,189
What...

1461
01:02:54,189 --> 01:02:56,689
- Oh, my!
- They called him a limo.

1462
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,520
I was annoyed
that the taxi didn't have a seat belt.

1463
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,189
It's so fun to watch him
forget about his original intention.

1464
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,000
That's what all hotel taxis look like.
They're all big.

1465
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:06,899
Yes. Hellshire Beach.

1466
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:09,169
(He heads to Hellshire Beach
in a luxurious taxi.)

1467
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,569
He even has his collars up.

1468
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:12,640
(His collars are up.)

1469
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:20,680
(The taxi keeps moving
while Kian84 enjoys modern society.)

1470
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,879
(It finally stops after a while.)

1471
01:03:24,879 --> 01:03:25,950
Yes.

1472
01:03:28,819 --> 01:03:29,819
Here?

1473
01:03:30,049 --> 01:03:31,689
- You can walk down...
- Okay.

1474
01:03:31,689 --> 01:03:33,620
- to the beach. It's mostly...
- Okay.

1475
01:03:33,819 --> 01:03:36,529
Is this the beach?

1476
01:03:36,529 --> 01:03:37,859
- Straight down.
- Straight?

1477
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:38,899
- To your right.
- Okay.

1478
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:41,330
The number-one beach in Kingston,

1479
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:42,830
- I hope it's good.
- Hellshire Beach.

1480
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:47,069
(He gets out of the taxi.)

1481
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,609
(Closing automatically)

1482
01:03:48,609 --> 01:03:49,669
- It's an automatic door!
- It is.

1483
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:51,779
That's so high-tech!

1484
01:03:51,779 --> 01:03:52,839
I loved it.

1485
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:54,109
(Enjoying the sweet technology)

1486
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,549
"Welcome..."

1487
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,149
(Welcome.)

1488
01:04:02,149 --> 01:04:05,819
(Only a sign welcomes him
on this empty road.)

1489
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:09,390
Is it because it's hot?
There aren't as many people as I expected.

1490
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,230
- Right. I thought it was number one.
- He said it was number one.

1491
01:04:15,629 --> 01:04:16,669
What?

1492
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:18,640
(Peeking)

1493
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,009
Gosh.

1494
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:24,710
Do they naturally get dreadlocks?

1495
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,109
They all have dreadlocks.

1496
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:27,980
(Born with dreadlocks)

1497
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,719
(Surprised)

1498
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,450
That grandpa...

1499
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,419
- Check out his aura.
- He's...

1500
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:39,689
- Hello. Come in.
- A hundred years... Hello.

1501
01:04:40,259 --> 01:04:42,230
- Come here.
- "Come here?"

1502
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:43,259
What?

1503
01:04:43,259 --> 01:04:45,029
- What are you guys videoing?
- Sorry?

1504
01:04:45,129 --> 01:04:46,200
What are you videoing?

1505
01:04:46,399 --> 01:04:47,830
- "Video?"
- Yes.

1506
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,129
This is for a Korean TV show.

1507
01:04:50,529 --> 01:04:51,870
So, you're an actor?

1508
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:54,410
Actor... Maybe.

1509
01:04:55,069 --> 01:04:56,310
(Giggling)

1510
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,680
He said, "Maybe," again.

1511
01:04:57,779 --> 01:05:00,810
His "maybe" worked on Nicole
and the Jamaican woman.

1512
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,350
It came in handy.

1513
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:08,989
(He flirted with Nicole, the Texan woman,
by saying, "Maybe.")

1514
01:05:10,149 --> 01:05:12,489
(The magic word also works in Jamaica.)

1515
01:05:12,919 --> 01:05:15,629
She looks kind.

1516
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,290
- Rasta?
- Yes.

1517
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,960
We're getting a cool breeze.

1518
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,299
(We're resting under the shade
as it's so hot.)

1519
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:23,770
We're here taking in the breeze.

1520
01:05:25,169 --> 01:05:26,939
It's like the countryside in Korea.

1521
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:30,439
- Is this Hellshire Beach?
- Yes.

1522
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,810
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1523
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,450
I'll come back when I'm bored.

1524
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,279
(He keeps moving.)

1525
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,350
Oh, this is it.

1526
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:41,450
(Looking around)

1527
01:05:42,049 --> 01:05:43,149
Gosh.

1528
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,160
This must be it.

1529
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:48,589
The water looks fabulous.

1530
01:05:52,259 --> 01:05:54,500
- Look at the ocean.
- The color is amazing.

1531
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,029
That's insane.

1532
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,169
I hear that Hellshire Beach
is less crowded than other beaches.

1533
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:03,270
It's a hidden beach
that's mostly visited by locals.

1534
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:04,379
That's nice.

1535
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:07,509
I love that.

1536
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:08,779
(Hellshire Beach)

1537
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:12,450
(He safely arrives,
thanks to the locals' help.)

1538
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:14,450
Beautiful.

1539
01:06:16,489 --> 01:06:18,689
(He looks for a spot to eat his food.)

1540
01:06:18,689 --> 01:06:19,689
Hello.

1541
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:23,060
- Can I eat lunch here?
- Ya Mon.

1542
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:24,060
He said, "Ya Mon!"

1543
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,399
(It's a Jamaican expression
of saying, "Okay.")

1544
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:29,370
No cash? Is it free to eat here?

1545
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:31,399
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1546
01:06:32,899 --> 01:06:34,969
(He gets permission and sits down.)

1547
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:38,210
(Taking out his lunch box)

1548
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,910
Gosh, he's eating there?

1549
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:41,950
That's plentiful.

1550
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:45,319
(He's excited about his first meal today.)

1551
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,489
Rice.

1552
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:51,160
It was so good to eat rice
after such a long time.

1553
01:06:52,419 --> 01:06:55,029
(He gobbles it down.)

1554
01:06:55,029 --> 01:06:56,060
He eats so well.

1555
01:06:57,259 --> 01:06:58,259
(A bite with rice)

1556
01:06:58,259 --> 01:06:59,430
That looks tasty.

1557
01:07:00,629 --> 01:07:02,000
(This is what I'm talking about.)

1558
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,270
(He must have liked the food.)

1559
01:07:05,739 --> 01:07:08,509
(He goes through the bag
to see if he has more.)

1560
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,149
He's a good painter.

1561
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:18,750
(There's a painter next to him?)

1562
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,520
There are good painters everywhere
in the world.

1563
01:07:23,149 --> 01:07:27,689
(He finds a man of common interest
and keeps looking.)

1564
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:30,759
(He can't stop looking back.)

1565
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:33,230
That old man looks just like Leroy.

1566
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:34,270
(A character from a video game)

1567
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,899
(The same hair?)

1568
01:07:35,899 --> 01:07:36,899
From "Tekken?"

1569
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,399
- They all have dreadlocks.
- Their styles...

1570
01:07:40,399 --> 01:07:42,509
- are amazing.
- Is that hair trending in Jamaica?

1571
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:47,310
(He takes a close look
and gets back to his food.)

1572
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,819
(Let's see.)

1573
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:53,980
He should go for a dip.

1574
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,819
- Yes, he loves water.
- Yes.

1575
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,359
(He's calm in front of the water,
which he loves.)

1576
01:07:58,359 --> 01:07:59,790
- What's wrong?
- Is he too tired?

1577
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:01,890
How should I put it?

1578
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,960
It was kind of like swimming
at Aewol Beach in Jeju.

1579
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,129
It didn't feel so special.
But behind me...

1580
01:08:09,569 --> 01:08:12,500
You know, there was this movie
back in the day.

1581
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,910
- Was it called "Alien Family?"
- "Coneheads?"

1582
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:17,710
- Oh, I remember! It was a fun movie.
- You know, right?

1583
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:22,080
They had large heads
like the characters in the movie.

1584
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,410
(He's interested in their hair,
which he's unfamiliar with.)

1585
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,919
(He finishes his food.)

1586
01:08:25,919 --> 01:08:27,989
He's painting.

1587
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:31,689
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, man.

1588
01:08:31,689 --> 01:08:34,759
- Yes. Is it acrylic?
- Yes.

1589
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:35,759
Yes.

1590
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:38,899
This is a Rastaman in Jamaica.

1591
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:40,500
Rastaman. Is this you?

1592
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,870
The first Rastaman in Jamaica.

1593
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,799
- The first Rastaman?
- Yes.

1594
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,839
- He's the first one?
- Yes.

1595
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:48,439
(Is that right?)

1596
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:51,439
- Are you a Rasta?
- Yes.

1597
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:52,980
- Rasta...
- Rastafarian.

1598
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,750
(Who are Rastas with their unique hair?)

1599
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,819
Rastafarianism is a religion
that reinterprets the Bible to reflect...

1600
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:01,149
the aspirations of Jamaicans,

1601
01:09:01,149 --> 01:09:04,020
- and notable followers are called Rastas.
- Rastas.

1602
01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:07,319
It promotes a naturalistic way of life,
striving for self-sufficiency...

1603
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:10,230
and minimizing artificial influences
while living in harmony with nature.

1604
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:13,759
The colors that represent Rastafarianism
are red, yellow, and green,

1605
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:17,370
which have greatly influenced
Jamaican culture and art.

1606
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:19,469
Bob Marley himself was also a Rasta.

1607
01:09:19,469 --> 01:09:21,640
(Bob Marley, the singer
who represents Rastas)

1608
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:24,270
What does a Rasta mean?

1609
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:28,810
What's the lifestyle of a Rasta?

1610
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:33,080
Natural. It's living in nature.

1611
01:09:33,649 --> 01:09:34,750
- "Natural."
- Yes.

1612
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:35,989
Nature.

1613
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:39,089
It was sort of like a monk in that sense.

1614
01:09:39,219 --> 01:09:41,359
- They're like cowboys.
- They are.

1615
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:44,930
- No meat?
- No meat.

1616
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,229
- No fish?
- Really? They're vegan.

1617
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:48,370
(Most Rastas are vegan.)

1618
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:49,599
But they still eat fish.

1619
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:50,700
(Most Rastas are vegan.)

1620
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:51,769
They don't eat meat.

1621
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:56,340
(Exclaiming)

1622
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,710
What's with your hair?
Why is your hat so big?

1623
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:01,479
Because it locks.

1624
01:10:01,609 --> 01:10:03,010
- Locks.
- Locks.

1625
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:06,819
Does that mean I can't be a Rasta
without thick hair?

1626
01:10:07,179 --> 01:10:09,950
No hair, no Rasta?

1627
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:11,660
(You're not supposed to cut it.)

1628
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,489
It has to be natural.

1629
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:16,559
- Natural.
- Natural.

1630
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,200
- Natural.
- Natural.

1631
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,200
(They suddenly take it off
after they finish talking.)

1632
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,500
(Falling)

1633
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,670
(What is that?)

1634
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,069
What's that?

1635
01:10:26,069 --> 01:10:27,540
(Why are tree stems falling...)

1636
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,540
(from their heads?)

1637
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:29,540
Unbelievable.

1638
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:31,309
Yes, it goes down to the ground.

1639
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,739
You're a real Rasta.

1640
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,179
Real.

1641
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:39,279
- Amazing.
- It's Rasta.

1642
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:40,319
(He was hiding thick hair inside the hat.)

1643
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,319
People with...

1644
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:44,859
People with thin hair can't be a Rasta.

1645
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,519
How long have you been growing it?

1646
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,689
- Sixty years locks.
- Sixty years?

1647
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:51,130
Sixty years.

1648
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:52,700
That has a history.

1649
01:10:54,529 --> 01:10:57,229
(The Rasta hair consists
of a decades-long history.)

1650
01:10:57,599 --> 01:10:59,370
There's probably
a whole ecosystem in there.

1651
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:00,439
Amazing.

1652
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:03,540
(Cat's cradle?)

1653
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,979
Like Rapunzel.

1654
01:11:05,979 --> 01:11:07,109
"Rapunzel."

1655
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:09,609
- It's not Rasta but Rapunzel.
- Rapunzel.

1656
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:13,220
- How old are you?
- Seventy-eight.

1657
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,420
- Seventy-eight?
- Yes.

1658
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:18,189
You've never had a haircut before
in your life?

1659
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:19,590
No.

1660
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:20,889
Not even for once?

1661
01:11:20,889 --> 01:11:22,559
No cut.

1662
01:11:22,559 --> 01:11:24,960
Because on the ground,
I was walking on it,

1663
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,460
stepping on it, and it dried up.

1664
01:11:28,069 --> 01:11:29,729
(Rasta's eco-friendly beauty treatment)

1665
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:32,840
That's one way to get a haircut.

1666
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,840
(Keeping the rest of his hair with care)

1667
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,269
I have a long way to go.

1668
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,510
Wait a minute.

1669
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,349
Wait. You can't see anything.

1670
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,720
- "Jamaican hermit crab."
- "Jamaican hermit crab."

1671
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,790
He must be really sad.

1672
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:49,989
It's a huge hermit crab.

1673
01:11:51,889 --> 01:11:54,290
- I can still see you.
- Can you?

1674
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,790
- Yes.
- Impressive.

1675
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:58,029
That's impressive.

1676
01:11:58,029 --> 01:11:59,130
(Glancing)

1677
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,269
Wearing the beanie deep down
used to be a trend in the past.

1678
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,099
(Thinking)

1679
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,639
Rasta?

1680
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:09,670
Come on.

1681
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,380
Where do I go to see them?

1682
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:15,210
I wanted to see their lives...

1683
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,679
in Jamaica.

1684
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,050
Like the last time
you got to experience Buddhism...

1685
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,420
- when you met young monks.
- Yes.

1686
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,250
I decided to visit more Rasta people.

1687
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,889
(He expected Rasta
to inspire him big time.)

1688
01:12:24,989 --> 01:12:27,620
My friend is...

1689
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:30,359
from the Rasta community.

1690
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:32,529
- Rasta community?
- Yes.

1691
01:12:32,529 --> 01:12:34,830
You can meet them there.

1692
01:12:34,929 --> 01:12:39,840
This isn't the base for Rasta,

1693
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,970
so I have to go there?

1694
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:43,210
I'll take you to the community.

1695
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:45,210
- Community? Rasta community?
- Yes.

1696
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,080
Rasta's community?

1697
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,510
That's the land of Rasta.

1698
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,720
- So if...
- But...

1699
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,620
My friend, we'll take you to
the Rasta community.

1700
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,620
- Your friend?
- It's in Kingston.

1701
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,019
Are we going together?

1702
01:13:01,019 --> 01:13:03,859
(I'm busy,
so I'll introduce you to my friend.)

1703
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:05,899
- Okay. Let's go?
- Let's go.

1704
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:08,229
I was expecting you to talk about drawing.

1705
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:09,599
The unexpected Rasta.

1706
01:13:10,899 --> 01:13:14,340
- This is...
- What's your name?

1707
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:15,809
My name is Future.

1708
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:17,239
- Future?
- Yes.

1709
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:18,910
Future. My name is Kian84.

1710
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:21,510
- How old are you?
- Fifty-seven.

1711
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:23,750
- Fifty-seven?
- Ya Mon.

1712
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:25,920
The elders there are so hip.

1713
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,479
- He's cool.
- Yes.

1714
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,420
- This is Joseph.
- Joseph.

1715
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,090
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

1716
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:34,790
- He's from South Korea.
- My name is Kian84.

1717
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,760
- Ya Mon. I'm Joseph from the Rasta.
- Joseph.

1718
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,130
Nice to meet you.

1719
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,760
I'm Joseph too.

1720
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,330
- Joseph too?
- Yes.

1721
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,470
Joseph too? Are you his father?

1722
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:46,040
- Two Josephs.
- No.

1723
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,700
It looks like...

1724
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,870
his hair is...

1725
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:52,479
(Something big must be hiding inside.)

1726
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:54,710
You can guess their spiritual energy
from it.

1727
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:57,210
- The bigger it gets...
- The longer, the bigger.

1728
01:13:57,210 --> 01:13:58,649
I see.

1729
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:00,120
What's this?

1730
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,590
- These are lots of stuff that I sell.
- Wait.

1731
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:05,319
- I sell... These are like shampoo.
- He made the stuff.

1732
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:07,059
- Shampoo?
- Yes.

1733
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:08,790
- Natural soap.
- Soap.

1734
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:09,859
Ya Mon.

1735
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:13,859
He must've made the shampoo
with natural oil.

1736
01:14:13,859 --> 01:14:15,870
- It looks like it.
- Natural shampoo.

1737
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,840
- How much?
- A thousand Jamaican.

1738
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,540
One thousand Jamaican.

1739
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,109
One? I should get one.

1740
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,540
(Sniffing)

1741
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,609
It smells like garlic.

1742
01:14:24,609 --> 01:14:25,639
(Sniffing)

1743
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:28,550
People might think it's a sauce.

1744
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:31,580
He wants to go to the Rasta community.

1745
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,620
(Asking Joseph)

1746
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,250
Yes.

1747
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:39,889
- He'll take you to the Rasta community.
- He said you're interested in Rasta.

1748
01:14:39,889 --> 01:14:42,460
- Yes. All right. Thank you.
- So up in the mountains.

1749
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,389
I'll take you there and show you.

1750
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,500
Then I should...

1751
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,729
(He feels bad to ask for a favor.)

1752
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:48,870
Well...

1753
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,439
Should I pay him?

1754
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:53,800
- No, money. It's a friend thing.
- No money?

1755
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,139
(Rastas don't take money.)

1756
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:58,580
- Really?
- Ya Mon.

1757
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,679
- Okay.
- Liberty.

1758
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:02,609
It's our way of life. The way we live.

1759
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:06,050
- You live...
- Yes, we live a communal life.

1760
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,580
- It's love, man.
- Community.

1761
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,290
Oh, nice.

1762
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,090
- No charge.
- Thank you.

1763
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,389
- Let's go.
- Okay. All right.

1764
01:15:13,389 --> 01:15:14,420
Peace out.

1765
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,889
(Have a safe trip.)

1766
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:19,330
- This... This car?
- Come around.

1767
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,359
Yes.

1768
01:15:20,559 --> 01:15:23,069
- The car is...
- You can go in there.

1769
01:15:23,069 --> 01:15:24,599
- Here?
- Yes, you go in there.

1770
01:15:24,599 --> 01:15:26,540
- Put this in the back.
- Okay.

1771
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:28,670
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1772
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:31,710
I'm not getting kidnapped, am I?

1773
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:33,840
- Kidnap?
- He's doubtful.

1774
01:15:33,939 --> 01:15:36,080
You never know. He said Rasta, but...

1775
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,649
- It could be gangsters instead of Rasta.
- True.

1776
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:41,420
Before I followed him,

1777
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,889
the production crew checked it.

1778
01:15:42,889 --> 01:15:45,790
- Checked Joseph?
- Because it could be dangerous.

1779
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:49,489
He wanted to share the Rasta culture...

1780
01:15:49,489 --> 01:15:52,029
- with the Korean production team.
- I see.

1781
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:54,200
That's how we set off.

1782
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,700
(Joseph's car's about to set off.)

1783
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,500
- It's hot.
- Yes. Very hot.

1784
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,739
No AC?

1785
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:02,340
You can get AC if you want.

1786
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:05,109
- AC?
- Yes, do you want AC?

1787
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:07,739
- Oh, the AC.
- Yes.

1788
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:10,309
It's all broken.

1789
01:16:10,309 --> 01:16:11,519
That's naturalism.

1790
01:16:11,519 --> 01:16:13,279
- Even the AC is natural.
- Yes.

1791
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:15,790
- Very cool.
- Ya Mon. Cool.

1792
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:17,389
(They set off with the blessing
from the natural AC.)

1793
01:16:17,389 --> 01:16:19,620
How many Rastas are there?

1794
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,630
- Twenty families.
- Twenty families.

1795
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:25,429
- Yes.
- Are you a vegetarian?

1796
01:16:25,429 --> 01:16:27,260
Yes, I only eat fish.

1797
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,429
- Cool.
- Yes.

1798
01:16:28,429 --> 01:16:29,700
So what do you eat?

1799
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,870
- I eat all.
- What?

1800
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:34,870
- All.
- What's all?

1801
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:38,410
Beef, pork, chicken...

1802
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,939
- Pork is not good.
- Crocodiles.

1803
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,849
Piranhas.

1804
01:16:43,779 --> 01:16:46,080
- You had that in South America.
- Piranhas.

1805
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,319
Crocodile and pork are not good, man.

1806
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:49,790
- Crocodile?
- Crocodile.

1807
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:51,460
- Are crocodiles clean?
- No.

1808
01:16:52,989 --> 01:16:53,989
My arm.

1809
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,489
(Two drops of his spit)

1810
01:16:55,489 --> 01:16:56,630
Did it land on you?

1811
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:58,599
He's warm-hearted.

1812
01:16:59,059 --> 01:17:00,700
(He wipes the spit on his pants.)

1813
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,970
(Laughing)

1814
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:07,239
- Joseph is a fun guy.
- Like a friend.

1815
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,370
(I like Joseph.)

1816
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:13,010
I have a feeling you'll make good friends.

1817
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:16,510
You got a call.

1818
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:17,710
Hello?

1819
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:18,819
How are you, buddy?

1820
01:17:18,819 --> 01:17:21,120
Good. We met recently.

1821
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,420
Still, I decided to give you a call.

1822
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,859
(Laughing)

1823
01:17:24,859 --> 01:17:26,720
- Look to the side.
- What?

1824
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,989
- Side?
- Maybe he's on the other lane.

1825
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:31,090
He was right next.

1826
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:33,399
What's going on? Oh, he's right there.

1827
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:34,500
Nice to meet you.

1828
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,470
It's like a sitcom.

1829
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:39,139
The camera.

1830
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,340
Yes.

1831
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,040
He's so happy.

1832
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:46,109
His friend's car has no bumper.

1833
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:48,109
His car is destroyed.

1834
01:17:48,109 --> 01:17:49,109
(Destroyed)

1835
01:17:49,109 --> 01:17:50,179
- That's natural.
- Go.

1836
01:17:50,809 --> 01:17:52,019
Is he your friend?

1837
01:17:52,019 --> 01:17:53,849
Yes, that's my friend.

1838
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:55,220
We're stopping here.

1839
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,920
(They stop for a second at the red light.)

1840
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:58,620
Nice to meet you.

1841
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,059
- Nice to meet you.
- He's Korean.

1842
01:18:01,059 --> 01:18:04,489
We're going to Rosman's house.

1843
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:06,500
- We're going to Rosman's house.
- Who's Rosman?

1844
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,059
Drive safe.

1845
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:10,429
- I got a new engine.
- What?

1846
01:18:10,429 --> 01:18:11,700
Are you testing me?

1847
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:12,939
(Speeding up)

1848
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:14,769
He has nice reactions.

1849
01:18:14,769 --> 01:18:16,170
(Screaming)

1850
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:17,840
- No.
- He suddenly sped up.

1851
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,109
No.

1852
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:21,910
(Laughing)

1853
01:18:23,309 --> 01:18:24,510
Why is he so happy?

1854
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,319
You should sing "Like a Friend" together.

1855
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:28,849
What's so funny?

1856
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:32,720
- Your best friend?
- Ya Mon.

1857
01:18:33,519 --> 01:18:35,229
(Laughing)

1858
01:18:35,229 --> 01:18:37,460
I like the way he laughs.

1859
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:41,160
(Like Toox from Brooklyn)

1860
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,970
- He kind of reminds me of Toox.
- Yes.

1861
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,500
Yet they're different.

1862
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,939
Look to your left.

1863
01:18:46,939 --> 01:18:48,939
Way up. That mountain, right there.
You see up there?

1864
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:51,609
- This mountain peak?
- Yes, that's where we're going.

1865
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:53,510
- Road?
- Yes.

1866
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:55,149
- Is there a road?
- The mountain.

1867
01:18:55,149 --> 01:18:57,380
- I hope we're not hiking.
- The mountain.

1868
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:58,849
(Laughing)

1869
01:18:58,849 --> 01:19:01,689
I hope we're not walking.

1870
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:04,620
It's not too hard.
Just probably over 700 steps?

1871
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,660
Seven hundred steps?

1872
01:19:07,059 --> 01:19:09,029
(Laughing)

1873
01:19:09,029 --> 01:19:10,359
No, no.

1874
01:19:10,859 --> 01:19:12,630
I don't want to walk for seven hours.

1875
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,059
No, not seven hours.

1876
01:19:14,059 --> 01:19:16,399
I said 700 steps, not the hour.

1877
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:18,739
No, man. You're crazy!

1878
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:21,639
I thought he said seven hours of walking.
I was surprised to hear that.

1879
01:19:21,739 --> 01:19:22,910
I thought he meant seven hours.

1880
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,210
It doesn't take long to walk 700 steps.

1881
01:19:24,309 --> 01:19:26,080
It's the mountain now.

1882
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,080
(They came near the mountain
while talking and laughing.)

1883
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,609
There are houses on the mountain.

1884
01:19:28,609 --> 01:19:30,979
- See?
- Yes, mountain houses.

1885
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:32,849
- That's where we're going.
- Yes, very beautiful.

1886
01:19:32,849 --> 01:19:34,050
There are many houses.

1887
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:36,889
Is this a store? A supermarket?

1888
01:19:36,889 --> 01:19:38,420
Yes, everything is there.

1889
01:19:38,519 --> 01:19:41,960
Is your house at the mountain peak?

1890
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,529
My house is not at the peak.

1891
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:46,800
It's in the Blue Mountain area.

1892
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,700
- Is the mountain's name Blue Mountain?
- Yes, Blue Mountain.

1893
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,040
Isn't the mountain green and beautiful?

1894
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,439
Yes, beautiful.

1895
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,800
The scenery is a piece of art.

1896
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,809
(The scenery is a piece of art.)

1897
01:19:59,109 --> 01:20:02,010
(Blue Mountain)

1898
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:05,080
Blue Mountain boasts dense rain forests.

1899
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,779
Thanks to its high altitude
and tropical climate,

1900
01:20:06,779 --> 01:20:11,220
Blue Mountain produces coffee renowned as
one of the top three in the world.

1901
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,460
Blue Mountain.

1902
01:20:15,059 --> 01:20:16,290
It looks like where Taoist hermits live.

1903
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:23,399
This house came down due to a hurricane.

1904
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:24,569
- A hurricane?
- Yes.

1905
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:26,439
Goodness.

1906
01:20:26,439 --> 01:20:28,340
When the hurricane came, it came down.

1907
01:20:29,269 --> 01:20:31,239
That's significant damage.

1908
01:20:31,779 --> 01:20:34,010
(Surprised)

1909
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:35,910
(There are many damaged vehicles.)

1910
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:39,149
A hurricane hit the area
about ten days before I arrived.

1911
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:40,319
- So that's what happened.
- But...

1912
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:45,090
Are the people okay?

1913
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:47,090
- No accident.
- No accident.

1914
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:48,559
- Nobody got hurt.
- No people.

1915
01:20:48,559 --> 01:20:50,330
- No one was hurt.
- Not people.

1916
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:53,529
(The car runs fast on a steep road.)

1917
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:54,700
How high are they going?

1918
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,729
(Sick)

1919
01:20:57,729 --> 01:20:58,769
- I felt sick...
- Goodness.

1920
01:20:58,769 --> 01:21:00,099
because the road was so twisty.

1921
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:02,170
(Terrified)

1922
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:04,540
(Holding tight)

1923
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,380
The road was so rugged...

1924
01:21:06,939 --> 01:21:08,750
enough to be a death road.

1925
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:10,550
It was dangerous.

1926
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:12,080
It's hard to get to a house there.

1927
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,450
(Scared)

1928
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:16,090
Very high.

1929
01:21:16,889 --> 01:21:19,920
- I see America.
- Ya Mon.

1930
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:21,189
(Welcome to the death road.)

1931
01:21:21,189 --> 01:21:22,189
Ya Mon!

1932
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:29,000
(Laughing)

1933
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,029
He's happy.

1934
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:33,639
How do you say fire in Korean?

1935
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,069
- Fire, in my language?
- Yes.

1936
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:37,470
What kind of fire?

1937
01:21:37,569 --> 01:21:39,279
- Fire, like fire.
- Fire.

1938
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:40,639
I see. "Bool."

1939
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,080
- Bool!
- Bool!

1940
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,649
- Bool!
- I see.

1941
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:45,019
- Bool!
- Bool.

1942
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:48,389
(He likes the pronunciation.)

1943
01:21:48,819 --> 01:21:50,590
- You say, bool!
- Bool!

1944
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,420
- Bool.
- Bool!

1945
01:21:56,359 --> 01:21:58,800
Joseph is very positive.

1946
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:02,069
Joseph laughs a lot.

1947
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,399
I wondered,
"How can someone be so excited?"

1948
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:08,139
Yes, I envy that you're happy.

1949
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,470
(Laughing)

1950
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:11,470
Fair is fair.

1951
01:22:12,139 --> 01:22:14,540
- Fire, bool!
- Yes.

1952
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,649
I'll park here.

1953
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,349
And we walk up.

1954
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:20,950
This is a parking lot.

1955
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,050
(They arrive at a parking lot.)

1956
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:23,819
- Your home?
- Yes.

1957
01:22:26,559 --> 01:22:28,859
(Kian84 gets off safely.)

1958
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:31,960
- See? Isn't this place nice?
- Yes.

1959
01:22:32,429 --> 01:22:33,800
Is that a mango tree?

1960
01:22:34,059 --> 01:22:35,599
Yes, that's another mango tree.

1961
01:22:36,569 --> 01:22:38,300
This is what a mango tree looks like.

1962
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,340
A mango tree?

1963
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:43,040
Many mangoes.

1964
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,040
It fell on the ground. It's rotten.

1965
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,239
(A mango fallen on the ground)

1966
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:48,550
There are mangoes on the ground?

1967
01:22:48,849 --> 01:22:52,550
- That's good.
- Is this okay?

1968
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,420
(Kian84 obtained a mango.)

1969
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:55,420
Yes.

1970
01:22:57,349 --> 01:23:00,090
(He eats it without washing it.)

1971
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:01,120
It's good.

1972
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:02,660
- It was good.
- Was it sweet?

1973
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,929
- It was sweet.
- It looks good.

1974
01:23:04,029 --> 01:23:06,000
It's delicious. It tastes sweet.

1975
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:07,830
It's got a bug.

1976
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:11,769
That one has a worm.

1977
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:13,269
(The mango Joseph was eating.)

1978
01:23:13,269 --> 01:23:15,470
It's a worm. It's a medicine
when eaten without being noticed.

1979
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:16,739
"A medicine when eaten
without being noticed."

1980
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:18,510
A worm is a source of protein.

1981
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:20,210
It must be delicious
since a worm ate it too.

1982
01:23:22,149 --> 01:23:24,510
(Laughing)

1983
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:27,149
- Do you like it?
- Big nature.

1984
01:23:27,149 --> 01:23:28,689
- Yes, man.
- Jungle.

1985
01:23:28,689 --> 01:23:29,819
Real nature.

1986
01:23:30,519 --> 01:23:33,160
(As they walk along,)

1987
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,330
(an unknown world unfolds.)

1988
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:37,460
It seems like they're entering
another world.

1989
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,300
It looks like CGI.

1990
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,300
There must be a waterfall.

1991
01:23:43,569 --> 01:23:44,569
Sound.

1992
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,739
- Yes, the water sound.
- You hear the water?

1993
01:23:47,739 --> 01:23:48,769
Waterfall.

1994
01:23:48,769 --> 01:23:50,269
(Going to Joseph's home
while listening to the water sound.)

1995
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:52,809
It's a jungle.

1996
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:56,609
I'm an hour away from a city,
and it's a jungle.

1997
01:23:58,149 --> 01:24:01,050
I was so curious about
what kind of place he was living in.

1998
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:02,790
(Exclaiming)

1999
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:04,790
That's the water.

2000
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,260
- Waterfall.
- There's a waterfall?

2001
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:08,790
What kind of waterfall is it?

2002
01:24:08,989 --> 01:24:11,229
It must be a big one,
guessing from the sound.

2003
01:24:11,489 --> 01:24:13,630
(As they walk along
with the sound of the water,)

2004
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:17,500
What's that?

2005
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,670
(a real waterfall appears.)

2006
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:20,170
- Waterfall!
- Yes!

2007
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:21,399
It's big!

2008
01:24:21,939 --> 01:24:23,340
It looks like Porfi's backyard.

2009
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,410
It looks like the way to his home.

2010
01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:26,510
Yes, it looks similar.

2011
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:30,349
(A secret waterfall behind Porfi's home)

2012
01:24:30,349 --> 01:24:31,550
It's been a long time.

2013
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:32,720
(A secret waterfall behind Porfi's home)

2014
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,290
(Kian84 sees a much bigger waterfall.)

2015
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:38,349
- It was bigger.
- It looks refreshing.

2016
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,790
- Is there fish?
- What?

2017
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:42,729
- Fish?
- No.

2018
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,729
I'm wet because of my sweat anyway, so...

2019
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:50,830
Do you want to go in there?

2020
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:53,269
- Is it very deep?
- It's about this.

2021
01:24:53,269 --> 01:24:54,269
- Here?
- Yes.

2022
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:55,269
Okay. I'm going in.

2023
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,870
(He throws his bag down.)

2024
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:02,510
- Together?
- Are you going there?

2025
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:04,849
All right.

2026
01:25:06,519 --> 01:25:09,519
It's so hot there, so you need to
go into the water once you see it.

2027
01:25:09,519 --> 01:25:10,849
It felt so uncomfortable.

2028
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:15,229
Hopefully, the stones won't fall down
while I'm in the water.

2029
01:25:16,389 --> 01:25:18,429
(He's scared,)

2030
01:25:18,429 --> 01:25:20,229
(but he strides ahead.)

2031
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:21,229
(Screaming)

2032
01:25:22,029 --> 01:25:23,229
Be careful.

2033
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:25,540
(Glancing)

2034
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,540
(Joseph gets ready
to go into the waterfall.)

2035
01:25:29,069 --> 01:25:30,710
(Falling)

2036
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:33,210
(Waving long hair)

2037
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:36,380
He has such a nice physique.

2038
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,109
He has such a nice body
even though he's a vegetarian.

2039
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,149
(Unfolding)

2040
01:25:43,649 --> 01:25:45,050
(Joseph unfolds his beard,)

2041
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:46,319
(and they enter
the natural shower room together.)

2042
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:49,189
They don't need to build a shower room.

2043
01:25:49,859 --> 01:25:50,859
(Screaming)

2044
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:52,830
It feels refreshing.

2045
01:25:53,729 --> 01:25:54,729
Here I go!

2046
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:57,700
(Shouting)

2047
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,300
(Shouting)

2048
01:26:00,599 --> 01:26:01,599
(Shouting)

2049
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:05,710
The water hit his head.

2050
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:07,380
He's going out of his mind.

2051
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:09,309
I was attacked.

2052
01:26:10,349 --> 01:26:11,450
But it feels good.

2053
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:15,279
Do you shampoo here?

2054
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:17,420
He's washing his hair.

2055
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:19,559
He's like Kian84.

2056
01:26:19,559 --> 01:26:20,720
(Applying homemade organic shampoo)

2057
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:23,130
Let me use your shampoo too.

2058
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:27,830
- It's made with natural ingredients.
- So you can use it there.

2059
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:30,099
(Sniffing)

2060
01:26:30,099 --> 01:26:31,099
It smells good.

2061
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:35,040
(They share shampoo...)

2062
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,109
It feels so refreshing!

2063
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:39,609
(They share shampoo and wash themselves.)

2064
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:41,439
(Shouting)

2065
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:43,609
It felt so refreshing. It was nice.

2066
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,790
(Washing his hair in one second.)

2067
01:26:54,189 --> 01:26:55,220
He's...

2068
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:57,029
He's almost being beaten up by the water.

2069
01:26:57,029 --> 01:26:58,029
That's true.

2070
01:26:58,429 --> 01:27:01,500
(Screaming)

2071
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,130
(He's so happy.)

2072
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:07,569
Good. It's good.

2073
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,109
- It's good.
- Ya Mon.

2074
01:27:10,109 --> 01:27:11,139
Yes, good.

2075
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:14,710
(He sits down, satisfied.)

2076
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:16,010
He's used to it.

2077
01:27:16,109 --> 01:27:18,109
As the water hits me...

2078
01:27:23,519 --> 01:27:25,660
(He shampoos his hair...)

2079
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:27,720
(and waits until Kian84 is done.)

2080
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:30,389
(Now it's my turn.)

2081
01:27:31,559 --> 01:27:33,330
(Shaking his head)

2082
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,300
He looked like an ascetic.

2083
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,330
(Charismatic)

2084
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,769
(Cleanly washing his hair)

2085
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,639
Watching him made me feel refreshed.

2086
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:46,040
You're amazing!

2087
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:47,840
Ya Mon.

2088
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:51,950
(He puts the GoPro in his pocket...)

2089
01:27:52,649 --> 01:27:54,920
(and enters the shower room again.)

2090
01:27:55,649 --> 01:27:58,920
(After putting his hands together
politely)

2091
01:28:00,819 --> 01:28:02,460
(Training in the waterfall)

2092
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,660
Is he training?

2093
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:07,059
Is he okay? It looks painful.

2094
01:28:07,059 --> 01:28:08,130
It looks really painful.

2095
01:28:08,229 --> 01:28:09,429
Goodness.

2096
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:11,569
(Staggering)

2097
01:28:11,569 --> 01:28:13,470
(Sweet)

2098
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,540
What? My GoPro!

2099
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:22,279
What? My GoPro!

2100
01:28:22,279 --> 01:28:24,179
- Is it gone?
- Oh, my.

2101
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:25,450
(He lost his camera!)

2102
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:26,479
Goodness.

2103
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:27,519
My GoPro!

2104
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,489
He's in big trouble.

2105
01:28:30,989 --> 01:28:31,989
I lost my camera.

2106
01:28:31,989 --> 01:28:33,859
It has all his travel records.

2107
01:28:33,859 --> 01:28:34,989
That's scary.

2108
01:28:34,989 --> 01:28:36,760
It's really a big problem if I lose it.

2109
01:28:37,929 --> 01:28:38,960
No, my GoPro!

2110
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:42,970
(When did Kian84 lose his camera?)

2111
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,269
(He was taking a shower
with the camera in his pocket.)

2112
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:47,739
(Kian84's camera)

2113
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,040
(Save me)

2114
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:51,540
He has to find it.

2115
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,139
How can he find it in that place?

2116
01:28:53,979 --> 01:28:56,580
(I should help.)

2117
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:59,019
(My Kian84 camera)

2118
01:28:59,649 --> 01:29:02,080
(Quickly trying to locate Kian84 camera)

2119
01:29:04,519 --> 01:29:06,489
Is it possible to find something
lost in there?

2120
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,489
- Did you find it?
- Yes.

2121
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:09,729
I'm fine.

2122
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:11,830
I'm fine.

2123
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:13,200
(Okay.)

2124
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:15,399
(He searches again
after talking nonsense.)

2125
01:29:16,269 --> 01:29:18,170
His eyes must sting.

2126
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,510
(No...)

2127
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:25,470
The water would carry it away
if I didn't find it within three minutes.

2128
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:29,179
(My Kian84 camera...)

2129
01:29:29,179 --> 01:29:30,580
(Staggering)

2130
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:36,019
(Give me a minute.
Let me rinse off the shampoo!)

2131
01:29:36,019 --> 01:29:37,250
Wash it off first.

2132
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,319
(Screaming)

2133
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:41,920
It's a mess.

2134
01:29:44,559 --> 01:29:45,599
No.

2135
01:29:45,599 --> 01:29:46,660
(No.)

2136
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,870
- I had already given up.
- Look at him.

2137
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:52,099
No, you should find the camera.

2138
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:56,439
(No matter how hard he searches,
Kian84 camera is gone.)

2139
01:29:57,139 --> 01:29:58,840
(Devastated)

2140
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,040
I've had this thing
ever since Adventure by Accident.

2141
01:30:01,309 --> 01:30:03,710
Teo and Pani Bottle have left.

2142
01:30:03,809 --> 01:30:06,979
The only friend I have left is the camera.
It's my friend.

2143
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,080
I talk to it.

2144
01:30:08,179 --> 01:30:09,250
(It's my friend. I talk to it.)

2145
01:30:09,989 --> 01:30:13,559
(South America, the first destination
of Adventure by Accident)

2146
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,489
(The awkward first meeting
with Kian84 camera.)

2147
01:30:17,889 --> 01:30:21,260
(The two got closer
as they traveled together.)

2148
01:30:22,099 --> 01:30:23,269
(Bonita!)

2149
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:27,599
(Even when he fell down and got back up)

2150
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:33,609
(Even when he was happy and sad)

2151
01:30:34,479 --> 01:30:37,910
(In every moment of his lonely trip,)

2152
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:41,580
(Kian84 camera was with him.)

2153
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:44,149
My family. My friend.

2154
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:46,090
It fell into the water and was gone.

2155
01:30:46,489 --> 01:30:47,819
And it was a special friend.

2156
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,830
I lost my best friend.

2157
01:30:50,929 --> 01:30:54,200
Aside from all the footage,

2158
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,000
the camera was like Wilson in "Cast Away."

2159
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,229
(Like Wilson in "Cast Away")

2160
01:30:59,099 --> 01:31:03,069
(Chuck's only friend, Wilson)

2161
01:31:03,769 --> 01:31:06,809
(Wilson)

2162
01:31:08,309 --> 01:31:09,580
(Like Wilson that fell into the water)

2163
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:12,010
Where are you, Wilson?

2164
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:13,080
(Kian84 camera is long gone.)

2165
01:31:14,149 --> 01:31:15,149
Wilson!

2166
01:31:16,649 --> 01:31:18,290
They look identical.

2167
01:31:18,519 --> 01:31:20,989
(Wilson!)

2168
01:31:20,989 --> 01:31:22,290
They look the same.

2169
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,830
(Kian84 camera)

2170
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:24,830
Wilson!

2171
01:31:25,729 --> 01:31:26,729
Where did you go?

2172
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:29,599
Where did you go, camera?
Return to me, and I'll be good to you.

2173
01:31:29,599 --> 01:31:30,630
I'm sorry.

2174
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:32,840
(I'm sorry.)

2175
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,099
You should still try to find it.

2176
01:31:35,809 --> 01:31:39,410
(Where did you go, Kian84 camera?)

2177
01:31:40,439 --> 01:31:43,050
- I hope it got caught by something.
- I feel bad.

2178
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:46,120
(The end of "Spirited Away Kian84 Camera")

2179
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,880
- What?
- How can you end it like that?

2180
01:31:48,279 --> 01:31:50,420
- I feel terrible for saying this.
- What is it?

2181
01:31:50,649 --> 01:31:52,689
But that upset me more than when...

2182
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,290
Teo and Pani Bottle left.

2183
01:31:55,929 --> 01:31:57,929
Had I known that would happen,
I would've treated it better...

2184
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:00,330
and fully charged it
before sending it away.

2185
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:01,660
(I should've fully charged it.)

2186
01:32:01,899 --> 01:32:04,130
But you still found it, right?

2187
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:06,500
- You did, right?
- You'll find out next week.

2188
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:11,309
(Following Rasta Joseph
deep into the mountain)

2189
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:14,840
(A mysterious community
within the Blue Mountains)

2190
01:32:15,849 --> 01:32:18,580
(Rasta Camp)

2191
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,319
(Do you like rice?)

2192
01:32:21,319 --> 01:32:22,319
(I love rice.)

2193
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:24,489
(A feast from nature)

2194
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:26,359
(Ya Mon!)

2195
01:32:26,989 --> 01:32:28,559
(Thanks to the energetic people,)

2196
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:32,599
(the day in the camp
is filled with happiness.)

2197
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:34,359
(Is this place paradise?)

2198
01:32:35,399 --> 01:32:36,599
(Where did it go?)

2199
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,800
(Suddenly,)

2200
01:32:39,939 --> 01:32:42,739
(a mystical ancient rhythm
starts playing.)

2201
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:45,939
(With the Rastas' spell,)

2202
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:50,309
(Kian84 falls into a daze?)

2203
01:32:51,609 --> 01:32:53,720
("Exhuma" in Jamaica)

2204
01:32:54,779 --> 01:32:57,090
(And at the edge of the Caribbean Sea,)

2205
01:32:57,819 --> 01:32:59,889
(Music Adventure by Accident's
last story unfolds.)

2206
01:33:01,059 --> 01:33:02,489
(It was more than just a trip.)

2207
01:33:02,489 --> 01:33:04,729
(It was a journey to pursue his dream.)

2208
01:33:05,559 --> 01:33:09,870
(Since we're already born,
do adventurous things as much as we want.)

2209
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:12,399
(And then let's travel again
to the netherworld.)

2210
01:33:12,569 --> 01:33:15,639
(A playlist to the pit)

2211
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:18,569
(The last song
encompassing the 11-day journey.)

2212
01:33:19,139 --> 01:33:21,080
(Music Adventure by Accident's Last Story)
