1
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,179
- The first episode was a big hit.
- Nice.

2
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,939
- Right.
- Everyone is talking about it.

3
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,750
By the way, where's Pani Bottle today?

4
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,210
- I know, right?
- Pani Bottle is...

5
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,050
- He's traveling for his day job.
- Yes.

6
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,919
- He went to shoot videos.
- We'll even work...

7
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,550
- He's the busiest member.
- Pani Bottle's share.

8
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,629
- Are you releasing a song?
- This time round...

9
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:01,870
It'll be released
when today's episode ends.

10
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,770
Really? Can we listen to it?

11
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,099
Yes, you can listen to it.

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,370
- I wrote the words.
- For real?

13
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,370
Yes. The song...

14
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,109
was composed by a popular person.

15
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:13,639
- Seriously?
- Already?

16
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,710
- Will you appear on "Show! Music Core?"
- Gosh.

17
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:18,650
If the song gets a good response.

18
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,219
Cast me, MBC, my foot.

19
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:23,950
(Please listen to it a lot!)

20
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,790
(Finally entering the Cooper Project)

21
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,620
- Hey.
- What's going on? This kid.

22
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,559
- I'm doing good.
- He's from South Korea.

23
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,930
He's a famous artist from South Korea.

24
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,430
(The gang members appear from all sides.)

25
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,430
Yes.

26
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,169
(Slightly nervous)

27
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,370
- Yes, that was...
- From last night.

28
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,639
(Nervously touring the neighborhood)

29
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,639
I appreciate it.

30
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:43,210
(A silent signal)

31
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,870
Hold on. What does that mean?

32
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:46,639
- Oh, no.
- Why?

33
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,710
I have to handle...

34
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,450
I have a handle a business.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,019
It's... No, hey.

36
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:54,320
- Toox suddenly left.
- What?

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,219
Is he making a deal? Wait.

38
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,019
I appreciate it, my boy.

39
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,120
- Yes, that's legal.
- I didn't know him.

40
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,689
- He gave the guy something.
- Another satisfied customer...

41
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,689
who bought a Toox shirt.

42
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:05,900
(I sold a T-shirt.)

43
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,960
He sold a T-shirt.

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,130
(I sold a T-shirt.)

45
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,600
- It was a direct deal.
- Is it like a secondhand marketplace?

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,639
It's something like that.

47
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,769
He sells merchandise
that has his name on it.

48
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,679
- Is Toox your brand?
- Yes, sir.

49
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,739
- Did you design it yourself? "Toox."
- Yes.

50
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,510
It needs hard work and dedication.

51
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:27,419
We have to walk all the way up.

52
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,589
I want to show the other side
of where we come from.

53
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:32,790
We have to show you
where my family is from.

54
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,989
Okay, thank you.

55
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm going to take you
to the infamous 295 Jackson St.

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,799
- Oh, man.
- Right.

57
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,030
- That's the central hub of this project.
- Yes.

58
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,630
We're going to the place
they were born and raised in.

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,769
- You know, on family days,
- Yes.

60
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,510
- this is more like a courtyard.
- It's called The Circle.

61
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,410
Yes, this is called The Circle.

62
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,380
We used to hang around
in the apartment complex playground.

63
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,450
Right.

64
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,450
- Do you live here, Toox?
- I live here. My building is in the back.

65
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,579
There are so many more buildings
in the back.

66
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,089
We will all come here
and converge together.

67
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,450
Yes, we play games.

68
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,589
- I know.
- You know what I mean?

69
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:07,560
On every family day that we have.

70
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,230
(Laughing)

71
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:12,929
This is one of the spots where,
you know, we do fireworks.

72
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,570
We're not supposed to have fireworks,
but they light them off right there.

73
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,070
Light them off, and you can see them.

74
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,940
- What's that?
- They're setting off fireworks.

75
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,139
- That place is like Wolmido.
- "Wolmido?"

76
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,910
- Our cyphers go on right here.
- Cyphers right here?

77
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,310
- Yes.
- I see.

78
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,609
(A place to cypher and socialize)

79
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,579
- Yes. There are a lot of trees.
- Really?

80
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,480
There are a lot of trees,
so we get a lot of shade.

81
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,950
Yes, a lot of trees.

82
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,119
(Trees)

83
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,190
- Trees?
- He's cute.

84
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,320
Trees.

85
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,660
But we spend, you know, those benches?

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,260
That's our hangout spot.

87
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,399
So you sit on those benches
until 2 to 4...

88
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,600
- in the morning.
- Right. Let's sit.

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,100
- "Right. Let's sit."
- The bench.

90
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,010
(He made a believable excuse and escaped.)

91
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,410
Where are you going?

92
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,410
This is where my family is from.
My aunt lives up here.

93
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,649
- I actually want you to meet her, maybe.
- Okay.

94
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:04,850
We can go in.

95
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,850
- I want to show you the inside.
- Yes.

96
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,519
Are we going to your aunt's house?

97
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,489
Yes. We're going to my aunt's house.

98
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,290
I just want to show you how...

99
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,089
- He's giving you a tour of the inside?
- Gosh.

100
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,630
- He took you over there.
- I felt very grateful that...

101
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,360
he invited me to his family's house.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,599
- It's not an easy decision.
- Yes, and you're a stranger.

103
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,829
I like you. You're a cool guy.

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,539
Yes. I want to show you my family.

105
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,339
She's somebody who raised me...

106
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,579
from when I was a baby
and showed me the way.

107
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,110
- She's a mom-like figure.
- I should greet her.

108
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,209
My family lives here.

109
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,979
I'm going to go in and check to make sure
they're okay.

110
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,349
- Good?
- Okay.

111
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,950
- He needed to get their consent first.
- Because of the cameras.

112
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,990
You're right.

113
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,820
(While he's getting the family's consent,)

114
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,159
(Kian84 looks around.)

115
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,829
This is an old building.
It would've been nice...

116
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,269
if the hallway was a bit more spacious.

117
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,729
What a shame.

118
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:01,170
Those were built as apartments years ago.

119
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,940
There were many old buildings.

120
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,639
How do I act mindful in English?

121
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,180
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse me?" Okay.

122
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,479
Keep interpreting for me.

123
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,389
Properly. What's your job?

124
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,420
What?

125
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,950
I'm troubled.

126
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,159
(Walking out)

127
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:20,459
- Okay.
- Come in.

128
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,690
- Good.
- So they know.

129
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:23,860
He got their consent.

130
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,130
(Curious)

131
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,360
I was really curious.

132
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,200
- Hey.
- I asked him to come in.

133
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,139
- Okay.
- You can come in.

134
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,170
Hello.

135
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,409
- Excuse me. Hello.
- What's up? What's going on everyone?

136
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,469
She's his aunt.

137
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,479
- That's my auntie. Auntie Makohim.
- What's up?

138
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,579
- That's right.
- Nice to meet you.

139
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:42,810
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

140
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,349
- His aunt.
- Yes, she's my aunt.

141
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:48,219
- She's like his mom.
- Auntie, this is Kian84.

142
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:51,149
He's a famous South Korean actor,

143
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,060
artist, and everything.

144
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,889
"Actor?"

145
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,990
- They are all my little cousins.
- Cousins?

146
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,829
- Your cousins?
- Yes, my little cousins.

147
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,500
- What's your name?
- Keith.

148
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,229
- "Keith?"
- Keith.

149
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:04,469
- Keith.
- Zuraya.

150
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:05,539
- What's your name? Tell him.
- What's your name?

151
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,139
- Zuraya.
- Zuraya.

152
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,139
- How cute.
- Zuraya.

153
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,310
- "Zuraya?"
- Yes.

154
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:10,709
Zuraya.

155
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:11,709
(Nice to meet you, too.)

156
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,039
So this is my family.

157
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,740
- She's adorable.
- They raised me.

158
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,479
(Appearing)

159
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Hello. Nice to meet you.

160
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,479
That's my uncle right there.
He's Uncle Bobo.

161
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,190
- Uncle Bobo.
- Hello.

162
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,050
Hello. Are you going to school?

163
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,959
Yes. These are all of my cute cousins.

164
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,019
Are you going to school?

165
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,060
(The family members appear one by one.)

166
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,860
- Do you like K-pop?
- What?

167
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,529
Do you like K-pop?

168
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,630
- Or hip-hop?
- I like K-pop.

169
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,130
- Really?
- Do you like K-pop?

170
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,940
- Which group do you like?
- BTS?

171
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,570
- Pizza?
- "Pizza."

172
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,240
K-pop group Pizza?

173
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,740
(Yes.)

174
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,810
Search for them, and they might exist.

175
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,649
On any given day,

176
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,110
- there could be a lot of people.
- Hello.

177
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,680
- How cute.
- Everyone comes to this house.

178
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,719
- They get comfortable.
- Do you like pizza?

179
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,550
(Nodding)

180
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,159
(I like pizza.)

181
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:01,719
Okay. Do you see my cousin in the back?
Are you hot there, my boy?

182
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:03,389
Are there more?

183
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,000
- He has a big family.
- He does.

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,560
His family kept showing up.

185
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,269
How many people are there in your family?

186
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:12,539
- Six.
- Six people?

187
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,070
Back in the day, it was 20.

188
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,170
(Back in the day, it was 20.)

189
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,409
Twenty people?

190
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,409
- Twenty people lived in that house?
- Yes, when he was young.

191
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,409
I have six kids...

192
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,750
- and 22 grandkids.
- I see.

193
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,579
- She has 22 grandkids?
- Yes.

194
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:29,089
- Twenty-two.
- Two great-grandkids.

195
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:31,690
Even great-grandkids?

196
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,589
- How old are you?
- I'm 68.

197
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,289
- You're 68?
- She's 68.

198
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:39,760
I think you look like you're in your 50s.

199
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
(Stop it.)

200
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,529
- Fifties.
- I thought you meant five years old.

201
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,339
- A big family.
- A big family.

202
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,839
Sometimes we play cards.

203
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,070
Sometimes, you know, we have parties.

204
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,180
His aunt raised all of them.

205
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,250
- Yes.
- She's incredible. How admirable.

206
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,479
I treat my aunt with respect.

207
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,279
You know, like an older aunt.

208
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,519
People who have a lot of wisdom
and a lot to give.

209
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,159
I learned a lot from her.

210
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,959
I put in a lot of things...

211
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,860
I learned from here...

212
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,060
and a lot of the situations
that happened here in my music.

213
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,630
I put them in my hip-hop.

214
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,670
- This is your house of history.
- History.

215
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,269
- Your house of history.
- History.

216
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,110
- History.
- This is where history started.

217
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,339
My inspiration.

218
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:27,610
I thought the US revolved around...

219
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:30,010
capitalism and individualism.

220
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,119
But they were very loving.

221
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:37,050
VSOP has lived here since he was little.

222
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,920
I could picture the story in my head.

223
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,989
It made me feel closer to him.

224
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:48,359
Rappers' lyrics are rough...

225
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:51,070
- but many are about family.
- That's right.

226
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,700
Because of his family,

227
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,400
VSOP was able to come to his senses.

228
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:56,869
- He didn't go astray.
- Right.

229
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,209
I can still remember
the smell of the house.

230
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,280
- You can remember it?
- Yes, it smelled like my house in Ulsan.

231
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,180
- "Ulsan?"
- In Ulsan?

232
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,219
Yes, my mom's old house.

233
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,790
Hold on. I should give the kids
some pocket money.

234
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,390
- Gosh.
- I can't give much.

235
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,719
He's never cheap to kids.

236
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,030
I'll give them 20 dollars.
How much is that?

237
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,290
(Around 27,000 won)

238
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,459
Okay, 20 dollars each.

239
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,700
You're giving them 20 dollars each?

240
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,099
Wait.

241
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Here's some pocket money.

242
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
(Opening his wallet
in the Ulsan-scented house)

243
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:26,640
- Allowance.
- "Allowance?"

244
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,999
Okay.

245
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,609
Say, "Thank you."

246
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,509
- Say, "Thank you."
- Did you thank me?

247
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,979
You don't want to? I'm sorry.

248
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,280
(Returning it)

249
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,310
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,450
(Throwing it)

251
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,910
What? What's wrong?

252
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,879
- Maybe he's shy.
- I think he's shy.

253
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,450
Okay. I'm sorry.

254
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,690
- You don't want it?
- This is an allowance from me.

255
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

256
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,690
- Do you want some allowance? Okay.
- Thank you.

257
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,629
- Here, you too.
- Thank you.

258
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:55,900
(And again)

259
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,430
- I'm sorry.
- There's a tension between the two.

260
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,099
I'm sorry.

261
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,640
- I'm sorry.
- "I'm sorry."

262
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,440
- I'm sorry.
- You aren't going to say thank you?

263
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,140
Oh, my. What's wrong?

264
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,440
(He apologized and gave him
the allowance with difficulty.)

265
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:08,780
Korea, where I'm from...

266
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,410
He gave the allowance...

267
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,749
but remained anxious.

268
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,180
In Korea, we say "Thank you."

269
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,219
Thank you.

270
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:18,089
- Sorry.
- He said, "Thank you."

271
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,660
Different culture.

272
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,959
- We are different.
- Thank you.

273
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,629
I'm sorry.

274
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,859
Okay. I'll leave.

275
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:28,060
I'll get going. Yes.

276
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,270
(Laughing awkwardly)

277
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:33,140
There's only one thing...

278
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:34,940
that I can do.

279
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,609
Like when I was in Bolivia,

280
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,609
and when I met Porpi,

281
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:41,109
I gave allowance to the kids.

282
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:42,749
I did the same here.

283
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,810
(I gave them the allowance too.)

284
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,379
Maybe this is a cultural difference.
I'm not sure.

285
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:50,020
- I don't know why he suddenly cried.
- He was a bright kid.

286
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,690
Did his pride get hurt?

287
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,920
I was very worried.

288
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,089
I might've made a mistake
because of the cultural differences.

289
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:58,660
I might have.

290
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,129
(Feeling sad)

291
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:04,430
Is it impolite to give allowance
in the US?

292
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,369
In Korea, we give allowance to the kids.

293
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:09,839
That's the same thing they do.

294
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,410
That's what I do.
I don't give the big ones. I give them.

295
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,109
- Same culture.
- Same. Yes.

296
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:17,979
I feel sorry seeing him cry.

297
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:20,180
- So shall we go now?
- Yes.

298
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:21,680
Did I give him too little?

299
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,589
- I think so too.
- Right?

300
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,959
You only gave him 20 dollars
and asked him to say, "Thank you."

301
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,759
I should've given him 100 dollars.

302
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,530
- You have good chemistry with kids.
- Yes.

303
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,560
(Feeling absurd)

304
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,359
- Bye.
- Bye.

305
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,129
Handsome.

306
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,629
- Yes, you too.
- Yes.

307
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:39,670
It's heartwarming.

308
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,300
All right, bye. All right, aunt.

309
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,670
I'll call you all later.

310
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:51,109
Korean family is very small.

311
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:53,849
- Small?
- Korean family is small.

312
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:57,020
Many people don't get married.

313
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,359
No babies.

314
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,060
- No?
- Yes, Koreans.

315
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,759
My goodness. So you don't want any babies?

316
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,629
- I want.
- In the future.

317
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,570
I want a family.

318
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,469
- I want a son.
- I see.

319
00:13:13,469 --> 00:13:14,570
So you have...

320
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,369
You are a successful artist.

321
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:19,410
- Yes.
- This...

322
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,239
I know that
the girls will be all over you.

323
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,349
(Smirking)

324
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:24,550
Right?

325
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:27,579
- I look so happy.
- You don't deny it.

326
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,790
- You don't deny it.
- He's not wrong.

327
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,520
Right. You're a successful artist.

328
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,119
(A successful artist)

329
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:37,890
How are you liking the city so far?

330
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:40,499
Is it fun?

331
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:42,300
Here?

332
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,499
My first day was a little scary and...

333
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,070
- Scary?
- Yes.

334
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,339
He felt unfamiliar.

335
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,709
But now it feels friendly.

336
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:56,650
Yes, family is very heart.

337
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,249
You know, the thing about it is...
That's how we felt growing up.

338
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,249
- When you go outside, it's scary.
- Yes.

339
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,989
- Outside?
- So we got to create an environment...

340
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:07,060
- that's friendly.
- Yes.

341
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,430
- So when we come home,
- Yes.

342
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,790
we're not scared.

343
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,859
If you go wherever else, it is scary.

344
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,800
It's safer to be in a group.

345
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,300
Is this the Cooper Family?

346
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

347
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,670
I'm a Cooper Family too.

348
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,999
- Of course!
- You.

349
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:24,209
You're a Cooper Family now.

350
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:26,709
Come on. You just took the toll.
You're a Cooper now.

351
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,249
- I won't be able to cross there now.
- Come on, now.

352
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:31,979
- Gosh, you're a Cooper Family now.
- It's a family.

353
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:37,119
VSOP, I'll attack this village.

354
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:41,390
If I get attacked and call you,
will you come here?

355
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,489
- Yes, please!
- Yes.

356
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:45,089
- Please!
- Thank you.

357
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,530
- Every time.
- He feels safe now.

358
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,229
- Oh, my.
- Good.

359
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:49,599
- Blood alliance.
- Always.

360
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,900
I should call myself as Cooper84.

361
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,999
Cooper84.

362
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,940
- So we'll drive and go out.
- Oh, my.

363
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,040
He could get in the front.

364
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,969
If you want, you can sit in the front.

365
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,140
- Thank you.
- All right.

366
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,579
Is this okay with you?

367
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,749
- I'm just putting the AC on.
- But you should...

368
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,690
(Yes.)

369
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,690
I'll drive you
and take you to the studio with me.

370
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,060
- Gosh, you're going to the studio.
- He wants to take me to the studio.

371
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,089
(Excited)

372
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,300
(He was invited
to his music studio last night.)

373
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,729
- There's New York music.
- New York music?

374
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:28,270
- Hip-hop studio.
- Even I haven't been there.

375
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,540
(Connecting Bluetooth)

376
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,609
Bluetooth.

377
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,140
This one is supposed to be down.

378
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,009
This one is supposed to be up.
I got lint on my hair.

379
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,349
Gosh, he's detailed.

380
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,849
- This is me and Bing.
- For real?

381
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,690
- For real?
- Me and Bing Nation.

382
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,119
- They...
- Oh, gosh.

383
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,619
- They're all musicians.
- made this music.

384
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,619
One, two, three!

385
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:52,259
(He starts singing
while he is fixing his hair.)

386
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,770
I feel like I'm looking at my friends.

387
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:59,940
- At the light, turn left.
- <i>Came along the way</i>

388
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,339
The navigation joined too.

389
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,009
(Cooper Family is getting excited.)

390
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:06,410
Their life is all about music.

391
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,979
(Cooper84 is still shy.)

392
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,479
(Enjoy.)

393
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:14,979
(Starts dancing)

394
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,950
(Singing)

395
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,690
(Cooper84 is excited.)

396
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,719
I wanted to sing together,
but I didn't know the lyrics.

397
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,560
At the light, turn right.

398
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,890
- Turn right.
- On to Nothern Avenue.

399
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,030
(He participates in featuring
as he gets excited.)

400
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,200
This song is nice.

401
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,270
In half a mile...

402
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,540
(Fully immersed)

403
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,469
(He's recording.)

404
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,040
(It's nothing special, but they're excited
and they burst into laughter.)

405
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,910
- Yes, I can do that.
- This is nice!

406
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,650
- I can do that.
- Bing Nation.

407
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,150
- Thank you.
- Some say he can't sing.

408
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,219
He can say, "That's me."

409
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,650
All set!

410
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,320
- Toox.
- That's me. Yes, sir.

411
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,520
(Toox's song,
who's full of energy and joy)

412
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,160
I recognize his voice.

413
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,030
(Impressed)

414
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,499
Me!

415
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,270
(Joyful Toox raps very well.)

416
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,300
He's good.

417
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,040
Me!

418
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,609
(He sang along "Me!")

419
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,680
- He said, "Me!"
- Me!

420
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,209
It's better.

421
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,450
Me?

422
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,550
Me!

423
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,749
Like that.

424
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:24,989
- Nice!
- What you said?

425
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:25,989
Appreciate you.

426
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,859
- Single mother.
- "Single mother."

427
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,259
(Laughing)

428
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,829
(He learns another vocabulary
after getting praised.)

429
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:37,869
- Yes.
- No.

430
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,410
I like this part.

431
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:45,969
(Rolling stone)

432
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,040
Roll roll rolling

433
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,940
(Rolling stone)

434
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,050
He never gets tired.

435
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,579
- He never.
- He's an energizer.

436
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,879
(Cooper84 got thirsty
after saying a few words.)

437
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:59,820
(Toox is still performing
even though he should be thirsty.)

438
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,290
(Glancing)

439
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:05,560
(He was born to be a singer.)

440
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,330
(Toox is excited alone
when the audience is silent.)

441
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,900
- VSOP looks tired too.
- It's sad.

442
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,999
Yes, he didn't react.

443
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:12,600
(His energy is too much
to be covered by their friendship.)

444
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,239
(He's fully immersed.)

445
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,769
He's fully immersed.

446
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:19,580
(Laughing)

447
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,739
(His head hurts.)

448
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:22,850
Tooxo.

449
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,749
(His name is Toox.)

450
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,979
Yes!

451
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:28,380
(He's about to fall asleep
after losing all his energy.)

452
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,850
<i>Angle from the side,</i>
<i>angle from the bottom side, I mean</i>

453
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,360
<i>Listen you explain that to him</i>

454
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,259
(There must've been a funny triangle.)

455
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,559
(Rubbing his eyes)

456
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,330
My stomach hurts.

457
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,729
I was...

458
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:44,130
trying to listen with attention
to get closer to them.

459
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,330
Toox...

460
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,340
doesn't need a cypher.

461
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,809
He does cypher every day.

462
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:53,940
He's doing it already.

463
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,410
He keeps talking when no one listens.

464
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,279
(He's still talking.)

465
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,680
(Please kill me.)

466
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,749
"Please kill me."

467
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,920
Your destination is on your right.

468
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,090
- In half a mile...
- Bobobo!

469
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,890
(They arrived at the studio
before dying of his energy.)

470
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,700
(How will the hip-hop studio
at Brooklyn look like?)

471
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,459
Nice to meet you.

472
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,469
(He enters the studio.)

473
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,600
He's entering the studio!

474
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,200
She's so tall.

475
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,239
Be at the other side.

476
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,110
(Toox enters while dancing.)

477
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:25,910
(Producer)

478
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:28,539
(The aspiring singer finds
the music studio fascinating.)

479
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,479
- This is a legit music studio.
- My goodness.

480
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,979
Let me try to record it.
Let me see how it sounds.

481
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:37,890
He's recording right now.

482
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,920
(VSOP is recording a guide for his song.)

483
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,459
VSOP is going to show him.

484
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,860
(He starts recording.)

485
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,600
(The aspiring singer is following
the rhythm.)

486
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,299
(Toox is again excited.)

487
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:53,440
(He became a maestro again.)

488
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,499
I thought he was being quiet,
but his body was making a noise.

489
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,709
Because he couldn't speak while recording,

490
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:58,739
- so he danced instead.
- I see.

491
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,850
(Dancing)

492
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,479
(Dancing)

493
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:08,019
(The song finished.)

494
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,850
There's a doll that dances
only when the music is played.

495
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,090
(He's like a doll.)

496
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:20,700
(Monitoring the recording)

497
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,930
So what I was thinking was...

498
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,630
finish all the frames
and then do the second...

499
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,739
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
The second flow.

500
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,039
Separately.

501
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,809
So say, "Can I take you home with me."

502
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,039
And then literally just two tracks.

503
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,680
They're seriously discussing music
without joking around.

504
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,150
I saw it in cypher but when he raps,

505
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,950
he's different. He's really good.

506
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,190
He's not trying to do hip-hop.

507
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,029
His life itself is hip-hop.

508
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:52,360
(Their lives are hip-hop.)

509
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,499
See. So what happens is sometimes...

510
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,969
If you're at a studio session,
you get a brain cramp.

511
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,170
- So you have a brain cramp,
- Yes.

512
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,299
throw some beats on,

513
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,440
and you start bouncing ideas
back and forth.

514
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,269
- In freestyle?
- Yes!

515
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:07,080
Yes, freestyle.

516
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
Cypher is...

517
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,910
usual as if it's like drinking Americano.

518
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:16,650
(Toox starts rapping first
as he can speak now.)

519
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,059
He's writing something.

520
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,120
He's writing.

521
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,090
(He writes the lyrics
thinking of the last two days in the US.)

522
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,400
- Rapper84.
- He doesn't get afraid anymore.

523
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,799
- What do you think?
- Me?

524
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,999
What do you think when your head hurts?

525
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,100
What I think?

526
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,769
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

527
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:37,009
(I went to Central Park.)

528
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,440
He wrote the lyrics in English.

529
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,209
(There are no toilets in Central Park.)

530
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:43,749
(No toilet!)

531
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,249
(I was sick.)

532
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:46,479
I was sick.

533
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,650
(For a long time...)

534
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,319
(I ran and ran.)

535
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,420
He didn't poop his pants.

536
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,719
(I struggled to find a toilet.)

537
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,930
(But this studio...)

538
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:59,259
(have a good toilet.)

539
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:01,130
(Laughing)

540
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,529
The toilet was nice.

541
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,630
(He already checked the toilet.)

542
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,269
There we go! Just like that!

543
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,069
(I gave allowance to the kids.)

544
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:13,380
(But he was sulky. Why did he cry?)

545
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,850
(Gosh. I'm still thinking about it.)

546
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,580
(I gave them 20 dollars each fairly.)

547
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,950
(But she...)

548
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,680
(cried!)

549
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,719
There's a story.

550
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,989
(She cried!)

551
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,789
But she was a he. That's a boy.

552
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,289
- He.
- It was a boy.

553
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:31,459
Oh, he was a boy?

554
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:32,459
(He's a boy.)

555
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:34,400
(Don't cry, girl.)

556
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,600
(Grow up strong.)

557
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:39,100
Now you picked the flow.
You've got to give me some.

558
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,539
- Yes.
- I like the way you picked the flow.

559
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,640
Yes, I'm a follower.

560
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,840
Yes, I felt it.

561
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,440
I really felt it.

562
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,410
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

563
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,539
Okay. Let's get it.

564
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,610
- Okay.
- Yes.

565
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,610
(Supporting)

566
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,120
(Simon Dominic, I'm in Brooklyn
and not The Bronx.)

567
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Is it me, again?

568
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,120
Video letter rap.

569
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
(He suddenly starts rapping
as if he's sending a video letter.)

570
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,360
(Simon Dominic, look at this
when I go back to Korea.)

571
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,759
(I'm now...)

572
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,190
(doing real hip-hop.)

573
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,059
(I'm doing real hip-hop here.)

574
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,799
Oh, man. That's it.

575
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,130
Oh, finally!

576
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,239
Why did I do that?

577
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,700
Show us!

578
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,469
(Muscles)

579
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:19,039
(Muscles)

580
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,440
(Muscles, hip-hop, yes!)

581
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:22,410
(Lifting weights)

582
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,350
- I should go to the gym.
- Nice.

583
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,110
He's playing around with the rhythm.

584
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,279
We're not done.

585
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,819
I'm so happy.

586
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:32,719
I'm very happy.

587
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,259
- Yes. It was great.
- Us too.

588
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,390
You touched our hearts.

589
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,660
- The viewers must be crying.
- Seriously.

590
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,930
You never said my name during
the awards ceremony but you call me now.

591
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,830
(He missed out only Simon Dominic's name
during the awards ceremony.)

592
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,370
(But Simon Dominic is Kian84's old wife.)

593
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,709
(He was his darling.)

594
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,450
(His heart is fluttering.)

595
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,979
I'm touched.

596
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,719
This is real.

597
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,650
All right. So we can get out of here
and enjoy a party.

598
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,660
- What time?
- Six o'clock.

599
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,819
- Six?
- Six.

600
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:12,529
(While they were touring
the neighborhood,)

601
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:16,160
(he invited his acquaintances to a party.)

602
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,700
(He invited Kian84 to the party too.)

603
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:22,269
(We're going to have music,)

604
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,969
(and the kids will be dancing.)

605
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,080
(It's a family party.)

606
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,009
- In front of the electric wires.
- Okay.

607
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,650
- See you at six.
- Yes.

608
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,880
"In front of the electric wires."

609
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,049
The location for the meeting is unusual.

610
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,420
"See you in front of the electric wires."

611
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,450
There are Jordan electric wires,

612
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,519
- and Adidas electric wires.
- I see.

613
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,590
Later, there will be a family party.

614
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:49,729
I asked around and apparently
people buy cakes for the party.

615
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,499
Just now, I went with nothing.

616
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:54,969
My goodness. It looks like a vintage cake.

617
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:56,170
This one and...

618
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:58,239
one each...

619
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:00,580
for everything.

620
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,009
These two more.

621
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,009
Yes.

622
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:06,519
- Can I write a sign for you?
- Well, sign...

623
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,450
- Please write Cooper.
- Cooper.

624
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,850
Yes.

625
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:12,090
I'm not sure of the spelling.

626
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,590
- Cooper.
- Cooper.

627
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,719
- It's O.
- Just Cooper?

628
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,959
Yes. Double O.

629
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:18,930
Cooper Family.

630
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,729
Thank you.

631
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,200
He bought a lot. His hands are full.

632
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:28,170
(He got out after buying a lot of things.)

633
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:31,840
(What?)

634
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,410
They're having a party.

635
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,979
Are they having a party too?

636
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,350
It was their Independence Day.

637
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:40,979
I'll go to the party now.

638
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:44,150
Gosh, this is heavy.

639
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,049
I need more hands.

640
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,120
(Heading to the party venue
with two full hands and excitement)

641
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,729
Cooper Community. This is the right place.

642
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:56,059
(Their meeting point is
in front of the electric wires.)

643
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,100
Cooper park houses.

644
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,170
It's in front of the condominium.

645
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,170
(He arrived at the Cooper Project.)

646
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
Is it there?

647
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:05,969
(Music can be heard from far too.)

648
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:07,009
This is...

649
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,209
- Hello!
- My man!

650
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:11,549
- Hello!
- "My man."

651
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:12,549
Toox!

652
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:15,080
- He brought gifts?
- Toox.

653
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:16,319
- Listen.
- Yes.

654
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,920
So what you're seeing is
the combination of community events.

655
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,420
- Community? This here?
- Yes.

656
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,660
So we're just out here. Kicking it!

657
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,529
- This is nice.
- Sit.

658
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:27,559
Is this the Cooper block neighborhood?

659
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,559
Yes.

660
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,029
(In the free-spirited environment...)

661
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,069
They look free.

662
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,799
(he also becomes joyful.)

663
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
(Barbeque is grilling.)

664
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,969
- Barbeque.
- Yes, barbeque.

665
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:40,080
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

666
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,080
- They're dancing too.
- So cute.

667
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,209
The party that Kian84 got invited to...

668
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:46,819
is called Block Party.

669
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,920
On special days, an outdoor party is...

670
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,350
held by blocking off vehicle traffic
in a specific block of the neighborhood.

671
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,519
This event is said to enhance
the sense of community...

672
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,190
and strengthen the bonds among residents.

673
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,090
This block party,

674
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,959
which features activities like barbecue,
fireworks, rap, DJing, and dancing,

675
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,569
is said to have had a significant impact
on the development of hip-hop.

676
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:04,569
It's Piggy.

677
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,700
It's a town festival.

678
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,469
Thank you for inviting me.

679
00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:14,309
Thank you for coming back, man.
I'm thankful.

680
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:16,080
This is a cake.

681
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,209
- These are cupcakes.
- He brought...

682
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:19,650
cookies.

683
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,950
(Ta-da)

684
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,620
My goodness. The cake. Cooper.

685
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,190
Cooper Family Love.

686
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:27,360
- Cooper Family Love.
- It's not the correct spelling.

687
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,120
- Is it wrong?
- Yes.

688
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,789
- Yes.
- Did I spell it wrong?

689
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,289
Oh, no.

690
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:34,660
(The staff helped to write the letters.)

691
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,700
He wrote it.

692
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,630
It's missing with another O.

693
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,799
- Oh, another O.
- He wrote Coper instead of Cooper.

694
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,940
It's okay. They understood.

695
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
It's okay.

696
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,440
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

697
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,640
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

698
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,910
(Having a toast
with the forgiving Cooper Family)

699
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:49,080
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

700
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,610
- The US is known for using red cups.
- Yes.

701
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,249
- It looks fun.
- They gave me whiskey.

702
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:54,249
- Is it whiskey?
- Yes.

703
00:27:55,979 --> 00:27:57,219
(Roaring)

704
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,920
(Screaming)

705
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,950
Toox loved it.

706
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,059
(Screaming)

707
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:04,529
- Right here.
- Yes.

708
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:05,729
- You know.
- The heart.

709
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,600
This is hip-hop.

710
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,330
(You're right.)

711
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,200
Toox needs to visit Korea one day.

712
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,499
He'll win the Best Rookie Award.

713
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:18,569
- My goodness.
- I envy him.

714
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:19,640
Catching the vibe.

715
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:23,340
Kian84, I want to show you everybody.

716
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,180
- I want you to meet them.
- Yes.

717
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,319
Come right here. This is Lans.

718
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,880
Yes. Nice to meet you.

719
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,789
He's my cousin. My older cousin.

720
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,890
You look like Snoop Dogg.

721
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:36,019
- He looks like Snoop Dogg.
- He looks the same.

722
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:37,360
- Yes.
- Okay. So look.

723
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,029
This is my cousin Jessica.

724
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:41,259
Is it your cousin?

725
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:43,200
- She's shy.
- Nice to meet you.

726
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,229
- Oh, you are shy!
- She's shy.

727
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,100
Look at my mom.

728
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,440
Mama.

729
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,340
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

730
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,069
My name is Kian84.

731
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:55,910
VSOP SITY...

732
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,509
She's like Michelle Obama.

733
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:59,509
(Her smile looks kind
like Michelle Obama.)

734
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:01,749
He's an artist from South Korea.

735
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
(Impressed)

736
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,519
VSOP is a fantastic artist.

737
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,890
- A fantastic rapper.
- Yes.

738
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:10,890
- That's my mom.
- I'm proud of him.

739
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,059
Mama.

740
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,529
I'm proud of him.

741
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:17,130
He loves his family very much.

742
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,400
- Yes.
- He loves his family very much.

743
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,269
- Yes.
- He is but not me.

744
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:23,709
Why?

745
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:25,670
- She's tough.
- I'm tough.

746
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,979
She's tough. She's crazy.

747
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:30,580
Why do you say she's crazy?

748
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,610
No, I'm not crazy.

749
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,580
She's not crazy. She's tough.

750
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,350
That was a spicy comment.

751
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,350
(They even make spicy jokes
to each other.)

752
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:40,120
Mother, have something to eat.

753
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,519
Drink and eat food.

754
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,360
- She doesn't drink.
- I don't drink.

755
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,190
- I don't drink.
- You don't drink?

756
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,200
- No alcohol.
- Yes.

757
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,759
Do you want cookies, bread, or...

758
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,100
- Nice.
- Yes.

759
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,870
- You bought them well.
- Nice.

760
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,940
Which one is yours?

761
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:57,940
What's your favorite cookie?

762
00:29:58,239 --> 00:30:00,380
- This is the children's.
- This is for the kids?

763
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,039
- Yes. Kids.
- Man. Is it?

764
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,709
Yes. I should give them to the kids.

765
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:05,749
- Over there.
- Come here.

766
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:07,749
- Do you have an extra bag to put this in?
- Cookie.

767
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,890
I'm like the guy
in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."

768
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,459
(Cookies)

769
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:15,489
Why is he so cute?

770
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:18,630
(They're all interested
in sweet Charlie84.)

771
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,890
Cookie?

772
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,400
(Cookie?)

773
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,459
Why are the children so cute?

774
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,299
(Excited)

775
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,069
Goodness.

776
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,200
Why does it feel like I'm in Madagascar?

777
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,569
- Goodness.
- Becky?

778
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:33,539
It felt like Madagascar.

779
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,039
(Charlie84 adds sweetness.)

780
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,110
Cookie.

781
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,120
- Do you want some?
- How cute.

782
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:43,479
- How cute.
- She looks cool.

783
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,390
Cry...

784
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:48,660
- Who was it?
- Who was the crybaby?

785
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,029
(While giving out allowance at aunt's)

786
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,789
(You should say thank you.)

787
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:54,229
(Shaking)

788
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,130
(No thank you.)

789
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,769
(You only gave 20 dollars.)

790
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,100
(Feeling sorry)

791
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,400
(The kid who cried for an unknown reason)

792
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,809
- Crying kid.
- He's a good adult who apologizes.

793
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,940
Is it her?

794
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:10,979
- Do you want some cookies?
- Cookies?

795
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,650
Do you want some cookies?

796
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,920
Take one.

797
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
(She's not the crying kid.)

798
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,219
Why are you apologizing...

799
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:20,559
to her?

800
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:21,890
Just one.

801
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,519
(He delivered the apology
to the wrong person.)

802
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,190
I'm sorry.

803
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:27,459
- I'm sorry.
- While giving out the cookie.

804
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,499
I'm sorry about today.

805
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,999
(It happens.)

806
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:36,039
I was worried most about you
because you cried. I thought I did wrong.

807
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,069
(Something isn't right.)

808
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:41,140
What is he doing?

809
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:42,779
Crying kid?

810
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,410
(No)

811
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,450
This is crazy.

812
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,019
It wasn't you?

813
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,019
- What is he talking about?
- You almost made another kid cry.

814
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,620
It's him.

815
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:54,120
It's him.

816
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,989
- Cookie.
- Come here.

817
00:31:57,989 --> 00:31:59,390
- Cookie.
- I remembered him.

818
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,400
Do you want a cookie?

819
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,959
- Have a nice day.
- Do you want a cookie?

820
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,100
Good. You did a good job.

821
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,170
(He eats the cookie and cooly leaves.)

822
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,239
But...

823
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:10,610
He could have said bye.

824
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,940
(Tagging along)

825
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:18,880
You shouldn't take them all.

826
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,049
Just eat that one.

827
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,249
I guess she liked it.

828
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,019
(The cookies are popular.)

829
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:26,289
If I knew,

830
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,590
I would have given him cookies
instead of 20 dollars.

831
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,029
He looks happier than when
he received the allowance money.

832
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:34,029
That's right.

833
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,330
I'm sorry, Zuraya.

834
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,529
I'm sorry about today.

835
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,239
- He sincerely apologized again.
- He's looking at him.

836
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,239
(He makes a sincere apology
in a sweet way.)

837
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,469
(He returns lightly after making
the apology.)

838
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,140
(Well done)

839
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,479
(Cheers)

840
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:52,180
Thank you.

841
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,719
- This one.
- Thank you.

842
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,890
(They keep taking care of him.)

843
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,390
As me how it went today.

844
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,519
How nice.

845
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,130
- I think you were drunk in the mood.
- It must have been nice.

846
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,700
Remember when I told you
my mom doesn't drink?

847
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,600
She's in remission from cancer.

848
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,299
She had cancer.

849
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:14,569
- His mother?
- His mother was sick.

850
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,700
She's fully recovered?

851
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,469
So she doesn't drink anymore.

852
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,279
That's a big relief.

853
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,049
Good.

854
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,350
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you.

855
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,680
- Thank you.
- Okay.

856
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,019
VSOP SITY's mother came...

857
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,759
as well as the children
in the aunt's house.

858
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:35,559
It was like a family event.

859
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,959
(The block party was like
a fun family event.)

860
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,090
It was like I was invited for a holiday.

861
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:44,229
The way they lived was similar to us
in that way.

862
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:48,840
Do you have such parties often?

863
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,170
On special occasions.
Like tomorrow is the fourth.

864
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,640
- Fourth of July. It gets crazy.
- It goes crazy.

865
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,650
Holidays. Everybody.

866
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,410
Every holiday?

867
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,420
As much as possible.

868
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,019
It's like a feast in Korea.
On the traditional holidays.

869
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,690
They play basketball games.

870
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,690
The kids race and run around.

871
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,759
I see.

872
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,130
(Like playing tag
on our traditional holidays)

873
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,600
(They fiercely run around
in Brooklyn traditional holidays.)

874
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,769
That's right.

875
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:19,370
They run around outside.

876
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,269
(He finds something.)

877
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,140
They're playing poker.

878
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,440
There.

879
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,509
- They're playing poker.
- They're playing poker too.

880
00:34:26,509 --> 00:34:27,739
It's similar. It's the same.

881
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,940
Brooklyn is the same as here.

882
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,779
- People live in similar ways.
- Right.

883
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:35,549
Do you want to learn how to play cards?

884
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:37,190
Cards? No.

885
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,390
- He said no.
- No.

886
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,219
(Are you scared?)

887
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,959
They look like pro gamers.

888
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,959
Yes. All of them.

889
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:50,400
They're gamblers.

890
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,330
They each have money...

891
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,370
(Do you want to see my skills?)

892
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,969
- A gambler.
- She's good.

893
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,840
(He's impressed.)

894
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:01,180
No. I'll be ripped off.

895
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,539
He said I will not play with you.

896
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:05,610
(Disappointed)

897
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,519
That's too funny.

898
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:10,790
They would have had a better time
because you came.

899
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,819
That's right. It's so nice.

900
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:15,219
- Here.
- Yes, sir.

901
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,919
Right there.

902
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:18,960
(Stop)

903
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,899
You don't drink so well, do you?

904
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,529
- You drink only a little?
- What?

905
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:26,799
(He's annoyed.)

906
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,799
The Korean says you don't drink much.

907
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,270
I can't even... See this.

908
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,140
(Shaking)

909
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,439
(Is he sobering up?)

910
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:36,879
He has lots of talents.

911
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,580
Breathe out and then take the drink.

912
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,580
You have no idea.

913
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,950
Toox doesn't stop talking.

914
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,560
I can't reply to him.

915
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,230
The way you talk is like a cypher.

916
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,230
The way you talk is like a cypher.

917
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,830
Your talking is like a cypher.

918
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,100
- You're ready for the cypher?
- Yes.

919
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:01,040
You're ready for the cypher?

920
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,399
(Shall we start a real cypher?)

921
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,640
There will be another cypher.

922
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,439
(He proposes to start a cypher.)

923
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,609
You're ready for another cypher?

924
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,739
Do you want to do this right now?

925
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:10,339
- Right now?
- Will that be right now?

926
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:12,049
<i>Move around</i>

927
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:13,210
There it goes again.

928
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:15,719
It starts right away.

929
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:18,549
<i>Speaking of the K, be on top of the K</i>

930
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:20,219
(The rap comes out immediately
like a spinal reflex.)

931
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:21,859
What do you mean?

932
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,189
(Mumbling)

933
00:36:24,189 --> 00:36:26,529
Mother took it next?

934
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:27,960
- Mother.
- Eminem.

935
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,700
(It's my turn!)

936
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,669
(Aunt Poker also joins the cypher.)

937
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,399
- She just goes for it.
- It's so hip.

938
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,669
Listen. Hip-hop is a way of life.

939
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:41,739
- Gosh.
- It's a culture.

940
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:44,680
All your family can rap freestyle.

941
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,779
- It's real.
- It's life.

942
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:48,950
Hip-hop is more than music.

943
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,290
The cypher started then.

944
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:54,859
The aunt suddenly went on...

945
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,890
as she was playing poker.

946
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,830
It was like the mothers' nagging...

947
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,960
or expression of hardships.

948
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,930
It was different from the root.

949
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,399
Even in Yeoju, the old ladies curse.

950
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:12,069
It's just that there is no beat.

951
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,810
It's strong.

952
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,680
- If they had the beat...
- That's right.

953
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,910
I was wondering when you'd mention it.

954
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:20,109
I think it's a way of expressing hardship.

955
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,250
You vomit things out...

956
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,549
and make a virtuous cycle.

957
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:25,549
(Maybe hip-hop is about vomiting words
that were inside you.)

958
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,089
It's my turn.

959
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:29,359
Okay.

960
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,359
Yes.

961
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,290
- Again.
- He's a cypher machine.

962
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:34,730
- He's a rapping machine.
- Spit it out.

963
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,700
(There is no lyrics note this time!)

964
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,399
(What will he express
in his real freestyle rap?)

965
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,399
And he goes.

966
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,410
(What will he express
in his real freestyle rap?)

967
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,140
<i>I came to Cooper family's dinner</i>

968
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,779
<i>And as expected, today's dinner</i>

969
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,149
<i>Is unbelievable</i>

970
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,580
Goodness. He's talking.

971
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,580
He understood.

972
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:58,890
<i>It would be nice if we did this</i>
<i>on Korean traditional holidays too</i>

973
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,919
That's good.

974
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:02,319
<i>I don't want to go home on holidays</i>

975
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:03,960
Mom

976
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:07,189
<i>I don't have a girl. I can't get married</i>

977
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,799
<i>Don't ask me what I do</i>

978
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:10,969
(Don't ask me what I do these days)

979
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:12,469
<i>Don't ask me about having a kid either</i>

980
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,669
<i>Don't ask me about getting married</i>

981
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,899
<i>Don't ask me about getting a job</i>

982
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,370
<i>I will live the way I want</i>

983
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:21,210
<i>Don't nag, just give me allowance money</i>

984
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,210
It's a bad son rap.

985
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:27,379
<i>Seolnal, Chuseok, don't nag, give me money</i>

986
00:38:27,379 --> 00:38:28,819
- Yes.
- Gosh.

987
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:29,850
<i>Keep the money</i>

988
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:31,149
"Keep the money."

989
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,919
"Give me money."

990
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,390
(Conclusion: Keep your money well
on traditional holidays)

991
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,790
(Like I did)

992
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:39,129
- Keep the money?
- He turned it around.

993
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:42,129
(Here comes "Keep the money")

994
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:46,299
Listen. Give him a round of applause.

995
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:48,870
Give my boy a round of applause.
You don't clap...

996
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,370
for yourself. Do you?

997
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,540
He didn't just blabber. There was a story.

998
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,710
He improved a lot
over a short period of time.

999
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,439
You played me.

1000
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,980
You made me teach you how to rap,
but you already knew how to do it.

1001
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:02,450
You already knew how to do it.

1002
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,950
What is he saying?

1003
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,390
It's a coming-of-age movie.

1004
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,489
- Yes.
- Give me that.

1005
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:10,689
You don't learn a flow like that
in two hours.

1006
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,299
I don't know
if this is a cypher or a conversation.

1007
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,930
The border is disappearing.

1008
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:19,399
<i>The border between cyphers</i>
<i>and conversations disappears</i>

1009
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,339
Beat change.

1010
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:24,810
It's warm in here.

1011
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,109
What's Aunt doing?

1012
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,939
Look.

1013
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
They're dancing.

1014
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,910
(The whole world is hip-hop.)

1015
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,149
It's a party.

1016
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,689
Ladies and gentlemen.

1017
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:43,259
I feel like he's going to rap
while hosting the event.

1018
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:49,060
It's the dance battle of the year!

1019
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:52,930
(Let's go!)

1020
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,770
(Let's start shaking it.)

1021
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,870
Even the kids.

1022
00:39:56,669 --> 00:39:57,810
Goodness.

1023
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,040
(They approach the stage one by one.)

1024
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,410
(Slowly approaching)

1025
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,410
Okay!

1026
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,640
What Simon said...

1027
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,980
the last time actually happened.

1028
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,719
Toox hosts the event,

1029
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:10,250
and people start break-dancing.

1030
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,589
That's right.

1031
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:13,419
Men and women of all ages participate.

1032
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:15,160
Gosh.

1033
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,319
(Dancer84 has to join them.)

1034
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:18,689
Show us, Dancer84.

1035
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,359
- K-pop.
- Let's go.

1036
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:21,629
Here he goes.

1037
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:22,930
He's here to take over Brooklyn.

1038
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,629
Teach them a lesson.

1039
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:26,600
(Come on.)

1040
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,399
(Did you want me?)

1041
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,609
(Dancing with an auntie
he asked without thinking)

1042
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:34,109
(Another auntie joins him.)

1043
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:35,410
Auntie.

1044
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,580
They're in the front and back.
He's surrounded.

1045
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,580
(The Korean nephew receives lots of love.)

1046
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,180
Stay healthy, Auntie.

1047
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,049
You must go through a lot
trying to raise your nephews.

1048
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,589
Well done.

1049
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,460
- Hey!
- Mother.

1050
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,629
- Hey!
- Okay.

1051
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,859
Congratulations
on your full recovery, Mother.

1052
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,100
He's wishing them good luck.

1053
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,230
- Let's go!
- Yes!

1054
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,339
Here it comes.

1055
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:03,299
"Go away, diseases."

1056
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:06,310
(Touched by his dance
of showing filial love)

1057
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:07,839
I'll show you. You've got to do it.

1058
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,279
She's VSOP's younger cousin.

1059
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:11,350
(The cousin teaches him how to dance
to show appreciation.)

1060
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,850
- Ready? That's it.
- Okay.

1061
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,450
He did that back in India.

1062
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,649
(Grooving to the rhythm)

1063
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,689
- All right.
- He's got the groove right.

1064
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:21,460
What...

1065
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:24,089
You said that you were shy.
You're not shy at all.

1066
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,359
That's it!

1067
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,189
(The same person)

1068
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:29,460
Ready? Hey!

1069
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,370
Five, six, rolling down!

1070
00:41:32,899 --> 00:41:34,169
Kian84!

1071
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:36,469
- Hey!
- Yes!

1072
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:39,310
- Kian84!
- Cooper Family!

1073
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,180
Family!

1074
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,339
- He mixes in really well.
- Yes.

1075
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,950
- Kian84!
- Cooper!

1076
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,250
- Kian84!
- Cooper!

1077
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,580
- Cooper!
- Kian84!

1078
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,790
Cooper!

1079
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,549
Cooper Family!

1080
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,020
As a fan of hip-hop,

1081
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,089
it's like a dream...

1082
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:01,960
to actually join a block party...

1083
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,500
for a project.

1084
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,270
- You have my respect.
- Yes.

1085
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:08,339
Nice.

1086
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,339
(Thanking the family members
for helping him fulfill his dream)

1087
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:14,180
Mother, congratulations
on your full recovery.

1088
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,509
Don't ever come back,

1089
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,910
you filthy cancer!

1090
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,379
Do not come to her!

1091
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,879
(The son is touched.)

1092
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,120
Go away!

1093
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:28,060
Go away, cancer!

1094
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,189
This is crazy.

1095
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,430
You said a lot of good stuff.

1096
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:33,629
Cooper Family!

1097
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:34,700
Hey!

1098
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,660
I wish you great success, guys.

1099
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,700
(Wishing them well)

1100
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:40,830
<i>Stay healthy</i>

1101
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:43,200
<i>Cooper Family</i>

1102
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,109
That's good.

1103
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,069
They must have loved you.

1104
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,210
And he rolled it down.

1105
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,580
- He did it?
- Yes, he did his own thing.

1106
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,779
He rolled it down.

1107
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,850
And then, he popped it out.

1108
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,950
- You'd have to be close after that.
- It's fascinating.

1109
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,689
We're going to break this off, man.

1110
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:01,919
Get over here, K.

1111
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:03,460
Okay. A cutting ceremony.

1112
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,529
We're going to have...

1113
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:06,790
We're going to give it a nice cut.

1114
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,129
- Right here.
- Right about here.

1115
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:11,399
(Cutting it together
with their hands put together)

1116
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:14,270
- Cooper Family.
- Absolutely.

1117
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,739
- My guy.
- Yes.

1118
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:17,339
I'm Cooper Family?

1119
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:19,839
We're going to cut this,
so everybody gets a piece of cake.

1120
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,279
I'm not going to hold you up.
I don't care if we have the...

1121
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:24,080
- Wait. Is he crying?
- Because he called you family?

1122
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,509
- Were you crying?
- I got slightly emotional.

1123
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,120
In fact, back in Korea,

1124
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,450
I'm very careful, and I usually hide away.

1125
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,589
And I get to freely be myself here.

1126
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:36,589
(I can freely be myself here.)

1127
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:37,790
I completely understand.

1128
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,890
As far as... Here,

1129
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:42,960
we don't glorify celebrities.

1130
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,230
Because you'd be family.

1131
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,100
- We love everybody.
- Seriously?

1132
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,200
That's so touching.

1133
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,500
- I'm serious!
- Do you mean that?

1134
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,810
- Okay. Thank you.
- That's what we wanted to show you here.

1135
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,969
Absolutely.

1136
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,310
It's so wholesome.

1137
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,480
I would have gotten emotional too.

1138
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,109
- Don't cry.
- You're good.

1139
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:00,480
I don't cry.

1140
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,879
- I don't cry.
- Give him love.

1141
00:44:01,879 --> 00:44:03,549
- I don't cry.
- There you have it.

1142
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,719
Men don't cry.

1143
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:08,120
- "Men don't cry!"
- Men don't cry.

1144
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:12,290
- Last shot.
- Last one? Come on. We still got more.

1145
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,859
We're going to toast
to my boy's new music career.

1146
00:44:15,629 --> 00:44:17,700
- We taught you the essence of hip-hop.
- Okay.

1147
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,129
We brought you to Brooklyn.

1148
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,540
Hip-hop and Brooklyn is
honestly synonymous.

1149
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,310
What we did today was literally...

1150
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:30,109
the day in the life
of a hip-hop artist in Brooklyn.

1151
00:44:30,779 --> 00:44:31,910
Come on.

1152
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,049
It's a connection
that you'll never forget your whole life.

1153
00:44:34,149 --> 00:44:36,149
Cooper Family, I mean.

1154
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,750
You already know that you're now
a family in Brooklyn.

1155
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,049
- Okay.
- Brooklyn, baby.

1156
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:41,620
- Brooklyn!
- Brooklyn!

1157
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,219
How did he have a shirt
that said Brooklyn too?

1158
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,390
Gwacheon!

1159
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,560
- "Gwacheon."
- Seoul!

1160
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,000
- Brooklyn.
- Yes!

1161
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,000
- I threw them away.
- That's so harsh.

1162
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I mean...

1163
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,040
- Sorry, Gwacheon and Seoul.
- It's in his heart!

1164
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,140
- I'll leave Yeoju, at least.
- We love that.

1165
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:00,540
It's my father's hometown, after all.

1166
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,739
He left Yeoju in his heart.

1167
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:02,739
(I can't throw away Yeoju.)

1168
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:05,250
If I'm ever in New York
and get into a fight,

1169
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,480
I'm calling you.

1170
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,779
He's going to call them
if he gets into a fight!

1171
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,850
- Yes!
- We've got your back.

1172
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,879
How trustworthy.

1173
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:12,319
If I run into a problem in New York,

1174
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,759
I'll say,
"You don't know the Cooper Family?"

1175
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,020
- Yes. We're pulling up!
- Call us.

1176
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,160
- Okay. I'm a gangster!
- You're family now.

1177
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,629
- "Gangster."
- I'm a gangster.

1178
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,399
They've actually become one.

1179
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:24,700
Be careful with that.

1180
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,469
You know what being a gangster is, right?

1181
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:29,439
It's taking care of your family
and doing the right thing...

1182
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:31,310
for your community.
That's what a gangster is.

1183
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,739
I care very much about my mother.

1184
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:36,310
My mother and my family.

1185
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,879
There you go.
That's what makes you a gangster.

1186
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:39,450
He has his approval.

1187
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,649
- He's Gangster84 now.
- Exactly.

1188
00:45:41,649 --> 00:45:43,419
- Gangster.
- That's what a gangster is.

1189
00:45:43,419 --> 00:45:44,419
I'm going.

1190
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:46,750
Don't cry.

1191
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,290
- Gosh.
- He doesn't want to go.

1192
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,859
All right, brother.

1193
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:53,629
- I wish you good luck.
- Thank you.

1194
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:56,029
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1195
00:45:56,029 --> 00:45:59,669
Mother, stay healthy.

1196
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:01,469
He pronounced that weirdly.

1197
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:04,140
See you in my next life!

1198
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,210
"My next life?"

1199
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,969
His next life?

1200
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,210
(That's like announcing
never to see each other again.)

1201
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,509
"See you in my next life?"

1202
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:15,080
I called them family and told them
that we'd meet in the next life.

1203
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,180
"See you in my next life."

1204
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,989
I'm sure they understood.
That was so funny.

1205
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:20,020
I hope so.

1206
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:23,120
See you in my next life!

1207
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,330
- Yes.
- Bye!

1208
00:46:27,129 --> 00:46:28,700
It's a short trip,

1209
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,200
and we're running out of time.

1210
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,370
I'm so grateful...

1211
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,239
for helping me feel a sense of belonging,

1212
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:39,069
but I also felt so shameless.

1213
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:42,279
They were born...

1214
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:43,609
and raised there,

1215
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:47,109
and they let me join their family...

1216
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:50,279
only after one day of experiencing it.

1217
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,620
I felt shameless,

1218
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,390
but also thankful for telling me that.

1219
00:46:56,489 --> 00:46:59,089
They must also cherish that moment.

1220
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,759
They meant it because you meant it.

1221
00:47:01,759 --> 00:47:02,830
Exactly.

1222
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:03,899
(The Cooper Family was sincere
only because Kian84 was sincere.)

1223
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:07,430
They've shown me their actual lives,

1224
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:08,899
and I thank them for that.

1225
00:47:08,899 --> 00:47:10,370
I can still remember...

1226
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,669
the smell of their sofa
when I went to their place.

1227
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:17,109
Those little moments had zero sloppiness.

1228
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:19,680
It was the essence of life.

1229
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,850
It was real hip-hop.

1230
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:25,290
Their life itself was hip-hop.

1231
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:26,850
(Real hip-hop was living
the life of hip-hop.)

1232
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,719
Hip-hop was their life.

1233
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:31,660
(The Cooper Family showed him
what true hip-hop was.)

1234
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:34,629
- Kian84, we appreciate you for even...
- What?

1235
00:47:34,629 --> 00:47:36,660
- understanding the world of hip-hop.
- They even interviewed them.

1236
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,370
- A video letter.
- You came here...

1237
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:41,370
on your own and decided to get...

1238
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,770
the real groundwork.

1239
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,040
- So, we really appreciate it.
- They're thanking you.

1240
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,609
Always practice, always write,

1241
00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:51,450
show humility, and show grace.

1242
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,080
Don't focus on anyone else.

1243
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:55,549
Focus on your craft.

1244
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:58,489
So, Ki, thank you for coming out.

1245
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,359
Thank you for coming to be a part
of what we have going on.

1246
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,759
Thank you for even stepping foot...

1247
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,529
in the cypher, having the courage to rap.

1248
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:09,629
That's big.
There aren't a lot of people...

1249
00:48:09,629 --> 00:48:11,299
- that live in the States...
- That's insane.

1250
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:14,000
that have the confidence enough
to do what you did.

1251
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:15,739
So, shoutout to you.

1252
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:19,410
You've got my full support.
From VSOP SITY.

1253
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,839
You already know what it is.
Shoutout to Ki.

1254
00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:23,040
Yes.

1255
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:24,980
"Ki."

1256
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,750
You wouldn't have had this connection
if you hadn't taken the courage...

1257
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,850
- to start rapping.
- I had no idea they did that.

1258
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,419
- If he hadn't...
- That's true.

1259
00:48:32,419 --> 00:48:33,450
- I'm so thankful.
- Right?

1260
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,790
I had no idea.

1261
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:36,989
- It's touching.
- Yes.

1262
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:37,989
You should say something to him back.

1263
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:39,790
- A reply.
- Thank you.

1264
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,629
Thank you. How are you?

1265
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,600
VSOP, Bing Nation, and Toox,
always stay healthy.

1266
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:52,609
I hope you keep making music that you love
and live a life...

1267
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:55,040
of protecting your family.

1268
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,250
I sincerely support you.

1269
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,480
I wish you good luck.

1270
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,890
Goodness. That was wholesome.

1271
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,250
Yes. It moves my heart.

1272
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,759
I feel like I should go to Brooklyn
on national holidays now.

1273
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,489
- That's going to take a long time.
- I'm in trouble now.

1274
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:14,259
- You need to visit every one of them.
- Yes.

1275
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,330
I'd feel safe coming to Brooklyn now.

1276
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:24,770
For I am the Cooper Family.

1277
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:32,109
Cooper, thank you.

1278
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:33,310
(Thank you, family!)

1279
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,850
I should buy some water.

1280
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,680
Brooklyn.

1281
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,350
Cooper Family.

1282
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,960
It was so loud and crowded, and then...

1283
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,160
Mother.

1284
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:46,460
(The family members still linger
in his mind.)

1285
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,029
The lingering feeling won't fade.

1286
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,299
He's still thinking about them.

1287
00:49:52,299 --> 00:49:57,299
(He arrives at a supermarket
with lingering feelings.)

1288
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:58,969
Every time,

1289
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,649
I'm thankful, and I feel shameless.

1290
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:08,520
I felt sorry...

1291
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,980
for becoming their family and leaving.
It was so short.

1292
00:50:12,149 --> 00:50:13,250
What a shame.

1293
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:15,890
(Buying a bottle of water
to console himself)

1294
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:16,890
I'll just buy water.

1295
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,560
(Buying a bottle of water
to console himself)

1296
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,000
- That will be 1.67 dollars.
- It's 1.67 dollars.

1297
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:27,299
Could you ring this up for me too?
Thank you.

1298
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:28,899
For both of us.

1299
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,040
(Okay.)

1300
00:50:32,939 --> 00:50:34,469
- He's...
- No way.

1301
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:36,109
(Who popped up and surprised Kian84?)

1302
00:50:36,109 --> 00:50:37,710
- He was paying, and...
- What is this?

1303
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,379
(Yoo Teo)

1304
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,480
(He made a surprise appearance.)

1305
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:46,520
How did he show up like that?

1306
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,790
You scared me.

1307
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,419
(An actor born in Korea
and raised in Germany)

1308
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,589
(The global star
that captivated the whole world)

1309
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:53,859
- He's so good-looking.
- So cool.

1310
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,799
- He's sexy.
- Totally.

1311
00:50:56,129 --> 00:50:57,129
(Hi)

1312
00:50:57,129 --> 00:51:00,029
(And a man of youthful innocence)

1313
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,299
(But a little whimsical at the same time)

1314
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,810
- Teo is finally here.
- Finally.

1315
00:51:07,009 --> 00:51:08,279
- Hi!
- He's here.

1316
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:10,140
Nice to meet you.

1317
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:11,379
That's their first encounter, right?

1318
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:13,580
We just met, and we have to fight.

1319
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:17,480
(Their first encounter caught him
off guard.)

1320
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,120
(Panting)

1321
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,219
(Screaming)

1322
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:21,489
You said I was going there to make music.

1323
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:22,489
(Breathing heavily)

1324
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,330
(First encounters are always hard.)

1325
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,359
As soon as they met...

1326
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:28,029
(Panting)

1327
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,060
- Nice to meet you, Teo.
- What's that?

1328
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,169
- Nice to meet you.
- Sure.

1329
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:35,370
- You can drop the honorifics.
- Can I?

1330
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:37,069
- Sure.
- Is it American culture?

1331
00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:38,069
Of course.

1332
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:39,910
You had lived in New York, right?

1333
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:41,939
Yes. I lived there for about seven years.

1334
00:51:41,939 --> 00:51:42,939
(Teo had lived in New York for 7 years.)

1335
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,980
I've always had people tell me
that I was different.

1336
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,279
Like, "You're weird."

1337
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,719
I'm the same.

1338
00:51:48,879 --> 00:51:51,250
They said that my blood type was AB,
I was whimsical,

1339
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,219
- Right.
- and I was a little strange.

1340
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,089
I never got along with other people.
I usually hung out by myself...

1341
00:51:56,089 --> 00:51:57,419
- or...
- You hung out by yourself?

1342
00:51:57,419 --> 00:51:58,430
Yes.

1343
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,430
(The two have a lot in common.)

1344
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:00,890
That's pretty honest.

1345
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:02,299
They must be on the same page.

1346
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:04,629
What do you think about me?

1347
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:06,669
- I feel comfortable.
- Do you?

1348
00:52:06,669 --> 00:52:08,540
Yes. Because you're your own man.

1349
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,169
Okay. So, I'll just say it
without worries.

1350
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,739
- All right.
- Sure. I'd like that.

1351
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:15,609
(What do you want to tell me?)

1352
00:52:16,379 --> 00:52:17,739
You look a little stupid.

1353
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:19,009
Yes, I get that a lot.

1354
00:52:19,009 --> 00:52:20,210
(Nonchalant)

1355
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,750
(How will the trip
of the two lookalikes be?)

1356
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,290
I can't wait to watch their trip.

1357
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,419
(And at Incheon International Airport
not long after)

1358
00:52:28,419 --> 00:52:30,719
So, it starts when I receive this?

1359
00:52:31,689 --> 00:52:33,629
- Kian84.
- It's the beginning of Teo TV.

1360
00:52:33,629 --> 00:52:37,200
I hope the trip inspires me,
and we inspire each other...

1361
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,600
as we spend time together.
I'll see you there.

1362
00:52:42,069 --> 00:52:46,609
(From Incheon to New York)

1363
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,439
I've arrived in New York.

1364
00:52:49,439 --> 00:52:50,439
(Teo arrives in New York.)

1365
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:53,180
Coming to the US,

1366
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:55,450
it makes me nervous.

1367
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,750
To save money,

1368
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,149
I'll take the subway.

1369
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:05,359
(He frugally arrives in Brooklyn.)

1370
00:53:06,689 --> 00:53:08,700
(The younger one was enjoying
the wild block party.)

1371
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,859
Oh, he arrived at that time.

1372
00:53:09,859 --> 00:53:12,529
(The younger one was enjoying
the wild block party.)

1373
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,839
(And the older one had
a wild party by himself.)

1374
00:53:16,669 --> 00:53:20,469
(Kian84 entered the supermarket,)

1375
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:23,640
(and he snuck in right after.)

1376
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,509
Oh, that's when you came.

1377
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:30,319
Could you ring this up for me too?
Thank you.

1378
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,549
It was so dramatic.

1379
00:53:31,549 --> 00:53:33,120
(That's how Teo made a surprise entrance.)

1380
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,819
Come on, Teo.

1381
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,390
First, give me the money.

1382
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:40,089
"Give me the money."

1383
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:41,560
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

1384
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,330
When did you get here?

1385
00:53:44,129 --> 00:53:45,870
I just got here today.

1386
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:48,100
Was it when you texted me earlier?

1387
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,200
Yes, I was already here.

1388
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,540
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

1389
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:54,569
Let's get going.

1390
00:53:54,569 --> 00:53:56,080
- I'll take that.
- That's fine.

1391
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,480
(They head back to the dorm as it's late.)

1392
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,810
I've always wanted to run in Central Park.

1393
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:03,379
- Have you visited Central Park?
- Yes.

1394
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:06,950
But I didn't get to see most of it.
Just a little.

1395
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:08,219
Excuse me.

1396
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:12,460
Can I have one more person
stay in my room for a day?

1397
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,930
- Okay.
- Yes.

1398
00:54:14,189 --> 00:54:16,399
That's going to be another 74.36 dollars.

1399
00:54:16,399 --> 00:54:17,399
Okay.

1400
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,700
He's confident.

1401
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,930
Seventy-four.

1402
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,299
(Thinking)

1403
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:24,770
(Paying with confidence)

1404
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:28,939
That's 50 dollars.

1405
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,180
That's 50?

1406
00:54:31,009 --> 00:54:32,680
I gave him 50 dollars.

1407
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,680
(He gave himself a discount.)

1408
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:35,620
So, I can give you 75, right?

1409
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,149
(Teo pays the rest.)

1410
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,819
Why did I hear 45?

1411
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:41,549
The trip is going to be far easier,
thanks to Teo.

1412
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:43,919
He's almost a local, so...

1413
00:54:45,129 --> 00:54:46,330
- Thank you.
- Okay. Thanks.

1414
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:47,330
Thank you.

1415
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:49,330
(He safely checks in,
thanks to the reliable brother.)

1416
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:56,270
- This is small.
- Celebration? Welcome.

1417
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:58,069
(He meant to say, "Welcome.")

1418
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:59,640
You can use this bed.

1419
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,640
- No, I'll take this one.
- Come on.

1420
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,210
- No, I want this one.
- No.

1421
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,680
I like corners.

1422
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,680
(He lets the younger one
have the larger bed.)

1423
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,450
What have you been up to?

1424
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:12,649
I thought about bringing an instrument
to this place,

1425
00:55:12,649 --> 00:55:16,359
so I brought a guitar.

1426
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:18,120
- Where's the guitar?
- In the bag.

1427
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,529
- It's an assembly guitar kit.
- Okay.

1428
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:22,529
I'll show you.

1429
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:23,660
(He carried the assembly guitar
on his back.)

1430
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,529
It's been 3 to 4 years
since I last touched the guitar.

1431
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,100
I bought an assembling one.

1432
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,439
I've never seen an assembling one before.

1433
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,540
You said that it had been three years
since you last played it.

1434
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,339
I'll be actually mad
if you're good at playing it.

1435
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,310
I have a feeling you'll be good.
Have you played it for a long time?

1436
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:40,480
I've been playing it a little
since I was a teenager.

1437
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,609
- Then...
- Occasionally.

1438
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,850
You're practically a musician.

1439
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,950
The most basic chords.

1440
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,189
(Grinning)

1441
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,689
He can even play the guitar well?

1442
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:51,890
(Playing it smoothly)

1443
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,160
He said it's been three years, but...

1444
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,859
(He's this good
when his skills have gotten rusty.)

1445
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,270
You're already pretty good.

1446
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,569
You have an enthusiasm for music.

1447
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:03,169
Yes, a little.

1448
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,410
(He's an actor,
but he's also serious about music.)

1449
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,109
(He can dance, and...)

1450
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,250
(Delicious.)

1451
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,279
What's wrong with me?

1452
00:56:16,279 --> 00:56:17,750
This is going to be richer.

1453
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,750
(An all-rounder
who also has boyish charms)

1454
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,750
You should have been there.

1455
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,859
You should have joined the Cooper Family.

1456
00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:26,859
(He feels bad that Teo couldn't join him.)

1457
00:56:27,089 --> 00:56:28,399
Do you like to run?

1458
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,160
- I want to run with you.
- Okay.

1459
00:56:31,259 --> 00:56:33,899
It costs money to go to a gym,
so let's work out at Central Park.

1460
00:56:33,899 --> 00:56:35,770
- At Central Park,
- I'd like that.

1461
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:36,939
we'll lightly jog.

1462
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:38,270
Is there anything you want to do?

1463
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,609
You know New York well.
You're a New Yorker.

1464
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:43,439
It's going to be so crowded tomorrow...

1465
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,279
because it's the Fourth of July.

1466
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:47,149
- That's a national holiday, right?
- Yes.

1467
00:56:47,149 --> 00:56:50,819
I'll follow the plan
that you have in mind tomorrow.

1468
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,049
- Okay.
- You should get some rest, then.

1469
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:54,049
Sure.

1470
00:56:54,589 --> 00:56:56,819
Did you attend an art school in New York?

1471
00:56:56,819 --> 00:56:59,230
Yes. It was an acting school.

1472
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,330
You've heard of method acting, right?

1473
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,859
People often talk about it.

1474
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,200
So, I got the chance to go to that hotel.

1475
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,469
Have you seen that movie?

1476
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:08,439
That led to another occasion,
and I went to Japan.

1477
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,569
Blues is music that contains resentment.

1478
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:13,739
It's music for cartoonists.

1479
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:15,879
That's what I want to say.

1480
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,609
Their conversation keeps going!

1481
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:20,250
I listened to his whole life story
that night.

1482
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,620
It was like a whole epic.

1483
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:24,219
We talked for over an hour before bed.

1484
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,919
Strangely enough,
we connected well in conversation.

1485
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:28,989
This is fun.

1486
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:31,830
I've always wanted to spend time
like this.

1487
00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:33,560
I've never...

1488
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:39,169
communicated this well
with other people before.

1489
00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:43,040
It's interesting
that we're connecting so well.

1490
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,040
It's over
once you have good communication.

1491
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,680
Our trip is going to be
a whole lot more interesting.

1492
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:55,080
- Right.
- I can't wait.

1493
00:57:55,279 --> 00:57:56,279
I'm excited.

1494
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,189
(The morning of Independence Day
dawns in New York.)

1495
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,390
Independence Day.

1496
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:07,160
I feel like there are going to be
so many events.

1497
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,529
(It's vigorous in the streets of Brooklyn
on a holiday.)

1498
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:09,899
That's New York.

1499
00:58:10,259 --> 00:58:11,830
It's starting to look like New York.

1500
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:14,029
(People taking a walk)

1501
00:58:14,029 --> 00:58:15,500
Look at all those puppies.

1502
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:18,770
- Did you sleep well?
- Did you?

1503
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,310
I slept like a baby.

1504
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,640
My body feels heavy.

1505
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:23,839
(Arms)

1506
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:24,839
(Teo stretches thoroughly.)

1507
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:25,850
(Soles)

1508
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,009
Is that a foam roller?

1509
00:58:27,009 --> 00:58:28,950
He uses that for an hour every morning.

1510
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,520
(How does Kian84, the marathoner,
prepare for it?)

1511
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,350
Goodness.

1512
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,390
(Wearing the socks and clothes...)

1513
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,259
(that he wore yesterday)

1514
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,129
(So cool)

1515
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:40,930
Shall we get going?

1516
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,100
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1517
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:46,270
It feels pretty good to go for a run
in the morning. I'm excited.

1518
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,600
Let's go slowly.

1519
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,069
Do you usually run a lot?

1520
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,839
He said all his joints wore out
for playing basketball for so long.

1521
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,270
Because he played so hard.

1522
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,540
(Kian84 answers for Teo
as he knows him well.)

1523
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,379
(Their first event)

1524
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:00,680
(A healthy run in New York)

1525
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,549
A lot of people dream
of running in New York.

1526
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:08,189
Running in foreign countries is
pretty cool.

1527
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,899
Along the walls with graffiti...

1528
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,569
(The dreamlike run in Brooklyn
even has the perfect background.)

1529
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,140
- Good.
- Good?

1530
00:59:26,439 --> 00:59:27,439
Good.

1531
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,279
There's the park.

1532
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,140
It's the park.

1533
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:33,549
(Their destination is
right in front of them.)

1534
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:35,580
Let's get our heart rate up
by getting to the playground.

1535
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,980
- Okay. Sprint?
- In 1, 2, 3.

1536
00:59:37,219 --> 00:59:38,219
They're sprinting.

1537
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:39,250
(The last spurt)

1538
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,719
All right. Get your heart rate up.

1539
00:59:41,489 --> 00:59:42,489
Pick up the pace.

1540
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:45,290
Kian84 is a marathoner, after all.

1541
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

1542
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,730
(They sprint...)

1543
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,930
(and finish the morning run.)

1544
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,640
(Soaking wet)

1545
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:58,609
(Taking his socks off)

1546
00:59:58,609 --> 00:59:59,669
Is there water?

1547
00:59:59,669 --> 01:00:00,770
(Where is he drawn to?)

1548
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:02,839
(The fountain in the playground)

1549
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:05,480
- It was summer...
- He turned into a child.

1550
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,149
in New York at the time.

1551
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:10,319
(Going in)

1552
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,350
What's he doing?

1553
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,750
(Surprised)

1554
01:00:15,759 --> 01:00:17,290
(Gargling)

1555
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:18,560
(Gulping)

1556
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,560
What did you...

1557
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,560
(He swallowed it.)

1558
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,359
Is it okay to drink that water?

1559
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,930
It's like Arisu in Seoul.

1560
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:27,469
That's refreshing.

1561
01:00:28,069 --> 01:00:29,069
This is great.

1562
01:00:29,399 --> 01:00:30,700
Why are there two Kian84s?

1563
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:32,439
So refreshing.

1564
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,239
(Groaning)

1565
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:39,879
- What?
- Goodness!

1566
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:40,910
- What is he doing?
- It's a b-boy.

1567
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,020
How did he do that?

1568
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,080
(Falling)

1569
01:00:43,919 --> 01:00:45,350
(Rolling)

1570
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:46,489
What is he doing?

1571
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:48,989
It's yoga.

1572
01:00:48,989 --> 01:00:50,819
I learned how to do yoga in India.

1573
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,189
On this filthy ground?

1574
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,529
(Filth doesn't bother me.)

1575
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,700
- Standing on your head?
- That's what I learned. It was tough.

1576
01:00:59,799 --> 01:01:01,770
(He takes a deep breath.)

1577
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:03,600
I'm supposed to take my feet off.

1578
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,739
Be careful!

1579
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:06,739
- Goodness.
- They're off.

1580
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,279
(Yoga84 has done it.)

1581
01:01:09,279 --> 01:01:10,279
Okay.

1582
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,580
(Hydrating again)

1583
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:16,350
That's Teo81.

1584
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,450
He said it was filthy.

1585
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:20,989
(But you said the ground was filthy.)

1586
01:01:21,549 --> 01:01:23,489
I wanted to try it out
since he was doing it.

1587
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,460
You two are the same.

1588
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,660
I'm scared to straighten my legs.

1589
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,259
(They both showed off their yoga skills.)

1590
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,600
(They finished the morning workout.)

1591
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,669
They're even sitting the same way.

1592
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,969
I think I've had enough.

1593
01:01:39,069 --> 01:01:40,140
- Is that enough?
- Yes.

1594
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:42,680
Where else should we go in New York?

1595
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,180
I want to check out
the Empire Steak Building too.

1596
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:47,379
- The Empire State Building.
- The Empire State Building.

1597
01:01:47,379 --> 01:01:49,719
The instrument shops are on 14th Street,

1598
01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:53,120
so we'll think about where to go
after getting inspiration there.

1599
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:57,259
(His nose is running.)

1600
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:00,730
Everyone said that you were so jacked...

1601
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,960
when I told them I was going with you.

1602
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,430
(Getting it for him)

1603
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,270
(Oh, my)

1604
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:10,399
I actually felt burdened to help Kian84...

1605
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:12,509
experience things.

1606
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:15,779
I've experienced New York...

1607
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:18,439
more than him.

1608
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:22,009
There's Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan,

1609
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:23,850
and there are a lot of artists.

1610
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:26,049
There was a famous music store...

1611
01:02:26,049 --> 01:02:29,120
- that's been around since the 1960s.
- I love that.

1612
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:32,560
I heard that many well-known musicians...

1613
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,430
frequented the place.

1614
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,859
He put a lot of effort
into helping you be inspired.

1615
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,870
Let's go to the instrument shop first.

1616
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:41,930
Yes, let's do that.

1617
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,000
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1618
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,370
(To the instrument store
for musical inspiration)

1619
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:45,810
That was a perfect workout.

1620
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,810
(They return to the dorm to wash up.)

1621
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,879
(Sweaty)

1622
01:02:51,879 --> 01:02:52,910
Gosh.

1623
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:55,950
He's so thick.

1624
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:00,020
(He takes a refreshing shower first.)

1625
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:02,189
(After freshening up,)

1626
01:03:02,189 --> 01:03:03,259
That feels good.

1627
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:04,419
(they head to the instrument store.)

1628
01:03:04,419 --> 01:03:05,460
Let's get going.

1629
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:08,460
It's ten in the morning?

1630
01:03:08,759 --> 01:03:09,960
It's hot.

1631
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:12,930
- Hold on. We should take the subway.
- Yes.

1632
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,669
- It's right nearby.
- Is it?

1633
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:15,939
It said it was seven minutes away.

1634
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,839
(He's gotten used to these streets
in 3 days now.)

1635
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:21,640
An American subway station.

1636
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,680
(Arriving at the American subway station)

1637
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:27,680
(Sitting right next to Teo)

1638
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,680
You look relaxed.

1639
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,649
I felt reassured to have him there.

1640
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:33,890
Man, I'm tired.

1641
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:36,160
- Are you tired?
- I'll take a short nap.

1642
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:37,790
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.

1643
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:39,330
Maybe he worked out too hard.

1644
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:41,759
(Checking if he's still alive)

1645
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:44,100
(Taking a deep nap
next to the trustworthy brother)

1646
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,870
(Bored)

1647
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:52,939
(Looking over)

1648
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:54,939
(I'm not lonely as long as I have Teo TV.)

1649
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:57,739
- He's quite playful.
- He has fun by himself.

1650
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,379
(While Teo is doing cute tricks,
Kian84 is sound asleep.)

1651
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,080
- Goodness.
- He's deep asleep.

1652
01:04:04,879 --> 01:04:05,950
(They took the subway
for about 40 minutes.)

1653
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:08,290
You had to cross the bridge.

1654
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:11,060
All right!

1655
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,759
(Arriving with a warm welcome)

1656
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:13,759
Let's go.

1657
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,669
(They climb up for a while.)

1658
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,739
- Gosh.
- There. There's 34th Street.

1659
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:24,469
- Look. Awesome.
- The Empire State Building.

1660
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:26,939
- The Empire State Building.
- The Empire State Building?

1661
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:29,140
(You can clearly see the skyscraper
from a distance.)

1662
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:31,540
(The most well-known landmark in New York)

1663
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:33,379
(Where the Empire State Building is)

1664
01:04:33,379 --> 01:04:34,450
Now, that's New York.

1665
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,919
Located at the very center of New York,

1666
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,779
Manhattan is known as the heart
of New York...

1667
01:04:38,779 --> 01:04:40,450
and serves as the world's hub
for economy and culture.

1668
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:44,390
It is home of the world-renowned
tourist attractions such as Times Square,

1669
01:04:44,689 --> 01:04:48,359
the Empire State Building,
and Central Park,

1670
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:50,629
making it the most familiar area
for most travelers...

1671
01:04:50,629 --> 01:04:52,100
visiting New York.

1672
01:04:53,399 --> 01:04:55,569
Bampari Steak Building.

1673
01:04:55,569 --> 01:04:56,600
"Steak Building."

1674
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,109
He always says, "Steak."

1675
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:01,169
It also feels different here.

1676
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,779
Yes, it's called the West Village.

1677
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,680
- It's an area for artists.
- Artists.

1678
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,879
Since the 1960s,

1679
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,819
blues and folk musicians...

1680
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,750
have emerged in that area.

1681
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,290
It's a paradise for artists.

1682
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,790
And the music store... Here it is.

1683
01:05:17,919 --> 01:05:20,989
"Music Inn?" Is that an employee?

1684
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,629
What?

1685
01:05:22,629 --> 01:05:25,230
There are many musicians
busking in front of the store.

1686
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,129
(I see.)

1687
01:05:27,669 --> 01:05:31,299
Isn't that the place that's on the poster
of Music Adventure by Accident?

1688
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:32,370
- Yes, that's the one.
- Yes.

1689
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:34,069
That looks good.

1690
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,140
Shall we go in?

1691
01:05:36,739 --> 01:05:38,210
(What's this place
that looks mysterious from the entrance?)

1692
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,480
It'd be nice just to look around.

1693
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,210
(Amazed)

1694
01:05:42,779 --> 01:05:44,279
(Thousands of instruments)

1695
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:45,319
That's nice.

1696
01:05:46,649 --> 01:05:49,460
(Musical instruments
from all over the world)

1697
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,489
That's fascinating.

1698
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:52,290
(And collections of vinyl records)

1699
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,930
(A place marked by the passage of time
since 1958)

1700
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:55,799
It shows you the history of music.

1701
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,000
(The younger one can't take his eyes off.)

1702
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:00,969
(The older one is proud.)

1703
01:06:00,969 --> 01:06:01,969
I love that.

1704
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,569
- Hi.
- Hello.

1705
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,870
We're here to check out your store...

1706
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:09,879
because we heard
so many wonderful things about it.

1707
01:06:09,879 --> 01:06:11,939
- Welcome.
- Yes? Thank you.

1708
01:06:11,939 --> 01:06:15,009
Were there a lot of famous musicians
that came to visit?

1709
01:06:15,049 --> 01:06:16,180
John Lennon.

1710
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:19,049
- John Lennon of the Beatles? Here?
- Yes.

1711
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:20,390
Many times.

1712
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:22,489
(The legendary musician, John Lennon)

1713
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,259
- And Bob Dylan.
- Bob Dylan? Here?

1714
01:06:26,259 --> 01:06:27,330
Many times.

1715
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,960
(And the king of folk, Bob Dylan)

1716
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,299
It's like a shrine.

1717
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:31,960
Paul Simon.

1718
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,270
- Paul Simon.
- Paul Simon?

1719
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,739
Paul Simon was a member
of a famous band...

1720
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:37,299
called Simon and Garfunkel.

1721
01:06:37,299 --> 01:06:38,640
I know Simon Dominic.

1722
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,969
(All I know is Simon Dominic.)

1723
01:06:40,969 --> 01:06:42,509
(My pal, Simon Dominic)

1724
01:06:42,509 --> 01:06:44,939
- Your love for Simon.
- Kian84.

1725
01:06:44,939 --> 01:06:46,009
I love you.

1726
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,049
To me, Simon Dominic is the best.

1727
01:06:48,049 --> 01:06:49,379
I love you.

1728
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,719
What kind of instrument
are you looking for?

1729
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,489
We're looking for something for him,

1730
01:06:54,489 --> 01:06:56,819
and he doesn't know
what he wants to play yet.

1731
01:06:57,219 --> 01:06:58,859
I thought I should buy
a small instrument while I was there.

1732
01:06:58,859 --> 01:06:59,930
- Right.
- Just one.

1733
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,560
- There should be good energy too.
- Right.

1734
01:07:02,859 --> 01:07:04,359
What did you play in the past?

1735
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:07,200
I played the castanets.

1736
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,600
- Castanets.
- Castanets?

1737
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,500
Castanets and the triangle.

1738
01:07:10,969 --> 01:07:12,410
- The triangle?
- Yes.

1739
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,540
- The ones we played in school.
- The recorder.

1740
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,980
- Recorder?
- Recorder.

1741
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,649
They're what we played back in
middle school and elementary school.

1742
01:07:19,649 --> 01:07:21,980
- I see...
- Is there anything else?

1743
01:07:22,379 --> 01:07:23,379
Right.

1744
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:24,980
That's a tough assignment for the owner.

1745
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:28,989
How about the kalimba?

1746
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,520
- Kalimba?
- Kalimba?

1747
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,589
- Where is the kalimba?
- It's downstairs.

1748
01:07:33,589 --> 01:07:34,689
- Downstairs? Okay.
- Downstairs?

1749
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,330
- They must be a basement.
- It's huge.

1750
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,330
(They go to the basement floor,
looking for the instrument.)

1751
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,230
- Gosh.
- Look.

1752
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:42,000
They have congas and bongos too.

1753
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,299
There were so many instruments
that I had never seen before.

1754
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:45,339
(The basement is also filled
with instruments from all over the world.)

1755
01:07:45,669 --> 01:07:47,540
Oh, that's the kalimba.

1756
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,040
Kalimba!

1757
01:07:49,509 --> 01:07:50,810
(I see!)

1758
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,339
- Do you want to try it?
- Yes.

1759
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,480
(Dinging)

1760
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:57,450
Kalimba?

1761
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,689
- It sounds mysterious.
- Yes.

1762
01:08:00,919 --> 01:08:02,089
Let's check out other instruments too.

1763
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,660
- They had that too?
- What is it?

1764
01:08:07,089 --> 01:08:09,129
- My love, the toad.
- What is it?

1765
01:08:09,629 --> 01:08:11,830
The toad is known
to bring you luck and wealth.

1766
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,500
What is it?

1767
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,200
Toad, look after me.

1768
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,899
(The toad-shaped percussion was
his favorite.)

1769
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:21,410
Apparently, scratching its back
brings you luck.

1770
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:22,879
Really?

1771
01:08:23,509 --> 01:08:24,810
- I love this.
- Do you?

1772
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:27,180
- Yes.
- You could use that for sound effects.

1773
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:32,180
(He's being cautious
before making a final decision to buy.)

1774
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:34,890
What the store owner told me was
exactly right.

1775
01:08:36,419 --> 01:08:37,719
I think I should buy this one.

1776
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:38,919
(He finally buys the kalimba
that the owner recommended.)

1777
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:41,489
For my boy Pani Bottle...

1778
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,660
I will buy the 75-dollar one
for you as well.

1779
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,500
That was for Pani Bottle.

1780
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,529
It's also a type of drum.

1781
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:48,069
Who's the child you play with?

1782
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:49,140
(He pays for the instruments
he carefully chose.)

1783
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,710
It's 150 dollars in total.

1784
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:53,770
Yes, I got it.

1785
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:56,109
- It's 150 dollars.
- Yes, it's 150 dollars.

1786
01:08:56,109 --> 01:08:57,140
(The kalimba: 75 dollars,
The paper drum: 75 dollars)

1787
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,609
- Thank you, Jeff.
- Thank you.

1788
01:08:58,609 --> 01:08:59,750
- Thank you, Jeff.
- Thanks.

1789
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:01,580
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1790
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,480
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Oh, yes.

1791
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,319
Good luck in your life.

1792
01:09:05,989 --> 01:09:07,049
Let's go, Teo!

1793
01:09:07,049 --> 01:09:08,049
(Thanks to Teo, he got his instrument!)

1794
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:09,960
Pani Bottle will love this, right?

1795
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,759
Yes, for sure.

1796
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:16,960
I usually don't look for details
before purchasing those things...

1797
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,929
and don't search either.

1798
01:09:18,929 --> 01:09:20,370
Without him,
I wouldn't have bought such things.

1799
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:22,569
It's really like the "Music Adventure."

1800
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:25,439
(The New York Brothers hit
the road again.)

1801
01:09:25,769 --> 01:09:27,109
(Where should we go?)

1802
01:09:29,179 --> 01:09:31,179
What about going to Times Square?

1803
01:09:31,179 --> 01:09:32,649
I've never been there before.

1804
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:34,380
I never thought
I would see Times Square in this show.

1805
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,220
I had never thought of that day's plan...

1806
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:39,389
- apart from visiting the music shop.
- Seriously?

1807
01:09:39,389 --> 01:09:41,989
He's never been there before,

1808
01:09:41,989 --> 01:09:43,019
He meant it.

1809
01:09:43,019 --> 01:09:45,359
so I thought it was a good idea.

1810
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,229
- Yes, it's worth visiting at least once.
- Why not?

1811
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:49,859
We had a quality time,
so I will take the lead.

1812
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:51,160
Whatever is okay with me.

1813
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,470
I usually don't like being a tourist,

1814
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,529
but today...

1815
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,170
He finally goes to a tourist place!

1816
01:09:58,470 --> 01:09:59,809
He's kind of twitching now.

1817
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:01,710
(Twitching)

1818
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:03,779
Have you been here a few times before?

1819
01:10:04,139 --> 01:10:06,050
I've lived here for seven years...

1820
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:08,050
- but only came here twice.
- You mean in the whole period?

1821
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,380
(Staring)

1822
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,649
I see something rotating over there!

1823
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,760
(It's a typical tourist spot in New York
full of splendor.)

1824
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,290
I'd be goggle-eyed if I were there.

1825
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,960
- Times Square!
- I now feel like they are in New York.

1826
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:25,830
They are literally
in the center of Times Square.

1827
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,439
- We are surrounded by advertisements!
- You're right.

1828
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:32,470
Whatever ads you imagine, there were more.

1829
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,510
(Fancy ads cover Kian84.)

1830
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:41,849
(Let me see.)

1831
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:45,420
(It's the best tourist spot
in New York...)

1832
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,920
(where so many tourists come.)

1833
01:10:48,849 --> 01:10:51,059
(He's not interested.)

1834
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,460
(Hey, you think the same?)

1835
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,160
(You too?)

1836
01:10:55,859 --> 01:10:56,899
I think we've seen enough.

1837
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,029
- It's not that fun, isn't it?
- No, it's not fun at all.

1838
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:02,170
The two are very similar.

1839
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:04,769
I knew you wouldn't like it much.

1840
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:06,670
- You wanted to go there.
- I did.

1841
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:07,670
(Feeling awkward)

1842
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:09,439
It was not enjoyable
as we've seen it so many times on TV.

1843
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:10,439
You're right.

1844
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,649
I just knew what was waiting for us.

1845
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:13,710
I felt the same way too.

1846
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:15,279
Because of you, Times Square,

1847
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,679
I won't go to the Empire State Building...

1848
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,019
and the Statue of Liberty either.

1849
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:21,889
It's all your fault, Times Square.

1850
01:11:21,889 --> 01:11:22,920
(He's just being grumpy
about Times Square.)

1851
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,590
Let's go back to our hometown.

1852
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:26,590
- Do you mean Brooklyn?
- Yes.

1853
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,660
- I got it.
- It has become his hometown now.

1854
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:30,760
This city took a lot of energy out of me.

1855
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,200
We arrived in Brooklyn again.

1856
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:38,899
This is the smell of the USA.

1857
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:41,609
- We are finally in the USA again.
- People here are...

1858
01:11:41,609 --> 01:11:43,309
- I also smell the true humanity here.
- Right.

1859
01:11:43,309 --> 01:11:44,679
Their facial expressions have changed.

1860
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:48,250
I can finally take a breath.

1861
01:11:49,149 --> 01:11:52,720
Times Square, that kind of place
for celebrities, doesn't fit me.

1862
01:11:52,849 --> 01:11:54,790
Including the famous building,
the Empire State Building.

1863
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:56,889
Full of snobs.

1864
01:11:56,889 --> 01:11:58,220
He said "full of snobs."

1865
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:59,689
That made me angry.

1866
01:11:59,689 --> 01:12:00,729
(You're surely my brother.)

1867
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:03,729
What's that?

1868
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,729
(Startled)

1869
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:09,200
(The sudden mysterious sound
made them startled.)

1870
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:11,670
- Are they alright?
- Was there an accident?

1871
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:13,970
(Getting serious)

1872
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,910
- Oh, my gosh!
- Was it a gunshot?

1873
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:18,309
(Almost panicked)

1874
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:20,410
- It was a fireworks display. It's okay.
- It scared me.

1875
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,750
- Gosh.
- Please.

1876
01:12:21,849 --> 01:12:24,019
(He swallowed nervously.)

1877
01:12:24,019 --> 01:12:25,420
Are you seriously a New Yorker?

1878
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,450
He was scared the most.

1879
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:31,819
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

1880
01:12:32,059 --> 01:12:33,590
(No one around there was scared
like them.)

1881
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:35,559
Surely, it's my hometown.

1882
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:37,630
The entire city vibe reminds me...

1883
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,470
- of that in Wolmido.
- He said Wolmido.

1884
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:41,429
It's the same fireworks display
in Wolmido.

1885
01:12:41,429 --> 01:12:43,899
- I was so scared.
- You too?

1886
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,470
What would you like for lunch?

1887
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,370
How about rice menus around here?

1888
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,979
- Are you not up for ramyeon?
- That's good.

1889
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:51,380
- We can buy some groceries in the market.
- Then...

1890
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,880
- That's cool.
- I got it.

1891
01:12:53,349 --> 01:12:54,410
A Korean supermarket!

1892
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:55,609
(They came the supermarket
they visited yesterday.)

1893
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,380
They even sell tteokbokki.

1894
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,179
- There is kimchi too.
- Oh, there's kimchi!

1895
01:12:59,179 --> 01:13:00,849
Korean products are really in now.

1896
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,359
There are different types of ramyeon!

1897
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,290
This is good!

1898
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,059
I feel so good seeing all of these.

1899
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:11,800
They all look so yummy.

1900
01:13:13,099 --> 01:13:15,029
Take some rest in the room.
I will cook for you.

1901
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:18,870
(Kian84 prepares the meal for Teo.)

1902
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,139
(First, he opens all the ingredients.)

1903
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:22,739
Okay.

1904
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:23,939
(Onions)

1905
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:26,010
(Ramyeon powder)

1906
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:27,649
Spicy!

1907
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:30,450
- Is that meat broth?
- I added a lot because it was too spicy.

1908
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,720
(Is he going well without me?)

1909
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,750
(He's fully focused,
not recognizing Teo's coming.)

1910
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:37,420
It looks yummy.

1911
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,420
(He's doing well.)

1912
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,929
- What are you doing?
- Why?

1913
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:42,029
- Oh, I didn't know you came.
- What are you doing?

1914
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,599
(The roasted chicken is
directly put in the pot.)

1915
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:45,599
I'm cooking.

1916
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,870
Do you put chickens in ramyeon?

1917
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:49,200
It's just a leg.

1918
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,439
Because it was originally a chicken dish.

1919
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:57,210
(This was originally a chicken dish.)

1920
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:59,779
Teo, just count on me!

1921
01:14:00,109 --> 01:14:02,179
- Don't say you want some more later.
- "More?"

1922
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:03,620
He just trusts him now.

1923
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:05,450
Take some rest, please.

1924
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:07,220
(He's full of confidence.)

1925
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:10,260
He has a lot to say
but keeps silent for now.

1926
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,290
(He just smiles.)

1927
01:14:14,929 --> 01:14:16,960
(The amount of topping is increasing
as Teo's doubt.)

1928
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:20,729
I also added kimchi
to make the greasy taste away.

1929
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,029
He adds a lot.

1930
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24,739
(He starts adding noodles too.)

1931
01:14:25,269 --> 01:14:26,470
(He even adds bunches of cilantro.)

1932
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,840
- Did you wash it in water?
- Of course, I did.

1933
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,540
This will be enough for now.

1934
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,540
(Full of cilantro)

1935
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:34,550
It looks so good.

1936
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:37,380
I will put it here.

1937
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,519
(Kian84's special ramyeon is complete.)

1938
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,550
It's cilantro-kimchi ramyeon.

1939
01:14:40,819 --> 01:14:43,189
It has become like fried noodles.

1940
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:44,220
(It's cilantro, chicken, onions, chili,
and kimchi ramyeon.)

1941
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,590
- Thank you for the treat.
- Sure.

1942
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:51,000
(Kian84 takes a bunch
of ramyeon noodles...)

1943
01:14:52,099 --> 01:14:53,700
(and tries it first.)

1944
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,200
(Impressed)

1945
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,899
- Is this really what I cooked?
- Does it taste good?

1946
01:14:58,769 --> 01:14:59,840
(Teo tries it too.)

1947
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,370
We need to focus on his reaction.

1948
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:03,779
(How is it, Teo?)

1949
01:15:04,309 --> 01:15:05,380
It tastes good.

1950
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,649
(It's good!)

1951
01:15:07,309 --> 01:15:08,849
(He feels relieved.)

1952
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,319
My mouth is watering again.

1953
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:12,580
(They are having a good meal time
together.)

1954
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:14,790
I feel good as you like my dish.

1955
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,720
Among all the dishes I had in the USA,

1956
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,330
- this is the best.
- I agree.

1957
01:15:21,989 --> 01:15:25,929
(They are fully trenched in ramyeon.)

1958
01:15:29,899 --> 01:15:31,769
Why did I wear white clothing?

1959
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,609
- The soup splashed in all directions.
- It all splashed?

1960
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:35,809
But dirty clothing has been
somewhat attractive recently.

1961
01:15:35,809 --> 01:15:36,809
Is that so?

1962
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:38,639
(Sorry?)

1963
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,550
(To maintain his popularity,
his clothing is dirty again today.)

1964
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:43,050
- If you are done,
- Yes?

1965
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,420
go upstairs and take a shower.

1966
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,950
And get some sleep.
I will clean things here.

1967
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:47,250
- Seriously?
- Yes, I will.

1968
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:50,359
- I'm going upstairs, then.
- Sure, please.

1969
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:51,859
Get some rest.

1970
01:15:52,519 --> 01:15:53,529
It's time to take over the role.

1971
01:15:54,189 --> 01:15:55,630
It's better to wash the dishes
immediately.

1972
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:56,660
For sure.

1973
01:15:57,859 --> 01:15:59,800
(As Teo took care of doing the dishes,
he came back to the room.)

1974
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,099
The ramyeon was amazing!

1975
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:07,170
(He takes off his clothing right away.)

1976
01:16:07,809 --> 01:16:09,639
(Slapping)

1977
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:10,639
I have a lot of belly fat.

1978
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:11,939
(He's fighting against his belly fat.)

1979
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:15,450
(Go inside, my belly!)

1980
01:16:15,849 --> 01:16:16,979
(But the belly never gives in.)

1981
01:16:16,979 --> 01:16:18,050
(Sighing)

1982
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:20,590
What's he doing?

1983
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:23,019
(He's squeezing his belly
to make a six-pack.)

1984
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:25,359
(Yes, this is it!)

1985
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,630
(Feeling satisfied, he lies down.)

1986
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:31,899
(My precious six-pack)

1987
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:33,630
(He does the last step to squeeze.)

1988
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:36,739
(One, two)

1989
01:16:37,599 --> 01:16:38,639
(Here, he also goes
for 1 and 2 movements.)

1990
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:40,210
They have a lot in common.

1991
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:42,239
(You're surely my brother.)

1992
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:43,439
It's done!

1993
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:44,439
(He finished doing the dishes
while exercising.)

1994
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,750
(He's very proud of what he's done.)

1995
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:49,779
(It's done.)

1996
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:51,080
The meal was very good.

1997
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:54,019
It was amazing.

1998
01:16:54,649 --> 01:16:57,489
It was so good!

1999
01:16:57,489 --> 01:16:58,559
Why did I do that?

2000
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,330
(He even shows his teeth, feeling good.)

2001
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,800
So fresh and so clean!

2002
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,029
You don't remember what you did, then.

2003
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:10,239
- I don't remember that.
- He doesn't!

2004
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,840
It was good!

2005
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,139
(The clean Teo comes back.)

2006
01:17:13,139 --> 01:17:14,569
- You liked the ramyeon?
- It was so good.

2007
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:15,870
What a relief!

2008
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:18,279
Let's go!

2009
01:17:18,279 --> 01:17:20,550
(It's time
to enjoy the nightlife of New York.)

2010
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,380
Gosh.

2011
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,250
So, it's time...

2012
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:28,550
- to go and watch the metal performance.
- "Metal?"

2013
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,960
- "Metal?"
- "Metal?"

2014
01:17:30,189 --> 01:17:31,960
It's heavy metal in English.

2015
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:32,989
"Heavy metal."

2016
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:36,399
- You know them?
- It's my favorite musician.

2017
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:37,929
I like metal!

2018
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:40,500
Oh, that's pretty cool. It's in Brooklyn.

2019
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,229
- Oh, they showed that.
- Yes.

2020
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:44,239
- It's a metal band.
- I see.

2021
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,040
You should go see them
if you're interested.

2022
01:17:47,309 --> 01:17:48,939
(I'm also a fan of metal!)

2023
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,510
I've never seen a performance
of a heavy metal band.

2024
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:54,080
It's my first time as well.

2025
01:17:54,179 --> 01:17:57,019
- We will see what heavy metal is.
- He will feel the energy of the metal.

2026
01:17:57,019 --> 01:17:59,479
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

2027
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,019
That looks good!

2028
01:18:02,649 --> 01:18:04,720
- Goodness.
- That looks good!

2029
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,319
There's another party.

2030
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:07,630
(Laughing)

2031
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:09,590
Everyone is enjoying a party here.

2032
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:14,670
(Just like Cooper Family's Block Party...)

2033
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,040
They're having parties
even in the sunlight.

2034
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,870
It's because that date was
the Independence Day.

2035
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:22,540
That burst up again, right?

2036
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:23,580
Yes, it did.

2037
01:18:24,109 --> 01:18:25,840
Why do they burst so often?

2038
01:18:26,309 --> 01:18:28,349
I guess they burst them on purpose
because it's summer.

2039
01:18:28,349 --> 01:18:30,179
- On purpose?
- I'm not sure.

2040
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:32,380
(The hydrant is open
in summer in reality.)

2041
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:33,389
My goodness.

2042
01:18:33,389 --> 01:18:35,489
They can open it.

2043
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:37,489
It's a Water Bomb in New York.

2044
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:39,859
It feels refreshing to look at it.

2045
01:18:39,859 --> 01:18:41,229
(With the water from the hydrant,)

2046
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:44,800
(people cool off.)

2047
01:18:45,859 --> 01:18:48,429
Look at those cars stopping
to be bathed in water.

2048
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:50,399
That's cute.

2049
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,470
They pass it by like it's a car wash.

2050
01:18:53,769 --> 01:18:54,840
It's a free car wash.

2051
01:18:55,639 --> 01:18:58,809
(The New York brothers
approach the Water Bomb.)

2052
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:03,010
The water pressure is quite strong.

2053
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:04,679
I guess it would hurt.

2054
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,450
(Ouch)

2055
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,519
(The strong pressure makes Teo run away.)

2056
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,489
(Kian84 isn't scared and strides ahead.)

2057
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,660
(It feels just right.)

2058
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,630
Here I go.

2059
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:23,069
(Screaming)

2060
01:19:28,569 --> 01:19:29,609
(He sticks his head out.)

2061
01:19:29,609 --> 01:19:30,809
I really wanted to do that.

2062
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,349
(Flat-faced)

2063
01:19:35,349 --> 01:19:36,580
The pressure is too strong.

2064
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:40,290
- It's too strong.
- Goodness.

2065
01:19:40,849 --> 01:19:42,290
It almost blew my head away.

2066
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,620
As I pushed my face ahead,

2067
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:46,830
it felt like
a straight right punch hit me.

2068
01:19:46,929 --> 01:19:47,929
"A straight right punch".

2069
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:49,189
It woke me up.

2070
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:52,630
Kian84 is a different man
whenever he sees water.

2071
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:54,870
I heard that I like water
because I have earth in my fortune.

2072
01:19:55,929 --> 01:19:57,739
I guess that's why we have good chemistry.

2073
01:19:57,739 --> 01:19:59,970
I like going to the mountains because
I have a lot of water in my fortune.

2074
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:01,739
- Do you?
- They say I need to find water.

2075
01:20:02,109 --> 01:20:03,580
Goodness, their fortunes are related.

2076
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:04,609
- Is that true, Teo?
- Yes.

2077
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,380
I hope it works out with the two of you.

2078
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,050
- I hope so too.
- What are you saying?

2079
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:11,779
You two look good together.

2080
01:20:13,319 --> 01:20:15,050
That's awesome.

2081
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,460
(The block party is in full swing.)

2082
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,790
Every block is having a party.

2083
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,300
(You should join us.)

2084
01:20:26,529 --> 01:20:28,630
(But I'm Cooper Family.)

2085
01:20:30,069 --> 01:20:31,300
Look at Teo.

2086
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,639
(Rapper 84 is loyal.)

2087
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:35,540
(Teo's dance has so much soul.)

2088
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,580
- Look at his foot moves.
- Teo is proud of his dance.

2089
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:38,710
(The New York brothers
have good chemistry.)

2090
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:41,410
(Come here, Bro.)

2091
01:20:42,279 --> 01:20:43,720
That's awesome.

2092
01:20:44,519 --> 01:20:45,920
- Shall we join them?
- Shall we?

2093
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,319
(They decide to go where the music is.)

2094
01:20:47,519 --> 01:20:48,590
What family are they?

2095
01:20:49,189 --> 01:20:50,660
- "What family are they?"
- I know.

2096
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:53,429
- "I'm Cooper Family."
- Yes, Cooper Family.

2097
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,399
- Hey, how is it going?
- Come on, Bro.

2098
01:20:58,399 --> 01:20:59,970
What's up? You're in New York, man.

2099
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,399
They're Latin American.

2100
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:05,340
It feels different from Cooper block.
It's a Latin American block.

2101
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,569
- It's a Latin American block.
- That's right.

2102
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:10,010
It's amazing. Every block consists of
different races and countries.

2103
01:21:10,779 --> 01:21:12,479
- Do you know how to dance?
- Do you know how to dance?

2104
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:14,950
- Do you know how to dance?
- Do you know how to dance?

2105
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:17,149
- Dance?
- Come on.

2106
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:18,420
Excuse me.

2107
01:21:19,179 --> 01:21:21,889
(A dance ceremony right away)

2108
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,019
Cooper, I'm sorry.

2109
01:21:24,189 --> 01:21:26,389
He says sorry to the Cooper Family.

2110
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,389
- Let's go.
- Yes.

2111
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:31,599
(I'm dancing too.)

2112
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:36,899
(A full-fledged dance party)

2113
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,309
(He gets Cooper Family
out of his head for the moment...)

2114
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:45,010
(and focuses on dancing with the lady.)

2115
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:51,920
I felt I was a traitor.

2116
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,790
They're just neighborhood residents
having a meal outside, of course.

2117
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:59,359
Still, I felt like, "I shouldn't do this."

2118
01:22:00,859 --> 01:22:03,559
(However, he can't stop shaking his body.)

2119
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,859
(Pleased)

2120
01:22:05,859 --> 01:22:08,599
- Come on!
- Come here!

2121
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:15,309
His dance moves are relaxed.

2122
01:22:15,939 --> 01:22:17,239
(An excellent turn)

2123
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,809
He's leading the lady.

2124
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,979
(In fact, this dancer...)

2125
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:24,720
What's that?

2126
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,080
- Wait.
- That's...

2127
01:22:26,349 --> 01:22:28,090
- Oh, my gosh. Where did you get this?
- Wait.

2128
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:29,389
- Were you a dancer, Teo?
- Wait a minute.

2129
01:22:29,389 --> 01:22:31,059
- That's...
- What's that?

2130
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:33,359
(A stylish wave)

2131
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:34,389
- What's that?
- Oh, my goodness.

2132
01:22:34,389 --> 01:22:35,389
He's a good dancer.

2133
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:36,389
Isn't that Park Jin Young?

2134
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:40,529
The video has a lasting impression.

2135
01:22:40,529 --> 01:22:42,630
- Him doing this.
- I know. Seung Hoon, you're good.

2136
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:45,269
- You're good, Seung Hoon.
- Nice!

2137
01:22:45,269 --> 01:22:47,069
Gosh, come on.

2138
01:22:47,069 --> 01:22:48,840
Did you learn how to dance?

2139
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,840
Did you train yourself to be an idol?

2140
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:54,149
Although I lived in Germany,

2141
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:57,080
most of my friends were immigrants,

2142
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:00,989
and I grew up in a hip-hop culture
from America.

2143
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:02,689
You absorbed it naturally.

2144
01:23:02,689 --> 01:23:06,189
Yes, and I was a breakdancer
among my friends.

2145
01:23:09,229 --> 01:23:11,229
(The former breakdancer...)

2146
01:23:11,229 --> 01:23:14,529
(is still alive.)

2147
01:23:15,569 --> 01:23:18,099
(He adapts to the rhythm quickly.)

2148
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,069
His groove is distinguished.

2149
01:23:21,069 --> 01:23:22,609
That's very nice.

2150
01:23:23,809 --> 01:23:25,809
(Dancing enthusiastically)

2151
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,080
Do like this!

2152
01:23:28,149 --> 01:23:29,649
(The former breakdancer
is good at Latin dance too.)

2153
01:23:29,649 --> 01:23:32,420
They all fell for Teo's charm.

2154
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:36,989
(What do you think about my dance?)

2155
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:39,519
(All right)

2156
01:23:41,029 --> 01:23:44,130
(Each of them is lost in dancing.)

2157
01:23:46,429 --> 01:23:47,429
Gosh, my eyes are burning.

2158
01:23:49,229 --> 01:23:50,739
The smoke is burning my eyes.

2159
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,870
The meat is burning!

2160
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:56,739
- They're busy dancing.
- The meat is burning!

2161
01:23:56,739 --> 01:23:57,910
(The burnt smell fills the air.)

2162
01:23:58,609 --> 01:23:59,880
Flip the meat!

2163
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:02,550
- Flip the meat!
- They're busy dancing.

2164
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:03,550
(It's all right.)

2165
01:24:03,649 --> 01:24:06,149
Flip the meat. It's burning.

2166
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:09,590
Is it okay that you flip the meat?

2167
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:12,090
No one was doing it.

2168
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,529
He's like a part-timer
in a barbecue restaurant.

2169
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:15,429
Who's in charge of the meat?

2170
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,529
(You're in charge.)

2171
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,460
It's burning.

2172
01:24:21,269 --> 01:24:22,529
(Smiling)

2173
01:24:22,529 --> 01:24:24,269
This is fire!

2174
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,769
- You know about that, right? Steak.
- Yes, steak.

2175
01:24:26,769 --> 01:24:28,109
- It's in a good shape.
- Yes.

2176
01:24:29,609 --> 01:24:31,340
I knew what it was, but it was burning.

2177
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:35,179
- "I knew what it was."
- It looks like LA-style ribs.

2178
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:36,179
(The pride of the whiz kid of English
is hurt.)

2179
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,620
Everyone is happy
that you're grilling the meat.

2180
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:41,989
They don't know the meat is burning
since they're busy dancing.

2181
01:24:43,389 --> 01:24:45,290
Teo, but I can't stay here long.

2182
01:24:45,389 --> 01:24:49,330
- Is it too loud for you?
- It's because I have my family.

2183
01:24:49,689 --> 01:24:53,929
This is betraying the Cooper Family.

2184
01:24:55,069 --> 01:24:57,170
He's building walls.

2185
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:58,170
(Cooper84 suddenly came to his senses.)

2186
01:24:58,269 --> 01:25:00,739
- Bye!
- Happy Fourth of July.

2187
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:02,370
Have a good day!

2188
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:04,410
- Two minutes.
- Two minutes?

2189
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:08,010
Everybody back to here,
it's all your people.

2190
01:25:08,279 --> 01:25:10,179
- A lot of people are here.
- People?

2191
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:14,050
What's the people's group name?

2192
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:15,620
Everybody's group right here.

2193
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:18,689
- Right at this building...
- This building and this building.

2194
01:25:18,689 --> 01:25:20,859
They're just residents from this street.

2195
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,700
The neighbors gathered together.

2196
01:25:23,859 --> 01:25:25,099
They don't have a name for the group.

2197
01:25:26,529 --> 01:25:28,000
(Do you want to dance?)

2198
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,769
(Let's dance!)

2199
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:36,639
He's excited.

2200
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,080
(Excited)

2201
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:42,880
(The gang member is antsy.)

2202
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,720
(The dancer wouldn't stop.)

2203
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:47,689
- Nice.
- Do you want to stay?

2204
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:49,649
Nice meeting you. I'm going.

2205
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,590
Cooper Family will be upset
if they see me here.

2206
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:54,989
I should leave right now.

2207
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,760
He's loyal.

2208
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,760
(The gang member is very loyal.)

2209
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:03,229
I guess Teo feels comfortable there.

2210
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:05,340
He's so into it.

2211
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:06,370
(The independent dancer
is absorbed in dancing.)

2212
01:26:07,069 --> 01:26:11,040
I guess they have a gathering
to enjoy Independence Day.

2213
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,580
They definitely have Latin blood.

2214
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:18,279
They're completely different
from Cooper Family Kian84 met yesterday.

2215
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:20,950
Their sentiment resonates with me more.

2216
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:28,559
In the past, I was always related to
Latin American people...

2217
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,429
who immigrated to America.

2218
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:35,470
Every morning, Puerto Rican immigrants...

2219
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:39,000
played Latin American
hip-hop music loudly,

2220
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,470
and I used to greet my neighbors.

2221
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:43,540
I got close to them
as I greeted them every day.

2222
01:26:43,809 --> 01:26:47,450
I love the feeling of being
in the neighborhood...

2223
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:49,050
and the family.

2224
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:51,380
I felt it again this time.

2225
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:52,979
So I loved it.

2226
01:26:53,519 --> 01:26:56,290
I loved it when they gave me
a warm welcome.

2227
01:26:56,859 --> 01:26:58,359
Amazingly, they're all so warmhearted.

2228
01:26:59,889 --> 01:27:03,059
No. As I'm Cooper Family,

2229
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,859
I can't betray them.

2230
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:09,970
Being Cooper Family, I'll stay away.

2231
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,069
This is how a war begins.

2232
01:27:12,069 --> 01:27:15,269
If I betray them,
my shoes will be hung on the wire.

2233
01:27:16,069 --> 01:27:17,279
That's a horrible thing to say!

2234
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:21,779
And yesterday, I put Brooklyn in my heart.

2235
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:23,050
(Brooklyn)

2236
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,720
I put it in my heart,
taking Gwacheon and Seoul out.

2237
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:27,290
You!

2238
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:29,120
(Meanwhile)

2239
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:31,790
- Chicharron.
- Chicharron, yes.

2240
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:33,519
- Thank you.
- The best here.

2241
01:27:33,519 --> 01:27:35,189
Teo is in another gang now.

2242
01:27:35,389 --> 01:27:38,099
- This tastes good.
- Chewy, firey.

2243
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,200
So good.

2244
01:27:40,529 --> 01:27:41,870
Who pays for all this?

2245
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:44,470
- We all chip in.
- Is that so?

2246
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:46,300
Like 20 dollars.

2247
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,439
Can I chip in too?

2248
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:50,139
- No, you guys, no.
- No?

2249
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:52,279
You're here, you already paid the price.
It's all right.

2250
01:27:52,609 --> 01:27:54,809
- We love it.
- I respect that.

2251
01:27:55,309 --> 01:27:58,080
So you were born and raised here?

2252
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,019
I was born in the Dominican Republic,

2253
01:28:00,019 --> 01:28:02,420
but I came here when I was a baby
like 4 or 5.

2254
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:05,720
So you're all from South America,
like all the people?

2255
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,489
- Dominican.
- Dominican.

2256
01:28:07,489 --> 01:28:10,529
Dominican and Puerto Rican friends,
you know, we're all cool.

2257
01:28:13,769 --> 01:28:14,870
What's wrong?

2258
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:16,700
Cooper Family doesn't hang out there.

2259
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:18,639
"A man who isn't cool".

2260
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,569
VSOP City, Bing Nation,

2261
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,279
Toox.

2262
01:28:27,849 --> 01:28:30,349
I won't betray my gang.

2263
01:28:30,349 --> 01:28:31,679
(I won't betray my gang.)

2264
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:34,620
It's a family.

2265
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,120
They're ordinary citizens.

2266
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,489
(Loyal84 only thanks about the gang.)

2267
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:41,559
(Glancing)

2268
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:44,160
Teo must get along with that gang.

2269
01:28:45,859 --> 01:28:47,929
(Curious)

2270
01:28:48,569 --> 01:28:50,229
Excuse me.

2271
01:28:51,139 --> 01:28:52,139
Excuse me!

2272
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,569
(Walking over sneakily)

2273
01:28:58,179 --> 01:28:59,679
Do you know Cooper?

2274
01:29:00,349 --> 01:29:03,179
- Cooper?
- "Cooper?" Do you mean Cooper Street?

2275
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:04,950
- Yes, Cooper Street.
- Yes.

2276
01:29:05,519 --> 01:29:07,090
I'm from Cooper Street.

2277
01:29:07,489 --> 01:29:08,920
(Okay.)

2278
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,250
What now?

2279
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:12,290
Are you friends with the Cooper Family?

2280
01:29:12,859 --> 01:29:14,389
Yes, we have no problems with them.

2281
01:29:15,989 --> 01:29:17,700
Since they're friends,

2282
01:29:18,429 --> 01:29:19,760
this gang must be...

2283
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:22,529
allied with my gang.

2284
01:29:24,069 --> 01:29:25,870
Then it's all right. We're allies.

2285
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:29,269
Yes. I got permission.

2286
01:29:30,069 --> 01:29:31,080
We are allies.

2287
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,609
(After checking they are allies,)

2288
01:29:34,609 --> 01:29:35,649
(he takes a seat.)

2289
01:29:35,649 --> 01:29:36,679
Gosh.

2290
01:29:37,779 --> 01:29:38,779
I thought...

2291
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,750
we were enemies and acted carefully.

2292
01:29:42,489 --> 01:29:43,819
(Feeling awkward)

2293
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:47,529
He must think of himself
as a gang member or something.

2294
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,160
(Laughing)

2295
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:52,359
I was just having fun.

2296
01:29:53,059 --> 01:29:55,170
Kian84 must feel a stronger bond...

2297
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:58,399
with the Cooper Family
because they were the first townspeople.

2298
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,210
But the fact that you can feel
the affection in any town is important.

2299
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,580
Thank you.

2300
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,779
(Affection)

2301
01:30:06,779 --> 01:30:10,109
They're opening their hearts
and being nice...

2302
01:30:10,109 --> 01:30:12,149
- to the strangers simply passing by.
- Right?

2303
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:14,649
Regardless of who you are,
they welcome everyone.

2304
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:17,090
Where are they from?

2305
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:20,160
Puerto Rico and Venezuela.

2306
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:22,989
They're immigrants.

2307
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:27,700
On holidays,
they quite often have a barbeque party...

2308
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,569
for the neighbors and invite everyone...

2309
01:30:30,569 --> 01:30:32,500
to hang around.

2310
01:30:33,639 --> 01:30:35,439
- All the townspeople gather?
- Yes.

2311
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:38,279
(The immigrants gather and bond together
in the foreign country.)

2312
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:45,479
(Foreigners have settled
in a block of South America.)

2313
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,120
(Another foreigner is deep in thought.)

2314
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,019
Overall, here's what I felt.

2315
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:54,229
The streets from 1 to 6...

2316
01:30:54,689 --> 01:30:57,029
and the avenue from 1 to 6 in New York.

2317
01:30:57,529 --> 01:31:01,170
Each block is rectangular,
like a chess board.

2318
01:31:01,529 --> 01:31:02,970
In each block...

2319
01:31:03,229 --> 01:31:06,470
In one block,
South Americans gather and hold parties.

2320
01:31:06,599 --> 01:31:08,939
In another block is the Cooper Family.

2321
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:12,840
Numerous people from who knows where...

2322
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,450
have gathered in each block...

2323
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:17,220
and held parties.

2324
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,220
(Another world by foreigners in a block)

2325
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:20,550
When the dandelion seeds travel
in the air,

2326
01:31:20,819 --> 01:31:23,019
you never know where it'll take root.

2327
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:25,189
Like that, these people...

2328
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,660
from all around the world...

2329
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,160
have taken root here.

2330
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,760
(The foreigners took root
like dandelion seeds.)

2331
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:34,630
That's the biggest thing
I felt in New York.

2332
01:31:35,269 --> 01:31:36,269
How should I put it?

2333
01:31:36,599 --> 01:31:37,769
Dandelion territory.

2334
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,000
Yes, it was a dandelion territory.

2335
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:42,809
That was when I got my inspiration.

2336
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:49,979
(A unheard song?)

2337
01:31:52,179 --> 01:31:53,179
What?

2338
01:31:53,179 --> 01:31:54,220
My gosh.

2339
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,220
(Is it Kian84's voice?)

2340
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:57,559
- What's this?
- My goodness.

2341
01:31:58,319 --> 01:31:59,590
- Is this the song?
- It's nice.

2342
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,630
The song is nice.

2343
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:03,059
- Wait.
- They used his song.

2344
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:11,769
("Dandelion" by Kian84)

2345
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:16,870
(I'm going on an adventure by accident)

2346
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:22,649
(To find the melody I've forgotten)

2347
01:32:24,849 --> 01:32:29,149
(Where are you from? How's this place?)

2348
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:34,830
(Is it a good place to take root?)

2349
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:39,760
(I haven't found it yet)

2350
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:43,800
(I'm in the air with no roots)

2351
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:48,769
(A completely different place,
an unknown land)

2352
01:32:48,769 --> 01:32:53,710
(Unexpected flowers are everywhere)

2353
01:32:53,710 --> 01:33:00,080
(The flowers that took root
on the chessboard)

2354
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:04,489
(Sing)

2355
01:33:04,489 --> 01:33:09,529
(Yes, I'm leaving to look for novelty)

2356
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:14,630
(In a place nobody goes to)

2357
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:17,399
(I'm going on an adventure by accident)

2358
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:23,540
(To find the melody I've forgotten)

2359
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:29,580
(Dreaming of becoming a singer
by accident)

2360
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:34,950
(The inspirations he got
from experiencing everything)

2361
01:33:35,849 --> 01:33:39,489
(His trip became music
and was created into the first song.)

2362
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:44,460
("Dandelion" by Kian84)

2363
01:33:46,059 --> 01:33:48,099
(Amazed)

2364
01:33:48,099 --> 01:33:50,300
- Now...
- Wait. The song is...

2365
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,340
- The lyrics were great. It's nice.
- The song makes you happy.

2366
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:55,139
The song was played after we watched...

2367
01:33:55,139 --> 01:33:57,010
- the story of your trip.
- Yes.

2368
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:59,979
- It made the song more special.
- Is that so?

2369
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:02,410
You're now singer Kian84, right?

2370
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:04,580
- No.
- Songwriter Kian84.

2371
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,649
Gosh, no.

2372
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,550
- What's the title?
- "Dandelion."

2373
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:09,750
- "Dandelion?"
- It's cute.

2374
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,019
Good. "Dandelion" is nice.

2375
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:13,920
If I'm asked to sing at an event.

2376
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,790
- Did you already think that far?
- If it's...

2377
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:18,300
Yeoju Rice Festival
or something like that,

2378
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,359
- Gosh.
- Yes?

2379
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:21,529
I will change the title to "Rice Seed."

2380
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:23,330
- "Rice Seed?"
- To match the region?

2381
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:25,470
- How can you change the title?
- I was just joking.

2382
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,870
I added my personal life to the lyrics.

2383
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:30,939
I lived in Suwon, Seongnam,

2384
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,910
Gangwon Province, Seoul,
Gwacheon, and more.

2385
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:37,349
Either way, I'm still wandering around
without a family.

2386
01:34:37,349 --> 01:34:39,779
- I haven't...
- You haven't taken root?

2387
01:34:39,779 --> 01:34:42,050
- settled down yet.
- You haven't settled down.

2388
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:43,149
I wrote that.

2389
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:45,389
Along the trip,

2390
01:34:45,689 --> 01:34:47,929
- I didn't stop writing.
- The lyrics?

2391
01:34:47,929 --> 01:34:51,160
I wrote whatever came to my mind.

2392
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,300
Then I sent it to the songwriter in Korea.

2393
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:55,870
That was during the whole trip.

2394
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:58,099
- So you kept communicating with them.
- Yes.

2395
01:34:58,099 --> 01:34:59,800
The song will be released...

2396
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,569
at 6 p.m. the day this episode airs,
right?

2397
01:35:02,569 --> 01:35:03,710
- Yes.
- I'm nervous.

2398
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:05,210
You'll be watching it right now.

2399
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:09,179
Please listen to the song
when it's released.

2400
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:11,950
- "Dandelion."
- People will. It's a nice song.

2401
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:13,420
How embarrassing.

2402
01:35:15,019 --> 01:35:16,090
Have a nice day!

2403
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:17,519
(The traveler leaves again
like dandelion seeds.)

2404
01:35:17,519 --> 01:35:18,590
Have a good day.

2405
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:22,359
- Without a doubt, I like South America.
- Is that so?

2406
01:35:22,359 --> 01:35:24,599
They're so warmhearted,
and the music is amazing.

2407
01:35:24,599 --> 01:35:27,870
- I'm happy that you felt how I felt...
- Cooper Family?

2408
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:30,069
with the Cooper Family, Teo.

2409
01:35:30,769 --> 01:35:31,800
Though it was short.

2410
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,170
- Really?
- Yes.
