1
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,069
(What's going on?)

2
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:44,440
(The two walk to where Teo is.)

3
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,650
(Climbing over)

4
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,550
- How cool.
- You two are cool.

5
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,579
What are we doing next?

6
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,620
(The chores brought
the cowboy brothers together.)

7
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,749
I think we need to go in.

8
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:54,889
- "In?"
- Yes.

9
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,689
Yes, come on!
You two are missing out on the action.

10
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,790
- Come on.
- Hey! Over here, Johnny.

11
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,590
- Johnny!
- Jump this way. Come over this way.

12
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,229
Eddie. You've got to help with it.

13
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,570
No. I don't want to break a leg.

14
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,839
(There's suspense in the ranch.)

15
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,009
(Feeling nervous as well)

16
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:16,439
(At that moment, the calf leaves the pen.)

17
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,210
Jose's got it. Get in the gate.
You all can go ahead.

18
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:20,750
Hey. There you go.

19
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,220
- Turn it back up. Stand it back up.
- Are you okay?

20
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,720
- So, come up here.
- There you go.

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,949
- Like this?
- Just like that.

22
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,750
- Put it about midway right there.
- Right here?

23
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,320
Yes, perfect. Squeeze it harder.

24
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:31,720
Doing that is called tagging.

25
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,229
So that's tagging.

26
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,430
The ear tag is an identification number
attached to the cow's ear.

27
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,400
With the ear tag, the cow's
vaccination record and such...

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,600
can be checked.

29
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,169
It helps take care
of the cow's health systematically.

30
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,869
- Korea does that too.
- Yes.

31
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:46,669
- I saw those in Korea.
- Right?

32
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,380
We have to lock the cow's head in place...

33
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,779
to prevent it from moving
and tag it in the right place.

34
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:54,350
If not, the cow can get hurt.

35
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,279
That's why we had to subdue it.

36
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,650
Real quick.

37
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,089
- All right. Now get onto its head.
- Turn its head to you.

38
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,859
- Stand back up.
- Like this. Look.

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,359
Even if it's a calf,
I'm sure it's really strong.

40
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:08,259
- You need strength and technique.
- Right?

41
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:09,330
(Tagging complete)

42
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,369
(The calf can return quickly.)

43
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,199
(He did well
despite it being his first time.)

44
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,770
(He has adjusted just fine!)

45
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,710
(Meanwhile, the two who were watching.)

46
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,710
(Groaning)

47
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,910
(Closing his eyes tightly)

48
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,749
- What is it?
- Hey, you two.

49
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,279
Hurry.

50
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:34,690
(They hesitantly enter the pen.)

51
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,559
- Young lad!
- Watch your back!

52
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,320
Watch out, okay? It'll run into you.

53
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,859
- Watch it.
- It'll eat your bum.

54
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,160
They go out that way. You're good.

55
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,600
(Will I be able to do it?)

56
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,869
- All right. Remember. Go down the rope.
- Here?

57
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,129
Get on that rope, Teo.

58
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,900
(Running)

59
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,469
- Come on. Grab the tail.
- I'll try.

60
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,980
Come on!

61
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,650
(Teo got overpowered and flown off!)

62
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,379
(Pani Bottle takes a hit as well.)

63
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,319
(Struggling)

64
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,589
- Good grief.
- The balance.

65
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:08,050
They lost balance.

66
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,059
- Get it, boys.
- It's okay. Calm down.

67
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,589
Take it down, boys.

68
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:14,760
- Oh, no.
- The calf was really strong.

69
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,800
- I'm pinned under.
- Right now!

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,930
- Five men weren't enough.
- We couldn't subdue it.

71
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,930
- Are you okay, Teo?
- Are you okay?

72
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,839
- I'm good.
- Grab the back leg.

73
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,740
- I'm good.
- All right.

74
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,369
Put this to the back leg?

75
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:28,909
- Regroup yourself.
- No.

76
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:30,980
Back leg.

77
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,450
Teo.

78
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,480
(Escaping again)

79
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,010
Hang on it, boys!

80
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,950
Don't let him go!

81
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,950
(Being dragged around)

82
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,950
Ready?

83
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,849
(Everyone calms it down.)

84
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,390
Ross. Get that front shoulder.

85
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,420
- Bear with it for a bit.
- Do you want to tag it?

86
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,330
Ross, you've got it.

87
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,099
Three people won't be enough.

88
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:50,159
It was extremely strong.

89
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,159
(The five barely tagged it.)

90
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,170
- Finished?
- Yes.

91
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,330
- Go.
- In 1, 2, 3.

92
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,670
- Good job, guys.
- Did you get the color for the tag?

93
00:04:57,369 --> 00:04:59,469
(In a daze)

94
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:00,939
We've got eight left.

95
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,409
(Shutting his eyes tight)

96
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:04,439
"Eight?"

97
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,580
- I understood why they needed help.
- Right.

98
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,119
- It's no joke.
- The job looks exhausting.

99
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,779
- That was...
- It was the main event.

100
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:11,779
Right?

101
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,420
Be careful of its back leg.

102
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,960
- If you get kicked by it...
- Teo fell down earlier.

103
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
- No, the cow overpowered him.
- Right.

104
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,059
And it's not like Teo is weak.

105
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,129
Get ready! We've got a rider.

106
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,999
Grab the tail.

107
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:26,999
Right in front?

108
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,939
(Kian84 goes after it.)

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,640
The tail.

110
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,110
- Get the tail.
- Be careful, Kian84.

111
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:35,580
- He's rolling on the ground.
- Careful.

112
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,980
There was cow dung everywhere.

113
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,510
- Teo's leg is under.
- It's okay. I'm still okay.

114
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,510
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm good.

115
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,710
- Yes, we're good.
- Go ahead, boys.

116
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,080
(Charging without hesitation)

117
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,550
There you go.

118
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,920
(Kian84 gets pinned down.)

119
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:49,059
- We need to turn its head to our side.
- This side?

120
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:50,089
(Pani Bottle is...)

121
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,089
Watch your legs.

122
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
(Don't overdo it, brothers!)

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,960
Good.

124
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,989
All right, boys. Get over here.

125
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,460
- Three, two, one.
- Two, one.

126
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,029
How are you that good
when it's your first time?

127
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,570
Goodness.

128
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,870
(Smiling despite the tough job)

129
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,679
(Completely synchronized as a cowboy)

130
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:12,810
After watching a demonstration,
Teo gave it a shot.

131
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:15,679
That itself was very scary.

132
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,450
Teo got pushed out 2 to 3 times
while catching the calves.

133
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,089
But...

134
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,960
when I saw Teo's face,

135
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,359
his eyes...

136
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,960
were like the eyes of a wolf.

137
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,070
- How wild.
- He's a wild horse.

138
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,570
At that time, Teo was a beast.

139
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,070
(The handsome guy crazy about cowboys)

140
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,500
Hang in there, boy!

141
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,140
(The crazy handsome cowboy)

142
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,570
Get ready!

143
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,940
We've got a rider.

144
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,880
(Meanwhile, he looks unwell.)

145
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,909
He does look unwell.

146
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:50,520
(Candy and Aeong's brother)

147
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,589
(An animal lover
who willingly gives his lips away)

148
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,789
- I can't look at it.
- It's okay.

149
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,589
- You don't like it?
- I saw it.

150
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,589
I already saw it.

151
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:03,099
I'm sorry!

152
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,330
Humans are sorry.

153
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,000
- "Humans are sorry."
- All right.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,330
- Step back.
- Watch your back.

155
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,370
There you go. Double in the front.
Go. Go backwards.

156
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,440
That's it.

157
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:15,440
(Falling down)

158
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,739
All right. I'm sorry!

159
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,479
I'm sorry!

160
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:20,549
(The animal lover apologizes.)

161
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,020
My heart is sick.

162
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,549
(My heart hurts.)

163
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,020
- Watch your back!
- Watch it!

164
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,729
(Staggering)

165
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,000
Putting aside how tiresome it is,
I just can't do it.

166
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,270
Can't we give...

167
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,500
the other three...

168
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,909
special selections?

169
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,210
Raise the three with...

170
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,750
special selections.

171
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:54,479
It was painful.

172
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:58,549
But there was no other choice.

173
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,520
Am I going to go vegan? No.

174
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,560
That's how life is.

175
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,060
We've been eating meat...

176
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:11,830
throughout our lives.

177
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:14,830
It's been done
for a long time historically, as well.

178
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,310
I've been ignoring the red pill until now
and finally faced it.

179
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:22,979
But it's because of their hard work...

180
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,349
that we get to eat delicious meat.

181
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,849
Teo understood it was livestock...

182
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,450
and a job.

183
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,089
It was surprising how fast he adapted.

184
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,359
That made me respect them more.

185
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,789
It's a mixed feeling.

186
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,359
Good grief. I pig out on meat,

187
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,070
and yet, I'm unnecessarily soft-hearted.

188
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,299
(A deep self-reflection)

189
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,469
I shouldn't pig out on them.

190
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:53,570
- Get ready, boys!
- Come here!

191
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,239
(The animal lover's voice changed.)

192
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,409
Okay. Turn over a new leaf.

193
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,150
Right there. Move. Get on it, boy!

194
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:01,549
- Okay.
- Hold on. Let me get it.

195
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,049
(Surprised by Kian84's spirit)

196
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,279
- That's a wild one.
- It was super strong.

197
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,020
(Watching for an opportunity,
then taking it down in one go)

198
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:09,359
Yes. That's it.

199
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,020
It's okay.

200
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
(Bear with me!)

201
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,789
Kian84 subdued it properly.

202
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:15,760
- He's gotten better.
- That guy.

203
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,099
We've got an American pitbull right here.

204
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,460
It's nice to have a little break.

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,799
- Hit it.
- One, two, three.

206
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,070
(Not a problem!)

207
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,440
- Nice. Good job.
- Let's go.

208
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,039
- Kian84 is getting better at it.
- That guy.

209
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,570
He doesn't know how to do it,
but he's hitting it.

210
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,940
Yes, he is. He ran a marathon.

211
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,010
- Really?
- Yes.

212
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,450
Help them.

213
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:36,580
(Determined to finish it
as quickly as possible)

214
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,279
(Grabbing)

215
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,890
Don't worry. It'll be over in a second.

216
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,560
(Patting)

217
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,320
We'll be done after that one.

218
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:45,859
I'll try it.

219
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:48,489
(Throwing himself onto it,
he's become a legit cowboy!)

220
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,000
- Hang on to it, cowboy!
- Hold on.

221
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,270
We'll make it quick.

222
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,900
(Patting)

223
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,140
One, two, three.

224
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,310
(After tagging it quickly)

225
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,710
- Finished?
- Yes.

226
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,239
In 1, 2, 3.

227
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:07,609
- Good job. Really good job.
- Everyone.

228
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:08,650
A really good job.

229
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,250
Yes, sir!

230
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,549
(He's proud but also confused.)

231
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,919
Kian84.

232
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,350
You don't need a gym here.

233
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,919
- I have no thoughts of hitting the gym.
- Right?

234
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,919
Yes.

235
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,059
(A mess)

236
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,029
You know how all the jeans...

237
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,659
- look like that in Texas movies?
- Yes.

238
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,760
It was because of that.

239
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,169
I thought cowboys rubbed dirt on it
on purpose.

240
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,000
- But it happens naturally.
- Yes.

241
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:31,000
- I was curious.
- You're bound to become dirty.

242
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:35,069
When we have a break,
let's come here to work out for a month.

243
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,110
- Okay.
- Teo.

244
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,179
- You look really happy here.
- I am happy.

245
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,579
(Teo is meant to be a cowboy.)

246
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,020
- So what time is lunch?
- Right now.

247
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,350
- Okay!
- Let's go.

248
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,590
You've got to ride a horse to the cabin.

249
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,390
- Lunch.
- It'll take about ten minutes.

250
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,919
- Yes, sir.
- Let's roll.

251
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,459
I don't want lunch.

252
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,329
- Okay.
- Put this hand here. Pull it up.

253
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,600
- Easy.
- Thank you.

254
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,329
All right, cowboys. Let's go this way.

255
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:01,699
(Heading for lunch)

256
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,539
(Looking back)

257
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,279
(Following Teo's signal)

258
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,279
Come on!

259
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,620
(Let's ride!)

260
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,090
(Galloping)

261
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,419
A little bit more. That's it. Right there.

262
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
Okay. There you go.

263
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,760
Yes, sir!

264
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,260
You're about to become a rider!

265
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,970
Spin him in a circle. Yes!

266
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,199
This is exciting.

267
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:37,970
(With speed like wild horses,)

268
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,409
(the cowboy brothers return
to their accommodation.)

269
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,709
Teo doesn't want to clear from riding.

270
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,750
(Attached to the horse)

271
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,020
- Nice.
- Teo didn't want to come down.

272
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,319
Good job.

273
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:54,590
(Patting)

274
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,689
- They've become friends.
- Here's a pork chop in a can.

275
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,990
- Awesome. Thank you.
- Yes.

276
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,699
(Quenching his thirst with a cold drink)

277
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,630
Nice. Cheers.

278
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,230
Because it's scorching hot, the cowboys...

279
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,140
stuff drinks in an icebox
and have them now and then.

280
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,970
It's delicious.

281
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,110
It's ice cold.

282
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,840
(Refreshing)

283
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,110
(Slamming it down right away)

284
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,549
- That heat makes you drink.
- Gosh, Kian84.

285
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,850
(Screaming)

286
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,020
Goodness. What a shocking taste.

287
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:36,699
- Didn't it feel like 40°C?
- It tastes sweet.

288
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,130
The sun was hot.
It was fine under the shade.

289
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,500
It most likely felt like 40°C.

290
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,900
(Ice arrived to cool the cowboys down.)

291
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:47,539
(Eating one)

292
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,179
Pani Bottle's ice-eating show.

293
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,610
(Grabbing)

294
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,319
(Washing his face with ice)

295
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:57,980
- An ice massage.
- That's good for your skin.

296
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,289
(Putting in)

297
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,760
That must've felt amazing.

298
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,419
Good. Yes!

299
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,630
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
What we have here right now...

300
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,959
are some cows we worked earlier.

301
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,569
We've got to feed our bellies
because we just did all the work. Right?

302
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:16,600
- What?
- Are those tacos?

303
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,970
That's a lot of meat.

304
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,939
What's up for dinner?
I'm going to get some.

305
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:22,679
- Can I try a little piece?
- Yes.

306
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,209
(Eating)

307
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,380
(Licking)

308
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:32,620
It's delicious.

309
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,120
It's charcoal-grilled short ribs.

310
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,319
There's something similar in Chuncheon.

311
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:38,620
Charcoal-grilled short ribs.

312
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,230
Were those venison sausages?

313
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,630
They probably hunted
and made it themselves.

314
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,000
It's made with everything
grown and raised there.

315
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,230
- Yes.
- That's right.

316
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
(The three cowboy brothers
are taking a break.)

317
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,299
(Snapping)

318
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:51,640
(Snapping)

319
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,939
- What's that?
- What was that?

320
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,169
It gets very loud.

321
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,510
- Gosh.
- Is it a whip?

322
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,850
It sounds like a gun.

323
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,380
You can hear the swishing
if you hear it in person.

324
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,449
It sounded like guns.

325
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:06,520
(What made people nervous?)

326
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,459
(By whipping it hard)

327
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,289
Cowboys threaten the animals
with the sound. They don't hit them.

328
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,419
- To turn the direction?
- Yes.

329
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,760
- Can I try?
- This is natural.

330
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,199
- Pani Bottle gives it a shot.
- It's hard.

331
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,130
(Snap)

332
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,140
Pull it straight down.

333
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,199
(Do it like this.)

334
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,539
I kind of figured it out.

335
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,079
Give it to me. I'll try.

336
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,250
Be careful. It's really strong.

337
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,250
(Kian84 gives it a go.)

338
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,279
I should take shelter.

339
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:38,880
- That looks scary.
- It is scary.

340
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,890
And it's heavy.

341
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,319
The Indiana Jones cowboy.

342
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,990
(It sounds quite right.)

343
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,059
There you go!

344
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,289
(I'll show you how cool I am.)

345
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,100
(Screaming)

346
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,600
Oh, no.

347
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,630
- That looks painful.
- I thought I was going to die.

348
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,770
Oh, no.

349
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:55,730
(Oh, my gosh)

350
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,000
- That must've hurt.
- Shoot.

351
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,140
That must've left a scar.

352
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,610
- I knew it.
- Not my style.

353
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,010
- You want some more?
- Not my style.

354
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,779
This isn't my style.

355
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,880
"Not my style."

356
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,819
That's kind of South Texas brand.

357
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:11,949
(This scar)

358
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:12,990
They get you.

359
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,220
- That's...
- A tattoo.

360
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,819
South Texas branding.

361
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,360
Like a tattoo.

362
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,730
- Right.
- Like a tattoo.

363
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,860
I've always had a pimple there.

364
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,699
(Between two pimples,)

365
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,730
(there's a clear line.)

366
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,539
(In the meantime)

367
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,840
(The taco ingredients are ready.)

368
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,309
- So grab a plate.
- Oh, setting.

369
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,679
This.

370
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,709
(First meal in the cowboy farm)

371
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:40,709
Oh, that looks good.

372
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:41,880
(Toasted)

373
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,419
Get your tortilla and make your taco.

374
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,750
One, two,

375
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,659
- three.
- I like it.

376
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:51,620
Do you make it yourselves?

377
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,429
That looks good.

378
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,590
(You put what you like
in your cowboy taco.)

379
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,630
What is that? Avocado?

380
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,429
- Avocado.
- Chicken.

381
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,329
(One more piece of meat)

382
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:00,329
It's hot.

383
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,600
That's amazing.

384
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,240
- That must've been really good.
- Yes.

385
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,709
(Pani Bottle likes...)

386
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,809
It's freshly grilled.

387
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,709
My mouth is watering. That looks so good.

388
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,549
(A bite of a meat wrap)

389
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,620
(Exclaiming)

390
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,350
(Munching)

391
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,350
Here's your plate.

392
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,490
That reminds me of you
having curry in India.

393
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,620
(Nom)

394
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,189
(He still munches on his food.)

395
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:29,559
(It tastes even better after working.)

396
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,600
Gourmet.

397
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
(It's delicious.)

398
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:32,970
(Chewing)

399
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,029
Underground.

400
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,770
The underground water?

401
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,100
I wasn't going to have beef.

402
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,939
- It's so good.
- I ended up eating it.

403
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:42,069
- You were planning to avoid beef?
- Even before I knew...

404
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,709
I wasn't going to eat it at least today.

405
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,279
He wasn't going to have beef.

406
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,980
I couldn't help it when it was there.

407
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:49,449
I'm sure they enjoyed their lives.

408
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:51,620
- Don't worry.
- I ate it even before I knew it.

409
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,189
(Closing his eyes tightly)

410
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,990
Eating it again? Is it that good?

411
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:00,959
We'll meet again in the inferno.

412
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:02,829
(One day)

413
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,959
Gosh.

414
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,329
(Teo heads outside with a taco.)

415
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,429
Gosh.

416
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,740
(Enjoying his taco under the Texas sun)

417
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
(Exclaiming)

418
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:19,039
(He begins inhaling it.)

419
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,709
Oh, that looks good.

420
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,279
I'm enjoying it so much.

421
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:24,449
It's delicious.

422
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,220
That looks good.

423
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,360
You should live here. It suits you.

424
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,890
If they need a hand, I'd come back.

425
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,890
I know.

426
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
- Gosh.
- Teo.

427
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,159
I love it here.

428
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,429
(Teo's become a real cowboy.)

429
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,699
- It matches him.
- It really does.

430
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,140
It's perfect.

431
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,470
He looks perfect with that taco.

432
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,010
- It's perfect.
- Yes, it's perfect.

433
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,840
Stop eating already.

434
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,150
It's like a letter to yourself.

435
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,209
It's so cute.

436
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,250
- Are you okay?
- Are you looking in the mirror?

437
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
(Side effect from eating too much?)

438
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,189
Who are you doing that to?

439
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,189
(Glaring)

440
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:04,189
(Ta-da)

441
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:05,819
- A baby.
- It's a baby.

442
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:07,260
Oh, my gosh.

443
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:10,029
(It's not a side effect from eating
too much, but he's babysitting.)

444
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,699
Who's the baby here?

445
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,730
(Turning)

446
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:16,029
(Smacking)

447
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,100
It's salty.

448
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,100
- Come here, boys.
- Hello.

449
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,270
Nice to meet you too.

450
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,309
They're JP's sons...

451
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,539
and Eddie's sons.

452
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,750
It's cute to see the boys...

453
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,909
- in cowboy hats.
- Yes.

454
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:29,480
Hey, this little cowboy,

455
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,150
he'd been bucked off a horse
harder than you've ever had,

456
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,319
and it took him a minute,
but he got right back up.

457
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,319
And he's been
getting back on horses again.

458
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,390
- Cowboy.
- Cowboy.

459
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,730
(He's a real cowboy.)

460
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,929
- Yes.
- How old?

461
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,830
- Seven.
- Seven.

462
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,929
What's your name?

463
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:47,630
- Jace.
- Jace.

464
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,900
You have a dream?

465
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:51,739
- A dream?
- Yes, your dream.

466
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,040
- My dream.
- What do you want to be when you grow up?

467
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,310
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

468
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,009
I'm a Korean painter.

469
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,679
Painter. Cartoon. Comics.

470
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,280
- He draws cartoons.
- You like cartoons?

471
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,189
- I like SpongeBob.
- Spider-Man?

472
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,419
- SpongeBob.
- SpongeBob.

473
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,219
What kind of music do you like?

474
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,689
- Country.
- Country?

475
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:16,530
- Even kids grow up listening to country.
- Same as him.

476
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,959
K-pop?

477
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:20,699
- No K-pop? They don't know.
- No K-pop?

478
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:22,699
Do you know "Gangnam Style?"

479
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,269
That's the worst question ever.

480
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,209
Come on.

481
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:29,269
I only asked because you were
talking about K-pop.

482
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,140
You more or less asked the same question.

483
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,280
K-pop?

484
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,949
I wasn't planning to ask to that extent.

485
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,280
What else is famous?

486
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,249
<i>Baby shark, doo, doo</i>

487
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:42,890
- Do they know this song?
- "Baby Shark."

488
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,890
They probably know.

489
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:47,060
He's already smiling.

490
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,030
This is like a famous Korean song.

491
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,030
(Grinning)

492
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:51,530
(Interested)

493
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,469
- It's "Baby Shark."
- "Baby Shark."

494
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,499
They all smiled as soon as it was played.

495
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,239
- They know "Baby Shark."
- Yes.

496
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,669
That's more popular than "Gangnam Style."

497
00:19:58,669 --> 00:19:59,709
Seriously.

498
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:00,739
(Old guys are happy.)

499
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,209
That's my jam.

500
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:04,040
That's Preston!

501
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,140
(Excited)

502
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,209
They're so cute.

503
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,610
This song is the best.

504
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:10,749
That's what we should make...

505
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:12,820
- instead of anything else.
- Something like that.

506
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,890
<i>Kian84, doo, doo</i>

507
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,459
(Good.)

508
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,560
Let's get some rest under the AC.

509
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
It's so hot.

510
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,759
- You have to take a nap after lunch.
- Because it's so hot.

511
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,070
It's a routine to rest indoors...

512
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,830
before the sun sets.

513
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,969
- Inside.
- About three hours.

514
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:31,600
They need to cool down.

515
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,209
It was way too hot.

516
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:34,739
(3 hours of nap time)

517
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:37,409
(Kian84, Pani Bottle, Teo)

518
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:40,650
I want green tea shaved ice.

519
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,820
Are you sleep-talking?

520
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:46,150
- After eating so much.
- I think you're sleep-talking.

521
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,620
It sounds like you're having a good dream.

522
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:49,390
"Green tea shaved ice."

523
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,419
(Dreaming about having green tea shaved
ice while cleaning the water tank)

524
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,959
(While resting with a good dream)

525
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:56,630
(It's time for the afternoon work.)

526
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,229
All right, men. It's time to get up.

527
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:02,999
We did the morning work.
Now we got to go in.

528
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:05,070
- All right.
- I'll wait for you outside.

529
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,140
Three hours went by so fast.
It felt like a minute.

530
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,540
We went to work right away.

531
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,979
(The afternoon work begins at 5 p.m.)

532
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:13,409
- It's warm.
- It's hot.

533
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:14,580
(Heading to work)

534
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,880
All right. We're going to go...

535
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,749
(Young cowboys joined them
for the afternoon work.)

536
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:19,050
The kids joined them too.

537
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,189
(Staring)

538
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,959
(Laughing)

539
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:28,959
He's cute.

540
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,499
He's cute.

541
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,699
(Laughing)

542
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,929
(Waddling)

543
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,400
He's cute.

544
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,969
- So cute.
- So cute.

545
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,040
(Approaching immediately)

546
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,939
(Laughing)

547
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,479
(Adorable)

548
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,909
(Grabbing)

549
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:49,919
So cute.

550
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,179
Oh, my gosh. He's so cute.

551
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:52,179
(The next generation cowboy)

552
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:53,189
He's practicing.

553
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,449
So what are we going to do?

554
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:56,019
Take care of the horses, put them up.

555
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:58,120
- Take care of the horses?
- Yes.

556
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,330
(Exerting)

557
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,030
(Switching to a horse)

558
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,259
Everything is leather.

559
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,429
(The young cowboys appear on horses.)

560
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:09,969
The kids are good at riding horses.

561
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,269
They're so brave.

562
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,439
Now, straight for a little bit.
Going to look.

563
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,810
Stop.

564
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,409
Pull hard. Harder.

565
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:21,679
(Horses become second feet for cowboys.)

566
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:26,719
(Young cowboys grow up
watching the life of a cowboy...)

567
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:33,159
(and learn to ride horses
before a bicycle.)

568
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,030
(Setting off with a cowboy family)

569
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,370
Good. Okay. Real good.

570
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,400
(In the beautiful scene...)

571
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,969
It looks amazing.

572
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,209
There you go.

573
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:48,239
(Kian84 is riding smoothly.)

574
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,370
Get behind him, Jace.

575
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,380
Kian84 looks good on the horse.

576
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,979
I rode this horse this morning. Seiry.

577
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,780
Seiry.

578
00:22:56,949 --> 00:22:58,019
Yes.

579
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:00,120
It must be hot for them too.

580
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,959
(While worrying about horses
from heatstroke)

581
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,189
Right in the middle.

582
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,830
No, we'll help you tie.

583
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,630
Because the horses came a long way,

584
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,830
we give them a bath.

585
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,630
Are they taking a bath?

586
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:17,340
(Exerting)

587
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,040
- It's soaked.
- It's soaked.

588
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:20,669
- It's soaked.
- My goodness.

589
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:21,840
- It's hard.
- It must've been so hot.

590
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,140
- My goodness.
- They sweat a lot.

591
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:26,449
Hey.

592
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:28,310
Its back is bent.

593
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,850
There he goes again.

594
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,120
- He feels bad again.
- But really, its back is bent.

595
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,390
- Isn't that normal?
- Not that much.

596
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,890
No?

597
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:39,219
Bad humans.

598
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:40,429
(The animal lover is furious.)

599
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:41,530
(It's normal to be bent.)

600
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,759
That's normal?

601
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,499
- Bring the horse, Kian.
- Yes.

602
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,030
- Bring the horse.
- Okay.

603
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,840
It's nice to give him a cool shower.

604
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,540
Okay. So...

605
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,370
Just water?

606
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,810
- That looks refreshing.
- Does the horse like it?

607
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,380
- Up here.
- Does it like it?

608
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,979
(Puff)

609
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:02,909
It's flaring its nostrils.
I think it likes it.

610
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:05,350
The horses liked it so much.

611
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,350
It must be nice.

612
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,590
(Kina84's first guest enters.)

613
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,820
He looks cool.

614
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,459
You remind me of...

615
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:15,759
"The Lord of the Rings."

616
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:17,860
You're right.

617
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,499
- Like the horse the elves ride.
- Yes.

618
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:22,229
(He has an awesome blond mane.)

619
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:23,540
His hairstyle...

620
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,469
- It's Teo's horse.
- It's Vaquero. I rode him.

621
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,810
The dirt.

622
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:31,280
(Scrubbing)

623
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:32,640
Look at his muscles.

624
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,780
Could you feel it?

625
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,880
I could. It's no joke.

626
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,249
- Are you happy?
- This is...

627
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:42,189
- He likes it a little too much.
- He likes it. He's flaring his nostrils.

628
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,659
I should loosen his trapezius.

629
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,229
- You're massaging him too.
- Massaging?

630
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,199
You provide good service.

631
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:56,870
- Trapezius.
- His trapezius was stiff.

632
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,269
It would take about three hours
to loosen up his trapezius.

633
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,110
Loosening his trapezius...

634
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,640
You're loosening a horse's trapezius.

635
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,610
You might be the first person
to give a horse a massage.

636
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,880
I guess he really likes it.
He's not moving even a bit.

637
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,919
- He likes it.
- He liked it.

638
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:12,179
Spray water on him.

639
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,249
- I'll give him a massage.
- Okay.

640
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,189
- It's a full course.
- Massage.

641
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,790
(Massaging)

642
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,459
- He should be tipped.
- He should be tipped.

643
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,300
He provided a full service.

644
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,400
(An animal-lover's full service)

645
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,999
He's getting proper service at a salon.

646
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,969
This is a Korean-style massage.

647
00:25:28,969 --> 00:25:30,300
- Does it feel good?
- Does it feel good?

648
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,070
- He likes it.
- He's not even getting nervous.

649
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,209
Kian84 took good care of him for me.

650
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:40,550
(He's very happy.)

651
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,350
- It's done.
- In the trailer.

652
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,350
(He's done with his first customer.)

653
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,749
(Under the 37°C heat)

654
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,449
- You worked hard.
- Goodness.

655
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:50,219
(He takes good care
of the other customers too.)

656
00:25:50,219 --> 00:25:53,159
You'd be sweating
even if you stand still if it's 37°C.

657
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,729
You feel thankful and sorry...

658
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,699
when you look into their eyes.

659
00:25:57,699 --> 00:26:00,330
We caught them when they
should be running around freely...

660
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,530
to use them as transportation means.

661
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:06,040
So I tried to give them a massage.

662
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,140
That's all I could do for them.

663
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,110
I liked it because the horses
were really cute.

664
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,610
I could sense that they were happy.

665
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,519
They flared their nostrils.
I think they felt refreshed.

666
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,550
(Rumbling)

667
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:22,120
It was worthwhile! Oh, my, the lightning.

668
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,560
It was worthwhile! Oh, my, the lightning.

669
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:28,630
(Rumbling)

670
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,800
(Exclaiming)

671
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,530
Pani Bottle goes crazy
whenever he sees lightning.

672
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,630
(Sprinting)

673
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:38,040
Okay.

674
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,800
(He took care of the last customer.)

675
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,810
Thank you.

676
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:44,780
Gosh. Have you been
to the Waterbomb festival?

677
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:46,749
- Once.
- Was it fun?

678
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:48,850
I was there to do a gig.

679
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:50,120
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

680
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,479
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

681
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,519
- What's wrong?
- Did you fall?

682
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,320
- Come here.
- Oh, dear.

683
00:26:58,189 --> 00:26:59,189
What happened?

684
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:01,259
Why?

685
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,560
(His dad checks on him.)

686
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
I guess he's hot.

687
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,699
- Hot.
- Hot. Yes.

688
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,669
- He was hot.
- Really?

689
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:08,699
Oh, no.

690
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,070
Goodness.

691
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,870
I think he felt dizzy
because it was so hot.

692
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:14,840
- Goodness.
- I was really shocked.

693
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,310
(He's in a bad condition
because of the hot weather.)

694
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,810
He should drink some water.

695
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,810
Here.

696
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,850
- What will he do?
- Here. Get some water.

697
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,679
Put it on your hands.

698
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,689
- He should go home.
- Right.

699
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:30,959
You should go home.

700
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:35,259
(JP calmly tries to lower
his temperature.)

701
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:37,199
He raises his son strongly.

702
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,530
He's hot.

703
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,600
- You should go home.
- He didn't pamper him.

704
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,769
He raises him so strongly.

705
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,269
- What's your name?
- Jace.

706
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:48,340
Jace? Come here.

707
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,610
- Let's get some rest under the shadow.
- Jace.

708
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,610
Are you hot? Do you have water?

709
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,850
(Eddie came to check on Jace.)

710
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,820
- I'm okay.
- Inside of your arm.

711
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,719
- He's so brave.
- He's a child.

712
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,959
He was brave. He didn't cry.

713
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,860
- I know.
- He doesn't whine.

714
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,890
He didn't.

715
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Candy?

716
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:13,999
- Right. His blood sugar went down.
- Nice.

717
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:16,870
Don't swallow it. Suck on it.

718
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,600
(Licking)

719
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,409
- Thank you.
- "Thank you." He's cute.

720
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,380
(Dropping)

721
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,280
- He dropped it?
- Oh, dear.

722
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,150
He just needs to eat it
within three seconds.

723
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,580
- No.
- He's so cute.

724
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,179
- Goodness.
- I didn't see that.

725
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,050
(Dropping)

726
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,790
(Disappointed)

727
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,350
He gave his son tough love.

728
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,360
Jace didn't feel well.

729
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,090
Perhaps he got exhausted from the heat.

730
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,600
But he didn't make a fuss.

731
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,330
JP also told him,
"It's okay. Drink some water."

732
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,370
(The cowboy dad took care of him calmly.)

733
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,199
He was raised strong,

734
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:54,969
and a cowboy's life is wild too.

735
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,179
He never said he was hot.

736
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,640
- That's right.
- He's so cool.

737
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,880
I think he'll grow up to be
a very cool person.

738
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,979
Go home.

739
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,479
He needs rest.

740
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:08,749
What should I say?

741
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,820
Just a moment, Jace.

742
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,630
Go home and turn on the air conditioner.

743
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,199
Coke and air conditioner.

744
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,540
- Sleep.
- Get some rest.

745
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,169
- I think he understood you.
- Yes.

746
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:29,209
Can you walk?

747
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,209
Can you stand up?

748
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,550
(Fortunately, he's feeling better.)

749
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
(They head home, just to be safe.)

750
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,790
We went home because we thought
it would be better for him to rest.

751
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,259
- Are you okay, Jace?
- Yes.

752
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,519
Be careful.

753
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:51,530
What is Teo doing?

754
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:57,239
(Teo is picking prickly pears.)

755
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:00,100
He said he wanted to eat prickly pears
as soon as he came to Texas.

756
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,769
(The day they came to Texas)

757
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,310
(That's a prickly pear!)

758
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,050
(He found some cactus by the road.)

759
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,019
(Teo wanted to try prickly pears.)

760
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,489
(Swallowing)

761
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,790
(He finally gets to taste it!)

762
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,360
(Ouch!)

763
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:21,130
(He was pricked.)

764
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,360
- Be careful, man.
- Were you pricked?

765
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,759
It'll be like
getting snapped with needles.

766
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,900
Goodness.

767
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,929
(He's used to it.)

768
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,169
It was like getting an injection.

769
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:32,300
Does it hurt that much?

770
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,239
There are at least 20 to 30 needles
on those cactus in one spot.

771
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,239
It's like I got acupuncture.

772
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,380
It hurts.

773
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,880
That many?

774
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,749
You get those big leather chaps that
you put on and they'll block a needle.

775
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,050
That's why we wear those chaps...

776
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,890
- that JP and Eddie were wearing.
- Right.

777
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,820
Kian84 just grabbed that...

778
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,130
and ate that thing.
I said, "Boy, you're crazy!"

779
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,330
- The fruit...
- They said you have to be careful.

780
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,759
You won't be able to work later.

781
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,269
(Even cowboys are careful
with the spines.)

782
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:02,630
Kian84 was great.

783
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,640
What about the spines?

784
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,239
There are spines.

785
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,239
He was shocked.

786
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,009
I see a few over there.

787
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,909
- Do you see some?
- Yes. The darker ones, right?

788
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:13,550
There are a few more behind.

789
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,850
Yes. They're like in a spot
and you have to look.

790
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,919
Let me get these ones first.

791
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:21,290
(He keeps picking.)

792
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,590
(They picked many purple prickly pears.)

793
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,159
They're ripe and purple.

794
00:31:26,189 --> 00:31:29,790
We're going to cut the prickly pears
to make jam.

795
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,999
(They're going to make prickly pear jam.)

796
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:34,600
The best thing to do
is to hold it up like that.

797
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,330
Shave that.

798
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,540
You prepared them.

799
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,169
Yes, but it was simple.

800
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:44,009
Just try to get the skin.
You can leave the skin here.

801
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,610
I'll go get us a little...

802
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,380
hammer and kind of...

803
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,650
Teo also cooks well.

804
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,280
Yes. It's a lifetime.

805
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,919
A lifetime of commitment.

806
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,189
You're doing better than me, baby.
You spent some time in the kitchen.

807
00:31:57,189 --> 00:31:58,189
I did.

808
00:31:58,189 --> 00:31:59,360
(Feeling proud)

809
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,259
(His speed goes up
after getting a compliment.)

810
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,499
(After peeling the prickly pears,)

811
00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:07,630
You have to mash them too.

812
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,630
(you mash them with a hammer.)

813
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,229
(Only natural ingredients are used
without adding any sugar.)

814
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,140
- They don't use sugar in this jam.
- Yes.

815
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,409
Do you just put it in the fridge
and eat it right away?

816
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:15,409
Yes.

817
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:19,239
(What will the sugar-free
prickly pear jam taste like?)

818
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:20,749
(While Teo was making prickly pear jam)

819
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:21,749
Here?

820
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,850
- There?
- Yes.

821
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,350
It's good.

822
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:27,249
We went there
after giving the horses a bath.

823
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,390
I'll dive in.

824
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,050
- What is that?
- Goodness.

825
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,890
(There's a large pond in front of them.)

826
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,489
Good.

827
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:36,030
(It's the pond they saw
while taking a tour around the ranch!)

828
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:38,600
(The horses enjoy a bath.)

829
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,370
- There were fish.
- It's a catfish.

830
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,669
You can fish or take a shower
or play in the water with the horses.

831
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,140
(Even ducks swim in it.)

832
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,080
- This is...
- It's rejuvenating.

833
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,280
He's going in while riding the horse.

834
00:32:58,749 --> 00:33:03,519
(He goes in while riding the horse.)

835
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,019
Just like that? Oh, my.

836
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,890
The horse and the person all go in
because it's so hot.

837
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,100
(It's a rare sight.)

838
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:12,699
It's a flood-damaged car.

839
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,929
A flood-damaged horse.

840
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,999
It's really deep.

841
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,540
(It reaches the horse's neck.)

842
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,640
The water...

843
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:23,239
(Exclaiming)

844
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:25,009
(He stands on top of the horse...)

845
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,140
(and dives in.)

846
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,909
(Jumping)

847
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,249
(Come in, brother.)

848
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,350
Kian84 can't stay still
in front of the water.

849
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,919
He has to go in.

850
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,290
(He's already unbuttoning.)

851
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,360
(His friend also enters the water.)

852
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,530
(Throwing)

853
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,759
It's cooler when he goes in
without his shirt.

854
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,169
(Extremely cool)

855
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,840
(He skillfully tumbles.)

856
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:56,209
(Fascinated)

857
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,679
I shouldn't undress too much this time.

858
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,380
"I shouldn't undress too much this time."

859
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,880
I shouldn't undress too much this time.

860
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,419
He's saying that
while taking off his pants.

861
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:10,050
I didn't take my shirt off.

862
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,130
Should I just wear my underwear?
I should take off my pants at least.

863
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,560
Don't people normally
take off their shirts?

864
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,429
I think it'll be better to wear it.

865
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:21,400
- Really?
- Goodness.

866
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
(He took off his shirt.)

867
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,939
(I don't want to see this.)

868
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:25,370
The pants are too thick.

869
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,340
I'll go in like this.

870
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,640
(Why do you keep taking your clothes off?)

871
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:32,509
It's not because I like exposing myself.

872
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:33,540
Why is he there?

873
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,780
(Laughing)

874
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:39,150
- What is that?
- It was raining.

875
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,719
It was worthwhile! Oh, my, the lightning.

876
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:45,060
This is crazy. This angle is too funny.

877
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,229
It's not because I like exposing myself.

878
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:51,800
I'd have to dry my clothes
if I wear them when I swim.

879
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:54,699
(He's innocent.)

880
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,229
I'll go in like this.

881
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:57,340
(He places his precious jeans there.)

882
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,439
- That stings.
- Why is the grass so prickly?

883
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:01,239
- Underwear Bottle.
- Gosh, it stings.

884
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:02,409
- Jump.
- Jump?

885
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:03,409
(Right here)

886
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:06,840
(The horse is as tall as Pani Bottle.)

887
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,509
(Will he make it?)

888
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,479
(Slipping)

889
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,090
(He jumped up...)

890
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,249
(and fell.)

891
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:16,989
Goodness.

892
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,019
(Laughing)

893
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,159
(Embarrassed)

894
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,030
(His short legs disappoint him.)

895
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,459
Okay. I'll try.

896
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,030
- It's okay. I'll do it myself.
- You got it?

897
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:27,969
Okay.

898
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:29,929
(He takes a deep breath.)

899
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,439
Go.

900
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,439
(Exclaiming)

901
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
It's slippery.

902
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,909
(Goodness)

903
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,239
(He refuses to give up.)

904
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,310
Do it. That's right.

905
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,810
- He did it.
- Good.

906
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,880
There you go.

907
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,479
His legs are quite pretty.

908
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,789
(He shows off his beautiful legs.)

909
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,689
(He succeeds after three tries.)

910
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,519
(He's happy.)

911
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,130
(Behind the brother who took off
only his pants...)

912
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,059
(comes the older brother
who took off only his shirt.)

913
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,200
(Jumping)

914
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,269
There.

915
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,800
- Kian84 as well.
- He did it at once.

916
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,039
(He struggles but manages to get on.)

917
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,769
Over here.

918
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,639
- Over here.
- Go.

919
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,479
You're going in with the horses.

920
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:16,180
There you go. Keep going!

921
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
(They go in the water on horseback!)

922
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,880
Yes! Cowboys!

923
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,919
Hey.

924
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,689
He jumped.

925
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,459
Hey.

926
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:28,059
He got on the horse after so much trouble,
but he just slid down.

927
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,430
(After watching him)

928
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,130
Steady.

929
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,360
Wait.

930
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,200
Just a moment!

931
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
(Wait!)

932
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,039
(Get in there too.)

933
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,070
(He was thrown into the water.)

934
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:42,010
The water is black.

935
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,209
It's not dirty, though.
There's a lot of mud inside.

936
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:45,439
It's a mudflat.

937
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,550
You even picked up water plants.

938
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,050
(A wild pond full of water plants)

939
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,050
(Laughing)

940
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,189
(Kian84 is in the water.)

941
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,229
(He adapts and swims with the horses.)

942
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:03,959
I've never seen someone swim
with horses before.

943
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,769
(While Kian84 was becoming one
with the pond)

944
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:12,900
(Watching)

945
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,369
Why is he so good at swimming?

946
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:17,439
(The little cowboy entered the pond.)

947
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:20,510
(Swallowing)

948
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:23,349
I guess it's deep there.

949
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:24,619
It's not five feet.

950
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,180
(Even the kids are playing.)

951
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,249
Hey.

952
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:28,749
(I can't stay here!)

953
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:32,619
- Underwear...
- Pani Bottle. Right.

954
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,829
(He enters the water again
after seeing the children.)

955
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:40,669
(An overwhelming face)

956
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:43,570
Cowboys are honest, you know?

957
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,269
The children are good swimmers too.

958
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:54,010
(It's a playground in nature.)

959
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:00,919
(Even Jace who was exhausted
in the heat joins them.)

960
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,619
If this were Korea,
there would have been some adults saying,

961
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:08,630
"Don't go inside!"
because the water looked dirty.

962
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,829
But they didn't make a fuss like that.

963
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:12,200
They just swam.

964
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,700
(The cowboys enjoy nature as it is.)

965
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,329
It looked nice.

966
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:17,700
(It looked nice.)

967
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,780
(The cowboys enjoy the afternoon
while being one with nature.)

968
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,309
There's nothing much to a cowboy's life.

969
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:31,550
You work hard and rest hard.

970
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,550
It goes from bitter to sweet.

971
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,720
(They enjoy a good rest after hard work.)

972
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,519
(You can also just lay down.)

973
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,019
Is it refreshing?

974
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
This is paradise.

975
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,459
You must have really enjoyed that.

976
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,099
(Enjoying a wonderful nap too!)

977
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,900
(The location of the hat...)

978
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,340
- That's manners.
- It's weirder.

979
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,880
It's weirder.

980
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,740
- Manners.
- His expression is weird too.

981
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,880
Right.

982
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:04,419
That's all I can see.

983
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:08,090
(They enjoy a sweet rest
using the grass as their bed.)

984
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:09,789
Let's go, Pani Bottle.

985
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:11,760
Okay.

986
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,990
(They return to the cabin...)

987
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,599
(to meet Teo.)

988
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:23,599
I'm so happy.

989
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,099
(He's overwhelmed with happiness.)

990
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,570
- Are you?
- Yes.

991
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:30,740
I might tear up. I'm really happy.

992
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,680
It makes me think
I missed this sort of thing.

993
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,479
(He's just happy because he got to
live his dream as a cowboy.)

994
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:38,880
- I can feel that he means it.
- It's real.

995
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,220
I'll do some laundry.

996
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,150
Laundry.

997
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,160
- Laundry?
- Laundry.

998
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,220
(Pani Bottle came out to do laundry.)

999
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:48,130
- Is he washing the clothes that got wet?
- Looks like it.

1000
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,099
(He washes his precious underwear too.)

1001
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,130
(He rinses it with water.)

1002
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,869
(Squeezing)

1003
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:03,470
Pani Bottle is done with laundry.

1004
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,780
It dries quickly because it's hot.

1005
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:11,820
(The sun sets.)

1006
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,349
(Texas' sky turns orange.)

1007
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,919
Quatro said we should go for dinner.

1008
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,729
(They head out for dinner.)

1009
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,130
Let's get on.

1010
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:27,229
Okay. Let's go.

1011
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,039
(Where are they going during sunset?)

1012
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:38,010
(Excited)

1013
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,309
(They get off with excitement.)

1014
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:43,309
Goodness.

1015
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:47,720
Gosh.

1016
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:51,059
It's amazing. You see the horizon too
since there are no mountains.

1017
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:56,930
(The sunset stretches wide
along the horizon.)

1018
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:05,240
(The pink sunset that looks like
a painting covers the sky.)

1019
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,709
(The sun is setting at the ranch.)

1020
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,309
(Well done.)

1021
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,050
(It's time for the horses
to go back home.)

1022
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,849
(Following the setting sun)

1023
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,059
This really made me feel
like I was in the US.

1024
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:27,320
New York is like Seoul.

1025
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,530
(Their dinner is getting cooked.)

1026
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,860
Goodness.

1027
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,669
Mac and cheese.

1028
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,740
That's really a home meal.

1029
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,539
(He eats a piece of meat
at a sunset restaurant.)

1030
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:42,769
(Eating)

1031
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:44,780
(Their eyes and mouth
are fully enjoying it.)

1032
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,139
- It's so good.
- Right.

1033
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,410
Was it different
from what you ate in Korea?

1034
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,950
- It's incomparable.
- That's right.

1035
00:41:51,249 --> 00:41:54,249
I thought it wouldn't taste good because
we had meat for lunch, but it was so good.

1036
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,950
Did you like that pork chop?

1037
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,990
This is my favorite spot, brother.
My favorite spot.

1038
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:02,360
I guarantee you this is something
all of us will have...

1039
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,930
in our memory. We will remember it.

1040
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,959
- Memory.
- Yes.

1041
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,300
(The cowboy family gathers together.)

1042
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:13,039
(Both adults and children come together
and enjoy the relaxed time.)

1043
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,570
It's so beautiful.

1044
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,809
It's different.

1045
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,510
The colors.

1046
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,180
It was like in the animations.

1047
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:31,189
Everything looked like a painting.

1048
00:42:34,229 --> 00:42:37,900
You could see the unrealistic colors
you see in animations.

1049
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,669
(Kian84 stores them in his heart.)

1050
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:47,570
- It's that kid.
- Jace.

1051
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,639
He seems better.

1052
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,380
Look here.

1053
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,180
- Grasshopper.
- Jumping.

1054
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:56,910
- I'll keep it as a pet.
- He'll keep it, not eat it.

1055
00:42:57,979 --> 00:42:59,220
Yes. That's what I said.

1056
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:01,490
(He's cute.)

1057
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,749
(Laughing)

1058
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,619
- Jace was very...
- I guess he wanted to become friends.

1059
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,829
He came and talked to me first.

1060
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:10,590
Do you like studying?

1061
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,070
- Yes.
- I don't think so.

1062
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:17,740
(He becomes a mischievous uncle.)

1063
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,740
You like studying?

1064
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,869
(Let's just move on.)

1065
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,010
I don't like studying.

1066
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,209
- You don't like studying?
- No.

1067
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:28,309
Right. I hated studying too.

1068
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,849
In the future,

1069
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,079
people who don't like studying...

1070
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:36,349
people who don't like studying...

1071
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,289
succeed.

1072
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,590
(What?)

1073
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,189
There will come a time
when people who don't study succeed.

1074
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:46,459
How do I say that?

1075
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,030
That's too difficult.

1076
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,300
There will come a time
when stupid people succeed.

1077
00:43:50,939 --> 00:43:52,400
(While Kian84 kept on prophesying)

1078
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:54,070
Look at the moon.

1079
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,010
- The moon is so beautiful.
- It's a crescent moon.

1080
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,209
(Staring)

1081
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,680
(He slowly walks to the horse.)

1082
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,490
I don't know why I did that.

1083
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,689
I felt very comfortable.

1084
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,800
(The friend who roamed around the ranch
with Teo...)

1085
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:19,860
(and bonded deeply with him
over a short time)

1086
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,669
(They've become close friends
within a short time.)

1087
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,439
I believe that we communicate
with someone...

1088
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:29,070
through our souls when we can't use words.

1089
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,510
I genuinely believe that.

1090
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:36,910
So, I think that was one of those moments.

1091
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,579
(They communicated through their souls.)

1092
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,189
I miss it.

1093
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,829
Is your life in Seoul tough?

1094
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:49,030
(Joking)

1095
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,329
He's worse than me.

1096
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:53,160
(He shows his affection for Teo
who resembles him.)

1097
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,099
It's a lizard.

1098
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,130
- Is it alive?
- A lizard.

1099
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,499
- A lizard.
- Really?

1100
00:44:58,499 --> 00:44:59,700
(Jace caught another insect.)

1101
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,700
Where did you get that?

1102
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,110
- Why don't we let the lizard live?
- Over there.

1103
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,309
Why don't we let the lizard live?

1104
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:06,280
(I feel bad for the lizard.)

1105
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,410
I see.

1106
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:12,380
You know, when we caught
dragonflies and stuff, they all died.

1107
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,189
Lizard. Go home?

1108
00:45:16,189 --> 00:45:17,189
What do you say?

1109
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:18,419
(He hears a shocking suggestion
after coming to brag about it.)

1110
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:20,189
He shouldn't have bragged about it.

1111
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:25,329
Lizard's mama is waiting.

1112
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,360
I didn't see the mama.

1113
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,669
He didn't see the mama.

1114
00:45:29,499 --> 00:45:30,599
I'll keep it.

1115
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,639
- He's going to keep all of them.
- You'll keep them?

1116
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,139
Then, let's trade with me.

1117
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:36,570
Okay?

1118
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,479
You want the lizard to eat it?

1119
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:41,010
- No.
- No. I'm not eating it.

1120
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,079
How about this...

1121
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,680
(He gets all the coins he has to trade.)

1122
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:44,880
Trade.

1123
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,289
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1124
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:53,760
(That's good to hear.)

1125
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:55,590
The deal has been made.

1126
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,800
(A dramatic deal)

1127
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,430
That's cute.

1128
00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:01,999
It's so tough to save a life.

1129
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:03,200
It is.

1130
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,439
(While the zoophilist is hard at work...)

1131
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:08,869
- What?
- Goodness.

1132
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,439
He's inspired.

1133
00:46:11,439 --> 00:46:13,309
(He's immersed in the atmosphere
and plays something on the spot.)

1134
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:16,349
That's why you need to be handsome.

1135
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:17,919
"That's why you need to be handsome."

1136
00:46:17,919 --> 00:46:19,579
(The handsome guitar sound...)

1137
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:20,650
(Joining)

1138
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,119
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

1139
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,820
That's so romantic.

1140
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:26,559
Are they playing together?

1141
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,459
(They start an impromptu jam.)

1142
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,030
I heard that JP used to be a musician.

1143
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:34,599
(Teo naturally responds.)

1144
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,430
<i>- Time keeps dragging on</i>
<i>- Dragging on</i>

1145
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,669
That was ridiculously cool just now.

1146
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,840
- Now, this is all imagination.
- Yes.

1147
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,269
(They play in perfect harmony
when it's the first time.)

1148
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,410
That's improvised?

1149
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:46,809
He's practically a singer.

1150
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:47,849
(Admiring)

1151
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,510
(They suddenly sing a cowboy duet.)

1152
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,849
(Their harmony...)

1153
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:57,789
(brings people together one by one.)

1154
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,720
(Kian84 is sitting in the middle.)

1155
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:05,229
<i>- Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door</i>
<i>- Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door</i>

1156
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,030
Pani is shaking something behind them.

1157
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,030
(Pani is shaking a soda can.)

1158
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:11,200
It's going to pop!

1159
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,840
(His excitement popped instead.)

1160
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,470
Hey, JP!

1161
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,939
Look up "Amarillo by Morning."

1162
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:21,680
Ready? Here we go, boys.

1163
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,680
(He starts playing
as soon as he hears the title.)

1164
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,450
This is equivalent to "Busan Seagull"
in Texas.

1165
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:26,650
- I see.
- I see.

1166
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,490
- Air violin!
- Yes.

1167
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:29,590
(Good teamwork)

1168
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,919
What did they take in Houston?

1169
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:33,459
<i>- They took my saddle in Houston</i>
- Oh, my gosh.

1170
00:47:33,919 --> 00:47:35,490
(Laughing)

1171
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,130
(Seeing how skilled they are,
they burst into laughter.)

1172
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,130
What did you lose?

1173
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,499
<i>- I lost my wife and a girlfriend</i>
<i>- I lost my wife and a girlfriend</i>

1174
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,970
(Laughing)

1175
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:47,269
In Texas,

1176
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,910
the place turns into a karaoke bar.

1177
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,910
(They can sing in harmony
with just one guitar.)

1178
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,039
<i>Morning</i>

1179
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:00,079
(Friends and family all come together
to enjoy this romantic night.)

1180
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:04,660
It felt like their work and leisure times
were combined into one.

1181
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,030
Work, camping, leisure,

1182
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:11,059
and karaoke were all one.

1183
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,360
But when they sing country songs,

1184
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,530
they can express the joys and sorrows
of their lives.

1185
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,139
They drive cattle in the morning,

1186
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:21,169
(They wake up early at dawn
and work hard.)

1187
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:23,840
they cut hooves on their horses
in the evening,

1188
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
(They sweat until the sunset.)

1189
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,450
and there are joys and sorrows
in their lifestyle.

1190
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,849
And it felt like they were
coughing it out.

1191
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:34,119
(They cough it out through music!)

1192
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,519
(Throwing away the burden
on their shoulders,)

1193
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,260
(they finish the day with laughter.)

1194
00:48:41,459 --> 00:48:42,729
All right, boys!

1195
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,660
You may think it's done,

1196
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,160
but you'd better get some good sleep...

1197
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,669
because, tomorrow, we've got to get up,
ride some horses, check the cows,

1198
00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:49,930
and do it all over again.

1199
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,229
That's the cowboy life.

1200
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,800
It's a good thing...

1201
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,910
(Something just went by.)

1202
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:56,309
At 4 a.m.?

1203
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,979
- At 5:30 a.m.
- At 5:30 a.m.?

1204
00:48:58,539 --> 00:48:59,740
(Dizzy)

1205
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,079
I think he said something like,

1206
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,619
"You can sleep when you're dead."

1207
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,749
What's scarier is that
they actually get up at 5:30 a.m.

1208
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,419
- Good night!
- Good night.

1209
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:13,889
- Good night.
- Ciao.

1210
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:15,360
- All right.
- Good night, guys.

1211
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,099
Goodness.

1212
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,229
- Let's head inside.
- Good work, guys.

1213
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,769
Oh, my.

1214
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:27,240
(Tired)

1215
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,840
I finally see what liquor tastes like.

1216
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,280
- A cowboy's day is...
- I'm so sleepy.

1217
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,910
(A day as a cowboy
was as long as a month.)

1218
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,150
Tomorrow, we'll have to...

1219
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:42,720
leave this place by noon.

1220
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,749
Right.

1221
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,160
He doesn't want to go.

1222
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:49,090
I'll just stay here. You can go.

1223
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,090
You?

1224
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,400
(Pulling his hat down)

1225
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,160
So, tomorrow night...

1226
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,669
- is our last night together.
- Yes.

1227
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,800
- Tomorrow is our last night?
- Already?

1228
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,800
It is.

1229
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,999
- You're leaving in two days.
- You leave the day after tomorrow.

1230
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:01,939
- Seriously?
- It's already their last night?

1231
00:50:01,939 --> 00:50:04,209
- Yes. I have to go too.
- I forgot about that.

1232
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,979
You're going back to Korea
the day after tomorrow, right?

1233
00:50:07,979 --> 00:50:09,110
Then...

1234
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,709
(Their trip is going to end in two days.)

1235
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:12,579
When you go back,

1236
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:15,450
I'm going to another place...

1237
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,150
to look for a new genre of music.

1238
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:19,289
(Your trip...)

1239
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,419
(is going to continue?)

1240
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:21,829
Where are you headed?

1241
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:22,829
(Where is he going by himself?)

1242
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:24,030
I'm going to Jamaica.

1243
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,700
- What? Jamaica?
- What?

1244
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,599
(Jamaica)

1245
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,599
Jamaica? Why are you going there?

1246
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:30,599
Jamaica?

1247
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:33,369
(He's going to Jamaica by himself?)

1248
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:35,669
I don't know...

1249
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,479
how it will begin and end.

1250
00:50:38,709 --> 00:50:40,410
But I want the last part of the trip...

1251
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:43,809
to be a solo trip.

1252
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,019
I want to finish the trip alone.

1253
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,689
I reckon there will be
more masterpieces if I dig deeper.

1254
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,160
- He's going to Jamaica alone?
- From the US to Jamaica?

1255
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,229
I've been to South America,
India, and Madagascar,

1256
00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:01,630
which are very far places, right?

1257
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:09,539
(He set off to unfamiliar lands
that were hard to reach.)

1258
00:51:11,439 --> 00:51:17,579
(He felt deeper emotions
in unfamiliar places.)

1259
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:22,189
I felt like I was getting too used to
the city while traveling in the US.

1260
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,820
So, I decided...

1261
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:28,090
to go to the wild.

1262
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:31,599
I thought about ending the trip
by myself...

1263
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,130
and talked to the crew.

1264
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,130
(He talked to the production crew
about going to Jamaica.)

1265
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:36,869
(Jamaica)

1266
00:51:37,499 --> 00:51:40,139
(An island in the Caribbean Sea)

1267
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,769
(An untouched and unexplored wilderness)

1268
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,340
(A vibrant place full of people...)

1269
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,209
(where music is a part of everyday life)

1270
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,709
Look at that.

1271
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,889
(He goes deeper into the uncharted land.)

1272
00:51:55,889 --> 00:51:57,450
This should be fun.

1273
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:00,119
Gosh.

1274
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,930
I never expected to go to Jamaica.

1275
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,059
How are you going to get there?

1276
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,329
- Jamaica?
- Yes.

1277
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:08,999
- Probably on a plane.
- From where?

1278
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:11,570
After checking the flights...

1279
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,400
Where exactly do you have to go?

1280
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,070
I'm tired, so let's look into it tomorrow.

1281
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:19,410
If you miss the flight,
you can always come back here.

1282
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,410
(He's unstoppable.)

1283
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,110
I'm going to bed.

1284
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,119
- So am I. I'll wash up.
- I'll sleep here.

1285
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:28,889
(Turning the lights off before bed)

1286
00:52:29,419 --> 00:52:31,820
(Pani also goes to bed.)

1287
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:36,860
(Teo is left alone.)

1288
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,700
- I didn't know you stayed up.
- He kept looking around.

1289
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:47,139
(He steps outside.)

1290
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,610
(Flopping down)

1291
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,180
(Teo can't seem to go to sleep.)

1292
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,380
It was dark, but I went outside.

1293
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,419
I looked up at the sky,

1294
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,450
and I had never seen
such a sky before in my life.

1295
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,160
- The night sky was stunning.
- All those stars!

1296
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,829
(Teo was looking up at the sky.)

1297
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:14,930
I was so happy.

1298
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,630
It made me feel sad, actually.

1299
00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:21,939
Are you sleeping?

1300
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,439
- The night sky is...
- Yes.

1301
00:53:24,439 --> 00:53:26,479
stunning.

1302
00:53:26,709 --> 00:53:29,180
The stars are gorgeous.

1303
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,610
(He wanted to share the view with others.)

1304
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,720
(He goes back outside...)

1305
00:53:36,419 --> 00:53:38,490
(and sits down.)

1306
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:44,959
(He stared at the night sky
for a long time.)

1307
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:53,139
(The wistful night goes by,)

1308
00:53:53,139 --> 00:53:56,439
(and morning breaks in the ranch.)

1309
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:00,039
(Groaning)

1310
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,079
Pani.

1311
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,749
Oh, he's topless.

1312
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,889
You either have your shirt or pants off.

1313
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:10,650
I'm constantly taking my clothes off.

1314
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,590
- He's Naked Bottle.
- Naked Bottle.

1315
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:15,090
Should we...

1316
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:17,389
get a tattoo today?

1317
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,430
Seriously?

1318
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,229
Are you trying to get matching tattoos,
or what?

1319
00:54:21,229 --> 00:54:22,229
(He shyly suggests matching tattoos.)

1320
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:23,729
Which tattoo? The thing from earlier?

1321
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:25,200
- The Longhorn.
- I see.

1322
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,099
- It's pretty cool, though.
- Where should I get it?

1323
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:29,769
- Hold on.
- Maybe here...

1324
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,880
- A spot where people can't see.
- I think you'll look great.

1325
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,280
Like here.

1326
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:37,610
Where people can't see? Right here.

1327
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:38,720
Isn't that too visible?

1328
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,820
But you can't see it.

1329
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,720
(Laughing)

1330
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,950
Why not on my forehead?

1331
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,749
Let's ask Kian84 too.

1332
00:54:45,189 --> 00:54:46,660
- Sure.
- Okay.

1333
00:54:47,419 --> 00:54:48,530
Let's wash up for now.

1334
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,530
(They'll discuss it with Kian84 later.)

1335
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,930
(Already exhilarated)

1336
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,400
(He wakes up by the sound.)

1337
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,900
(He wore the shirt to sleep.)

1338
00:54:59,939 --> 00:55:01,840
- He slept with that shirt on.
- What?

1339
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,240
- Did you wash the shirt?
- You didn't do the laundry?

1340
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,979
Did I wash it and dry it?
I can't remember.

1341
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,280
- I don't think he did.
- That's not important.

1342
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,010
Right. What's important is that
I was tired.

1343
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,349
- Right. As long as he got a good sleep.
- I guess you dried it.

1344
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,349
Shall we go?

1345
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:19,990
(They go up the stairs to the rooftop.)

1346
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,760
The flag is all torn.

1347
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:24,959
Check out the flag.

1348
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:29,729
- You're right.
- It's all torn.

1349
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,369
- Goodness.
- It's weathered.

1350
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,169
The color is beautiful.

1351
00:55:33,269 --> 00:55:35,610
- It's a violet...
- It's purple.

1352
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:36,610
(A violet sky is beyond the flags.)

1353
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,010
It was picturesque in the morning.

1354
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,579
(They're dazed
in front of the overwhelming view.)

1355
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:43,209
When are we getting a tattoo?

1356
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,919
Oh, no.

1357
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,380
(The crazy handsome cowboy
still wants to get a tattoo.)

1358
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,590
- You should actually consider it.
- What?

1359
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,990
- Becoming a cowboy.
- A cowboy.

1360
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,289
(You should be a cowboy.)

1361
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:55,630
Turning to a cowboy lifestyle.

1362
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,829
Wait. So, when are we getting the tattoo?

1363
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,660
- You still haven't gotten their answer.
- But...

1364
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,070
Why don't all six of us get it?

1365
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,240
Why are you dragging us into it?

1366
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:07,599
- Let's all get it.
- We didn't even go!

1367
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,709
Do Yeon, you should get one here.

1368
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:11,410
The studio members aren't part of it.

1369
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:17,309
It's rising.

1370
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,720
- It's so pretty.
- Goodness.

1371
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:23,749
- Oh, my.
- The sun is rising.

1372
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:25,760
I see it through the trees.

1373
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:30,130
They wake up to find themselves
in Jeongdongjin.

1374
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,930
The sunrise.

1375
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:34,160
(The ranch turns red.)

1376
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,300
It's beautiful.

1377
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,869
(The ranch turns red.)

1378
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,070
It's beautiful.

1379
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:47,039
Shouldn't we go down there
and get to work?

1380
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,309
I'm over here cooking breakfast.

1381
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:52,019
- They're already...
- They're all out.

1382
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,950
We're going to put salt and pepper.

1383
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,119
They may not like salt.

1384
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:56,689
They're diligent.

1385
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,119
What are they making?

1386
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,220
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1387
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,329
- Hey.
- Did you get some sleep?

1388
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:03,959
- Yes. Good morning.
- A little bit?

1389
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:05,030
- They weren't sleeping.
- Good morning.

1390
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,300
- All right.
- Good morning, Sunshine.

1391
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,300
Yes.

1392
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:09,729
- Morning.
- Cowboy!

1393
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,800
- Still tired.
- Cowboy Pani.

1394
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,900
- Yes.
- Pretty sore?

1395
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,769
I think so.

1396
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:20,539
(While the cowboys make breakfast...)

1397
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:21,579
Everything, right?

1398
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:22,650
He's the ultimate.

1399
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,749
- He is the ultimate. He's the rider...
- Why do they have this in the kitchen?

1400
00:57:24,749 --> 00:57:26,220
- He's the...
- Hey!

1401
00:57:26,919 --> 00:57:28,720
- What's this?
- What is that doing here?

1402
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,550
- What is that?
- What?

1403
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,860
It's a hippie...

1404
00:57:33,689 --> 00:57:34,689
Why do they have this?

1405
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:36,630
It suits you.

1406
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,329
Eddie.

1407
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:41,559
- Look at him.
- It's pretty.

1408
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,900
Oh, that's why...

1409
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,840
I was wondering why his hair was long.

1410
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:48,369
You look like you'll play the guitar
with your teeth.

1411
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:50,070
He looks like a one.

1412
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:51,410
What is this?

1413
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:52,809
It's a costume.

1414
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:53,979
(He looks like a veteran.)

1415
00:57:53,979 --> 00:57:57,249
There won't be too many people
who play the guitar better than you.

1416
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:00,150
(The mad guitarist
overwhelms people with his looks.)

1417
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,050
Did Teo like it?

1418
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,050
This is the jelly we made yesterday.

1419
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,220
Oh, it's the jelly.

1420
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,829
From the prickly pears, right?

1421
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:13,860
(Teo and Quatro
made this prickly pear jam.)

1422
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,669
- It's the jam.
- The one they made yesterday!

1423
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:17,269
Oven inside the house.

1424
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:19,099
- Inside?
- JP.

1425
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:20,539
I had never seen that before.

1426
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,539
(Freshly baked buns)

1427
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,309
- Open it up.
- That looks good.

1428
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:24,369
- Goodness.
- Should I try it?

1429
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:26,510
(Steaming)

1430
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,410
(Filling it with jam made by Teo)

1431
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,249
- It's like eating a scone...
- A scone.

1432
00:58:30,249 --> 00:58:31,709
- with strawberry jam.
- Right.

1433
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,450
This is the color magenta.

1434
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,090
(A big bite)

1435
00:58:37,249 --> 00:58:40,059
(The mad guitarist also takes a bite.)

1436
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:49,599
Why? You don't like it?

1437
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:51,599
- It's not exactly sweet.
- No.

1438
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:53,639
It wasn't jam.

1439
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,209
This looks like...

1440
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:56,470
(They give honest reviews.)

1441
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:58,939
(But Teo is enjoying it.)

1442
00:58:58,939 --> 00:59:02,450
The cowboy doesn't have a problem with it.

1443
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,209
- The bun is salty.
- Yes.

1444
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,150
I like it. Oh, my gosh. It's good.

1445
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,189
I wonder what it tastes like.

1446
00:59:10,689 --> 00:59:13,090
It's like mashed watermelon and cucumbers.

1447
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,619
Did they boil it down?

1448
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:16,260
- Yes.
- They must have.

1449
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,189
- Guys.
- Yes?

1450
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:19,229
Let's go eat outside.

1451
00:59:19,229 --> 00:59:20,530
- Okay.
- Sure.

1452
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:22,970
- Should we bring this too?
- Yes.

1453
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,400
(There's more to eat?)

1454
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:25,740
Oh, nice.

1455
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:27,470
In the morning...

1456
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:29,740
They're having a barbecue at 6 a.m.

1457
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,169
(A barbecue party early in the morning)

1458
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,180
T-bone steak!

1459
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,979
- They're eating steak in the morning.
- They actually eat it in the morning.

1460
00:59:37,749 --> 00:59:39,820
(Yesterday's lunch: Meat)

1461
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,450
They have barbecue parties
three times a day.

1462
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,990
- Seriously.
- That's insane.

1463
00:59:44,189 --> 00:59:46,260
(And T-bone steak this morning)

1464
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:48,289
Bacon.

1465
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:49,829
Steak and eggs?

1466
00:59:50,189 --> 00:59:52,530
Eating steak in the morning
doesn't sit well with me.

1467
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:53,930
All right, guys.

1468
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:57,729
(Nibbling)

1469
00:59:58,329 --> 00:59:59,599
They're sick of it.

1470
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:00,740
(They only eat bacon as they've eaten
meat three times in a row.)

1471
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,970
I was fed up with it.

1472
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:03,110
(Welp...)

1473
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:06,340
(A big bite)

1474
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,680
This is crazy.

1475
01:00:10,979 --> 01:00:12,950
(He puts a T-bone steak between the buns.)

1476
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,950
(Admiring)

1477
01:00:15,889 --> 01:00:17,749
- That looks good.
- He made a burger.

1478
01:00:17,749 --> 01:00:20,720
- Teo is so...
- It was so delicious.

1479
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,889
(He can easily handle a morning steak.)

1480
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:22,889
I was able to eat it.

1481
01:00:23,729 --> 01:00:27,260
The food suits you,
and the lifestyle suits you.

1482
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,800
This is so good, though.

1483
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,900
(He even wipes the sauce off the plate.)

1484
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:39,209
The owner doesn't drink coffee,

1485
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:41,809
- so they don't have coffee.
- I have coffee.

1486
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,349
- You do?
- Yes. Do you want me to bring it?

1487
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,680
- Let's have a cup of coffee.
- Sure.

1488
01:00:45,419 --> 01:00:48,150
(Pani makes coffee.)

1489
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,619
- You're done eating, right?
- Yes.

1490
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:53,119
- I'll make coffee, then.
- Good.

1491
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:57,829
(He makes coffee right away.)

1492
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,999
They served us breakfast,

1493
01:00:59,999 --> 01:01:01,700
so I thought it'd be a good idea
to give them coffee.

1494
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:03,530
This is Korean coffee.

1495
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:06,939
- Coffee.
- Thank you.

1496
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:08,599
(Cups of coffee
for the hardworking cowboys)

1497
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,539
- Here.
- I appreciate you.

1498
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:14,209
You always have to bring these
when you're traveling.

1499
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,510
- It's a necessity.
- Gosh. What is that?

1500
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,780
It's Korean coffee.

1501
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,689
That's some good stuff right there. Gosh.

1502
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:23,919
He's enjoying it.

1503
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,619
- Is it...
- There's no one who'd dislike this.

1504
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:32,200
Like in a K-Town mart.
They should have it.

1505
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,300
- He's taking a photo.
- He's taking a photo of it!

1506
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,269
- He must love it.
- Yes.

1507
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:38,329
(I need a photo of this.)

1508
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:41,470
That is some good stuff. Gosh, darn it.

1509
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:42,910
(The cowboys love Korean coffee.)

1510
01:01:43,169 --> 01:01:44,169
That was a good meal.

1511
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,209
Shouldn't you paint something today?
You promised them yesterday.

1512
01:01:50,209 --> 01:01:51,579
- Yes, the kids.
- The kids.

1513
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:53,220
I should paint the kids before I go.

1514
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:58,519
- The flag was all torn. It's so old.
- Yes.

1515
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:00,689
We always made a flag, right?

1516
01:02:00,689 --> 01:02:01,689
- Right.
- Yes.

1517
01:02:01,689 --> 01:02:03,689
We ate and slept in the cabin,

1518
01:02:03,689 --> 01:02:05,430
so it was like a gift for them.

1519
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,430
I like that.

1520
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:09,570
The kids have their paintbrushes
and paint.

1521
01:02:09,669 --> 01:02:12,240
Okay. I should draw their faces too.

1522
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:13,800
- You could.
- Okay.

1523
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:16,939
- There's the little cowboy!
- Little cowboy.

1524
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,039
Adorable.

1525
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:21,039
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Nice shirts.

1526
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,579
- Nice shirts.
- Good morning.

1527
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,180
He's friendly.

1528
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,619
The kids are getting their stuff.

1529
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:26,680
Yes.

1530
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,450
- All of it?
- All, yes.

1531
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,419
The kids gave him tools after they heard
he was going to paint something.

1532
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,160
Okay. Come here.

1533
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,130
I'm going to draw you guys.

1534
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:38,729
You can draw the three of us.

1535
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,300
(Us?)

1536
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,430
- They're so cute.
- No?

1537
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:44,269
I don't know how to draw.

1538
01:02:44,269 --> 01:02:46,200
- That's okay.
- That's fine.

1539
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,070
You can draw whatever you want.

1540
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,309
It's just for fun.

1541
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:50,309
- He's shy.
- How adorable.

1542
01:02:50,439 --> 01:02:53,809
Sit comfortably,
and feel free to draw anything.

1543
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:54,910
Where's gray?

1544
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:56,410
You can draw their faces,

1545
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,280
- and I'll draw the props.
- Okay.

1546
01:02:58,510 --> 01:02:59,519
Like an assistant.

1547
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,450
It's been so long since I last painted.

1548
01:03:02,289 --> 01:03:03,519
I only paint when I'm on this show.

1549
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:07,490
- Nowhere else.
- But you went to art school.

1550
01:03:08,019 --> 01:03:09,990
I was a flunker. I was a terrible painter.

1551
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,760
- I...
- What's that photo?

1552
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:13,900
- That's my graduation photo.
- That's you?

1553
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:17,630
- What are you wearing?
- A gas mask.

1554
01:03:18,499 --> 01:03:20,169
Were you able to graduate
after that photo?

1555
01:03:20,169 --> 01:03:21,169
Fortunately, yes.

1556
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:24,410
(He calls himself a flunker,)

1557
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,740
(but Kian84 didn't even graduate.)

1558
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,410
This is a poor painting environment.

1559
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:31,709
(Next to the poor artists...)

1560
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,220
- The tattoo.
- The Longhorn.

1561
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,820
- That's all he thinks about.
- He's hooked on it.

1562
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,749
Do you all recognize this?

1563
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:39,959
That's a Longhorn.

1564
01:03:39,959 --> 01:03:42,389
A Longhorn! That's right. Exactly.

1565
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,059
- He drew it so nicely.
- It's cool, though.

1566
01:03:44,059 --> 01:03:45,260
(He draws the symbol of Texas
as if it's a tattoo.)

1567
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,260
Maybe I'm going to get a tattoo.
Put some ink on my skin.

1568
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,269
Why is Pani drawing it?

1569
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:51,070
I could do that much.
It wasn't a permanent tattoo.

1570
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:54,700
- Doesn't that mean you want one?
- No, not at all.

1571
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,209
- No?
- You try to convince me every time.

1572
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:58,410
(He finds the opportunity
to sneak his way in.)

1573
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,139
I got a pretend tattoo. What do you think?

1574
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,650
- "HB?" Houston Bros!
- Yes.

1575
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,749
To remember this trip.

1576
01:04:06,619 --> 01:04:07,849
It's a friendship doodle.

1577
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,249
I'm satisfied with that.

1578
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:10,349
- Are you?
- Yes.

1579
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:15,260
What was your favorite part of the trip?

1580
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:19,599
My favorite part of the trip was
coming here and meeting you guys.

1581
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:22,030
- That's so sweet!
- It's poetic.

1582
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,570
What he said was a gift in itself.

1583
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:25,700
- Are you going to miss us?
- Yes.

1584
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,610
Let's make a beautiful painting.

1585
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,280
(It's time to make a beautiful painting.)

1586
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,880
That looks the same as me!

1587
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,410
- Look at that. He's got a picture.
- You!

1588
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,410
- That's me!
- Yes.

1589
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:39,519
It already looks the same.

1590
01:04:39,919 --> 01:04:42,320
That's you. He's amazing, right?

1591
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,650
That's why he's a professional.

1592
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:47,220
- You're really good.
- Come on.

1593
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:50,189
It was my first time seeing Kian84 paint,

1594
01:04:50,189 --> 01:04:52,630
so I wanted to show off to the kids.

1595
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,099
The kids are good too.

1596
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,169
I like how they draw it randomly.

1597
01:04:57,169 --> 01:04:58,599
That's so cute!

1598
01:04:58,599 --> 01:04:59,669
That looks like SpongeBob.

1599
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:02,570
It looks like...

1600
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:06,280
Jace is the main character.

1601
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,840
This is
Jace's Music Adventure by Accident.

1602
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,450
That's amazing.

1603
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,550
(The main character is here.)

1604
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,019
He got curious and sat next to you.

1605
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:17,119
It's you.

1606
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,189
You're bigger than the older ones.

1607
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:23,389
It means that you need to be a big man.

1608
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,130
(Touched)

1609
01:05:26,459 --> 01:05:27,499
Do you want to try it?

1610
01:05:27,999 --> 01:05:29,030
- I can do it?
- Yes.

1611
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,300
I love his attitude.

1612
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,400
Do you want to paint the color of the hat?

1613
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,939
- Paint the hat with this color.
- Do you want to fill out the hat?

1614
01:05:36,939 --> 01:05:38,010
Okay.

1615
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:40,610
- Is there a correct answer to painting?
- There isn't.

1616
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:41,939
- There's no correct answer.
- There isn't.

1617
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:43,650
Okay. Do it.

1618
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:45,680
(Charing into the world
without correct answers)

1619
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,849
He picked gray?

1620
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:52,490
He's bold.

1621
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:54,389
(Hesitant)

1622
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:57,530
But yellow seems better, doesn't it?

1623
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,459
You said there were no correct answers.

1624
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:03,169
Maybe it seems gray to you.
Okay. Good! Come on!

1625
01:06:03,169 --> 01:06:05,229
- Whatever you want.
- Come.

1626
01:06:05,229 --> 01:06:06,269
Come at it.

1627
01:06:06,939 --> 01:06:09,369
- It looks good, though. He's an artist.
- It does.

1628
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:11,139
You can fix it.

1629
01:06:13,209 --> 01:06:14,280
Okay.

1630
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,340
(He pours his soul into it...)

1631
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,479
- He's really bold.
- He's got potential.

1632
01:06:17,479 --> 01:06:19,150
(with the little artist.)

1633
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,950
Man, I'm tired.

1634
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,749
I shouldn't have drawn all four of them.

1635
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,389
I thought the other three might be
disappointed if I only painted one.

1636
01:06:27,389 --> 01:06:28,419
Exactly.

1637
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,860
(Lying down)

1638
01:06:32,229 --> 01:06:33,959
What happened to him?

1639
01:06:34,229 --> 01:06:35,400
There are too many.

1640
01:06:35,999 --> 01:06:37,070
What did he say?

1641
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:39,099
I thought you were a professional.

1642
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,010
- He thought you were a pro.
- He thought you were a pro.

1643
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:45,639
(The remark cuts deep.)

1644
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,380
That was great.

1645
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,709
A pro can't get tired.

1646
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,680
- Professionals are not tired.
- There you go.

1647
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:54,249
Oh, my.

1648
01:06:54,349 --> 01:06:55,689
Who taught you to say that?

1649
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,419
- They were brought up in a tough world.
- That was sharp.

1650
01:06:58,419 --> 01:06:59,490
Okay. I'll keep trying.

1651
01:07:00,189 --> 01:07:01,260
I'm learning a lot from you.

1652
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,059
(He experiences
how a cowboy raises his child.)

1653
01:07:03,729 --> 01:07:05,090
His butt is showing now.

1654
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:08,360
Kian84, he can see your butt.

1655
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:11,169
Thanks for looking out for me.

1656
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,599
- I think he's a genius.
- He's adorable.

1657
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,240
Kick his butt.

1658
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:19,809
(Sure!)

1659
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,110
(He was feeling lazy,)

1660
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,019
(and the kid gave him energy.)

1661
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,320
(He's recharged.)

1662
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:33,559
- Hey.
- He's adorable.

1663
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:36,530
- I think Jace likes him.
- I know!

1664
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:39,599
- I guess he wanted to be friends.
- Kids get playful when they like you.

1665
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,860
You wanted me to work hard.

1666
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,130
He's the happiest I've seen.

1667
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:45,400
- He was tired earlier.
- Yes.

1668
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,209
- He said you got tired too soon.
- Did he? Try being my age.

1669
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:50,939
He thought you got tired too soon
when you were a pro.

1670
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:53,240
You know, he's older than your dad.

1671
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:55,709
- How old is he?
- He's 41.

1672
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:57,910
(Surprised)

1673
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:59,479
I thought he was 22.

1674
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:02,450
- He halved your age.
- He thought you were 22.

1675
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:04,519
- Who said that?
- Him.

1676
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:05,619
- Okay.
- How old are you?

1677
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,559
I should draw him better.

1678
01:08:08,889 --> 01:08:10,590
Great. The main character is replaced.

1679
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,999
(What?)

1680
01:08:14,229 --> 01:08:15,630
I thought he was like 20.

1681
01:08:16,369 --> 01:08:18,599
- Jace thought you were 20.
- He understood!

1682
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:21,499
It's a competition now.

1683
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,470
- This is an auction.
- Yes.

1684
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:25,840
I thought he was one.

1685
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,780
- He thought you were one year old!
- One year old.

1686
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,309
- He thought you were one.
- He lost.

1687
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:33,019
- One year old.
- How do they learn to make such jokes?

1688
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,650
What seven-year-olds make jokes like that?

1689
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:36,689
(Moved by the high-quality jokes)

1690
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:38,619
- They should be in our studio.
- I know.

1691
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:40,220
They've got what it takes.

1692
01:08:40,959 --> 01:08:43,030
- I have a question.
- You said you were seven years old.

1693
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:45,059
Why are you laughing
and shaking your butt?

1694
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:47,700
He asked why you were laughing
and shaking your butt.

1695
01:08:48,729 --> 01:08:50,470
That's because my body is shaking.

1696
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:52,470
How does a seven-year-old make
such a joke?

1697
01:08:52,939 --> 01:08:55,139
- His butt laughed with him.
- They know how to tease you.

1698
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:58,240
It's taking a while,

1699
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,680
- so I'll start writing their names.
- Okay.

1700
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:03,780
Man, I'm tired.

1701
01:09:04,309 --> 01:09:05,380
You got bored?

1702
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:07,380
- "You got bored?"
- "You got bored?"

1703
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,650
(Yes.)

1704
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,550
It's not easy when you're old.

1705
01:09:11,789 --> 01:09:13,490
- He's too old.
- You must want to be seven again.

1706
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:16,059
I'm jealous of your age.

1707
01:09:16,059 --> 01:09:17,660
(Jealous)

1708
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,400
But it won't be easy.

1709
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:24,499
You need to study, go to middle school,
go to high school,

1710
01:09:24,599 --> 01:09:27,869
make friends, go to work,
find a girlfriend,

1711
01:09:28,169 --> 01:09:31,240
- and serve your parents.
- Right.

1712
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,139
- Life is tough, Jace.
- What are you saying to him?

1713
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,110
- Yes, that's true.
- Jace?

1714
01:09:37,349 --> 01:09:38,479
He says it's true.

1715
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:39,780
Is that right?

1716
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,519
He's seven, but he's mature.

1717
01:09:42,249 --> 01:09:44,289
When he said you weren't a pro,

1718
01:09:44,289 --> 01:09:46,019
- No.
- you were offended, weren't you?

1719
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:47,059
"Offended."

1720
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:50,030
- That's not it.
- They're extraordinary.

1721
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:51,729
I can't believe he's teaching me things.

1722
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:54,260
Give me 30 minutes, kids.

1723
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,099
(He's enlightened and tries again.)

1724
01:09:56,099 --> 01:09:57,599
- Sure.
- They're nice kids.

1725
01:09:58,269 --> 01:10:00,700
It's got his style.

1726
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,370
The painting shows his style.

1727
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:04,969
I don't think
I've ever seen you like this.

1728
01:10:04,969 --> 01:10:06,309
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1729
01:10:06,309 --> 01:10:09,780
You're really distracted,
but this is quite surprising.

1730
01:10:10,049 --> 01:10:13,019
- You look different.
- He looks the coolest in his main field.

1731
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,589
I can tell that you're immersed
when you're doing your main job.

1732
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,920
I'm done.

1733
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,019
(He's done in no time.)

1734
01:10:20,019 --> 01:10:21,089
Finished.

1735
01:10:21,089 --> 01:10:22,490
Oh, he's done. Let's check it out.

1736
01:10:23,259 --> 01:10:25,460
- It looks good.
- That's awesome!

1737
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:27,960
Jace. You don't do well with heat.

1738
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,030
(Jace, the youngest
who's easily affected by heat)

1739
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:30,670
Jace's older brother.

1740
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,530
- You got his ears right.
- Yes, the older brother.

1741
01:10:32,799 --> 01:10:34,170
Preston, do you like it?

1742
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,969
- He likes it.
- That's nice.

1743
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,639
- And the handsome guy.
- He drew them so well.

1744
01:10:39,009 --> 01:10:40,339
And then, your names...

1745
01:10:40,839 --> 01:10:43,009
are on the outside and below.

1746
01:10:43,049 --> 01:10:45,710
In English, and then, in Korean.

1747
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:47,820
The letters look so cool.

1748
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,290
- That was Teo's idea.
- Yes, I love it.

1749
01:10:50,889 --> 01:10:53,490
He knows how to add the American touch.

1750
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,830
Who drew this?

1751
01:10:57,589 --> 01:10:59,360
- Who was it?
- Me.

1752
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:01,559
- This is you.
- It's me?

1753
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:05,469
- That must be Teo.
- And that's me? Yes, it's my shirt.

1754
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,500
This is Pani Bottle?

1755
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:10,339
- Are you sure that's a person?
- What's that?

1756
01:11:10,339 --> 01:11:11,910
- Isn't that a prickly pear?
- A prickly pear!

1757
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:15,639
At least he's smiling.

1758
01:11:16,349 --> 01:11:17,780
The eyes resemble mine, though.

1759
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:20,780
That one's you.

1760
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,549
- This is me?
- Yes, he says it's you.

1761
01:11:22,549 --> 01:11:23,820
- My face?
- Oh, it's your face.

1762
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:26,019
(An abstract face)

1763
01:11:26,019 --> 01:11:28,160
What's this?

1764
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,059
- It's this.
- Oh, my Buddhist prayer beads?

1765
01:11:30,059 --> 01:11:31,860
- They're huge.
- He's very observant.

1766
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:34,460
What's this?

1767
01:11:34,799 --> 01:11:35,799
The hair.

1768
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:38,129
- Is this Pani Bottle?
- Yes, his hair.

1769
01:11:38,629 --> 01:11:40,400
- That's a rocket.
- That's a thick head of hair.

1770
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,070
- That feels good.
- This is...

1771
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:46,210
But his face... The hair and the hat.
It's floating?

1772
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:48,379
- Why? Why is it floating?
- Why is the hat above the head?

1773
01:11:48,379 --> 01:11:49,379
You're right.

1774
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:51,179
(Bursting into laughter)

1775
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:53,179
- Because my head is big?
- He loves it.

1776
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:56,820
(Kian84's review made him laugh.)

1777
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,189
- Why is it floating?
- Why are you making fun of me?

1778
01:12:00,889 --> 01:12:01,990
Is this a rocket?

1779
01:12:02,389 --> 01:12:05,330
- It's that...
- Someone should answer him!

1780
01:12:05,429 --> 01:12:07,299
- Good.
- He saw you earlier and drew you.

1781
01:12:07,299 --> 01:12:08,660
- No!
- A rocket?

1782
01:12:09,299 --> 01:12:11,469
I used to draw it like this
back in kindergarten.

1783
01:12:11,469 --> 01:12:13,299
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

1784
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,299
Why?

1785
01:12:15,769 --> 01:12:16,839
Why are you crying?

1786
01:12:17,139 --> 01:12:18,670
What's wrong, Jace?

1787
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:22,040
He got upset that we were laughing
at his painting.

1788
01:12:22,139 --> 01:12:24,710
He misunderstood.
He thought we were making fun of him.

1789
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:27,379
- Right. We weren't, though.
- Oh, boy.

1790
01:12:27,379 --> 01:12:28,450
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

1791
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:31,049
He's so innocent and tender-hearted.

1792
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:34,360
- Did I do something wrong?
- What is it?

1793
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:36,160
(But it somehow seems familiar.)

1794
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,189
What did I do wrong?

1795
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:39,700
(When he gave out pocket money
in Brooklyn...)

1796
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:40,860
(You need to say thank you.)

1797
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:42,870
(No, thank you.)

1798
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:45,929
(He has a record of making kids cry.)

1799
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,670
- What did I do wrong?
- You're making a lot of them cry.

1800
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,170
Why do you make kids cry
everywhere you go?

1801
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:52,979
I didn't. We were all talking about it.

1802
01:12:52,979 --> 01:12:54,339
Yes, we were all talking about it.

1803
01:12:54,339 --> 01:12:56,610
Why do you make kids cry
from all over the world?

1804
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:59,280
No. I didn't do it.

1805
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,349
"I didn't do it."

1806
01:13:00,349 --> 01:13:02,420
(Please tell me it wasn't me, Jace.)

1807
01:13:02,889 --> 01:13:04,849
- You can tell me. It's okay.
- It's okay.

1808
01:13:04,849 --> 01:13:05,849
I'm not crying.

1809
01:13:06,059 --> 01:13:07,189
You're not crying?

1810
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:10,589
I'm checking what kinds of guns there are.

1811
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,530
You're looking at the guns?
He's talking about the guns.

1812
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:14,599
(Looking away at the guns)

1813
01:13:14,629 --> 01:13:16,429
- He's lying.
- It's a cowboy joke.

1814
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,370
He's thinking about
which gun to use to shoot you.

1815
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,400
That was why he was looking at them.

1816
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,210
- He was selecting which gun to use.
- He's thinking of which one to use.

1817
01:13:26,009 --> 01:13:27,040
(Don't kill me.)

1818
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,110
That's how mad he was?

1819
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,379
I'm looking at the guns.

1820
01:13:31,379 --> 01:13:32,719
You're looking at the guns?

1821
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:33,780
I'm looking at the guns.

1822
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,479
(But the trace of tears is too obvious.)

1823
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:36,750
He's not saying it since he's embarrassed.

1824
01:13:37,089 --> 01:13:39,250
- What's the reason?
- He must be sentimental.

1825
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,460
Did we tease him?

1826
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,389
- Is it...
- Is it about your drawing?

1827
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,460
He did his best, but we teased him.

1828
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:49,330
- I think there was a misunderstanding.
- Right.

1829
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:53,099
I was trying to get close to him,

1830
01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:54,740
but I did it the wrong way.

1831
01:13:55,299 --> 01:13:56,870
I understand how he feels.

1832
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:02,740
When I was a student,
I got annoyed when a teacher teased me.

1833
01:14:04,349 --> 01:14:05,750
(Sighing)

1834
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,019
He sighed.

1835
01:14:09,019 --> 01:14:11,049
- He sighed.
- You're branded for your big mistake.

1836
01:14:11,049 --> 01:14:14,320
Gosh. You made a seven-year-old boy sigh.

1837
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,490
But he is...

1838
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:17,629
You revenged him for what he said earlier.

1839
01:14:17,629 --> 01:14:20,830
- What are you saying? Revenge?
- To a seven-year-old boy.

1840
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:21,960
- He's a...
- You won, Kian84.

1841
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,929
No, he really is a smart boy.

1842
01:14:24,469 --> 01:14:26,370
Honestly, I don't know why.

1843
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,200
I don't know the exact reason.

1844
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,469
I'm going to get ready.

1845
01:14:31,469 --> 01:14:33,179
I'm going to prepare things in advance.

1846
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:35,879
(Opening the door)

1847
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,549
I'll load the car...

1848
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:41,019
- and put up the flag.
- Yes.

1849
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:42,990
They got awkward.

1850
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:44,490
(Jace comes out timidly.)

1851
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,990
(Drooped shoulders)

1852
01:14:49,389 --> 01:14:50,490
But he's still following Kian84.

1853
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,629
(Following with a distance)

1854
01:14:51,629 --> 01:14:52,689
Oh, my.

1855
01:14:53,059 --> 01:14:55,160
Let's see what you boys did.

1856
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,330
What did you get? What did we get?

1857
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:00,839
Each one of them drew us, you see.

1858
01:15:00,839 --> 01:15:01,870
Oh, yeah?

1859
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:04,170
They drew you? Oh, JP!

1860
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:06,479
You think that's JP?

1861
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:08,280
His mind is drawn to Jace.

1862
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,650
That's beautiful.

1863
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:13,049
He lowered his head in front of me.

1864
01:15:13,879 --> 01:15:15,620
It made me feel so heavy-hearted.

1865
01:15:17,019 --> 01:15:18,889
- Goodness.
- Why...

1866
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:21,219
That one was such a nice one. If you want,

1867
01:15:21,219 --> 01:15:24,360
keep that one. I guarantee,
if that's for the boys, let them keep it.

1868
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,960
- We can hang that one.
- He says this is so beautiful,

1869
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,830
- so he wants to hang that one.
- Okay.

1870
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,629
Okay. Perfect. Thanks.

1871
01:15:30,629 --> 01:15:31,870
- Perfect.
- That's nice.

1872
01:15:32,299 --> 01:15:33,700
Your painting...

1873
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:35,799
will be hung now as a flag.

1874
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:39,139
(Making peace before putting up the flag)

1875
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,080
(Attaching carefully to the pole)

1876
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:44,780
Let's do it together.

1877
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,549
- Like all one hand.
- Together. Okay.

1878
01:15:46,549 --> 01:15:48,150
You're all right?

1879
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:50,650
(They put up the memory in unison.)

1880
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:53,420
Yes, boys.

1881
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,920
I like the painting.

1882
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,559
You three are left there on the flag.

1883
01:15:57,629 --> 01:15:59,030
That's nice.

1884
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,799
Hey, cowboys! Come here.

1885
01:16:01,799 --> 01:16:03,929
- Pocket money?
- Uncle is giving you pocket money.

1886
01:16:03,929 --> 01:16:04,929
(Giving pocket money as he feels sorry)

1887
01:16:04,929 --> 01:16:07,400
You should give pocket money to the kids.

1888
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,240
- Study hard.
- Thank you.

1889
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,410
All right. Be good to your parents.

1890
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,839
- Here. All right.
- Thank you.

1891
01:16:13,839 --> 01:16:15,580
Jace can't stop crying.

1892
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:16,950
- Is he crying again?
- Yes.

1893
01:16:17,509 --> 01:16:20,280
You need to cover your tears. Come here.

1894
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:21,679
Cover your tears with these.

1895
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,349
Okay.

1896
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,990
- Is it a gift?
- Cover your tears.

1897
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,990
I gave it to him because boys don't cry.

1898
01:16:27,759 --> 01:16:29,420
Good. Real men don't cry often.

1899
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,530
Okay. Good.

1900
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:32,689
- He's so cute.
- All right.

1901
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:35,629
A Texas man doesn't cry.

1902
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,200
You shouldn't cry.

1903
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,330
(However...)

1904
01:16:40,269 --> 01:16:43,009
(Jace leaves as he can't stop crying.)

1905
01:16:43,009 --> 01:16:45,210
Earlier, Jace cried because he was teased,

1906
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:47,379
but now, he cried because he heard
that we were leaving.

1907
01:16:47,379 --> 01:16:48,710
- Because you were saying goodbye.
- Yes.

1908
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:50,809
- He was sad.
- I guess he cried for that reason.

1909
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,450
Please assist me with the interpreter.

1910
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,120
Jace? Come here.

1911
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:01,820
Come here.

1912
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,960
Oh, my.

1913
01:17:05,559 --> 01:17:07,559
(Jace hid himself
because he was sad to say goodbye.)

1914
01:17:07,559 --> 01:17:08,629
Are you okay?

1915
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:09,729
- Yes.
- Yes.

1916
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,629
Come here, Jace.

1917
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:14,900
Uncle is giving you pocket money.

1918
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:17,939
(He wants to give the kid something
as he feels sad.)

1919
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:19,540
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1920
01:17:20,009 --> 01:17:21,580
- He's sweet.
- He said thank you.

1921
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,110
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

1922
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:25,650
- He went to him.
- All right.

1923
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,790
Jace, grow up well.

1924
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:32,049
I'm going back to Korea now.

1925
01:17:33,089 --> 01:17:34,320
Be good to your dad.

1926
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:37,229
Grow up to be a great person.

1927
01:17:38,259 --> 01:17:39,830
He keeps falling into his arms.

1928
01:17:40,599 --> 01:17:44,670
I'm not sure if we'll meet again,

1929
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,500
but that's what all encounters are like.

1930
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,009
(It doesn't mean
that your connection ends here.)

1931
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:54,379
Excuse me. Can I ask you one more thing?

1932
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:55,710
Yes.

1933
01:17:55,979 --> 01:17:58,750
Do you like Uncle Teo...

1934
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,420
- or Uncle Kian94 or Uncle Pani Bottle?
- Seriously.

1935
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,049
- I was just curious.
- Gosh.

1936
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,860
(Which uncle is in your heart, Jace?)

1937
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:12,259
(It's Uncle Kian84!)

1938
01:18:12,259 --> 01:18:13,299
Him.

1939
01:18:13,299 --> 01:18:14,900
- It's Uncle Kian84.
- He's cute.

1940
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:16,830
Is that so?

1941
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,070
Come here.

1942
01:18:20,769 --> 01:18:24,040
- One, two, three, four...
- He has nothing to give other than that.

1943
01:18:24,309 --> 01:18:26,009
I'm giving you ten dollars more.

1944
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,339
Don't tell your brother that you got this.

1945
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:31,580
- Thanks.
- Okay.

1946
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,580
(Kian84 cares about him more.)

1947
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,049
There you go.
I knew you liked me the most.

1948
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,689
- He's giving him another hug.
- He keeps falling into his arms.

1949
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:40,559
They're hugging once again.

1950
01:18:40,559 --> 01:18:42,920
Jace is on my mind.

1951
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,189
He kept approaching me.

1952
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:47,759
The previous day, he caught a grasshopper
and showed it to me.

1953
01:18:47,759 --> 01:18:49,059
Then he showed me the lizard he caught.

1954
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:50,870
He tried to communicate.

1955
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:51,900
(The little cowboy
kept trying to communicate.)

1956
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,439
It was so cute.

1957
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:56,910
(Going through difficulties together...)

1958
01:18:56,910 --> 01:19:00,540
(and laughing together)

1959
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,410
He made me feel a lot of things
although he was little.

1960
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:07,049
I hope he doesn't lose
that pure sentiment as he grows up.

1961
01:19:07,549 --> 01:19:08,849
I wish I had a son like that.

1962
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,120
- He's cute.
- Yes.

1963
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,549
(And...)

1964
01:19:12,549 --> 01:19:13,719
Oh, my.

1965
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:15,990
- They're the boys.
- Oh, my.

1966
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:18,689
All right.

1967
01:19:18,689 --> 01:19:20,929
- He doesn't want you all to go.
- I guess he really feels sad.

1968
01:19:21,059 --> 01:19:23,500
- He's sad that you're leaving.
- Yes.

1969
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,070
- Jace.
- Give him a hug, Jace.

1970
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,170
(They still feel sad
even after hugging many times.)

1971
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:31,040
Be happy.

1972
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,939
He said you're going to be okay.
You're a cowboy.

1973
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:34,639
- He doesn't know when he'll see you next.
- He doesn't want you to leave.

1974
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:35,939
Stop crying.

1975
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,479
He said you all were so much fun.

1976
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:38,580
Is this a gift for me?

1977
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:42,120
- He gave him the snack he was eating.
- Is this a gift for me?

1978
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,589
When a seven-year-old gives you
a snack, that's everything he can give.

1979
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,559
- He's so cute.
- Thank you.

1980
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,530
- He feels sad.
- So cute.

1981
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:53,200
- This is your horse.
- He says we can say goodbye to horses.

1982
01:19:53,429 --> 01:19:54,429
Safety?

1983
01:19:54,559 --> 01:19:55,830
- Seiry.
- Seiry?

1984
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,000
Safety?

1985
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:59,969
Safety. Are you safe?

1986
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:02,969
You have sleep on your eye.

1987
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:04,040
(He cleans the horse's sincerely
even if he can't remember its name.)

1988
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,339
Okay. The other side.

1989
01:20:05,339 --> 01:20:06,410
Great job, buddy.

1990
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:11,110
(Saying goodbye sincerely to the horses)

1991
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:12,379
Have a good life.

1992
01:20:13,049 --> 01:20:14,080
Safety.

1993
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,820
"Safety."

1994
01:20:16,219 --> 01:20:18,189
He wants the horse to live in safety.

1995
01:20:18,889 --> 01:20:20,719
(Meanwhile, Pani Bottle...)

1996
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,889
See that? You didn't get bucked off.

1997
01:20:23,889 --> 01:20:25,759
He got on the horse in one go.

1998
01:20:25,759 --> 01:20:28,400
(Saying goodbye intensely)

1999
01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:31,200
In the past, I thought about...

2000
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,200
becoming a farmer.

2001
01:20:34,339 --> 01:20:36,139
It was a very healthy lifestyle.

2002
01:20:36,139 --> 01:20:37,570
That's what I thought.

2003
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:39,509
I was lucky to have experienced it.

2004
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:43,250
I want to get on again.

2005
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:45,179
Yes, last time.

2006
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,250
How can Teo leave here?

2007
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,849
I think Teo will feel the most sad.

2008
01:20:51,549 --> 01:20:53,049
What if he runs away on that horse?

2009
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:56,629
- He almost did that.
- He was serious.

2010
01:20:56,629 --> 01:20:57,990
He might run away just like that.

2011
01:20:58,259 --> 01:21:00,229
Pani Bottle, let's leave Teo here.

2012
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,629
He seems really sad to leave.

2013
01:21:03,629 --> 01:21:05,769
I don't think he wants to go home.

2014
01:21:05,769 --> 01:21:06,939
(The cowboy is sincere to the end.)

2015
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:10,009
I don't want to leave.

2016
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,439
We feel sad too.

2017
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:13,910
Vaquero!

2018
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:19,250
(My friend who ran with me
like we were one.)

2019
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,290
Thank you for your work.

2020
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:29,689
Time for me to go.

2021
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:31,860
Bye.

2022
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,830
(Pulling himself together)

2023
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:41,639
Did you cry?

2024
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:48,540
It's his back, but I can see
the look on his face.

2025
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,320
(Knowing how genuine he was about this,)

2026
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,990
He grew so attached in a day.

2027
01:21:57,650 --> 01:22:03,019
(they can feel how sad he is
deep inside their hearts.)

2028
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:09,400
Darn it.

2029
01:22:14,469 --> 01:22:16,339
(His genuine emotion explodes.)

2030
01:22:16,339 --> 01:22:17,670
- You know...
- I mean,

2031
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:19,610
it's been a long time since I teared up.

2032
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:21,809
But the tears stopped in an instant.

2033
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,950
- He really didn't want to go back.
- Seriously.

2034
01:22:25,049 --> 01:22:27,019
- That was shocking.
- He stunned me.

2035
01:22:27,019 --> 01:22:28,019
(He really didn't want to leave.)

2036
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:29,679
Darn it.

2037
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:40,599
(As this moment won't come back again,)

2038
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:46,939
(he tears up in sadness.)

2039
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:51,240
I can't believe how I can develop...

2040
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,610
so much affection in such a short time.

2041
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,750
Everything felt like a lie.

2042
01:22:58,009 --> 01:23:00,519
It was a short moment for me.

2043
01:23:00,519 --> 01:23:01,580
(The cowboy life felt like a dream.)

2044
01:23:02,549 --> 01:23:06,420
The cowboy lifestyle was so pure,

2045
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,689
and the emotions I felt there...

2046
01:23:08,689 --> 01:23:10,089
were beautiful.

2047
01:23:10,089 --> 01:23:11,089
(The emotions he felt for the first time)

2048
01:23:11,089 --> 01:23:13,900
And when I said goodbye in the end,

2049
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:25,410
(Precious moments...)

2050
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:27,509
He has that innocence like a true artist.

2051
01:23:27,509 --> 01:23:29,179
(His innocent heart
didn't want to say goodbye.)

2052
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,580
- I can't stop tearing up.
- Oh, no.

2053
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:34,120
I guess he still feels the emotion
he felt back then.

2054
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,120
I see.

2055
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,549
(The memory is still clear.)

2056
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:43,830
I think they have the humanity
I forgot about.

2057
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:44,889
(He felt the humanity he forgot about.)

2058
01:23:45,059 --> 01:23:46,860
Looking at the cowboy ranch,

2059
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:49,700
I got to think a lot about
what romance is.

2060
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:54,040
Insisting on a tradition isn't romance.

2061
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,040
It can bring you more difficulties.

2062
01:23:56,469 --> 01:23:59,670
They're not maintaining it
only for romance.

2063
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,679
I think they're people...

2064
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,280
who live to find balance
and happiness in nature.

2065
01:24:05,809 --> 01:24:09,420
So I think their romance has a reason.

2066
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,920
- Thanks. Keep in touch.
- Yes. Thanks for everything.

2067
01:24:13,349 --> 01:24:14,360
You're a good man.

2068
01:24:14,559 --> 01:24:16,559
Yes, you too. Likewise. Thank you.

2069
01:24:17,129 --> 01:24:18,660
- Adiós.
- I'm going to be back.

2070
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,900
- Yes, sir.
- One day. Yes.

2071
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:24,799
- Adiós!
- Bye!

2072
01:24:24,799 --> 01:24:26,740
- Adiós!
- Ciao!

2073
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:29,439
Jace! Be strong!

2074
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:31,410
Okay!

2075
01:24:32,469 --> 01:24:33,639
Have a good life, Quatro!

2076
01:24:33,979 --> 01:24:35,139
- Bye!
- Bye!

2077
01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:36,439
(Goodbye until we meet again!)

2078
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:41,019
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

2079
01:24:41,019 --> 01:24:42,780
- Goodness, he cried again.
- Oh, no.

2080
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,389
- Jace.
- It's not easy...

2081
01:24:45,389 --> 01:24:46,389
experiencing such a farewell at that age.

2082
01:24:46,389 --> 01:24:48,089
(This summer may have been...)

2083
01:24:48,089 --> 01:24:51,689
(the most memorable summer
of his life yet.)

2084
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:55,000
- Goodness.
- I feel sad.

2085
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:56,929
The people here are so nice.

2086
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:13,150
- I guess it's this song.
- It's the song.

2087
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,780
(This song is...)

2088
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,080
(A song inspired by the cowboy life)

2089
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,620
- It sounds so nice.
- It's going to be released today.

2090
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,620
It's Teo's song.

2091
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,360
(The second song
of Music Adventure by Accident)

2092
01:25:22,519 --> 01:25:27,759
("Texas Summer" by Yoo Teo)

2093
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,559
(The video Teo filmed in Korea)

2094
01:26:00,259 --> 01:26:04,299
(The cowboy life lingers on him.)

2095
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:08,400
(The season colored with romance
they can't forget.)

2096
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:12,170
(It was summer.)

2097
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:13,679
What a summer.

2098
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,410
(The summer in Texas was hot!)

2099
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:18,280
- Texas summer!
- It's so perfect.

2100
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,920
- The song sounds nice too.
- It's catchier than "Dandelion."

2101
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:26,049
Watching your trip and then listening
to the song creates storytelling.

2102
01:26:26,049 --> 01:26:27,189
- Yes.
- It's more touching.

2103
01:26:27,589 --> 01:26:29,620
What we felt together...

2104
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:33,160
was expressed as simply
and honestly as possible.

2105
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:35,860
Although the lyrics are simple,

2106
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:39,200
the song moves our emotions more deeply.

2107
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,240
- It was so nice.
- Right.

2108
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,170
If you go to America for filming,

2109
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:44,710
you can visit them then.

2110
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:47,580
I plan to go there again to help out.

2111
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,740
- You should go.
- They'd be happy to see you again.

2112
01:26:50,179 --> 01:26:51,979
Seeing Teo falling for the cowboy life,

2113
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:55,780
I realized that every person
has a different dream.

2114
01:26:55,879 --> 01:26:58,290
I realized it more seeing Teo.

2115
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:00,360
In fact, as I traveled,

2116
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,420
I got used to meeting
and saying goodbye to people.

2117
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:06,460
But Teo wasn't used to it like I was,

2118
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,360
so that surprised me.

2119
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:11,400
I realized it more seeing how Teo was.

2120
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,540
He had such sincerity.

2121
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:17,710
But I got emotional from the beginning.

2122
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:20,070
I envied their lives so much.

2123
01:27:23,549 --> 01:27:24,910
(The last journey of three brothers)

2124
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,979
(A live bar?)

2125
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:28,820
(Are they making a debut in America?)

2126
01:27:29,019 --> 01:27:30,689
(However...)

2127
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:33,049
(The stage is huge.)

2128
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:36,719
(Can they handle this stage?)

2129
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,389
(The pressure increases.)

2130
01:27:39,389 --> 01:27:41,059
(Is Pani Bottle running away?)

2131
01:27:41,429 --> 01:27:43,000
(Emergencies continue.)

2132
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,070
(The leader feels pressured.)

2133
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:48,339
(I can't step back!)

2134
01:27:48,939 --> 01:27:50,670
(Getting hyped)

2135
01:27:51,269 --> 01:27:52,610
(After frantic efforts,)

2136
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:55,679
(the last part of their journey
in America...)

2137
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:58,379
(is highlighted
by three brothers' debut performance.)

2138
01:27:59,009 --> 01:28:01,080
(And a song that tells
their challenges...)

2139
01:28:01,549 --> 01:28:04,490
(and sung by three of them is created.)

2140
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:06,719
(And the leader alone...)

2141
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,589
(goes somewhere
looking for new inspiration.)

2142
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,960
(Green nature...)

2143
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,530
(and instinctive energy is alive
in the soil.)

2144
01:28:14,629 --> 01:28:15,860
(Jamaica)

2145
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,400
(Reggae teachers everywhere!)

2146
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:21,000
(Please be my teacher.)

2147
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,139
(Follow me.)

2148
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,910
(The reggae teacher's
music training camp...)

2149
01:28:25,410 --> 01:28:27,780
(is in the Blue Mountain rainforest?)

2150
01:28:27,939 --> 01:28:28,939
What's that?

2151
01:28:29,379 --> 01:28:33,309
(Truly original)

2152
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:35,650
(Should I run away?)

2153
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:39,019
(He arrives at a natural waterfall
to train his vocals.)

2154
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:42,019
(Beside the teacher hesitating,)

2155
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:44,929
(the beginner doesn't spare himself.)

2156
01:28:45,259 --> 01:28:46,259
(Shouting)

2157
01:28:47,799 --> 01:28:48,929
(Oh, my)

2158
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,799
(The teacher is deeply moved.)

2159
01:28:51,229 --> 01:28:52,629
(You can be my best pupil.)

2160
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:54,670
(Pupil84 surpasses his teacher.)

2161
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:57,009
(Vocal training in the wilderness)

2162
01:28:57,269 --> 01:28:59,570
(Music Adventure by Accident)
