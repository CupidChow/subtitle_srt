1
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,409
Today is the last trip of Music Adventure
by Accident's big journey.

2
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:23,279
- It's a shame.
- I agree.

3
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,410
Hold on. Who is he?

4
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,080
I thought he was a standing signboard.

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,219
Hi. I'm Lee Si Eon.

6
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,689
(It's been a while.)

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,360
I've always been cheering...

8
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,630
- for Music Adventure by Accident.
- Right.

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,560
I watched the first episode with Kian84.

10
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,060
He caught the premiere.

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,200
Si Eon also took part
in the "Dandelion" challenge.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,229
- Right.
- I did my best...

13
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:47,700
in the challenge.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,700
(Joined the "Dandelion" challenge)

15
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:53,170
(Si Eon voluntarily promoted
the challenge.)

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,639
I'm confused about whether
your Instagram account belongs...

17
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,009
to you or Kian84.

18
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:00,319
The hashtags on the posts you upload...

19
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,120
have Music Adventure by Accident
and catch the premiere.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,319
- You promote the show more than Kian84.
- He's loyal.

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,749
It belongs to Kian84.

22
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:06,819
- Right?
- Yes.

23
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,959
You two are a family to adore him so much.

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,259
You two went to
the Amazon Rainforest together.

25
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:13,800
- Aren't you the first jungle brothers?
- Yes.

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,459
- We are.
- There were unforgettable moments.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,300
After a swim, we were taking a shower.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,899
Kian84 told me the water was clean.

29
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:21,940
I asked where it was from,
and it was from the Amazon River.

30
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,970
- You remember it clearly.
- Yes.

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,069
Traveling in Jamaica...

32
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,209
reminded me of the Amazon Rainforest.

33
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:30,410
It was like watching
the very first season of this show.

34
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,410
- I agree.
- Me too.

35
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,179
We have Si Eon,
Kian84's trusty backup, here with us.

36
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,319
Kian84 has gone into Jamaica's
mysterious mountains,

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,390
the Blue Mountains.

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,160
Shall we check out
what happened on his last trip?

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,229
Let's go.

40
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,159
One more time.

41
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,659
I think it's enough for me.

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,599
But it was refreshing.

43
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:33,840
(Scrubbing)

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
His hair is so cool.
I want to try that hairstyle.

45
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,539
(Naturally taking a shower in nature.)

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,909
With dreadlocks, the water...

47
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,810
needs to be as strong as that waterfall.

48
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,319
(The water needs to be
as strong as the waterfall.)

49
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,550
(Sitting down)

50
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,289
(Having fun while waiting for him
to finish showering)

51
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,860
(Standing up)

52
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,599
(He puts the camera in his pocket...)

53
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:04,469
(and enters the waterfall.)

54
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,739
- Didn't that hurt your head?
- The water pressure looks too strong.

55
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:10,839
(The strong current makes him leave.)

56
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,170
(Being kind)

57
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,010
(Rummaging)

58
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,580
(It feels empty.)

59
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,320
(What?)

60
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,119
My camera!

61
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,249
(My camera!)

62
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,459
- What is it?
- What happened?

63
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:28,660
- Something has happened.
- What?

64
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,989
(I lost my camera.)

65
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,860
(The camera went missing
in the split second.)

66
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,999
(He was having fun under the waterfall
just a while ago.)

67
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:43,739
(The camera inside his pocket...)

68
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,140
(fell into the water.)

69
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,209
Oh, no.

70
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:48,980
(fell into the water.)

71
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,950
No!

72
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,519
- My camera!
- Goodness.

73
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,989
(Turning)

74
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,920
(I'll find it for you.)

75
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:03,660
My camera!

76
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,830
- The current is too strong.
- It's hard to see anything.

77
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,869
(Joseph willingly helps Kian84.)

78
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,469
(The owner desperately searches
the ground.)

79
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,209
(He searches every nook and cranny,)

80
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,040
(but the camera is nowhere to be seen.)

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,339
And the water is murky too.

82
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,950
I have had this thing
since "Adventure by Accident."

83
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,880
When my travel mates leave...

84
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,619
or when I'm alone,
the camera becomes my friend.

85
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:30,719
I talk to it.

86
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:32,760
Since Teo and Pani Bottle left,

87
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,920
the only friend I had left was the camera.

88
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,360
So it was like losing my best friend.

89
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,200
Right. The camera had all your memories.

90
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,600
My family and friend
got lost in the water,

91
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,869
and I had no idea where it was.

92
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,640
Where did you go?

93
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,100
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,110
(Where did you go? I'm sorry.)

95
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,080
Please.

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,110
(Please.)

97
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:58,880
(They desperately search for his friend)

98
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,350
(but it's nowhere to be seen.)

99
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,660
- I thought it got washed away.
- You should still find it.

100
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,160
(Blinking)

101
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
(On the verge of the memories formatting)

102
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:13,730
No.

103
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:18,069
I bid farewell with that camera
at the Uyuni Salt Flat.

104
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,639
Kian84 treasured the camera
more than he treasured the people.

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,540
Where did it go? Good grief.

106
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:27,309
(Staggering)

107
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,910
(Instead of Kian84
who is not steady from the shock,)

108
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,480
(Joseph searches for it
while flipping his dreadlocks.)

109
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,220
(Diligently looking for it
in the strong current.)

110
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,860
(Pulling up)

111
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,989
(Could it be?)

112
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,069
(He caught something with his hair.)

113
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,600
(The camera)

114
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,100
(Amazed)

115
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,239
- Look.
- Joseph found it.

116
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,340
- It got caught in his hair.
- Nice.

117
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,410
(Fascinated)

118
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,050
(The camera was lost in the water.)

119
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:06,379
(It got saved by the dreadlocks.)

120
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,189
(I found you)

121
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:12,090
(Walking over to deliver the good news.)

122
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,119
(Hey)

123
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,819
Goodness. You found it?

124
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:18,389
(I found it)

125
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:19,460
You found it?

126
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,530
(Feeling proud)

127
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:21,629
Wow!

128
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,629
- Thank you.
- I had already given up.

129
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,030
- You two must've grown closer.
- Thank you.

130
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,300
(Smiling)

131
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,699
(Reunited with his friend)

132
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,739
Thank you.

133
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:32,369
(Laughing)

134
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,809
I thought finding it would be impossible,

135
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,610
but Joseph pulled it up with his hair.

136
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:41,449
How he found it like that
is still a big mystery to me.

137
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,090
There's this thing called
spoonworm fishing.

138
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,160
Two gaffs are dropped into the mud flat
and dragged up.

139
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,929
The spoonworms
would be caught on the gaffs.

140
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,530
- That's how it's done.
- Like spoonworm fishing?

141
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,530
Joseph's...

142
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,369
spoon-worm-gaff-dreadlocks
found my camera.

143
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,770
It was amazing.

144
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,340
I never thought we'd find it.

145
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:04,069
(Laughing)

146
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,110
Joseph!

147
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,610
- Thank you, Rothman.
- No problem.

148
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,439
Okay, let's go.

149
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,879
(Calling the hero whatever he wants.)

150
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,780
(Now they head to Joseph's house.)

151
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:15,850
(Rustling)

152
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,720
Do you know what this is?

153
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,920
- No. What's this?
- It's peach.

154
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,889
"It's peach?" I see.

155
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,160
(Taking a bite of Jamaican peach)

156
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:26,829
It tastes just like Korean peach.

157
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,270
- Was it sweet?
- Slightly less than Korean peaches.

158
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,939
- My country farms peach.
- Peach?

159
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:34,999
- Yes.
- Okay.

160
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,670
They're very big.

161
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,710
Big. These are natural.

162
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,179
- No chemical. No fertilizer.
- I see.

163
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,809
(Organic)

164
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,850
(Heading to Joseph's house
in clean Jamaica)

165
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,850
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

166
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,389
- Does your camera still work?
- Yes.

167
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:56,429
Okay.

168
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,759
You must've been so happy.

169
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,829
You're a very lucky man.

170
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,100
I'm blessed.

171
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,230
- Your hair...
- Yes?

172
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,230
- Your hair fished it.
- Yes.

173
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,600
- It fished my camera up.
- Yaman.

174
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
(Wild)

175
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,139
Unbelievable.

176
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:11,509
(Laughing)

177
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:14,679
- You found it.
- Yes.

178
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,079
- It's a very important camera.
- Yes.

179
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,119
It was so heavy.

180
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,090
Rothman. Thank you!

181
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,319
- He's not Rothman.
- His name isn't Rothman.

182
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,319
Do many people shampoo...

183
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,530
- in the waterfall?
- Yes.

184
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,559
Wow.

185
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,960
- I'll tell them not to take a camera.
- The camera?

186
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,600
(Laughing)

187
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,270
- Your English has gotten a lot better.
- Right?

188
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,309
- You can fully communicate with him.
- He's almost a native speaker.

189
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,939
- I know, right?
- Anyone can do it.

190
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:46,480
I'll teach you some English
next time, Si Eon.

191
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,509
Si Eon, do you know what
"Like a Friend" means?

192
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:51,980
- "Like a Friend."
- "Like a Friend."

193
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:57,189
(A trio song, "Like a Friend")

194
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,449
(I like a friend.)

195
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,489
(No, just like a friend.)

196
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:05,360
(Kian84 made everyone laugh
with the wrong translation.)

197
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,499
Si Eon, do you know what
"Like a Friend" means?

198
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,270
- "Like a Friend."
- "Like a Friend."

199
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,629
- I like you?
- It's the same answer.

200
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,270
- You've got a strong opponent.
- They're the same.

201
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,999
- Am I wrong?
- They sure are friends.

202
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,170
- "Like a Friend."
- You two are like a friend.

203
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,410
I like you.

204
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,340
- Isn't that what it means?
- These two are like a friend.

205
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,009
- What does it mean?
- Just like a friend.

206
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
I see.

207
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,480
(True best friends)

208
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,620
(Continuously driving...)

209
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,760
(deep into the Blue Mountains)

210
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,459
- So I park here.
- Okay.

211
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:39,189
Then we walk up.

212
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:40,760
This is the parking lot.

213
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,959
- I see.
- Yes.

214
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,469
Thank you for driving us.

215
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,640
So when you see Blue Mountain Coffee,
it's these.

216
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,439
These are green now.

217
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,079
- When they ripen,
- Yes?

218
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,679
- they become red.
- Red.

219
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,910
- Do you harvest when it's red?
- Yes.

220
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,479
- You harvest when it's red.
- Oh, my.

221
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:02,319
He grows coffee in his front yard.

222
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:04,349
So that's the coffee plant.

223
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:06,990
Blue Mountain Coffee
is one of the world's top three coffees.

224
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,890
They're also called the King of Coffee.

225
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,689
- One of the world's top three. I see.
- It's one of the world's top three.

226
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:16,229
It's grown in high-altitude areas
with abundant soil moisture,

227
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,630
which gives the beans
a rich flavor and aroma.

228
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,300
(It's famous for its smooth flavor
with no bitterness.)

229
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,670
- That's...
- I wonder how it smells.

230
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,069
What season catch?

231
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:26,709
What's... By September.

232
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,510
- Do you harvest in September?
- Yes.

233
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,849
- In September.
- I see.

234
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:31,209
(On the way, he also
checked out some coffee.)

235
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,420
School of Vision?

236
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
- There is school?
- Yes.

237
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,819
- School of Vision.
- Wow.

238
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,020
- School of Vision.
- School of Vision.

239
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,189
Rasta Camp.

240
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:43,859
- Rasta Camp.
- Rasta.

241
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:46,089
I thought it was a school
but it was a camp.

242
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,459
You get to experience
the Rastafarian life.

243
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:50,870
It's like the Cheonghak-dong Village,

244
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,030
- or a temple experience.
- A temple retreat!

245
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,069
I think it's something
like a temple retreat.

246
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,510
Rasta Camp.

247
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,439
- Yes.
- Rasta Camp. Yes.

248
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,109
Yes, so you're now climbing 700 steps.

249
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:05,750
- Seven hundred steps?
- Seven hundred steps from here.

250
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,620
It's not bad. It's 70 steps.

251
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,620
That's not bad at all.

252
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,689
You're fit.

253
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,490
The air feels fresh.

254
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,660
(He starts with a huge misunderstanding.)

255
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,589
This is the track to my home.

256
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,359
Your home. Thank you.

257
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,130
Joseph, are you 46?

258
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,030
- I'm 49.
- Oh, 49.

259
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,640
- Forty-nine.
- My goodness.

260
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,640
He was older than I thought.

261
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,309
He looked so young.

262
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:32,510
He's a big brother.

263
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,410
(As he continues to hike diligently)

264
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,179
(Amazed)

265
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:39,920
(Something makes him laugh.)

266
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:41,150
- My gosh.
- Beautiful.

267
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:42,849
Very beautiful.

268
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,689
- Way over there is where I live.
- It's gorgeous.

269
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,020
When we go up, we will see better.

270
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,530
- My gosh. It's wonderful.
- Yes.

271
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,559
(Setting off again after a short break)

272
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
(Breathing heavily)

273
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:58,400
(Gasping for air)

274
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:59,900
(Breathing heavily)

275
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:04,870
It feels like Porphy...

276
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,309
(Breathing heavily)

277
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:07,839
This reminds me of his home.

278
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,050
(Breathing heavily)

279
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,949
(He was deceived when Porphy said
it would take just ten minutes.)

280
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,290
He said it would only take ten minutes.

281
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,449
- But I walked for an hour.
- You're right.

282
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,459
Let's take a break.

283
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,589
(That day when he laid down
on the endless mountain path.)

284
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,569
People living in the mountains
always say it'll take less time.

285
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:31,599
(I agree)

286
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,870
(Panting continuously)

287
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:39,670
(Sweat glands are widely open)

288
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,740
Tired?

289
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,780
No. No tired.

290
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,880
I found the cameraman so I'm...

291
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,319
I'm power.

292
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,750
Okay. So this is our farm.

293
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,719
- Yes.
- These are raspberries.

294
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,990
- Oh, raspberries.
- Yes.

295
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,390
- Oh, yes.
- Do you want to see them?

296
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:59,429
- What?
- Raspberry.

297
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:00,859
Why is the color different?

298
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,859
Because this isn't ripe yet. This is ripe.

299
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,030
It's ripe.

300
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,870
- So you can eat that.
- Kian84 understands everything.

301
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,240
- I improved a lot.
- How did you understand "ripe?"

302
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,910
- What?
- How did you understand it?

303
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,510
- He spoke in English.
- The color was different.

304
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,540
I see.

305
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,010
- The color changes when it's ripe.
- That's true.

306
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:21,579
(Are there red beans in the bread?)

307
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,050
(Around 50 minutes)

308
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,420
(It's 50 minutes?)

309
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,219
(It's 15 minutes)

310
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,589
(They have a history
of misunderstandings.)

311
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,089
You should travel abroad.

312
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,130
You improved a bit in South America.

313
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:36,929
Yes.

314
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,000
Since no pesticides were used,
they eat them right away.

315
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:42,099
(It's nice)

316
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,740
I liked how we just picked things
and ate on our way.

317
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,140
I loved it.

318
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,479
We did that when we were young.

319
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:50,780
It's sweet and sour.

320
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,550
- Nice. Vitamin C!
- Raspberry.

321
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,420
Yaman. There's a lot of vitamin C.

322
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
Vitamin C!

323
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,790
- See this?
- Yes.

324
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,819
This is hibiscus.

325
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:03,260
- Hibiscus?
- It's good for nerves.

326
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,829
- Nurse?
- Nerves.

327
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:06,699
Like if you're shaking...

328
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,559
- Yes.
- Oh, it's good for palsy.

329
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,630
- How did he understand?
- Yes. It's good for your...

330
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,699
- Steady the nerves.
- I see.

331
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:15,099
When you eat this, your palsy will stop.

332
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:16,870
You boil it and drink like...

333
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,240
- Like tea.
- I should bring it for Simon Dominic.

334
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,609
He has shaky hands.

335
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:23,609
Oh, do I?

336
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,319
- Yes, Simon Dominic has a tremor.
- I guess it's gotten better nowadays.

337
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:28,719
His tremor is quite bad.

338
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,420
- He's always thinking of his friend.
- In Jamaica...

339
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,849
I should've picked some for you.

340
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,359
You should've.

341
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:36,760
I should tell Simon Dominic about it.

342
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,260
I'll tell him to come to Jamaica
and try it.

343
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,329
(He's only thinking
about his wife in Jamaica.)

344
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,069
- We'll reach soon.
- Okay.

345
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,569
Yes.

346
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,199
Oh, this?

347
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,339
Rasta village? Rasta communication?

348
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:50,910
- This is the Rasta Camp.
- We're here.

349
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,380
- Yes.
- Finally.

350
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,209
He truly lives in the nature.

351
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,349
I think they took about 1700 steps.

352
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:58,410
My goodness.

353
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,780
- It's nice.
- Yes.

354
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:02,520
It's nicely decorated.

355
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,150
It looks very nice inside.

356
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:06,290
(The three colors of Rasta,
green, yellow, and red.)

357
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,420
Yes. Greetings.

358
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,329
Nice to meet you.

359
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:14,660
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

360
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:16,929
- Look at their hair.
- Even the kids.

361
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,370
- Yes.
- My goodness.

362
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,140
Yes, you're...

363
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,900
Okay.

364
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:25,069
He needs to suck his fingers later.
Nice to meet you.

365
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,140
(He says hello to the kids first.)

366
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,240
Nice to meet you.

367
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,109
My goodness.

368
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,380
This is the observation deck.

369
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,479
Yaman. This is a cooler spot.

370
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:35,420
- My goodness.
- Yes.

371
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,579
My gosh.

372
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,219
- So you see.
- It's an observation deck.

373
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,660
- After a whopping 700 steps.
- He lives at the top of the mountain.

374
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:42,990
We came from there.

375
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,589
That's where I met you today,
way over there in the clouds.

376
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,000
Gosh, the camp is huge.

377
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,130
It's on the top of the mountain.

378
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,939
(Rasta Camp)

379
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:55,569
Rasta Camp is...

380
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,010
where Rastas live.

381
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,780
It's where they continue
the culture and spirit of Rastafarianism.

382
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,179
(They pray together)

383
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,479
They pursue a natural lifestyle,

384
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,949
farming for themselves
and living simply...

385
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:08,819
through self-sufficiency.

386
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:11,390
This place is a community village
equipped not only with living spaces...

387
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,160
for its members
but also with a place of worship...

388
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,890
and school facilities.

389
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,059
(A community village
where Rastas live together)

390
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:18,089
That's amazing.

391
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:23,630
- All Rastas?
- Yaman. All Rastas.

392
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,630
- Only Rastas live here. Yaman.
- Yes.

393
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:29,170
See. See them here.

394
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,209
- This is the priest and the minister.
- Nice to meet you.

395
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:34,040
- Yaman.
- Yes.

396
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,109
Yes. Rasta.

397
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:38,179
- Yaman.
- Yes.

398
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,120
- Yaman.
- Nice to meet you.

399
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,319
It seems unlikely
that Asians would normally visit.

400
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,219
- I think they're...
- It would be quite unfamiliar to them.

401
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,959
Are you all related?

402
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,059
Are they all your blood family?

403
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,859
No, spiritual family.

404
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,599
Spiritual family.

405
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,000
I thought they were blood-related,

406
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,199
like actual relatives, but they weren't.

407
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:01,640
He said they were a spiritual family.

408
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,040
They're not related by blood
but close as a family.

409
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,109
They're a community with strong bonds.

410
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,839
Some people were born and raised there,

411
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,579
while some joined later
after becoming a Rasta.

412
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:14,219
- Voluntarily, just like that?
- Yes.

413
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,420
So this is the temple.

414
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,050
- Temple.
- Yes.

415
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,260
- This is where we'll worship tonight.
- Okay.

416
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,359
(Rasta temple)

417
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,559
There are a lot of vibrant colors.

418
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,329
All the colors are shouting Jamaica.

419
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,429
This is the school.

420
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,199
- School?
- Yes.

421
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,740
- Oh, this is a school.
- Yes.

422
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:39,770
This is a school for the little children.

423
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,380
Oh, children. Yes.

424
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,880
- From age 3. No, from ages 2 to 6.
- Okay.

425
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:47,420
- Seriously.
- It's a kindergarten.

426
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,280
It's not an official school.

427
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,819
They're cute.

428
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,349
We start them off here
and send them all to...

429
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,959
primary school, high school,

430
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:59,290
- college, and university.
- University, yes.

431
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,300
This is my home.

432
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,200
Your home. Oh, wow.

433
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,200
The place looks so cool.

434
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:07,800
- I raise fish too, you know.
- Fish?

435
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,440
How does he raise fish
at the top of the mountain?

436
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:14,210
- Is it your pet?
- Yes.

437
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,210
It's cute.

438
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,579
These are the small ones.

439
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:19,980
(His camera enters the water again)

440
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,349
These are the small ones.

441
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:22,520
They're guppies!

442
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,919
- Are they his pet?
- They're cute.

443
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:25,990
Do you eat them?

444
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,020
- What?
- Yes.

445
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,419
But they're very small.

446
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,430
They're small, so I eat them
when they get bigger.

447
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,159
- He raises them to eat.
- He waits for them. to grow.

448
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:34,930
(They weren't pets.
They were being raised as future food.)

449
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,629
So this is where I live.

450
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:40,069
This is Joseph's house.

451
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:42,740
- Oh, this is your room.
- Yes.

452
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,240
I was curious about it.

453
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,339
- Thank you for inviting me here.
- You can take off your shoes and come.

454
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,710
- Oh, they take their shoes off.
- It's the same as Korea.

455
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:51,210
This is my home.

456
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,849
- Oh, my!
- Yes.

457
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:54,919
- It smells good.
- Yaman.

458
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:56,050
My wife is here.

459
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,119
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

460
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,659
(She's shy)

461
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,760
- She's in the kitchen.
- She's cooking.

462
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,190
It smells delicious.

463
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,129
- Rice?
- Kitchen. Yes.

464
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:08,930
I like rice.

465
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,230
You like rice?

466
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,770
(He's drawn to the kitchen
by the smell of rice.)

467
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,800
What kind of rice is this?

468
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,099
- What rice?
- Turmeric rice.

469
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:17,210
- Turmeric rice.
- Turmeric rice?

470
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,040
- It looks tasty.
- Nice. Turmeric rice.

471
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,240
It looks delicious.

472
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,740
Thank you for inviting me.

473
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:24,510
Thank you very much for the invite.

474
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,020
They both look so kind.

475
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:28,980
- Do you want a banana?
- Yes.

476
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,349
- We've got a pineapple too.
- Okay.

477
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:32,690
I like bananas.

478
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,359
- I will eat rice.
- Yes.

479
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,819
- Thank you.
- Yaman.

480
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,629
We have a pear, we have a tomato.

481
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:41,359
We have... All of these
came out from the farm.

482
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,260
- Your farm. Yes.
- Yaman.

483
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,099
- My goodness.
- He harvests.

484
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,369
(He has a bunch of fresh fruits
harvested in front of his house.)

485
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,740
It's completely self-sufficient.
They grow their food and eat it.

486
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,540
They cultivate everything they eat.

487
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,109
- They cultivated it all?
- It's all self-sufficient.

488
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:56,809
(Rastafarians maintain an organic life.)

489
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:59,079
- Jamaica tomatoes.
- Do you want some pineapple too?

490
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,619
- No, I'm okay.
- Okay.

491
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:04,089
Joseph is offering so many things.

492
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:05,190
(He offers everything.)

493
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,720
- Good. Nice.
- Nice.

494
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
(Taking a bite)

495
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,290
- Is this your bed?
- Yes.

496
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:12,829
If you want, you can sleep here tonight.

497
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,260
No.

498
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,559
(Laughing)

499
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,230
(Letting out a contagious laugh)

500
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,770
(Why are they laughing?)

501
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,139
That's just like a guest bed.

502
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:24,740
But it's still...

503
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,010
My wife's bed is in there.

504
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,480
- A big bed.
- A big bed, I see.

505
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,450
Since it's a house used by a couple,
I feel a bit awkward.

506
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:35,379
We have a guest house too, you know?

507
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,980
- A guest house?
- Yaman.

508
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,190
He even has a guest house?

509
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:42,589
I think it would be better
if I slept in the guest house.

510
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,530
(Laughing)

511
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,790
I wanted to spend the night there.

512
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,430
They had a whole house for guests,

513
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:51,500
so I asked if I could sleep there.

514
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,369
They could get into a quarrel,

515
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:54,839
- him and his wife.
- You never know.

516
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,899
"Why did you invite him?
I feel uncomfortable!"

517
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,440
"I cooked only for two people."

518
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,280
(He chooses to stay in the guest house
for the couple.)

519
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:03,809
Do you do pull-ups?

520
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:07,319
- Do you do pull-ups?
- Yes, it's my exercise.

521
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:08,980
- So you do pull-ups?
- Yes.

522
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,649
There was a reason why he was built.

523
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,119
There's a home gym here too.

524
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,319
I think it'll break.

525
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,260
Pull-up.

526
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:18,790
- You have to show him.
- Show off!

527
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,300
One, two,

528
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,730
- three,
- Nice.

529
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,970
four, five.

530
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,800
(Laughing)

531
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,970
I'm tired.

532
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,139
(You're good)

533
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:33,139
Yaman.

534
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:34,309
(His pull-up skills are quite good.)

535
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:35,510
It wasn't bad.

536
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:36,609
(Eating)

537
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,079
How many can you do?

538
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:40,919
Two, three.

539
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,819
- My gosh, five,
- Wow.

540
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:46,750
six, seven,

541
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,159
eight, nine, ten.

542
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,260
He's too good.

543
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,359
- My gosh. Good.
- Okay.

544
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,159
(He's a pull-up master.)

545
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,700
- You're so strong.
- Yaman.

546
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,569
He's like the Jamaican Dex.

547
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:58,930
You can sit down if you want.

548
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,440
Yes, sit down. I'm...

549
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,839
Come and relax, man.

550
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,139
(He quickly replenishes his energy
with the banana.)

551
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:05,210
- Oh, thank you.
- Yaman.

552
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,879
I think I’ve eaten
more fruit today than ever.

553
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,450
Oh, no.

554
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,480
No, give me. I'll throw it away for you.

555
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,520
You could just ask him
to throw it away for you.

556
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,950
Did you feel bad asking him?

557
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,649
Visiting his house itself was a favor.
How could I give him trash too?

558
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,520
It's more rude to put
the banana peel in your pocket.

559
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,859
- Exactly.
- It's a food waste.

560
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:25,389
But you're more hygienic now.

561
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:26,389
Of course.

562
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,530
- No, give me. I'll throw it away for you.
- Oh, no.

563
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,369
Why would he throw it away?

564
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,230
He puts the skin in his pocket.

565
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,069
(What an unusual man.)

566
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:38,569
At this hour, after six...

567
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:39,909
what do you usually do before you sleep?

568
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:41,980
We're going to celebrate in the temple.

569
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,579
- Okay, temple.
- Yes. We're going to the temple...

570
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:46,280
at 8 p.m. and celebrate and then...

571
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,319
we eat dinner together.

572
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,119
- So we worship at 9 p.m.
- Yes.

573
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,389
Then I'll go to the guest house.

574
00:23:56,389 --> 00:23:59,790
I'll unpack my bag there.

575
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,829
All right. No problem.

576
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,099
See you soon.

577
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:03,359
- All right.
- See you soon.

578
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,369
Take it out and leave it here, please.

579
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:08,169
All right. We're going to
your guest house. Come.

580
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,839
My gosh. Big natural!

581
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,710
Yes, man. We used to have
a tree house here.

582
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,710
But because of the hurricane...

583
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:19,879
- Hurricane.
- The hurricane blew it away.

584
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:22,280
- My goodness.
- The hurricane blew it away.

585
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,020
Yes, this is the guest house.

586
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,190
Is that the guest house?

587
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,220
It would've been nice
if there were people from other countries.

588
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,389
But it was only me.

589
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,030
This is where you'll stay tonight.

590
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,129
- Oh, yes. Thank you!
- Yaman.

591
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:36,260
There's a lot inside.

592
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,329
There's no electricity here.

593
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:38,329
Oh, thank you.

594
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,970
Is there no electricity?

595
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:42,540
Yes, we have solar.

596
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,169
A solar generator.

597
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:46,409
- Yes.
- There's no electricity.

598
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:49,710
Shall we meet at 8 p.m.?

599
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,379
- Yaman.
- I'll take a short break.

600
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:54,450
- Yaman, that's it. All right.
- Yes.

601
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,550
(Waving)

602
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,720
Tired man. All right.

603
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,020
(Screaming)

604
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
(Groaning)

605
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,059
He's exhausted.

606
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,290
(Groaning)

607
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,430
(Groaning)

608
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,629
(Laughing)

609
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:10,399
(He takes a short break
to charge his energy.)

610
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,839
(Before he knew it, the sun had set.)

611
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,869
(Rasta Camp has turned dark.)

612
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,270
(Pitch-black)

613
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,639
It's pitch-black.

614
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,210
(He's not a ghost.)

615
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,280
There's no light.

616
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,750
I've been to so many...

617
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:31,990
corners of the world.

618
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,819
Like floss, reaching into every nook
and cranny between the teeth.

619
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,990
I've traveled around many countries.

620
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,030
I thought about it.

621
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,399
(In the darkness, he goes on
a Memory Adventure by Accident.)

622
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,399
Porphy of Bolivia,

623
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:46,829
(My Bolivian friend, Porphy)

624
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:48,639
Porphy Junior,

625
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,240
Porphy's wife,

626
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:54,139
and Porphy's sister.

627
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:58,109
The guest house owners of Peru.

628
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,419
I remember Si Eon
who cooked seaweed soup for me.

629
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:04,119
- Mother Si Eon.
- Look at my hair.

630
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,349
CEO Modi.

631
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:07,520
(His Indian friend, CEO Modi)

632
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,319
The female CEO who wore a fried egg dress.

633
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,329
A fried egg.

634
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:12,659
We almost died...

635
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,899
camping above 4000m sea level.

636
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:18,899
- The crying monk.
- My goodness.

637
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:20,230
And the saliva monk.

638
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:22,740
He walked back to all his trips.

639
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:27,379
Yerpe and Flora of Madagascar.

640
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,510
He made a lot of friends.

641
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,710
The smiling whale...

642
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:35,050
I'm curious if it's traveling in the sea.

643
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:39,220
I remember the food we had
at Madagascar University.

644
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,389
We went to various places.

645
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,290
Maybe it's time for me to go.
I'm being reminded of all the trips.

646
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,730
The guest house makes you
walk back to your past.

647
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,200
I'd been lying there for an hour,

648
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,369
or maybe two hours.

649
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,069
There was no light and it was humid.

650
00:26:58,069 --> 00:26:59,409
- It was hot.
- There were mosquitos too.

651
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,780
So I could only stare at the ceiling.
There's no line there.

652
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,550
Looking at the ceiling, I could only...

653
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,879
- do that alone.
- You were reminded of your trips.

654
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,980
I was okay yesterday, but...

655
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:12,419
being alone is lonely.

656
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,520
I don't think I can sleep alone here.

657
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:20,960
If it's not too impolite,

658
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,230
I think it'd be better to sleep on the bed
that Joseph suggested.

659
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,639
I think I'll see a ghost here.

660
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,109
(Escaping before seeing a Jamaican ghost)

661
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,740
The fear of being judged
was overpowered by my fear.

662
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:37,710
- Joseph?
- Yaman.

663
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,750
Come in. Take off your shoes.

664
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,589
Well, the guest house...

665
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:49,359
is very scary. Scream.

666
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,159
- You can sit down.
- Sorry.

667
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,290
- I will make you something.
- Yes.

668
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,829
He packed and brought his bags.

669
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,099
- He came back with all his things.
- He did.

670
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:58,369
He was seriously scared.

671
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:00,270
He has everything with him,
even the banana skin.

672
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:03,169
Today, I live here.

673
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,809
- You can stay here. Yaman.
- Thank you.

674
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,139
- That's okay.
- It's so scary there.

675
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,540
This house is very lonely.

676
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,780
Lonely and scream. Scared.

677
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,750
- Yes, scary.
- Scary.

678
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,250
Oh, well.

679
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,760
- I was so scared back there.
- So I told you to stay here.

680
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,460
I look ghost!

681
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,990
(I saw a ghost!)

682
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,159
- So you can sit down.
- Sorry.

683
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,389
I will make you something.

684
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:32,069
I will make you some juice
and guacamole with avocado.

685
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,599
Guacamole is delicious.

686
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,300
(He's making a snack for Coward84.)

687
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,740
He's using fruits again. Okay.

688
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,669
This is the peach
we got from the waterfall.

689
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,809
- Oh, from the waterfall.
- Is it a peach juice?

690
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:47,079
- My gosh.
- I bet it was really fresh.

691
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,450
(Grinding with water in the mixer)

692
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,419
I think the main food there is fruits
instead of carbohydrates.

693
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:52,550
Seriously, they only eat fruits.

694
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,750
Yes, only fruits.

695
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,020
- Plenty of vitamin C.
- Seriously.

696
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,059
He's putting in ginger too.

697
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,990
With peach and star fruit...

698
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,000
- Ginger.
- Star fruit?

699
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:04,530
Is that a star fruit?

700
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,000
It's a tropical fruit
that looks like a Korean melon.

701
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,669
As it gets ripe, it becomes sweet.

702
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,440
- It looks pretty.
- It does.

703
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
You can taste it.

704
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:13,839
- Eat it?
- Yes, eat it.

705
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:15,109
It's unusual.

706
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,879
It tastes like a tangerine.

707
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,879
I grow that right here.

708
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,619
(A finely blended, truly organic juice)

709
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,889
Is there anything I can help?

710
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,790
(He wipes it down.)

711
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,300
Wife? Here?

712
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,669
- What's your name?
- Lisa.

713
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:45,210
- Lisa, yes.
- Lisa?

714
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:48,480
You have the same name
as Lisa from BLACKPINK. You know?

715
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,210
Why would you mention BLACKPINK there?

716
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,349
My goodness.

717
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,379
- Lisa!
- Lisa.

718
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:56,980
- Does he know?
- No.

719
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,020
Finding common ground.

720
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:01,419
Wash your hands. Wash your hands first.

721
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:05,260
Crush this.

722
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,290
- This is where you will crush...
- Okay.

723
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,760
- the guacamole.
- Okay.

724
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:13,899
- It's avocado.
- Avocado. It was light and clean.

725
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:16,270
- This is tomato and onion.
- Yes.

726
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,970
- That's nice.
- It's delicious.

727
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,940
- Did he harvest those himself?
- Yes.

728
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,280
There's no need
to purchase groceries then.

729
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:24,379
That looks delicious.

730
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:26,010
(He adds various spices like an expert.)

731
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,450
(Satisfied)

732
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:33,349
(While Joseph
quickly prepares the food...)

733
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:34,720
So he puts that on top of it.

734
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,490
(Well...)

735
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,260
Aren't we not having rice today?

736
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:43,430
- No rice?
- She was cooking turmeric rice earlier.

737
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,669
He didn't serve that to me.

738
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,129
We're going to eat rice later.

739
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,500
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, when we come back from chanting.

740
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,770
- Okay.
- Oh, later.

741
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,770
I'll digest this really fast.

742
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,579
He looks pale.

743
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:56,940
He thought they were going to eat...

744
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,379
- the next day.
- He looks so thin.

745
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,720
I only ate fruits. That drove me crazy.

746
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,280
I felt a sour taste.

747
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:06,790
- But your face looks better.
- It does look better.

748
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,760
You eat a lot of food like me.

749
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:12,089
(So please give me some rice.)

750
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,599
(Glancing)

751
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,369
Joseph is amazing.
He's vegan and he only eats fish...

752
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,300
but he has such a good body.

753
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,339
(Natural-made muscles)

754
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,240
(Feeling shy)

755
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:28,510
- This is for you.
- Okay.

756
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:30,379
(Fruit juice as well)

757
00:31:30,379 --> 00:31:31,379
Thank you.

758
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:32,980
- You can sit.
- Fruit juice.

759
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,480
This really is the vegan life.

760
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,290
(He drinks juice first.)

761
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:43,159
It tastes good.

762
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Thank you.

763
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,530
What about your wife?

764
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,059
Jennie?

765
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:50,030
- Jennie?
- Did you eat?

766
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,829
- It's Lisa.
- Come on.

767
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,639
Lisa became Jennie.

768
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,540
He gave them new names.

769
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,740
(Laughing)

770
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:02,510
- Lisa.
- Oh, Lisa.

771
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,740
I'm sorry.

772
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,750
Lisa.

773
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,609
Do you have a girlfriend named Jennie?

774
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:09,950
- No.
- No.

775
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,450
(Jennie is just...)

776
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,690
(someone who he's always proud of.)

777
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:19,760
(A phone friend who he talked to
on the phone just once.)

778
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,559
Right.

779
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,930
(That's funny)

780
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,430
Thank you for the food.

781
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,500
Thank you.

782
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,200
Let's eat together, Lisa.

783
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:35,510
(He tries the guacamole first.)

784
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,809
- Do you like it?
- It's delicious.

785
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,119
Come and try this.

786
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,149
(Sweet Joseph cares about his wife.)

787
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:45,190
(Enjoying)

788
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,020
(Hold on)

789
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,359
Spicy. It's very spicy.

790
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,430
It's cayenne pepper.

791
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,200
Cayenne pepper...

792
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,869
is cultivated in subtropical regions
of Central and South America.

793
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,869
It's much spicier
than Korean chili pepper.

794
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:01,339
(I eat it often.)

795
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,540
(Coughing)

796
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,909
(The spicy taste came up.)

797
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:09,909
Is it...

798
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:10,980
(Coughing)

799
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:13,849
- The cayenne pepper is hot.
- Cayenne pepper.

800
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:15,619
You put in too much, right?

801
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,680
(Coughing)

802
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,290
- Gosh.
- Doesn't he eat that every day?

803
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,419
He put in too much.

804
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,059
- He's crying.
- Cayenne pepper...

805
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,790
(Coughing)

806
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,030
Sorry.

807
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:29,599
(I can't help it.)

808
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:31,869
I thought he added a lot
because he liked spicy food.

809
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,000
(Eating)

810
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,700
(He's at peace alone.)

811
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,010
(He comes back with a towel.)

812
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,639
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

813
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,210
(Laughing)

814
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,480
Man.

815
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:49,720
That pepper...

816
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,290
It's my time.

817
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:53,819
The one by the waterfall was your time.

818
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:56,020
(Laughing)

819
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,490
We took a shower together.

820
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:02,599
- Water.
- Yes.

821
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:05,770
I lost my camera.

822
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,700
And Joseph...

823
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:09,839
used his hair...

824
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:11,440
to fish it out.

825
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,609
(Joseph fished it with his hair.)

826
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:14,010
- Hair fishing.
- She understood.

827
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,180
Yes. He said it right.

828
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,680
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

829
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,409
(Laughing)

830
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:21,079
She burst into laughter.

831
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,079
(Why...)

832
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,079
Why does she like it so much?

833
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,190
You're having fun.

834
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,290
(He fished out the camera.)

835
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:29,319
(Falling behind)

836
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:31,530
She's reacting so well.

837
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,659
Seriously.

838
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,500
It's nice to hear her laugh.

839
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,569
It's nice that she's laughing
when it wasn't such a funny story.

840
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,300
I bet you were content.

841
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,169
(Joseph and Lisa laugh a lot.)

842
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,710
(He also laughs with them.)

843
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,040
How long have you been married?

844
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,280
Eight years.

845
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,780
- Eight?
- Yes.

846
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,980
Forty years? Where did you two meet?

847
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,720
We met at Nyabinghi.

848
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,520
We met there.

849
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,790
Oh, yes?

850
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,220
Did you make a move?

851
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,960
Did you make the first move?

852
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:05,760
She did.

853
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,129
He understands everything.

854
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:09,329
(He understands Kian84's English.)

855
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:11,430
I think she should tell the story.

856
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,700
Let her tell you the story.

857
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,099
Well.

858
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:17,669
A bus came,

859
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:21,579
and I saw him come out of the bus.
He came out of the bus and stood up.

860
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,240
(Standing up)

861
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,579
He's tall.

862
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,819
- Yes, like King Kong.
- King Kong.

863
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:32,450
- King Kong.
- King Kong.

864
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,159
(King Kong Joseph
who Lisa fell in love with)

865
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:36,659
It makes sense.

866
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:37,659
(Muscular)

867
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:40,059
Like...

868
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:42,899
- Like King Kong.
- King Kong.

869
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:46,000
I was like...

870
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,139
- Right.
- The's the one.

871
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:49,839
(I like him.)

872
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:51,510
That was it.

873
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,609
She told the story very well.

874
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,740
Wow. Congratulations.

875
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,609
Even today, he's still my King Kong.

876
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,550
I can feel the love.

877
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,149
- He's feeling the spice.
- He keeps wiping his face.

878
00:36:06,149 --> 00:36:07,959
- King Kong is feeling the spice.
- He keeps crying and drooling.

879
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:09,859
(Laughing)

880
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:11,359
Sweet.

881
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,930
Sweet King Kong.

882
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,560
(Laughing)

883
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,330
This is crazy.

884
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,669
She's enjoying it so much.

885
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:19,899
Lisa is driving me crazy.

886
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:24,240
Joseph's house was interesting.

887
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:27,039
My grandparent's house
was in Taehwa-dong, Ulsan.

888
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:30,680
I could smell the Ulsan house smell
from there.

889
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:33,609
There's a scent
that Gyeongsang-do houses have.

890
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,979
The smell of wardrobes
of Gyeongsang-do grandmothers.

891
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,720
- You smelled that there?
- Yes.

892
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,850
Was it not the smell of the banana peel
inside your pocket?

893
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:42,490
(Was that what it was?)

894
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,629
Well...

895
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:47,930
Seeing them laugh made me laugh.

896
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,370
It was very humane.

897
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:56,039
You were in an unfamiliar place,
but it didn't feel unfamiliar.

898
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,870
- That's right.
- Right, the cozy sensation.

899
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,109
- Yaman.
- Yaman.

900
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:05,510
That's Jamaican people's favorite word.
"Yaman."

901
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,149
- Yaman.
- What's yaman?

902
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:09,450
- What does it mean?
- Something like "good."

903
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,189
They pronounce "man" like that.

904
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,249
It uses "yes," so it's yaman?

905
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:16,919
- What does it mean?
- It means everything is okay.

906
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,959
- Everything is okay.
- It's a positive word.

907
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,990
- Right.
- Yaman.

908
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,399
This is yaman.

909
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,459
(The guacamole is nice!)

910
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,499
We should go.

911
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:31,839
It's time to go. Let me get dressed.

912
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,640
- It's time.
- I'll come back soon. I'll get dressed.

913
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,479
Shouldn't I change into better clothes
if we're going to a service?

914
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,180
(He quickly got changed.)

915
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,450
- Hold on.
- What's that?

916
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,749
He looks hip no matter what he wears.

917
00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:44,749
That's cool.

918
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,620
He wore white clothes.

919
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,950
(He wore white clothes.)

920
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,859
You're a fashionista.

921
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:51,890
Let's get the clothes.

922
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:53,959
It looks cool.

923
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:55,459
Fashionista King Kong.

924
00:37:55,629 --> 00:37:57,260
Fashionista King Kong.

925
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,439
- Fashion show model.
- He looks good.

926
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:02,970
- Ready to go?
- Okay. I'm ready.

927
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,709
They always have service in the evenings.

928
00:38:06,939 --> 00:38:09,839
It's the most important ritual...

929
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:11,479
for the Rastafarians.

930
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,680
I'm quite interested...

931
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,180
in religious things like funerals.

932
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,550
Right, you went last time too.

933
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:20,249
I told him I wanted to see it,
and I went with him.

934
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,490
- We're going into the temple now.
- Okay.

935
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:29,260
(They enter the temple.)

936
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,629
There are lots of people.

937
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,140
Take off your shoes and your socks.

938
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:42,140
- Barefoot? This place...
- He became very serious.

939
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,140
Yes.

940
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:46,249
They're all wearing white clothes.

941
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:47,709
Have a seat.

942
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,919
(The Rastafarians show their respect
by wearing white clothes.)

943
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:51,419
They can only wear white clothes.

944
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:54,350
Everyone in the village had gathered.

945
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,330
- This is the big man.
- The big man.

946
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,430
That's the priest.

947
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,399
He's the one who officiates everything.

948
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:02,430
The priest.

949
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:04,999
- Thank you for having us.
- You're welcome.

950
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,439
(He greets him and enters.)

951
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:10,499
Bless all.

952
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
(They're all happy
even in the reverent atmosphere.)

953
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,510
It's not a heavy atmosphere.

954
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,310
There's a red carpet.

955
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,819
(There is a mysterious red carpet...)

956
00:39:22,419 --> 00:39:23,479
(and a bonfire burning next to it.)

957
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:25,649
They light it before they pray.

958
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,819
It's a spiritual fire.

959
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,589
This fire purifies the atmosphere.

960
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:31,660
I see.

961
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:35,359
The temple was like a ssireum stadium.

962
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,999
You had to go barefoot.
That was interesting.

963
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,399
They had lit up a bonfire,

964
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,999
and they were all dressed in white too.

965
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,169
I was excited about experiencing...

966
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:48,640
a new culture.

967
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,039
(Excited about the new culture)

968
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,410
I should at least wear a white shirt.

969
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,410
(Looking around)

970
00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:56,149
(He follows the dress code
out of courtesy.)

971
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,089
I'll keep Buddha away for now.

972
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:01,660
(Putting the Buddhist
prayer beads on his wrist.)

973
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,089
(Chanting)

974
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:07,160
(The service begins
with the priest's chant.)

975
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,959
(Standing up)

976
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,830
(Jah! Rastafari.)

977
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,640
(They start praying rapidly
in a mysterious language.)

978
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:21,370
(He can't dare to interrupt it
in this atmosphere.)

979
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,510
(Gulping)

980
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,249
It's about thanking their god
and nature...

981
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:27,749
and returning to nature.

982
00:40:27,749 --> 00:40:30,319
It was something like that.

983
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,459
(After offering their thanks,)

984
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,430
(they all stand up.)

985
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,399
What?

986
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:47,769
What's going on?

987
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,640
(As soon as the prayer ends,)

988
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,979
(they play the drums from everywhere.)

989
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:56,280
Oh, my.

990
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,780
(Part 2 of the service begins with music.)

991
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:04,950
That's amazing.

992
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,289
(What is going on?)

993
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,359
(The music gets louder.)

994
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:22,169
Is this a hymn?
It doesn't sound like reggae.

995
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:24,439
It's Nyabinghi.

996
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:26,240
(This is Nyabinghi music.)

997
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Nyabinghi?

998
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:30,979
Nyabinghi is music created
by striking three drums...

999
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:33,979
of different sizes and tones
to produce rhythm.

1000
00:41:33,979 --> 00:41:37,350
Rooted in Rastafarian culture, which
emphasizes living in harmony with nature,

1001
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,819
it is said to be the first form
of Rastafarian music.

1002
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,990
It's so primitive to make music
only with drum sounds.

1003
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,990
Yes.

1004
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:45,890
This is cool.

1005
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,769
(Spotting a cool boy believer)

1006
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:56,240
(Carefree)

1007
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,370
He's groovy.

1008
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:00,439
(Finding him cute)

1009
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,140
(Let me try it too.)

1010
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:07,479
(He's motivated by the boy believer
to try dancing.)

1011
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:13,319
(The foreigner's dance
brings joy to everyone else.)

1012
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:17,160
(Dancing hard)

1013
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,530
(They've all become one.)

1014
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,669
The deeper I get involved
with other cultures,

1015
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:29,200
the more I realize
that they have their own religions.

1016
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,640
Looking back at all the other cultures
in the series,

1017
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,479
half of them are shamanism and praying.

1018
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:39,109
Half of the show is practically me
filming "Exhuma."

1019
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,249
It's like "Praying by Accident."

1020
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:43,680
I've always been praying.

1021
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,720
(The prayer expert is on
"Praying by Accident.")

1022
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,189
The reason
that they're always praying is...

1023
00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:50,760
that they're trying to find
peace of mind...

1024
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,890
by having religious ceremonies...

1025
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,060
in their tough and difficult lives.

1026
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,060
(They want to find peace of mind
through religion.)

1027
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,169
I'm sure it's the same for everyone.

1028
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:00,729
(Won't we all feel the same?)

1029
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:02,700
He's right.

1030
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,470
- It runs through the whole series.
- Right.

1031
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:11,439
(If you get to know them,
they all have the same nature.)

1032
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:16,780
(And this foreigner
shows his respect within them.)

1033
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,319
(A dance of respect)

1034
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:23,720
(He's passionate enough
to sing the lyrics too.)

1035
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,129
I also wanted to be possessed,

1036
00:43:25,129 --> 00:43:27,160
- so I was focused.
- "Possessed?"

1037
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,100
Squats.

1038
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,930
(Showing respect to their culture
with his whole body)

1039
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,439
This is how we worship.

1040
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:38,839
(Proud)

1041
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,879
This is where reggae music...

1042
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:45,010
- originated from.
- I see.

1043
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:50,450
(Nyabinghi is the root of reggae,
the music of nature and healing.)

1044
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,350
- This is...
- Yes.

1045
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:56,519
- This music frees us in nature.
- "Free."

1046
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:57,919
- Yes.
- "Free."

1047
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:00,260
I love it.

1048
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,129
- I can see that, man.
- Yes.

1049
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:04,359
We'll all return to nature, after all.

1050
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:09,039
I'm starting to feel holy.

1051
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,200
I'm getting that holy energy.

1052
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,539
With this holy energy...

1053
00:44:14,939 --> 00:44:16,910
Please bring success to Teo.

1054
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,510
Bring success to Pani as well.

1055
00:44:21,819 --> 00:44:24,749
Bring success to Dex and Si Eon.

1056
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,550
Bring success to everyone.

1057
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,689
He even prayed for us.

1058
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:31,419
Now...

1059
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,459
(He tries the drum too.)

1060
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:34,589
Get rid of Simon's hand tremor!

1061
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:36,660
My hand tremor?

1062
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:39,530
He even wished for his friend's health.

1063
00:44:40,169 --> 00:44:41,530
And Do Yeon.

1064
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:43,499
Please find her a good man.

1065
00:44:43,499 --> 00:44:46,939
- Another good energy.
- Yaman.

1066
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,709
And Seung Hoon.

1067
00:44:50,879 --> 00:44:52,010
Make his new album successful.

1068
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,350
Thank you.

1069
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:56,120
I hope your song, "Dandelion,"
is also a success.

1070
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,120
(He blesses everyone with all his heart.)

1071
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,560
When I was singing death metal,

1072
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,390
I told them to die.

1073
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:09,760
(Simon, Do Yeon, Seung Hoon,
Si Eon, and Pani.)

1074
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:10,959
(Die!)

1075
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:11,999
"Die?"

1076
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:13,629
Why?

1077
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,800
He cursed us when he was in the US!

1078
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:19,709
(Sorry about that.)

1079
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,680
If you keep listening to Nyabinghi,

1080
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:24,640
it somehow relaxes you.

1081
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:28,620
It sings about happiness and not worrying.

1082
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,319
It relaxed me for some reason.

1083
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:36,220
I danced and prayed with them
for about 50 minutes there,

1084
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,419
and I hoped...

1085
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:40,359
for everyone's success.

1086
00:45:40,959 --> 00:45:44,930
It relaxes your body and mind,

1087
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:49,439
so it's almost felt like eating food
without flavor enhancers.

1088
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,999
That's how it felt.

1089
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,939
That was the best part of the trip for me.

1090
00:45:53,939 --> 00:45:55,339
(It's the type of music he needed
at the end of his long trip.)

1091
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,439
Thank you for letting me...

1092
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:01,819
get here safely and soundly.

1093
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:02,850
Goodness.

1094
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,919
(Offering blessing and thanks)

1095
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,859
Rastafari!

1096
00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:11,720
(The foreigner's Rasta worship ends.)

1097
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,430
Yes.

1098
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,930
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1099
00:46:17,729 --> 00:46:19,999
From Joseph's point of view,
he must've been thankful...

1100
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:22,370
- that a foreigner was...
- He showed respect.

1101
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,499
showing respect for his religion.

1102
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:26,109
Blessings to you.

1103
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:28,609
(The Rastafarian night grows deeper.)

1104
00:46:28,879 --> 00:46:30,680
We need something to eat, no?

1105
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,010
Eat?

1106
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,749
- Finally. It's dinnertime.
- Dinnertime.

1107
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:34,950
- Dinnertime?
- Food!

1108
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,120
- Yes.
- Okay.

1109
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:39,019
Dinner together? Here?

1110
00:46:39,249 --> 00:46:40,249
Oh, wow.

1111
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:44,120
Oh, that was food for everyone.

1112
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,189
- We share our food here.
- This.

1113
00:46:47,629 --> 00:46:49,700
Yes. Those are veggie chunks.

1114
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,560
- Okay.
- Veggie chunks.

1115
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,970
It looks like meat, but it's not meat.

1116
00:46:55,169 --> 00:46:56,439
It was soy meat.

1117
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,140
Oh, soy meat.

1118
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,169
That looks delicious.

1119
00:46:59,169 --> 00:47:00,539
It looks like actual meat.

1120
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:03,379
I bet it was similar to what you had
back in India.

1121
00:47:03,379 --> 00:47:04,410
- Yes.
- That looks good.

1122
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,249
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1123
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,350
(A short prayer for the meal)

1124
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,379
Okay.

1125
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,990
(Nom)

1126
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,450
(What do you think?)

1127
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,959
Texas beef.

1128
00:47:16,289 --> 00:47:18,830
It's the same as Texas beef.

1129
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,689
- Did it taste the same?
- You like it?

1130
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:22,330
I like it.

1131
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,999
I didn't really crave meat...

1132
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,569
as I had that.

1133
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:30,569
(Cleaning the plate)

1134
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:32,069
- Delicious.
- Yes.

1135
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:36,580
You only eat vegetables,
but you don't have a problem...

1136
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,180
- with getting big?
- No problem.

1137
00:47:39,379 --> 00:47:42,550
Working on the farm, building things,

1138
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,450
going down the hill,
and bringing up stuff...

1139
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,450
Right.

1140
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,959
You'd naturally get in shape
if you farm on a mountain.

1141
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,519
The farming muscles.

1142
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:52,430
Yes, it comes from everyday life.

1143
00:47:52,629 --> 00:47:55,859
When you're barefoot in the sand,

1144
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:58,700
- you become one with the earth.
- Oh, they walk around barefoot.

1145
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,499
- A lot of people walk barefoot nowadays.
- It heals you.

1146
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:02,039
I see.

1147
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,970
That's why I like going barefoot.

1148
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:05,439
I like floors.

1149
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:07,609
- I always eat on the floor too.
- Yaman.

1150
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:09,810
- Goodness.
- They're connected.

1151
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:10,810
(They have a lot in common.)

1152
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,850
All you need is will.

1153
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,249
(Laughing hysterically)

1154
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:15,249
Good.

1155
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,180
I hear Lisa's laughter.

1156
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:20,950
(Now, he can tell from her laughter.)

1157
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:23,289
She's got a huge presence.

1158
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:24,990
(Lisa's laughter...)

1159
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,729
(makes him laugh too.)

1160
00:48:26,729 --> 00:48:29,160
Laughter is contagious, after all.

1161
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,930
(The laughter epidemic)

1162
00:48:33,899 --> 00:48:35,069
Any juice?

1163
00:48:35,399 --> 00:48:37,600
Water. Crystal punch.

1164
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,910
- What's crystal punch?
- It's water.

1165
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:42,539
There's a spring water.

1166
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:44,510
- Natural spring water.
- It's mineral water.

1167
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,979
They call water from mineral springs
crystal punch.

1168
00:48:46,979 --> 00:48:48,280
That's a cool name.

1169
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,220
Do you also have a beer?

1170
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,850
- "Beer?"
- I doubt that they have beer.

1171
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:53,950
Not beer yet.

1172
00:48:54,649 --> 00:48:56,990
Okay. Sorry.

1173
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,689
You can't drink and eat food
at the same time there.

1174
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:00,859
- Oh, you can't drink while eating?
- Really?

1175
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,459
That's unacceptable for Rastas.

1176
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:05,129
I guess they do have alcohol, at least.

1177
00:49:05,129 --> 00:49:06,300
Oh, the service hasn't ended.

1178
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,200
When we go home after this,
we can have beer.

1179
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,339
I see. We can drink at home.

1180
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:13,910
It's still a holy service.

1181
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,910
Yes.

1182
00:49:15,939 --> 00:49:17,680
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1183
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,979
- Crystal punch?
- Crystal punch.

1184
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,379
(Drinking)

1185
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:24,580
Isn't it nice?

1186
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,919
- Is this spring water?
- Yes.

1187
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:28,649
- From a mineral spring? It's good.
- Yes.

1188
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:30,260
It wasn't kept in the fridge.

1189
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,760
(It's not beer, but he's satisfied.)

1190
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,189
- Delicious.
- Yes.

1191
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:36,760
He cleaned the plate.

1192
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:38,930
He's a big eater.

1193
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:41,370
Thank you for the food.

1194
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,200
I'm sure I'll sleep well tonight.

1195
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,269
(Feeling full)

1196
00:49:48,269 --> 00:49:51,109
- Here's your beer.
- Thank you.

1197
00:49:51,479 --> 00:49:53,479
- Beer!
- Thank you.

1198
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,220
(Drink up, pal.)

1199
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,850
I'll go and get some rest, then.

1200
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,850
- Yes. If you're ready, we can go.
- Yes.

1201
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:03,390
(He goes home with a beer in his arms.)

1202
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,819
- Thank you, Joseph.
- Yaman.

1203
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:07,990
Now,

1204
00:50:10,399 --> 00:50:12,700
it's my last night here.

1205
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,800
Today was...

1206
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:19,609
a dreamy experience.

1207
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:21,339
Meeting Teo...

1208
00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:25,609
feels like ages ago.

1209
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,050
- I bet it did.
- On his last night...

1210
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,350
They were only apart for a day.

1211
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,249
Be safe out there.

1212
00:50:31,249 --> 00:50:35,050
(His day began with a nonchalant goodbye
with the brothers.)

1213
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:37,720
(And he met new people...)

1214
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,930
(and new experiences.)

1215
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:44,030
I can't help but think about
how well he adapts to all cultures.

1216
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:49,899
The world is expansive,
and it's full of things to experience.

1217
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:53,039
That's what I'm thinking...

1218
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:54,470
(He filled a whole page of memories
in one day.)

1219
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,410
before going to bed on my last night.

1220
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,749
(Let's hope for a new day and good night!)

1221
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:03,919
I hope there aren't too many mosquitoes.

1222
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:08,149
(Scratching)

1223
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,760
- Oh, no.
- He can't sleep?

1224
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,919
- The mosquitoes.
- The mosquitoes.

1225
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,830
These darn mosquitoes.

1226
00:51:13,729 --> 00:51:16,260
- Were they buzzing in your ears?
- Yes.

1227
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,660
- In the summer...
- I hate that.

1228
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,300
- It drives you insane.
- Can't he do anything about that?

1229
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,370
Kian84.

1230
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:24,700
(Ta-da)

1231
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,010
- Oh, he brought the net.
- Goodness.

1232
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:29,580
Thank you.

1233
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:35,879
Joseph is installing
a mosquito net for me.

1234
00:51:38,149 --> 00:51:41,390
He's such a good friend.

1235
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:45,089
He came and set it up?

1236
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:46,859
He must have been tired,
but he got up for me.

1237
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:48,689
Thank you, Joseph!

1238
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,430
- What a nice man.
- He's very warm-hearted.

1239
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,229
When was the last time
I slept in a mosquito net?

1240
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:57,499
I'm deeply indebted.

1241
00:51:57,499 --> 00:51:58,499
(Feeling bad)

1242
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,410
I'm so thankful for Joseph.

1243
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:03,339
He got up and set up
a whole mosquito net for me.

1244
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,280
But more importantly,

1245
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:10,220
the mosquitoes came through the net.

1246
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,950
- Mountain mosquitoes are tougher.
- I still got bitten.

1247
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,350
I'm sure one of them
was locked up in the net.

1248
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:14,990
No, I think it was ripped.

1249
00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:18,189
I'm still thankful for the gesture.

1250
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,930
Whether I was bitten or not
doesn't matter.

1251
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,859
What matters is that Joseph came
and set it up for me while he was tired.

1252
00:52:24,129 --> 00:52:25,160
He keeps scratching.

1253
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,370
He keeps scratching.

1254
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:29,200
- Thank you, Joseph.
- Here you go.

1255
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,669
Yes. Thank you.

1256
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,709
I'll go to sleep now.

1257
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:37,780
(His day ends
with the mosquito net of love.)

1258
00:52:46,419 --> 00:52:49,289
(The bright sun rises,)

1259
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:54,629
(and the animals have already
started their days.)

1260
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:57,959
It's a morning in the wild.

1261
00:52:57,959 --> 00:52:59,569
It finally feels like we're watching
"Adventure by Accident."

1262
00:52:59,569 --> 00:53:00,870
(Jamaican morning is full
of nature sounds.)

1263
00:53:05,669 --> 00:53:08,410
(Waking up)

1264
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,439
(He busily greets the morning.)

1265
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,680
(He furiously brushes his teeth
with his eyes closed, as always.)

1266
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,189
(Rummaging through)

1267
00:53:19,689 --> 00:53:21,450
(Carefully taking out his yellow socks)

1268
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:22,859
(Sniffing)

1269
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:24,390
He smells his socks first.

1270
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,530
(He checks them
and irons them with his hands.)

1271
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,930
(Good to go)

1272
00:53:34,729 --> 00:53:37,539
(His socks may be yellow,
but not his teeth.)

1273
00:53:38,499 --> 00:53:41,269
(He brushes his teeth
after a long time...)

1274
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,280
(and organizes his bed.)

1275
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,680
- He even cleaned up.
- He made the bed.

1276
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,519
(Dazed)

1277
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,819
(While he was busily moving around
in the morning,)

1278
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,450
(Joseph approaches him
with something in his hands.)

1279
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,959
- Work gloves.
- Yes.

1280
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,830
Even their work gloves have
Jamaican colors.

1281
00:54:01,629 --> 00:54:03,530
(Rummaging)

1282
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,830
(A big knife?)

1283
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,399
Where are they off to?

1284
00:54:13,669 --> 00:54:15,269
You look pretty cool.

1285
00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:16,580
(A cool worker of the day)

1286
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,780
- We're going to the banana farm?
- Yes.

1287
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,010
Oh, bananas.

1288
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,050
- Yes.
- Then, I can go...

1289
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,419
- sweep with me...
- Okay.

1290
00:54:24,419 --> 00:54:27,120
- and do some stuff on the farm.
- Okay.

1291
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,359
It's hot in the afternoon,

1292
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,760
- so they work in the morning.
- That's right.

1293
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,490
If I can help you...

1294
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,490
- Yes, you're going to help me.
- Okay.

1295
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,899
They fed me,
so the least I could do was help.

1296
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,200
Right, with the farm.

1297
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:43,439
Give me this. I have to use it.

1298
00:54:47,769 --> 00:54:49,180
- Take your time.
- Okay.

1299
00:54:49,379 --> 00:54:50,379
Take your time.

1300
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,810
Why?

1301
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,280
It's too steep.

1302
00:54:56,149 --> 00:54:58,379
There aren't even any trails.

1303
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,789
It's not even flat.

1304
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,850
They should break a trail
before they farm.

1305
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,419
It's too rough.

1306
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:05,789
That's the farm?

1307
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:07,890
- It's practically a gym.
- A gym?

1308
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,160
It looks tougher to work than in Amazon.

1309
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,870
It was at least flat in Amazon.

1310
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:15,769
- Make your step.
- Okay.

1311
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:17,600
That looks tough.

1312
00:55:18,999 --> 00:55:20,470
It's a gym in the mountains.

1313
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:24,339
Uphill and downhill were 45 degrees...

1314
00:55:24,879 --> 00:55:29,050
It wasn't even 45 degrees.
His farm was on an actual cliff.

1315
00:55:29,149 --> 00:55:31,479
That's too dangerous. No!

1316
00:55:31,479 --> 00:55:32,789
- I had to stay alert.
- Careful.

1317
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:36,919
(After a steep slope...)

1318
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,289
Gosh, the mosquitoes...

1319
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:41,359
And mosquitoes?

1320
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,229
- Mountain mosquitoes are tough.
- These mosquitoes.

1321
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:46,970
Mountain mosquitoes.
I shouldn't have worn shorts.

1322
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:48,499
(His day at Joseph's farm
is off to a rocky start.)

1323
00:55:48,499 --> 00:55:51,100
The gloves have holes.

1324
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,169
(A cliff mountain)

1325
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:54,870
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

1326
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,479
All right.
So, you're going to weed out here.

1327
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,149
- Here?
- Yes.

1328
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:01,149
(His job is weeding.)

1329
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,220
- That's...
- Aren't those all weeds?

1330
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,289
- How would he handpick all of them?
- He wanted me to pull all of them.

1331
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:12,390
Yes, go up more.

1332
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:14,459
(Grunting)

1333
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,229
The roots are long.

1334
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:19,169
Go up more.

1335
00:56:19,769 --> 00:56:21,769
(He pulls from higher,
but it's not enough.)

1336
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:23,200
(Shouting)

1337
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,640
(Struggling)

1338
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,439
These weeds have such long roots.

1339
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:29,039
You would naturally gain muscles there.

1340
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,479
- You all right?
- All right.

1341
00:56:31,479 --> 00:56:32,649
(While he's fighting the weeds...)

1342
00:56:35,919 --> 00:56:37,819
Joseph pulls them as if they're tissues.

1343
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:40,950
(He's got a whole bundle.)

1344
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,220
When you're finished,
you're going to be strong.

1345
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,560
- Okay.
- Yes.

1346
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,990
This is a Rastaman's exercise.

1347
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,200
Like going to the gym.

1348
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,999
I like...

1349
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,399
(Ragged)

1350
00:56:56,399 --> 00:56:57,399
He's tired.

1351
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:58,870
Poor him.

1352
00:57:00,439 --> 00:57:03,240
(I was once a warrior.)

1353
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,249
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1354
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,919
(Joseph is still dominating the weeds.)

1355
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:13,350
(The true warrior never gets weary.)

1356
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,350
He doesn't even look tired.

1357
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:17,390
Joseph has to be in good shape...

1358
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,930
because he's doing deadlifts...

1359
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,560
- while he pulls the weeds.
- "Deadlifts."

1360
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,060
He's constantly doing squats.

1361
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,769
His stamina... And he's muscular.

1362
00:57:26,769 --> 00:57:27,769
(The alpha in the area)

1363
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:30,169
Oh, hey, look here.

1364
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:32,470
- Yes?
- Kian84, look here.

1365
00:57:33,169 --> 00:57:34,269
(What is it?)

1366
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:36,080
(Even Joseph struggles)

1367
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,209
I guess something is stuck.

1368
00:57:37,209 --> 00:57:38,439
(What on earth is it?)

1369
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,410
What is it?

1370
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:41,910
(What's the tough one
that's making Joseph struggle?)

1371
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:42,919
Oh, my gosh.

1372
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,350
What is it?

1373
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,390
- Oh, goodness.
- What is it?

1374
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,720
Cassava!

1375
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,760
(A giant cassava)

1376
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,760
Cassava!

1377
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:53,490
(It's enormous.)

1378
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:55,560
- Look at the size.
- I've tried that in potato chips.

1379
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,160
- Right. They're so tasty.
- I love them.

1380
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,930
(Thrilled)

1381
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:02,999
(Glancing)

1382
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:04,600
He spotted another one.

1383
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,109
One minute.

1384
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,209
(Where are you going?)

1385
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:10,879
(Dashing)

1386
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:12,379
What?

1387
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:13,979
Careful.

1388
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,780
(He went all the way down here.)

1389
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:18,919
(Pulling)

1390
00:58:19,149 --> 00:58:20,890
Oh, it's a pineapple.

1391
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:22,620
He got a pineapple.

1392
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,620
(He ran downhill for this pineapple.)

1393
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,919
(Precious)

1394
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:28,729
(He proudly comes back.)

1395
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,069
Pineapple again.

1396
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:37,700
(He runs as soon as he spots one.)

1397
00:58:38,439 --> 00:58:39,640
He's practically a squirrel.

1398
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,310
(As fast as a squirrel)

1399
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,240
(Collecting one)

1400
00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:44,339
(Cheering)

1401
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:47,450
(A handful of pineapples)

1402
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,680
(He keeps looking around
even as he climbs down.)

1403
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,649
He must have found another one.

1404
00:58:52,649 --> 00:58:53,649
(Turning into a squirrel)

1405
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:57,459
He's busy.

1406
00:58:57,459 --> 00:58:58,589
(Wherever the fruit is, he runs over.)

1407
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:01,129
(It's not over yet?)

1408
00:59:01,689 --> 00:59:03,600
- Oh, he climbs a tree like that?
- Oh, my.

1409
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,899
He must be so muscular.

1410
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:09,030
- Ethiopian apple.
- An apple?

1411
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,039
Yes.

1412
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:11,370
(His jaws drop.)

1413
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:14,939
He should be competing in the UFC.

1414
00:59:14,939 --> 00:59:16,410
(He's physically and mentally prepared
for the UFC.)

1415
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,839
(Throwing)

1416
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:20,979
(He eats the harvested fruits
on the spot.)

1417
00:59:20,979 --> 00:59:22,580
- He eats it right away.
- I wonder what it tastes like.

1418
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,819
(Kian84 also takes a big bite.)

1419
00:59:23,819 --> 00:59:26,149
It wasn't exactly an apple.

1420
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:28,089
- What did it taste like?
- Like a fig.

1421
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,289
(Bringing the pineapple
he picked up earlier)

1422
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,760
- You want something to eat?
- Sure.

1423
00:59:35,859 --> 00:59:38,930
(He cuts it with his long knife.)

1424
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,300
- He cuts and eats it on the spot.
- I'm sure that tasted good.

1425
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,169
Thank you, Joseph.

1426
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:46,839
(Slurping)

1427
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,379
- It sounds so juicy.
- I'm drooling.

1428
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:52,010
It's sweet.

1429
00:59:52,479 --> 00:59:53,550
It's good.

1430
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,350
(Slurping)

1431
00:59:57,379 --> 01:00:00,120
That was the best one I've had
in the US and Jamaica combined.

1432
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:02,149
- That pineapple?
- It was incredibly sweet.

1433
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,990
It was sugar itself.

1434
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,459
It's good. I won't starve to death here.

1435
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,129
Everything grows here.

1436
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,569
Isn't an avocado like 5,000 won in Korea?

1437
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:15,129
Those avocados grow here.

1438
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,200
I've seen mangoes,

1439
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:19,810
bananas, and pineapples grow here.

1440
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:20,810
They've got everything.

1441
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,280
Money grows from their soil.

1442
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:27,080
There's a whole fruit aisle
from Emart over there,

1443
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:30,220
and a fruit aisle from Homeplus
growing over there.

1444
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:34,319
You'd be self-sufficient
with just the food that grows here.

1445
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,720
That's incredible.

1446
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:40,459
(Kian84 also finds something.)

1447
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:42,129
(Reaching out)

1448
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,530
This is a pineapple.

1449
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,830
Yes, you can make juice.

1450
01:00:47,399 --> 01:00:48,530
Put it over there.

1451
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:51,800
(Where is he going?)

1452
01:00:52,669 --> 01:00:53,740
It's itchy.

1453
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,280
- Mosquito...
- With the pineapple?

1454
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,479
(He scratches the mosquito bites
with the pineapple.)

1455
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:01,780
- That's awesome.
- Seriously.

1456
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,680
(This open-minded man
makes you admire him.)

1457
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,519
All right. Leave that
and grab your machete.

1458
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:08,519
Okay.

1459
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:09,560
(They climb down with both hands full.)

1460
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,959
- Nice work.
- Nice.

1461
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,220
(No, they climb up with both hands full.)

1462
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:16,300
(Kian84 repaid their kindness.)

1463
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,330
- Put it over here.
- Okay.

1464
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,930
It looks like he caught a pig.

1465
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,499
Are you sure that's not alive?

1466
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:25,669
(It's not alive, is it?)

1467
01:01:26,169 --> 01:01:27,439
- Put it over here.
- Okay.

1468
01:01:28,439 --> 01:01:30,080
(Sweating buckets)

1469
01:01:31,379 --> 01:01:33,450
(Though he's tired,
he peels the fruits right away.)

1470
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:36,010
It looks like a human leg.

1471
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,919
(The fruits fill the basket.)

1472
01:01:39,919 --> 01:01:42,220
He cooks a meal with only fruits.

1473
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,789
(A full basket)

1474
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:45,019
(Scoffing)

1475
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,160
Those were fruits for that day.

1476
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:48,490
(Welp)

1477
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,260
- You look very excited.
- Good for you.

1478
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,300
You only get rice for dinner.

1479
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,399
Rice is rare over there.

1480
01:01:55,399 --> 01:01:57,539
(A happy fruity life)

1481
01:01:59,569 --> 01:02:02,269
(They come back home after morning work.)

1482
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,240
(A full basket)

1483
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,550
(He puts the freshly harvested basket
in the kitchen.)

1484
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:13,220
Oh, yes.

1485
01:02:13,789 --> 01:02:15,819
(He nonchalantly tosses the towel.)

1486
01:02:16,919 --> 01:02:19,189
(And something catches his eye.)

1487
01:02:19,189 --> 01:02:20,430
(A cat)

1488
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,530
There was a cat.

1489
01:02:22,999 --> 01:02:23,999
Your pet?

1490
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,160
- Your pet?
- What?

1491
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:26,530
He said, "Fat."

1492
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:27,930
Yes, our cat.

1493
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,370
He still understands.

1494
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,370
(He understood perfectly.)

1495
01:02:31,169 --> 01:02:32,669
(It scurries outside...)

1496
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,310
- Oh, there are a lot.
- Oh, my.

1497
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:38,810
- It reminded me of my cat.
- They look alike.

1498
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:40,879
Go and eat some fish.

1499
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,519
(He's worried that the cat
might be starving.)

1500
01:02:45,419 --> 01:02:47,289
(He gets changed...)

1501
01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:49,149
(and quenches his thirst.)

1502
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,660
(After some time to get organized,)

1503
01:02:53,789 --> 01:02:56,459
(Joseph prepares breakfast.)

1504
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,700
(He turns on the stove first.)

1505
01:03:00,229 --> 01:03:02,200
(Looking for something)

1506
01:03:03,399 --> 01:03:04,700
(Getting the enormous cassava)

1507
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,740
Oh, the cassava.

1508
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:10,539
(Breakfast made
with freshly harvested ingredients)

1509
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:11,609
I know it tastes good.

1510
01:03:11,609 --> 01:03:12,680
(Breakfast made
with freshly harvested ingredients)

1511
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,580
(Let's see)

1512
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:18,450
(He thinks while trimming
the ingredients.)

1513
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:20,990
What?

1514
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,760
(Turning on music)

1515
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,760
It's reggae.

1516
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,229
(With the song playing,)

1517
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,260
(he grooves.)

1518
01:03:32,129 --> 01:03:34,800
(This man of excitement
can't stand silence.)

1519
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,609
(He peels the ingredients
while humming his work song.)

1520
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,680
(The pot is full.)

1521
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,450
It's a fruit party!

1522
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:51,479
(Putting them straight into boiling water)

1523
01:03:51,919 --> 01:03:52,919
Are those bananas that he's boiling?

1524
01:03:53,189 --> 01:03:55,689
- What was it? Plantain?
- Plantain.

1525
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,359
Oh, they weren't bananas.

1526
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,390
(The chopped vegetables...)

1527
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,600
(go straight into a frying pan.)

1528
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:07,269
(Adding various spices)

1529
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,039
(Stir-fry them and they're ready to go.)

1530
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:12,640
- That looks good.
- It looks like Thai papaya salad.

1531
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,539
(Tasting it)

1532
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,609
(That's good)

1533
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,310
(It tastes good!)

1534
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:23,819
- He's dancing by himself?
- He must like it.

1535
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:24,919
(He expresses the taste
with his dance moves.)

1536
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:27,149
He was having this much fun by himself?

1537
01:04:27,149 --> 01:04:28,419
(Fascinated)

1538
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,919
(Humming)

1539
01:04:32,189 --> 01:04:33,629
(Enjoying the taste,)

1540
01:04:34,629 --> 01:04:36,160
(the dance machine has fun
in the kitchen for a while.)

1541
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,600
He finds fun in whatever he does.

1542
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:43,039
(Checking the food every once in a while)

1543
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,080
(He follows the music into the kitchen.)

1544
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,109
What's good?

1545
01:04:54,649 --> 01:04:55,709
(He's almost done cooking.)

1546
01:04:55,709 --> 01:04:56,720
Oh, he boiled them.

1547
01:04:58,780 --> 01:04:59,819
Wow.

1548
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,060
- Nice.
- That looks good.

1549
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,019
(A local dish made
with natural ingredients and care)

1550
01:05:06,729 --> 01:05:07,930
(He smells it first.)

1551
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:08,959
It smells good.

1552
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:11,430
Gosh.

1553
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,169
Good.

1554
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,069
This is chocolate tea.

1555
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:16,769
- Chocolate?
- Yes.

1556
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,899
- Chocolate!
- Yes.

1557
01:05:18,899 --> 01:05:19,939
(Chocolate tea to raise
the blood sugar level)

1558
01:05:19,939 --> 01:05:21,209
That has to taste good.

1559
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:24,039
(He takes them outside.)

1560
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:30,550
(Getting his favorite speaker)

1561
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:33,649
(He follows Kian84.)

1562
01:05:34,589 --> 01:05:35,819
Let's go.

1563
01:05:35,819 --> 01:05:36,919
(Off to have breakfast)

1564
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:41,660
(Following the trail outside of his house)

1565
01:05:43,229 --> 01:05:44,499
He's so full of excitement.

1566
01:05:44,499 --> 01:05:45,930
(He hums as he moves.)

1567
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:49,169
- Hey.
- Hi.

1568
01:05:53,339 --> 01:05:55,709
(They arrive at the table in no time.)

1569
01:05:55,709 --> 01:05:56,709
Great.

1570
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,609
(He admires the place
as soon as he arrives.)

1571
01:06:03,979 --> 01:06:07,720
(Halfway up the Blue Mountain)

1572
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,749
That's a great view.

1573
01:06:08,749 --> 01:06:12,220
(You can enjoy the green nature.)

1574
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,660
(Made of healthy ingredients
that they picked themselves)

1575
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,060
Delicious food.

1576
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,330
(A vegetarian meal made with care)

1577
01:06:20,669 --> 01:06:23,740
They have a big breakfast
only with vegetables.

1578
01:06:24,399 --> 01:06:26,200
- Thank you for the food.
- Yes.

1579
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,269
Thank you.

1580
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:29,069
Nice.

1581
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:30,539
(He tastes the chocolate tea first.)

1582
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:31,939
I wonder what it tastes like.

1583
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:35,879
(Another sip)

1584
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,879
(What do you think?)

1585
01:06:38,379 --> 01:06:41,050
This is good. This is amazing.

1586
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:42,649
Yaman.

1587
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:46,390
Is this made of stuff you farmed here?

1588
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,830
Yaman.

1589
01:06:49,289 --> 01:06:50,330
With actual cacao?

1590
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:53,169
(He ground cacao that he farmed...)

1591
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,100
(and boiled it with other spices.)

1592
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:00,209
- That looks really good!
- That was so tasty.

1593
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:03,410
This is cassava...

1594
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,539
- Cassava?
- Yes.

1595
01:07:05,539 --> 01:07:07,450
(Telling him he cooked
the cassava that he picked)

1596
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,280
I know what cassava is.

1597
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:10,919
And plantain...

1598
01:07:10,919 --> 01:07:12,950
There's a legendary food made of cassava.

1599
01:07:14,649 --> 01:07:16,120
(Chewing)

1600
01:07:16,919 --> 01:07:17,919
(Spitting)

1601
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,289
(Dizzy)

1602
01:07:22,859 --> 01:07:25,060
(The legendary drink, masato,
made from chewing fermented cassava)

1603
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:28,399
The shock must still be vivid to you.

1604
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:31,169
I still won't be able to drink that.

1605
01:07:31,899 --> 01:07:34,310
I've never tried cassava
that's not in masato.

1606
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:35,609
(How does cassava taste in a solid state?)

1607
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,339
(What do you think?)

1608
01:07:38,709 --> 01:07:39,910
(It's good!)

1609
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:41,910
(Enjoying the taste with a frown)

1610
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:45,350
(Enjoying the taste with his beard)

1611
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:47,089
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I like it.

1612
01:07:47,089 --> 01:07:48,220
That's good.

1613
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,289
(They enjoy the meal
by using all their senses.)

1614
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:52,620
It tasted like chewy and moist potatoes.

1615
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:53,689
That must be good.

1616
01:07:54,289 --> 01:07:55,289
(Shooing away)

1617
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:56,999
He's so sweet.

1618
01:07:56,999 --> 01:07:58,030
(He's sweet enough to shoo away flies.)

1619
01:07:58,399 --> 01:07:59,459
(Thanks to him,
Kian84 gets to enjoy the veggies.)

1620
01:07:59,459 --> 01:08:00,470
- Plantain?
- Yes.

1621
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:01,530
(Plantain)

1622
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,939
(He sees Kian84 enjoy the food,)

1623
01:08:04,939 --> 01:08:06,169
(and he's pleased.)

1624
01:08:07,439 --> 01:08:08,439
That's good.

1625
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,979
(Gobbling up)

1626
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,950
(He's starting to feel full.)

1627
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:15,479
(Rustling)

1628
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,979
(Joseph takes something out.)

1629
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,289
(What is it?)

1630
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,589
(He keeps wriggling his fingers.)

1631
01:08:23,019 --> 01:08:24,019
What?

1632
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,890
(Without a word,
he puts a bracelet on Kian84.)

1633
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:30,800
He got a gift for you!

1634
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:32,600
(A little gift for Kian84 before leaving)

1635
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,729
It's a gift for you.

1636
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,470
So you can remember Rastafari.

1637
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,600
(He laughs it off.)

1638
01:08:39,499 --> 01:08:41,339
(Kian84 takes some time to think.)

1639
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:43,780
Shalom?

1640
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,410
(What?)

1641
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,510
- Was it Shalom?
- Shalom. Peace.

1642
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:48,550
Just like that?

1643
01:08:51,379 --> 01:08:52,450
Your name?

1644
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,249
(He already forgot his friend's name.)

1645
01:08:54,249 --> 01:08:55,289
Don't tell me you forgot!

1646
01:08:56,019 --> 01:08:57,519
- Your name?
- Joseph.

1647
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,720
Joseph.

1648
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,729
(He's Joseph, not Shalom.)

1649
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:02,359
Was Shalom the one in the Amazon?

1650
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,930
Joseph?

1651
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:05,999
- No problem.
- No problem.

1652
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:07,129
- Yes. No problem.
- Thank you.

1653
01:09:07,129 --> 01:09:09,200
(He forgives him right away.)

1654
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,439
His name was Joseph,

1655
01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:16,209
but I called him Rothman
all day on the first day.

1656
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,879
(Yes, I'm Joseph.)

1657
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,149
(He clearly said his name was Joseph
on the first day.)

1658
01:09:21,649 --> 01:09:23,819
(Rothman!)

1659
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,550
(What?)

1660
01:09:25,879 --> 01:09:26,950
Rothman?

1661
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:30,120
(He called him Rothman all day.)

1662
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,419
Joseph must have thought
he was saying, "Yaman."

1663
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,189
I asked him again,
and his name turned out to be Joseph.

1664
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:37,700
(He finally figured out the name
right before his leave.)

1665
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,729
But...

1666
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:39,970
Joseph?

1667
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,530
I have a present...

1668
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:43,839
(Actually, I also have a present for you.)

1669
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:46,499
- I have a present for you.
- What?

1670
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:49,310
- Let's go.
- Alright.

1671
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,280
Do we go this way?

1672
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,550
(He just follows Kian84.)

1673
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,550
Lisa, come over here.

1674
01:09:58,419 --> 01:09:59,580
(He has a present for Lisa too?)

1675
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,550
- Oh, Lisa.
- Yes?

1676
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,589
This is...

1677
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:05,189
I feel a bit shy. This is...

1678
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:08,859
As I wish you two happiness,

1679
01:10:08,859 --> 01:10:11,829
I drew a picture of a happy family.

1680
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,970
This is it.

1681
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:17,270
- This is...
- That looks so cool!

1682
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,400
(Laughing)

1683
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:21,709
(Look at this)

1684
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,610
- He drew you so well.
- Yes.

1685
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:25,440
It looks exactly like her.

1686
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:29,579
(While Joseph was cooking breakfast,)

1687
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:32,949
(he was drawing a picture of them
to express his gratitude.)

1688
01:10:32,949 --> 01:10:34,249
That is awesome.

1689
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,890
(Recalling the time
he spent with the couple,)

1690
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:44,129
(he drew them with sincerity.)

1691
01:10:44,129 --> 01:10:46,060
He's smiling while drawing it.

1692
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,169
(Oh, my)

1693
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,699
I'm sorry, Lisa.

1694
01:10:51,699 --> 01:10:54,039
Your face looks bigger here.

1695
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:55,940
- Because I couldn't check...
- No problem.

1696
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,010
the details while drawing.

1697
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,209
- So, here you are.
- It looks nice, man.

1698
01:10:59,209 --> 01:11:01,810
- Yes.
- But the letter, "e..."

1699
01:11:01,909 --> 01:11:03,279
- What's wrong?
- Something's wrong?

1700
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:05,879
The spelling is incorrect.

1701
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,890
It's "Joseph."

1702
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,320
The letter should stand on the other word.

1703
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,360
(He got the wrong spelling of theirs.)

1704
01:11:12,789 --> 01:11:15,230
- This is...
- This "e" should stand here.

1705
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:17,029
- Here...
- I mean, this "e."

1706
01:11:17,029 --> 01:11:18,659
It should move to here.

1707
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,070
Joseph will probably tell others,

1708
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,100
"There was a fool from Korea."

1709
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,699
"He wrote the wrong spelling
while drawing."

1710
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:26,100
- "But he was good at drawing."
- "He was talented, at least."

1711
01:11:26,839 --> 01:11:28,570
This "e" should stand here.

1712
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:30,110
This is love!

1713
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:31,480
"This is love!"

1714
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,579
There's a meaning to it.

1715
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:35,279
Love will be mixed together.

1716
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:37,020
- This is my sign.
- Yes.

1717
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:41,320
Even your beard looks like a heart.

1718
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

1719
01:11:43,089 --> 01:11:44,119
- Love.
- Yes, the love.

1720
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,459
It truly has some details.

1721
01:11:46,459 --> 01:11:47,760
- Thank you.
- It looks nice.

1722
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,560
Thank you.

1723
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,459
I'm not going to wear it.

1724
01:11:51,459 --> 01:11:52,959
I will frame it and put it in the house.

1725
01:11:52,959 --> 01:11:54,400
Oh, thank you.

1726
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,829
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

1727
01:11:56,029 --> 01:11:57,869
(She sees it one more time)

1728
01:11:57,869 --> 01:12:00,739
May your family be full of love
and prosperity.

1729
01:12:00,909 --> 01:12:02,339
- You too.
- Now I see...

1730
01:12:02,339 --> 01:12:04,039
why G-Dragon does this gesture.

1731
01:12:04,039 --> 01:12:06,140
It became my habit as I stayed abroad.

1732
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:08,709
- Thanks.
- They do it too.

1733
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,520
Yaman.

1734
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,480
(It suddenly became a ceremonial time
to put their hands.)

1735
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:14,220
You can come again.

1736
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:17,119
You don't need to bring a camera.
Just come and make yourself at home.

1737
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:19,560
- I got it. No camera.
- That's it.

1738
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,860
- But I need the camera for YouTube.
- Okay.

1739
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:29,770
It seems like Joseph
finds his peace at home.

1740
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,300
They keep away from capitalism,

1741
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,369
and they live within their community.

1742
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:36,839
They seemed satisfied.

1743
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,449
The US is the strongest of all...

1744
01:12:40,449 --> 01:12:43,550
and has a lot
of cutting-edge technologies.

1745
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:45,550
But they don't provide a restroom.

1746
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:49,919
(Finding a restroom downtown
was a challenge for him.)

1747
01:12:50,789 --> 01:12:54,029
But in Rastafari,
it was hard to use the electricity.

1748
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:57,459
My stay here was very tough.

1749
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,029
(They never lost their smile.)

1750
01:13:03,329 --> 01:13:05,940
- Thank you.
- Come and try this.

1751
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,839
I read somewhere before...

1752
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:14,379
that for most of the people in the world,
family is the most important thing.

1753
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:17,480
But in Korea, people answered
that money comes first.

1754
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,419
In Bolivia, Porphy also said
family is the most important thing.

1755
01:13:20,949 --> 01:13:22,720
It was the same in Texas.

1756
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:25,820
- Family means a lot to all, right?
- Yes.

1757
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,589
I'm not sure if this is because
I've lived alone too long.

1758
01:13:28,589 --> 01:13:29,829
I'm afraid to get married.

1759
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,730
That's...

1760
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:35,169
why I'm obsessed with material things.

1761
01:13:35,169 --> 01:13:36,770
I'm not sure, really.

1762
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:39,999
But whenever I meet someone
living in nature,

1763
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,209
I feel what matters in our lives.

1764
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,039
I get closer to the essence of life.

1765
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:46,810
It makes me feel good,

1766
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:49,579
as I realize what matters in life.

1767
01:13:49,579 --> 01:13:51,220
This is the greatest asset...

1768
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,720
I've gotten through this program.

1769
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,089
Yes, it's important to know that.

1770
01:13:55,089 --> 01:13:56,690
It was the same lesson there too.

1771
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,829
I came here because of music,

1772
01:14:02,589 --> 01:14:04,600
but it gave me a life lesson.

1773
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:10,169
Rasta, bye!

1774
01:14:10,169 --> 01:14:14,070
(Rasta, you gave me
an important lesson in my life. Bye!)

1775
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:19,409
(After having been touched,
he heads back home.)

1776
01:14:20,949 --> 01:14:23,110
(The sorrow of parting
forced him to find a spot.)

1777
01:14:23,379 --> 01:14:25,520
This place is...

1778
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:30,119
the coast that Bob Marley loved.

1779
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:32,260
This is nice.

1780
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:35,289
- It's the name of the beach itself?
- It's the Bob Marley Beach?

1781
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,600
The color of the sand is black.

1782
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:42,169
I've heard pelicans live here.

1783
01:14:42,169 --> 01:14:43,300
- I see one!
- Oh, pelicans?

1784
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,600
Seriously?

1785
01:14:44,869 --> 01:14:47,970
As soon as they find a prey...

1786
01:14:49,369 --> 01:14:51,480
(Diving into the water)

1787
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,050
That looks amazing.

1788
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:55,409
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

1789
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:57,579
(Laughing)

1790
01:14:58,150 --> 01:14:59,150
Look at it!

1791
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:00,220
It catches like that?

1792
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:04,419
As I finish my journey here,

1793
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:08,629
I will stay here,
reflecting on the last days.

1794
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,829
There is...

1795
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:15,570
a stylish desk and a chair.

1796
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,239
As long as I can take a seat
and write something, it's okay.

1797
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,310
(He opens his lyric notebook.)

1798
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,610
(It's full of letters now.)

1799
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:26,839
"New York,"

1800
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:30,279
"Denver, and the Rocky Mountains."

1801
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:31,480
(Enjoying the sea breeze,)

1802
01:15:32,419 --> 01:15:35,249
(he recalls his 11-day journey.)

1803
01:15:36,419 --> 01:15:38,489
"The fragrance of a woman,
with a German lady."

1804
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,930
(It was an impressive memory to him.)

1805
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:45,260
(Looking back on it,
the start of this journey was...)

1806
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,900
(a piece of dream to be a singer.)

1807
01:15:49,369 --> 01:15:51,800
(In my yearbook, I can still see it.)

1808
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:53,940
My future dream was to be a singer.

1809
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:58,039
(Whenever I sing a song,)

1810
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,150
(it still touches my soul.)

1811
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,919
(Even after he grew up,
music touched his heart.)

1812
01:16:05,779 --> 01:16:09,190
(So, he started his journey
to be a singer.)

1813
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,020
I took a look at what happened...

1814
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:15,159
in the last 15 days.

1815
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:18,329
First, I arrived in New York...

1816
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,400
(He arrived in the city
full of excitement.)

1817
01:16:23,999 --> 01:16:27,310
(The city was not friendly to a stranger.)

1818
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:28,310
Okay!

1819
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:30,779
- Oh, yes. He did Cypher.
- It was very fun.

1820
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:32,110
(But thanks to his brave challenge,)

1821
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,810
(he became a part of a family
with others.)

1822
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:35,850
Oh, family.

1823
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:37,550
- It looks like it happened a long ago.
- Indeed.

1824
01:16:37,949 --> 01:16:40,079
(In a city resembling a chessboard,)

1825
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:43,220
(he felt affection from the strangers...)

1826
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:48,329
(and wrote his first song, "Dandelion.")

1827
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:51,029
And brothers from Houston. The cowboys.

1828
01:16:51,529 --> 01:16:53,430
Of course, it was enjoyable
meeting the cowboys.

1829
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:56,329
But for me,
watching the fully absorbed Teo...

1830
01:16:56,730 --> 01:17:00,140
- among them was more fun.
- He was a true cowboy.

1831
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,510
As I watched him,
it made me feel happy too.

1832
01:17:03,909 --> 01:17:05,180
(Rolling)

1833
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:06,310
(Falling)

1834
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:07,779
(And riding)

1835
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:11,079
(He experienced what it means
to be a true cowboy.)

1836
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,879
- Look at him.
- Gosh.

1837
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:14,650
(He learned their pureness and
a romantic view of life.)

1838
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:15,720
- I remember it.
- The kid too.

1839
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,720
What a nice memory.

1840
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:19,589
Although it was a short trip,

1841
01:17:19,589 --> 01:17:22,989
it changed my life in many different ways.

1842
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:24,959
And...

1843
01:17:25,999 --> 01:17:29,100
PKT with YHi.

1844
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,339
- It's Yay Hi.
- It's Yay Hi.

1845
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:34,570
We three gathered together to sing a song.

1846
01:17:34,709 --> 01:17:37,180
We did it in a live bar.

1847
01:17:38,339 --> 01:17:40,409
- It was very touching.
- Yes.

1848
01:17:40,409 --> 01:17:42,779
I didn't expect such a nice song.

1849
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:46,879
(They hung around like friends.)

1850
01:17:47,089 --> 01:17:49,419
(We are pure!)

1851
01:17:49,789 --> 01:17:52,860
(Teo's purity made them all laugh
all throughout.)

1852
01:17:53,289 --> 01:17:55,959
(Pani Bottle's support around the clock
became a great asset to all.)

1853
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,999
It's like an epic story of an idol group.

1854
01:17:57,999 --> 01:17:59,329
That's right.

1855
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:02,999
(We shined as if we were
a popular idol group.)

1856
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:07,640
It's "Like a Friend."

1857
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:12,039
Lastly, Joseph and Lisa.

1858
01:18:12,579 --> 01:18:13,640
Be happy!

1859
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:17,980
Until Joseph's hair
that's like a 100-year-old wild ginseng...

1860
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,180
becomes a 10,000-year-old one.

1861
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,720
May their love last forever.

1862
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:27,529
Thank you so much!

1863
01:18:27,529 --> 01:18:29,560
(Thank you, everyone!)

1864
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,629
I started to travel
without a specific theme.

1865
01:18:33,629 --> 01:18:36,800
But as music became the theme,

1866
01:18:37,339 --> 01:18:39,100
I felt more...

1867
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,539
than I did something new.

1868
01:18:41,869 --> 01:18:45,039
I found such passion and excitement
while singing.

1869
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:46,579
(His journey blossomed with songs.)

1870
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:50,720
That's the power of music, I think.

1871
01:18:51,749 --> 01:18:53,520
(From a simple trip,)

1872
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,850
(but transformed by the magic of music...)

1873
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:58,220
- The new song...
- This is your last song!

1874
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:04,230
("Tornado" by Kian84)

1875
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:09,329
(Dive into the storm)

1876
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:12,270
(Just crash into it)

1877
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:15,510
(You are a tornado now)

1878
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:22,680
(You're at full speed,
colliding head-on with your dreams)

1879
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,079
(There are no coordinates)

1880
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:28,890
(You left your map behind somewhere)

1881
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,589
(But you'll find it)

1882
01:19:30,589 --> 01:19:33,690
(The Oz-like world you dreamed of)

1883
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:36,890
(Call for me inside the tornado)

1884
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,360
(For you, who were full of dreams)

1885
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,900
(Rush into it to escape your boredom)

1886
01:19:43,999 --> 01:19:47,039
(You are a tornado now)

1887
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:54,209
(You're at full speed,
colliding head-on with your dreams)

1888
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:56,279
(There are no coordinates)

1889
01:19:56,379 --> 01:20:00,520
(You left your map behind somewhere)

1890
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,050
(But you'll find it)

1891
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:03,320
(The lead role's life that you envisioned)

1892
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,020
- It sounds like a theme song for a drama.
- Yes.

1893
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,589
He didn't get to see a tornado,
but he created a song.

1894
01:20:07,589 --> 01:20:08,860
(From the inspiration
of chasing a tornado,)

1895
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:10,390
(he wrote a song about a journey
chasing a dream.)

1896
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,800
"You are a tornado now."

1897
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:12,900
That's nice.

1898
01:20:13,459 --> 01:20:15,029
("Tornado" by Kian84)

1899
01:20:15,029 --> 01:20:16,029
Good job.

1900
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,140
- Yes!
- I like the song.

1901
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:21,239
It sounds like he opened his diary...

1902
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:22,909
- and telling those words to himself.
- Yes.

1903
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,779
I can feel your soul.

1904
01:20:25,879 --> 01:20:26,980
Thank you.

1905
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:29,510
Actually, you get used to...

1906
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:32,020
your everyday life
and get stuck in the rut.

1907
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:35,919
I think a tornado
signifies a kind of fantasy.

1908
01:20:36,419 --> 01:20:38,119
Making music...

1909
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:41,789
and traveling, as I think back,

1910
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:44,529
felt like my life was trying...

1911
01:20:44,529 --> 01:20:47,100
to enter a tornado.

1912
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:50,900
You can understand it
as escaping the daily life...

1913
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:53,699
and dreaming of a life of fantasy.

1914
01:20:53,699 --> 01:20:54,869
(The song expresses his will
to live a life that thrills his heart.)

1915
01:20:54,869 --> 01:20:57,539
- Kian84 challenged himself.
- Yes.

1916
01:20:57,539 --> 01:20:58,879
I cheer for him, whatever he does.

1917
01:20:58,879 --> 01:21:00,039
- Yes.
- That's nice.

1918
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:04,850
I was so happy to be
a part of Kian84's dream.

1919
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:09,150
If he thinks he hasn't achieved enough,
as his partner in music,

1920
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:11,760
I will support him in music.

1921
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,260
You're like Joseph and Lisa.

1922
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:17,459
- Yaman.
- Yaman.

1923
01:21:17,459 --> 01:21:18,999
(Simon Dominic's support
reassures Kian84 already.)

1924
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,829
Honestly, so many people helped me...

1925
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:23,300
in making the songs, so I appreciate that.

1926
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,400
I hope it doesn't remain my dream only.

1927
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,940
I hope people will see it...

1928
01:21:29,409 --> 01:21:32,140
and get inspiration.

1929
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:37,209
- This show made that wish come true,
- Yes.

1930
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:39,150
so I can't thank you enough.

1931
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:41,050
(Very thankful)

1932
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:45,690
I hope those who have
a new challenge coming...

1933
01:21:46,119 --> 01:21:48,760
prepare it well and get a good result.
That's my wish for everyone.

1934
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:51,999
Everyone, now that you're
born into this world,

1935
01:21:51,999 --> 01:21:55,770
I wish you could do everything you want
and enjoy everything,

1936
01:21:56,129 --> 01:21:57,900
and then travel to the next world.

1937
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,270
Okay. Bye.

1938
01:22:02,409 --> 01:22:03,409
(Music Adventure by Accident is over.)

1939
01:22:03,409 --> 01:22:05,379
(We have a post-credits scene.)

1940
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,650
- Thank you for your work.
- Thank you for your work!

1941
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:09,709
(There's a post-credits scene.)

1942
01:22:09,709 --> 01:22:11,650
(A post-credits scene is coming soon.)

1943
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,619
I wonder which country we'll go to
for the fourth season.

1944
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:18,089
I want to go somewhere
with diverse races...

1945
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,789
or even minority groups.

1946
01:22:19,789 --> 01:22:22,760
I want to go to a place
where I haven't seen at all.

1947
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,659
That's the place I'm curious about.

1948
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,230
Can't we go to such a place...

1949
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:30,029
for the fourth season of
"Adventure by Accident?"

1950
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,300
We can enter the country secretly.

1951
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:34,869
It doesn't matter to me.

1952
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:38,140
We need to find a hidden area...

1953
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:41,550
where there are Indian, South American,
and African people.

1954
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:42,949
(Adventure by Accident will return
in a real raw element in a hidden land!)

1955
01:22:43,049 --> 01:22:44,149
