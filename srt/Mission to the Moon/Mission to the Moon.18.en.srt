1
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,080
What if it doesn't work?

2
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,440
I have another way. Ouija board!

3
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,040
This method is classic.

4
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,760
You have to invite the spirit into the glass first,

5
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,360
and then ask the questions you want to ask.

6
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,760
Then, they'll answer you themselves.

7
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
If you are here,

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,800
I invite your spirit to possess this glass.

9
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,280
Have you come yet?

10
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,240
Where are you now?

11
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,200
But if your hand slips during the game,

12
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,800
that spirit will appear to you.

13
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,640
Don't you want to see my face anymore?

14
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:38,440
I want to see your face every day, every time.

15
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,000
So, what happens next?

16
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
and this method is super effective!

17
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
You knock on a rice bowl to call ghosts.

18
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,400
The sound of the knocking will make them think it's time to eat,

19
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,280
and then they'll appear right in front of you.

20
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,680
You...

21
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,000
you...

22
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,480
are you around here?

23
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,160
Come eat with me, please.

24
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,320
I promised you that if you made me win the lottery,

25
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,680
I'd treat you to a big meal.

26
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
I've kept my promise!

27
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,960
You...

28
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,720
are you here? You...

29
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,640
I give up!

30
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,320
I give up!

31
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,760
I really give up,

32
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
I surrender to you!

33
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,440
Where are you?

34
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,480
Come out!

35
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,400
see how I've given up.

36
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,320
I won't stop you from anything anymore.

37
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,360
You can do whatever you want.

38
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,120
You can flash in and out.

39
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,120
You can sleep on my bed, I won't chase you away.

40
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,440
Whatever you ask for, I'll give you.

41
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,240
Whatever you want, just tell me!

42
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,880
Tell me everything.

43
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,880
I won't be annoyed, I'll agree to everything.

44
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,040
I only ask for one thing,

45
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,560
can you please come back to me?

46
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,080
You like him.

47
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
No.
