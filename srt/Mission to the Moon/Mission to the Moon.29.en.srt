1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,240
How did you eat that hard lump?

2
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,080
This hard lump?

3
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,680
Yeah.

4
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,080
It melts easily and is easy to eat when you're hungry.

5
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,320
Very convenient, look at  this!

6
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,320
Wow, what do you think?

7
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,280
It looks delicious.

8
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,320
You're right! May I try some?

9
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,080
Be careful, you might get addicted to food from this era.

10
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm afraid it won't just be the food I get addicted to.

11
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm afraid I'll get addicted to the human of this era too.

12
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,280
Oh... just eat it!

13
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,840
Hmmm,

14
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,680
delicious!

15
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Addicted yet?

16
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,200
I’m addicted.

17
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,960
Resigning?

18
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,440
Hey, if there's any problem, you can talk to me.

19
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,400
Nothing.

20
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,840
Oh!! If it's nothing,

21
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
then why are you suddenly resigning?

22
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,320
It's a personal matter.

23
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,120
Alright, alright. Go on vacation first.

24
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,880
Rest your body, rest your mind for two or three months.

25
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,840
If you still want to resign then, we can talk.

26
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,640
Okay.

27
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,720
Yeah, go think about it carefully first.

28
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Vee, what the hell are you doing?

29
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
What? What did I do?

30
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,960
About you resigning.

31
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,880
What's going on with you? Why didn't you tell us?

32
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,080
Suddenly resigning, that's totally not normal.

33
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,920
Yeah.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,640
Uh, I just want to try to find new experiences.

35
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,040
Experiences?

36
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,880
The truth, please.

37
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm tired.

38
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,000
I want to take a break.

39
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,800
What did P'Whan say?

40
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,720
She told me to think about it again.

41
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,640
Are you sure you've made up your mind?

42
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,360
Yeah.

43
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,920
May you receive the merits I've made with good intentions.

44
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,880
I don't know if there's a next life,

45
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,000
but if there is, I wish that in some life, we can meet again

46
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,760
and truly spend our whole lives together.

47
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,640
This time you're not offering clothes anymore?

48
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,440
Not anymore.

49
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
He doesn't need them anymore.

50
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,920
When your karma is depleted,

51
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,840
that's when you'll find true happiness.

52
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,680
Hello, listeners.

53
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,280
Today, the first caller to welcome the first day of Halloween is Khun Vee.

54
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,360
Hello, Khun Vee.

55
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,600
Hello.

56
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,720
Today, Khun Vee has a terrifying experience to share with us.

57
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
What's the story, Khun Vee? Please.

58
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,720
Have you ever heard about the belief surrounding Halloween?

59
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,360
The one where spirits return to visit someone they miss.

60
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,800
I never believed it,

61
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,080
not until it happened to me.

62
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,960
That's when I realized it was true.

63
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,800
Today is another Halloween.

64
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,400
and I wish for the belief I hold true to come to pass again.

65
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Let him come back to me.

66
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,320
for the one I miss with all my heart.
