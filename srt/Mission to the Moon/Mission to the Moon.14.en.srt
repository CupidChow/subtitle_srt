1
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,720
Are you having fun?

2
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,560
It's quite fun.

3
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,720
Everything here is strange to my eyes.

4
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
I asked if you had a lot of fun.

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,680
I already answered that it was fun.

6
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,760
I meant that you tricked Ton.

7
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,840
Was that a lot of fun?

8
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,360
that presses the coffee

9
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,360
Oh, because of that?

10
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,840
Humans like to assume that things that happen without proof are tricks,

11
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,360
when in reality, it's just emotion at that moment.

12
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,920
Hey you.

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,640
A ghost that causes unnatural things to happen is called a haunting ghost.

14
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Punhan Buasri

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
What else?

16
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,360
What are you standing here doing?

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,040
Umm.

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,080
Oh, I came here to talk on the phone. Here.

19
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,440
Oh, Let’s come to work. Hurry up.

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,600
Yeah, come in.

21
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,480
Hello, Hello viewers and listeners.

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,840
Tonight, we're here for our super spooky night.

23
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,520
Let's start with our first caller.

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,040
Hello, Khun Gubgib.

25
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,600
How's the scary cartoon ghost story going?

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,240
Tell us all about it. Wow… it is…

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,880
No way!

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm getting goosebumps.

29
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,160
And what happened next, Khun Gubgib?

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,480
What happened after that?

31
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,760
This isn't true.

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
How many meters?

33
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
What is it?

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,400
Don't tell me the tree is alive?

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,440
It's a lie. I know.

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
skip

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,680
It's not true.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Please continue.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,400
Thai dress.

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,900
It's not true.

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
No.no.

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Go on,

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,800
what happened next?

44
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,080
It was behind...

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,840
She is lying.

46
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,000
What happened next, Khun Gubgib? It's getting to the climax now.

47
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,520
This is a lie. I confirm it.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,440
Ugh!! Stop talking, it's annoying.

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,200
No, No it’s not that.

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,680
I apologize.

51
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,520
Hello?  Hello.

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,960
Wait, Gubgib?

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,280
Hello?

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Why do he has to curse his fans so harshly?

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,947
Why don't you know how to control your emotions as a DJ?

56
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:48,726
If you can't control your emotions, then quit being a DJ.

57
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,040
If you still can't manage your emotions like this,

58
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,880
you aren't suitable for hosting live shows like this anymore.

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,680
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,920
Do you have any problems?

61
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
Are you in love?

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,440
No, no.

63
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
Then what are you stressed about?

64
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Nothing.

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm sorry, I'll try harder.

66
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
Listen to me.

68
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,560
Everyone has things they need to deal with. they need to manage.

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,920
It depends on who can handle it first, that person wins.

70
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,040
I hope you understand what I am saying.

71
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,760
And how many hateful SMS messages have been sent to me?

72
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,520
How much do I have to swallow my pride and beg for sponsors.

73
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,600
That’s so many ! And what is this you can't control your emotions, and everyone is just criticizing.

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,040
How sponsors think.

75
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,320
How are you going to take responsibility for this?

76
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,760
Do you even understand?

77
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,600
Why did that woman talk with you for such a long time?

78
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,200
When you came out, you looked so strange.

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,800
If that woman did anything to upset you, please tell me.

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,720
I will go take care of it myself.

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,960
And why aren't you answering me?

82
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,080
Did I do something to displease you?

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm very worried about you.

84
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
Before, when we were together,

85
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,600
you would never be like this.

86
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,200
You were so talkative and engaging.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,240
Always making me happy whenever I was near you.

88
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,720
Oh!!!

89
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,560
Would you just shut up?

90
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,720
You're such an annoying ghost!

91
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,400
Why do I have to deal with this kind of shit?

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,000
Do you even know that ever since you showed up,

93
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,080
I have been faced with so much shit.

94
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,880
Nothing good has happened at all.

95
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
You're just thinking about your own needs,

96
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,840
Isn't it too selfish?

97
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,080
Look at my life!

98
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
I have to work to earn a living.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,040
I don't get to just magically have food like you do!

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,880
I have to work to survive.

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,880
and what if I get fired? What will I do then?

102
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,320
And what the hell does that two thousand year old story have to do with me?

103
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,320
Is it even real?

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,080
I have no idea if you just made it up.

105
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
I don't know anything!

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
The past is the past, dammit!

107
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,480
Why are you digging it all up?

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,680
I didn't mean to.

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,840
I apologize.

110
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,040
Just go wherever you want to go.

111
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,880
just live our separate lives.

112
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Please.

113
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

114
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,120
If that is what you desire,

115
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
I would do it.

116
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm good, feeling comfortable.

117
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,200
Oh, what's wrong with you?

118
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,320
What's your problem?
