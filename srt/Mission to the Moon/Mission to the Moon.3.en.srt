1
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,200
Cheers!

2
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,680
What kind of Kumarn Thong drinks liquor?

3
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,200
I've only ever seen them drink red syrup.

4
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,960
Well, I'm Kumarn Thong who has reached legal drinking age, you know.

5
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,640
Cheers!

6
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,800
Bottoms up!

7
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
Hey Vee, you can drink slowly,

8
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,280
you don't have to finish the whole glass every time.

9
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,080
I don't care if others don't finish,

10
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,680
but I'm finishing my glass.

11
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,840
Such a heavy drinker.

12
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,480
Really fun!

13
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,240
Open the door.

14
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,640
What the hell you drink,

15
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,960
you’re drunk so hard!

16
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,120
If you're drunk and causing this kind of trouble,

17
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,160
shit… I'd better go home.

18
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,840
Wait,

19
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
are you seriously going to let him wear a Kumarn Thong outfit to sleep like this?

20
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,760
Don't give a shit!

21
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,760
I'm already so drunk, I could die.

22
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,040
Let's go... back.

23
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
Hurry.

24
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,760
Shit...

25
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
What the hell is it now?

26
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm leaving.

27
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,440
Hurry up! So I can close the door.

28
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm going back.

29
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,880
Goddammit, I'm so freaking drunk!

30
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,880
Shit,

31
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,320
Am I dreaming again?

32
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
I've been dreaming so much lately.

33
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Who are you?

34
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,400
Oh, we just met last night.

35
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Did you drive me home?

36
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,440
No, that's not right.

37
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,640
Or... don't tell me... we two...

38
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,480
I’m Sri Sinwadee,

39
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
or Prince Sasin the royal son.

40
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,720
Hold on,

41
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
are you hungover or  just immersed in this role?

42
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,480
Don’t you believe me?

43
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
I don't believe you.

44
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,040
Okay

45
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Shit...

46
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,320
Why do you have to look so disgusted with me?

47
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
Because you're a ghost.

48
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,400
The more you struggle and run away, the worse it will become.

49
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,720
I saw a ghost.

50
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
What did you say?

51
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,880
A ghost followed me home.

52
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,000
What should I do?

53
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,280
You should make merit and dedicate it to your Enemies from a former life first.
