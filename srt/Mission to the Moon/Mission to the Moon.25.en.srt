1
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,600
Smells good.

2
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,000
You always startle me!

3
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,040
Why are you startled?

4
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,680
Just in case it's a vengeful ghost coming to take my life!

5
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,480
How about we go on a date to a temple then?

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,800
No thanks, I don't like temples.

7
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,680
Alright, but you must promise me you'll make merit regularly.

8
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,480
Hmm, I'll try.

9
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,280
What is this?

10
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,840
It's an earbud.

11
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,520
From now on, when I walk with you,

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,440
I won't have to worry about what people think when I want to talk to you.

13
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,600
It'll be like I'm just on a call.

14
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,040
That way I can talk about anything with you.

15
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,560
Smart.

16
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,360
Of course.

17
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,120
Why did you bring me to walk here?

18
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,480
You'll know soon.

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,040
Why did you stop?

20
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,600
You'll know.

21
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,600
Come with me.

22
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,880
I want you to draw a picture for me.

23
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,440
Alright. Have a seat.

24
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,400
Thank you.

25
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,400
But it's a couple's picture.

26
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Okay, then give me a picture of the couple.

27
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,280
I don't have one.

28
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
Oh? So how's that going to work?

29
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,000
You want a couple's picture but don't have a picture of a couple?

30
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Then can I describe their faces to you

31
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,280
and you draw based on what I tell you?

32
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,200
Okay

33
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,640
What are you going to do?

34
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,440
You'll see.

35
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,160
Okay, I'm ready.

36
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,760
Then let's start.

37
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
He has double eyelids,

38
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,640
large brown eyes,

39
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,920
dark eyebrows,

40
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
a beautiful prominent nose,

41
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,480
a chiseled jawline,

42
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,480
and full, pink,

43
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,800
kissable lips.

44
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,920
Huh?!

45
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,680
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

46
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,080
My lips are very kissable?

47
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,400
I am handsome, but you are even more handsome.

48
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,440
This should really be something to represent our memories together,

49
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,920
But... you didn't get a shot.

50
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,680
Just take this one then, it's classic.

51
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,080
Keep it safe.

52
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,240
I'm going to have it framed and put it above my headboard.

53
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,360
Excellent.

54
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,720
Oh! If you do that, I'll die of embarrassment.

55
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,560
So when you look at the picture, you'll think of me.

56
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,800
No way.

57
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,760
When I miss you, isn't it better to just look at you?

58
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,640
Just in case.

59
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,120
Hey, I think I’m stomach ache.

60
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,280
I'm hungry too.

61
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,600
Let's go home, let's go eat instead, okay?

62
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,040
Wait a minute.

63
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
There's somewhere I want to take you.

64
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,840
You haven't changed at all.

65
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,840
Everything still looks the same,

66
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,760
just like that day

67
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,760
What you saw in your dream, it's real.

68
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
Virunwee,

69
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,680
wake up!

70
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,080
Wake up!

71
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
Don't leave me!
