1
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,800
What do you want to say?

2
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,160
I come in peace.

3
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,320
Peace? What’s time?

4
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,080
Probably in the afternoon.

5
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,080
Huh!?

6
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,800
You asked about the time.

7
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,120
Why are you laughing?

8
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,840
Nothing,

9
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,840
Just tell me what you want.

10
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,200
I have some reasons why I must return here.

11
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,120
Hmm, and what are those reasons?

12
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
I can't tell you much.

13
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,120
It's a rule of time.

14
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,280
Your memories will only return when you sleep.

15
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,400
All I can say is that I came back here for you to remember me.

16
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,520
I... uh...

17
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
I remember you.

18
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,640
Why do I remember you?

19
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,360
Because... we were in love

20
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,320
two thousand years ago.

21
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,920
Two thousand years?

22
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Who could possibly remember that?

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,160
I even forget why I walked to the fridge when I'm thirsty.

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,080
Please go back to where you came from.

25
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,600
I can’t return.

26
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,880
Have you heard that a person dies twice?

27
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,800
First, a physical death.

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,480
Second, a death from memory.

29
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
When you remember me,

30
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,680
then I will depart forever.

31
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,240
That is my mission.

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,600
So, ghosts have missions too?

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,080
Humans have their world,

34
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,320
why wouldn't ghosts have their own world?

35
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
But isn't that a bit selfish?

36
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,160
It's just your own desire.

37
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,440
I have an exchange to offer.

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,560
What about exchange?

39
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,440
Tell me.

40
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,440
I will protect you from your enemies from a former life.

41
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,440
Enemies from a former life?

42
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,760
Does it really exist??

43
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,560
It’s true.

44
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,320
Huh?

45
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,360
You can hear me?

46
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,160
Okay, but we have to make a deal.

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,920
Deal?

48
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,560
Yeah,

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,120
cohabitation agreement between a person and a ghost.

50
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
I’m not an ordinary ghost.

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,200
I’m  far superior to that.

52
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,560
Don’t flashing in and out to scare me.

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,080
Okay.

54
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Let's live separately and not bother each other.

55
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
If you forbid me from interfering with you,

56
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,440
then I have no reason to come back here.

57
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,000
Then don't interfere unless it's necessary.

58
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,160
Okay deal.

59
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,160
And most importantly, don't enter my room.

60
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,360
I can’t agree with this one.

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,120
And why do you have to come into my room?

62
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I must sleep with the one I love every night.

63
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,080
No way.

64
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,200
Why not?

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,720
1 You are not my lover,

66
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,080
2 Do ghosts even need to sleep?

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,200
1 Your past self was my lover.

68
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,680
2. Ghosts need rest too.

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,240
So you admit you're a ghost?

70
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,680
Don't change the topic.

71
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
I have to protect you,

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,400
if your enemies from a former life come to harm you while you're asleep.

73
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,440
How can I help you?

74
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,360
Your memories will only return when you sleep.

75
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,080
If your memories don't return,

76
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,280
I can't go anywhere and have to stay here forever.

77
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,320
Is that what you want?

78
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,000
Fine,

79
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,240
I'll allow you into my bedroom then.

80
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,640
But you're not allowed on my bed.

81
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,200
I agreed.

82
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,200
Ah, and is there anything you want to beg me?

83
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,760
I don't like shaman.

84
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,080
Could you not bring it here?

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,200
Okay, you don't like Shaman,

86
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,320
I won't bring it here.

87
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,880
I have something to beg you.

88
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,400
I'd like you to change your outfit.

89
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Why do you want me to change outfits?

90
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,440
Your nipples bother me.

91
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,360
This is called a car.

92
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,360
Car?

93
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,200
Hmm, it's developed from a cart.

94
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Cart?

95
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
Your body odor smells the same as always.

96
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,880
How about this one?

97
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,560
No.

98
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,480
I... I'm embarrassed.

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,960
Hey, what was your career in your past life?

100
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,680
Do you sell khanom krok?

101
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
You're so good at flirting.

102
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,840
I don't have any career other than being the son of a king.

103
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
Are you boasting to me?

104
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,520
Boasting?

105
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,920
Yes, boasting, like showing off.
