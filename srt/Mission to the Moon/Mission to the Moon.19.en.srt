1
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,680
I give up!

2
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,360
I give up!

3
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,800
I really give up,

4
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
I surrender to you!

5
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,480
Where are you?

6
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,520
Come out!

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,440
See how I've given up.

8
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,360
I won't stop you from anything anymore.

9
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,400
You can do whatever you want.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,160
You can flash in and out.

11
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,160
You can sleep on my bed, I won't chase you away.

12
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,480
Whatever you ask for, I'll give you.

13
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,280
Whatever you want, just tell me!

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,920
Tell me everything.

15
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,920
I won't be annoyed, I'll agree to everything.

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,080
I only ask for one thing,

17
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,600
can you please come back to me?

18
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
You like him.

19
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,160
No no. My friend.

20
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,680
Friend?

21
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Yeah, we've been friends for a long time.

22
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, friend is friend,

23
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,240
but I'm going to tell you something,

24
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,040
these symptoms definitely mean he are like him.

25
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
And do your heart skips a beat when with him?

26
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,274
Sometimes

27
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,480
And do you shy when he's close to you?

28
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,960
Yes.

29
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,280
Have you two had sex yet?

30
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,800
Hey! Are you crazy?

31
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,480
It hasn't gotten to that point.

32
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,160
Just a friend's story,right?

33
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,440
Umm just a friend's story.

34
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,520
Just friends?

35
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,640
Yeah, my friend.

36
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,480
Just a friend's story.

37
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,440
I apologize.

38
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,240
It's alright now.

39
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
Don't be afraid.

40
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,760
Thank you.

41
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,080
Thank you for coming to help me.

42
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,920
I told you I would protect you

43
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
and be by your side forever.

44
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm sorry for what I said that day,

45
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,400
for speaking badly to you.

46
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,800
It was my fault for not controlling myself

47
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,040
and letting those words slip out, telling you to leave.

48
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,640
I also have to apologize for bothering you

49
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
and causing you trouble.

50
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
I promise that from now on,

51
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,720
I won't disturb you again,

52
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,920
and I'll only appear when you want to see me.

53
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
If I were to tell you...

54
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,400
Tell me what?

55
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,360
that...

56
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,040
What is it, Navee?

57
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,640
Can I see you forever?

58
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,400
Yes, if you ask.

59
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,840
What will you do?

60
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,040
Just stay still.

61
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,320
What did you say?

62
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,040
I think I might like you.
