1
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,600
If the next life exists,

2
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,320
I wish to encounter all forms of love

3
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,400
that have been accepted no matter who it’s with.

4
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,960
The fortune of those born on Monday is currently not good.

5
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,280
The fate has turned upside down,

6
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,400
and Enemies from a former life are not going away,

7
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,640
causing unhappiness in their lives.

8
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,600
Your fortune is very bad.

9
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
Would you like to go make merit?

10
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,480
Say it again.

11
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,720
Who will go to make merit?

12
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,560
It’s you.

13
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,400
you should believe it sometimes,

14
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,040
When they tell you or warn you, it's for your own good to be careful.

15
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
It’s not wasted.

16
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,720
No way.

17
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,680
I will go to work,

18
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,800
see you tomorrow.

19
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,520
May any ghost come and haunt my friend.

20
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,760
Make him catch a fever and go bald.

21
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,800
Tomorrow night, the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand

22
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,960
invites everyone to watch the super full moon phenomenon!

23
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,880
It's a Halloween treat,

24
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,920
as the moon will appear exceptionally large, much bigger than usual,

25
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,800
and will be at its closest to Earth in many years.

26
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,280
This will be seen again for about 2-3 months,

27
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,400
and that's just an estimate.

28
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Don't forget, tomorrow night from 9 PM onwards.

29
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,440
What am I dreaming?

30
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,160
Nowadays it's all about telling ghost stories.

31
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,400
You gotta play on beliefs.

32
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,040
People are all thinking about the spiritual stuff.

33
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,040
What spooky stories do you want to tell us tonight?

34
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,680
Have you ever heard the belief about Halloween?

35
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,880
Halloween is the day that spirits return to meet someone they miss.

36
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,280
Whoa! I’m Goosebumps!

37
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,840
That’s so scary.
