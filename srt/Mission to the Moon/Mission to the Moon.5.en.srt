1
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,520
You are not the only soldier here.

2
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,000
But I..

3
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,960
Stay with me.

4
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,000
I know that you can handle it,

5
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,400
but with Virunvee, who is no longer the same person,

6
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,320
he certainly won't accept you appearing in his house.

7
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,720
Then what should I do?

8
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,440
Just don't startle him, that should be enough.

9
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,840
Hey... thought something will happen.

10
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,800
Good Karma is happening really quickly today.

11
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
I'd better go.

12
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,400
Did you kick some ghosts?

13
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
Look, He's more likely to get kicked by ghosts.

14
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,080
Well... I’ll kick you guys first!

15
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,200
Are you interested in taking my amulet to wear first?

16
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,920
I can lend it to you. It's effective for warding off ghosts.

17
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,000
Wow,

18
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
but no thanks.

19
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,920
it's gone.

20
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,960
Huh?

21
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,320
Seriously?

22
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,920
Is it leaving just like that?

23
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,360
Yes, just pour ceremonial water then he is gone.

24
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,720
By the way,

25
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,840
was the ghost a woman or a man?

26
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,120
A man.

27
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,920
Really?

28
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,000
And was he handsome or horrible?

29
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,200
Handsome.

30
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,320
Wowww, He admires that the ghost is handsome.

31
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,080
What? I'm just saying what's true.

32
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,400
I have to go to work now. See you.

33
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,160
See you.

34
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,120
See you.

35
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,960
Um.

36
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
I think it's a bit strange.

37
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,680
The flowers of this city.

38
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Here, take it.

39
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,320
As beautiful as you.

40
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,280
The scent is as fragrant as I am.

41
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,280
So fragrant.

42
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,920
So fragrant.

43
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,640
It has been so long, but my love for you remains unchanged.

44
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,240
Through tens of thousands of days, I still miss and yearn for you.

45
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:22,480
My love has never changed, it transcends time.

46
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,160
I wait patiently for destiny to bring our hearts together.

47
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,080
No matter how long it takes, my love belongs to you only.

48
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,960
Even after making merit, if you still feel like he hasn’t gone.

49
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,880
The last way is a shaman.

50
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,800
A shaman?

51
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,120
What's wrong,shaman?

52
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,240
Get out!

53
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,760
Help me! I'm being haunted by a ghost!
