00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,840
Hello, listeners.

2
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,440
Today, the first caller to welcome the first day of Halloween is Khun Vee.

3
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,520
Hello, Khun Vee.

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,760
Hello.

5
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,880
Today, Khun Vee has a terrifying experience to share with us.

6
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
What's the story, Khun Vee? Please.

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,880
Have you ever heard about the belief surrounding Halloween?

8
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,520
The one where spirits return to visit someone they miss.

9
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
I never believed it,

10
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,240
not until it happened to me.

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,120
That's when I realized it was true.

12
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,960
A spirit came into my life and turned it upside down.

13
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,200
So many things happened,

14
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,480
and eventually, it even blossomed into love.

15
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,760
Many people might expect horror

16
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,040
or thrills,

17
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,520
but for me, it was incredibly sad.

18
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,760
I don't even know how I'll go back to living my life.

19
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,080
I don't think I'll ever be able to live a normal life again.

20
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,600
Today is another Halloween.

21
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,720
I still hold onto that belief,

22
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
and I wish for the belief I hold true to come to pass again.

23
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,560
I wish for it to happen to me just one more time,

24
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Let him come back to me.

25
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,160
for the one I miss with all my heart.

26
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,840
Sorry to keep you waiting.

27
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,680
It's just as you thought.

28
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,080
You have carried negative karma for thousands of years.

29
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,920
Now, your karma has been cleared

30
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
because your mission is complete.

31
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,720
Are you ready to disappear forever?

32
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,680
Humans taught me the meaning of hope.

33
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,560
Those with strong hope

34
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,800
often see the importance and attain the signs of new life.

35
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm just like you—a human,

36
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,920
with a heart.

37
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,160
I can feel pain,

38
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
I can cry.

39
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,800
Oh, and I can get hungry too.

40
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,640
No matter how much time passes, my love for you will never change.

41
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,400
Even after tens of thousands of days, I still miss you deeply.

42
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
It has never changed.

43
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,600
Our love transcends time.

44
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:26,200
I wait for destiny to bring our hearts together.

45
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm truly confused, honestly.

46
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,880
Suddenly, you appeared and said we used to be lovers.

47
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,320
And then you just vanish abruptly after showing up

48
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,640
That also scares me.

49
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,720
This is going to end up on The Ghost Radio; poor P'Jack.

50
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
But as time goes on,

51
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,440
more things surprise me.

52
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,120
The idea that we were once in love—at first, I half-believed it, half-didn't.

53
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,800
In the end, it turned out to be so true; being with you directly was utterly astonishing.

54
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,440
My heart tells me it's indescribable, like falling in love.

55
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,040
Over time, it made me forget you for a while.

56
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,360
But in the end, I slowly came back to loving you.

57
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,280
No matter how long it's been since we last met or saw each other,

58
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,120
I still love you the same.

59
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,160
No matter how much time passes, my love for you will never change.

60
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,640
Even after tens of thousands of days, I still miss you deeply.

61
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,480
It has never changed.

62
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,680
Our love transcends time.

63
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,920
I wait for destiny to bring our hearts together.

64
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,000
No matter how long it takes, I will only love you.
