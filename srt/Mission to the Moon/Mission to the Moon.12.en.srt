1
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,320
Wow, a ghost can cook too?

2
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,520
I’m not a ghost.

3
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,400
Not a ghost, what time?

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Are you asking me about the time again?

5
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,560
Oh,

6
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
you can let my words slide sometimes.

7
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,760
But anyway, what's is this?

8
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,600
I do everything that I can.

9
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,400
Like Harry Potter,? Conjure up.

10
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,480
Harry?

11
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,320
It’s Harry Potter.

12
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,440
That wizard movie.

13
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,560
I don't know about Harry you speak of.

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,680
But if you like, I can be him for you.

15
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,840
You know. I had a dream last night too.

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,600
I dreamt that the two of us loved each other.

17
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,600
Yes,

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,040
we loved each other two thousand years ago.

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,240
You were a soldier, and I was a prince.

20
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,280
Oh, and then...?

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
Don't ask too much.

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,960
You'll know soon.

23
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,680
Hurry up to eat.

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,160
sit here.

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,120
Whatever.

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,520
If you want to tell me, then tell me later.

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,320
Let me serve you.

28
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
Just a little.

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,880
Is that enough?

30
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,840
Hmm.

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Eat up.

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,440
Let me serve you.

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,440
You’re good at cooking.

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,080
but I don't know if it's delicious or not.

35
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,960
I'll wipe this up myself.

36
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,960
Do you have any errands to run today?

37
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,600
Yeah, I have to go to work tonight.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
Why?

39
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,000
I want to go to the temple.

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Go to the temple?

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,560
I want you to make merit for your enemies from a former life.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,520
Can we go another day?

43
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
I want to rest today.

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,120
If you do as I want, I will make you win the lottery.

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,360
Okay, then I'll go to shower first.

46
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Please keep this for me. I'll eat it later.

47
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,520
You know nowadays already have online merit-making.

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,720
Just transfer the money,

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,800
no need to walk around in the heat like this.

50
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Are you going to invite monks to the house?

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,320
Why didn't you tell me?

52
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,800
Ugh...

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
just pretend I didn't say anything.

54
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,840
Oh ... just pretend I didn't say anything.

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,440
So headace.

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,240
Do you have a headache?

57
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,200
Are you okay?

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
You're starting to feel really warm.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,520
Or are you getting a fever?

60
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
That's right.

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,080
Hot, really hot.

62
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,360
Really hot.

63
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Let's go make merit.

64
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,160
Let's go.

65
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,880
Let's go.

66
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,880
Four thousand Baht.

67
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,400
Four thousand Baht?

68
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,920
Yes.

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,040
Price is so expensive!

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,040
That's trying to rip off tourists.

71
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,040
It definitely wouldn't cost 500.

72
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,720
What did you say?

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,600
Oh, it's very beautiful.

74
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,960
Do you want it?

75
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,800
I told you not to come near me in public.

76
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Have you finished choosing already?

77
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,660
Um.

78
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
This one.

79
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,360
Pay by Qr scan,right?

80
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,900
Yes.

81
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,320
Intend to receive blessings

82
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,880
Receiving blessings.

83
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,680
Why are you following me?

84
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
I told you to separate at the temple.

85
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,320
I've come to escort you.

86
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,760
So, are we going together then

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,960
Let's go.

88
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,160
You told me to go together.

89
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,800
I was being sarcastic.

90
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,320
You don't have to believe every single word I say.

91
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,920
Why are human emotions so complicated?

92
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,200
Why don't you just say what you mean directly?

93
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,320
Don't change the topic.

94
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm going to work.

95
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
You can't come.

96
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,400
It's because I'm worried about you.

97
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm afraid you'll be in danger if you're not by my side.

98
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,400
Stay still.

99
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,960
I can sense something is not right.

100
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,120
I'm serious, this place has ghosts.
