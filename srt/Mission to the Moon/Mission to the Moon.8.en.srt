1
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Your body odor smells the same as always.

2
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,360
To be safe.

3
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,040
You... go.

4
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Hello.

5
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,840
How about this one?

6
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,560
No.

7
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,600
Let's pick, 250 THB

8
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,600
I'll pay by scanning the QR.

9
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,480
Got it.

10
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,800
Done.

11
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,960
I'm not comfortable wearing this.

12
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,160
I've already paid.

13
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,800
You have to wear it.

14
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,440
I... I'm embarrassed.

15
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,320
Why are you embarrassed?

16
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,720
No one can see you.

17
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,760
It's just me here.

18
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,920
Here you go.

19
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
Thank you.

20
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,400
Let's go...

21
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,960
go!

22
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,600
Wait.

23
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,000
What else do you want?

24
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh... garlands!

25
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,080
Buy some garlands and flowers to pay respects at the shrine at home too.

26
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, give me one garland of marigolds, please.

27
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,920
Buy betel set too.

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
Betel set please.

29
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,960
Just two pieces?

30
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,800
Two pieces.

31
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,520
This?

32
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,160
Yes.

33
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
Two pieces, right?

34
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,360
40 baht.

35
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,040
Here.

36
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Thank you.

37
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,520
I'm dedicating these to someone I know.

38
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
I am not just whom you know,

39
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,720
but I am your lover.

40
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,800
Quiet please.

41
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,400
I was just about to say that I can't wear clothes like this.

42
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Do you remember what I told you?

43
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,000
Whatever happens, there's no way to avoid it.

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
You have to stay with it with a peaceful heart.

45
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,040
Yes, it's exactly as you said.

46
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,760
Alright, now focus on pouring the water of dedication.

47
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,480
Am I funny or not?

48
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,680
Yes... uh, no.

49
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
You're cute.

50
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,360
You admire me.

51
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,160
If you like, then I like too.

52
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,520
Hey, what was your career in your past life?

53
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,240
Do you sell khanom krok?

54
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,200
You're so good at flirting.

55
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,400
I don't have any career other than being the son of a king.

56
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
Are you boasting to me?

57
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,120
Boasting?

58
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Yes, boasting, like showing off.

59
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,440
Why does "boasting" mean showing off?

60
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,120
Oh, never mind, don't worry about it.

61
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,360
Let's go home.

62
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,560
"Let's go home"

63
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,040
is such a heartwarming phrase.

64
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,320
Come on, let's go home

65
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,400
Let's go home.

66
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
Hey,

67
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,760
if you're so powerful, show me some magic

68
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,400
and tell me what the winning lottery numbers will be this time!

69
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,080
This one.

70
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,600
No.

71
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,280
Are you sure?

72
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,680
No.

73
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,400
This one.

74
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,880
Here.

75
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,960
Wish you luck.

76
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
Thank you.

77
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,280
If I win the lottery this time,

78
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,560
I'll call you "Sir"

79
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,800
and make a combo of merit to you.

80
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,760
Yeah,

81
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,560
hurry up and find me a new shaman!

82
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,960
Okay.

83
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,800
The reason you came back is because you hoped I would remember you, right?

84
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,880
I wanted you to remember me
