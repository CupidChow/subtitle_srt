1
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,880
Hey you,

2
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,760
if you're so powerful,

3
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,480
show me what the lottery numbers will be for this draw!

4
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,800
Here it is.

5
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,240
This is it.

6
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,040
I hope you win.

7
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,240
Thanks, Auntie.

8
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,360
How could it win?

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,840
Shit!

10
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,960
How is this possible?!

11
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,000
If I win this lottery, I'll call you "My Lord"

12
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,440
and make a huge merit offering!	

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,320
Let me win but why couldn't it have been the first prize?

14
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,440
Wiranvee has been alone for a long time.

15
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,280
To have someone enter his life,
He probably isn't ready yet.

16
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,400
Don't forget that he isn't Wiranvee,

17
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,200
but Navee, who knows nothing at all. 	

18
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,000
Suddenly, someone who isn't human just appears.

19
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,520
Maybe it's time I concede defeat on this matter.

20
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,280
You must give time.

21
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,040
Time to learn about each other.

22
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,320
then you will understand.

23
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,000
Wiranvee might be angry or irritated at first,

24
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,520
but if you observe carefully,

25
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,320
I think he's starting to change.

26
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,320
When he doesn't see you,  he gets just as gloomy as you do.

27
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,000
What's wrong with you? You look stressed.

28
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,840
Stressed? I'm not stressed.

29
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,920
Your voice is high-pitched,

30
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
You're suspicious. Not normal.

31
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,440
Not normal.

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Oh, it's just... I'm thinking about what to do with the money I won from the lottery.

33
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,960
You won the lottery?

34
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,040
Yes!

35
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,520
Let me see.

36
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,160
Damn! Oh, it's the fifth prize.

37
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,680
I thought you won the first prize.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,320
Well! The fifth prize is good enough,

39
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,520
I've never won anything in my life.

40
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,560
This time is just practice,

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,280
next time the first prize for sure!

42
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,240
Amen.

43
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,920
If you're happy, why's your face sad like a dog's?

44
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,400
Sad what? Not sad.

45
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Look,

46
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm off to work.

47
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,200
I think he's sad.

48
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,520
He looks exactly like a dejected dog.

49
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
Did he really win the lottery?

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,160
Yeah, with a face like that, he won the lottery? He looks incredibly miserable.

51
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,240
What a mess.

52
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,800
We have to thank Khun Kob very much.

53
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,000
This is a call that I would say is very goose bumps

54
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,040
and should be a good reminder for many people

55
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,040
"Do good get good, do bad get bad."

56
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,760
So, keep that in mind everyone.

57
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,120
Tonight, before we end this evening, let's go to our last caller.

58
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,480
Hello, Khun Koy.

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Do you have any spooky stories for us today?

60
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,280
Let me preface this by saying,

61
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,000
some people are afraid of ghosts, even though some of them have never seen.

62
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,840
But there are also people who genuinely want to see them.

63
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,480
Do you mean want to see a ghost?

64
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,960
Yes, I want to see a ghost.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,280
And if someone wants to see a ghost,  what should they do?

66
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,160
Let's start with a basic method,

67
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,040
Look through your legs.

68
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,160
They say everyone is born from their mother's crotch,

69
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,560
which is believed to be the area connecting the human world and the spirit world.

70
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,360
Try it, you'll definitely see something.

71
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Seriously, is this real?

72
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,800
Nah, it's not.

73
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,600
If you want to meet him, you should say it like this.

74
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,280
What if it doesn't work?

75
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,640
I have another way. Ouija board!

76
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,240
This method is classic.

77
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,960
You have to invite the spirit into the glass first,

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,560
and then ask the questions you want to ask.

79
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,960
Then, they'll answer you themselves.

80
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
If you are here,

81
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,000
I invite your spirit to possess this glass.

82
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,520
Where are you now?

83
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,160
Don't you want to see my face anymore?
