1
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,440
I never knew there was such a beautiful place in the palace.

2
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,240
Only you I allow can enter.

3
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,760
Why is it that no one else can come in?

4
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Is the Crown Prince so possessive?

5
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,240
Yes.

6
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,800
Not just of this place, which I've only allowed you into,

7
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,720
but also of my heart.

8
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,960
The moon is beautiful tonight.

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,360
It's been this beautiful for a long time.

10
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,400
This is where you can see the moon most clearly.

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,760
I like to come here when I feel lonely

12
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,320
because every time I look up,

13
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,040
I feel like I have a friend by my side.

14
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,000
But since I've had you,

15
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
I haven't felt that way again.

16
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,520
And I swear to my friend that..

17
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,720
I will love you from this moment, forever.

18
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,440
Crown Prince...

19
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Is something troubling you?

20
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,040
Is it about us?

21
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
You don't have to worry about anything.

22
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,240
Even if the sky falls and the earth crumbles, I won't let anyone separate us,

23
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,320
because I love you.

24
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,000
And you, do you love me?

25
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,120
Oh, Viranvee,

26
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,960
please tell me and make my heart happy,

27
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,960
please, please?

28
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,800
If you can bring me the moon,

29
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,680
I'll tell you what you ask.

30
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,920
Of course.

31
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,840
Then close your eyes and wait here for a moment.

32
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,240
You can open your eyes now.

33
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,680
Will you tell me now?

34
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,000
I think you are too clever.

35
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,000
I admit it.

36
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,480
So, Viranvee,

37
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
do you love me?

38
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,160
I do.

39
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
I love you with all my heart.

40
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,320
No matter how much time passes, my love for you will never change.

41
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,880
Even after tens of thousands of days, I still miss you deeply.

42
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,880
It has never changed.

43
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,200
Our love transcends time.

44
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,200
I wait for destiny to bring our hearts together.

45
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,880
No matter how long it takes, I will only love you.

46
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,640
Last night, we...

47
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,840
Hey, don't talk about it.

48
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,600
What happened last night is strictly forbidden to talk about.

49
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,880
Even after all this, you're still not sure?

50
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
I told you I loved you at least ten times while we were making love.

51
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,880
Don't you remember?

52
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,760
Then tonight I'll only say three words.

53
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,680
What will you say?

54
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,520
I love you.
