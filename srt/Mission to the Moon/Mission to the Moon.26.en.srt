1
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,360
You never changed at all.

2
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,800
Give me your hand.

3
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,880
Everything still looks the same,

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,360
just like the day I brought you here.

5
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,880
What you saw in your dream, it's real.

6
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,200
Viranvee,

7
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,120
the Prince, asked me to bring you some tea.

8
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,120
He thought you might be talking with the King for a while.

9
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,760
Thank you very much.

10
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,320
Viranvee,

11
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,880
Viranvee,

12
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,760
you must be alright.

13
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
Prince.

14
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,120
Viranvee.

15
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,320
I love you  with all my heart.

16
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,720
I love you too,

17
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
with all my heart.

18
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,960
If there's a next life,

19
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
I wish all forms of love...

20
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,600
would be accepted,

21
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,920
no matter what they are.

22
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
Virunwee,

23
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,600
wake up!

24
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
Wake up!

25
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
Don't leave me!

26
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,000
Viranwee!

27
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,480
Viranwee!

28
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,240
Wake up!

29
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,160
Why?

30
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Why did you have to do this?

31
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,960
Because he’s a blemish on your life.

32
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,960
You are a royal prince,  nothing should tarnish your reputation

33
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,320
or make people gossip that the prince is insane.

34
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,280
If you were to become king one day instead of me, how would you be credible?

35
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,360
Grieve all you want, then take his body and dispose of it.

36
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,760
I...

37
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
we'll meet again soon.

38
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,160
You remember me now, don't you?

39
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,560
You said you wouldn't go anywhere if I didn't remember anything.

40
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,040
Even if you don't remember me, I still have to go.

41
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
Why do you act so dishonorably?

42
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Honor?

43
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,720
What about a king who orders people killed just because they don't get their way,

44
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,760
and that person is someone his own son loves?

45
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,080
Is that what you call honorable?

46
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Hey Sasin.
