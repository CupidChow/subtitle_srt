00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,480
Navee, do you want some drinks?

2
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,400
Damn it! Why? He tricked me again!

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So what's next, red shirt?

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,640
I think she's just rambling and not making any sense.

5
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,560
So, was the ghost wearing a red or white shirt? Did you see, Navee?

6
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,600
Navee!

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,640
Navee!

8
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,480
Navee!

9
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,960
Navee!

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,920
Navee!

11
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,800
Navee!

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Navee!

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,960
Ughhhhh,

14
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,960
You really are a ghost!

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,960
you keep haunting me!

16
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,920
Where are you?

17
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
I wish you sweet dreams.

18
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,560
No matter who agrees or not, I don't care.

19
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,760
I only care about you.

20
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,120
Just believe in me,

21
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,080
in my love for you,  that's enough.

22
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,760
Maybe it's time I concede defeat on this matter.

23
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
And if someone wants to see a ghost,
