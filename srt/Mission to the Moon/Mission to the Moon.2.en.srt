1
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,280
Huh? Will you move me to do a ghost radio program?

2
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Yes, or do you have any problem?

3
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,360
I’m not,

4
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,800
but you will surely be the one who has a problem.

5
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,640
Why?

6
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,120
You're going to let someone who doesn't believe in ghosts do a ghost radio program?

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
The listeners are going to laugh so hard.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,720
If you don't do it, what will you do?

9
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,880
Because the program you're currently doing, I'm going to shut it down.

10
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,000
Shut down?

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,760
Yes.

12
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,600
Sponsors aren't coming in.

13
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,320
They prefer this program more.

14
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,240
You know how Thai people like ghost stories and supernatural stuff.

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,280
Our boss sees that you're talented, work well,

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,800
and have many fans,

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,800
so that's why you're being moved here.

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,080
I didn't want to leave you.

19
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
And most importantly,

20
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,360
if you don't do it, then I guess we'll have to say goodbye. Bye...

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
When should we start working?

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,160
Look who's getting smart now.

23
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,800
See you tonight, okay?

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,560
Tonight?

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Oh...

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,320
Tonight?

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah,

28
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,440
why hasn't Tap's program been cancelled yet?

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,080
Do you know?

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,600
Your program is out of trend,

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,360
It's boring as hell, just playing songs for people to listen to.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,360
Nowadays it's all about telling ghost stories.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,600
You gotta play on beliefs.

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
People are all thinking about the spiritual stuff.

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,480
but my program had sponsors lining up before I even grabbed the mic.

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,960
Then if you don’t want to do it, why did you agree with her?

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Oh dear, what am I going to do then?

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,760
You're right.

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,800
So, do you believe me now that your fortune is down?

40
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,240
Hey Bua.

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,200
You can't let beliefs and horoscopes dictate everything in your life.

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,600
You can believe if you want,

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,520
but don't be superstitious.

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
I beg you.

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
I agree, don't be superstitious.

46
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Shit..

47
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,120
then why are you wearing a Buddha amulet on your neck?

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,720
Woahhh, you really don't know anything!

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,640
Do you know about marketing and fashion?

50
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Some Buddha amulets are worth millions,

51
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,720
you know! How can you say that?

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,480
WTF fashion!?

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,480
Come on!

54
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,360
What kind of fashion is that, huh?

55
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,560
Excuse me,

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
can I have a shirt? I'm cold.

57
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,760
What kind of Kumarn Thong wears a shirt?

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,280
Don’t have to be real,

59
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,000
bodysuit would be fine.

60
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,280
Okay, wait a second.

61
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,760
Thank you.

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,080
Okay, Hello listeners and viewers,

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,160
Welcome to this Halloween night.

64
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,480
I'm Navee, the same good guy, with a ghost program! Alright,

65
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,560
let's start with the first line.

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,160
Hello, Khun...

67
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,720
Khun Kwang.

68
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,880
Hello, Khun Kwang.

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,400
Hello P’Vee

70
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,320
What spooky stories do you want to tell us tonight?

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,320
Have you ever heard the belief about Halloween?

72
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
Halloween is the day that spirits return to meet someone they miss.

73
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,400
I've never heard that before!

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,560
That's interesting and very exciting.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
Please continue, please continue.

76
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,600
My ex-boyfriend passed away unexpectedly last Halloween,

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,320
and then he  came back.

78
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,200
Whoa! I’m Goosebumps!

79
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,480
That’s so scary.

80
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,880
I once read that there are two deaths in a person's life.

81
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
First is the physical death,

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
and second is the death of memory.

83
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:13,400
My boyfriend made me believe that the two things that sustain life are love and memory.

84
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,120
But if these two things die away, then we face true death forever.

85
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,600
Okay, let's move  to the last call of this night.

86
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,960
Hello….

87
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,760
Hello?

88
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,560
Hello?

89
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,960
Hello? Hello.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
Can you hear me?

91
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,440
Do you believe in reincarnation?

92
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,040
What? What no?...

93
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,160
What? What no?

94
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
That's not right.

95
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,000
Hello?

96
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,280
I know you don't believe, but I will make you believe.

97
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,160
Hello?

98
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,320
Hello?

99
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
Hello?

100
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,040
Hello? Hello?

101
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,600
Hey Bua, who did you get to talk to me?

102
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,920
Seriously, this person is weird.

103
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,160
I didn't even press accept.

104
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,800
When I checked on my phone number, I couldn't find it.

105
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,960
Do you think it's a ghost?

106
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,920
WTH Ghost!

107
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,600
Ghosts can't use telephones!!

108
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,080
Don't disrespect what you don't believe,then you will see it soon!

109
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,800
Come on!

110
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,800
If it comes, I'll kick its head spinning.

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
Bless me!

112
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,640
I really want to see the person who kicks ghosts.

113
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,520
What the hell you drink,

114
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,840
you’re drunk so hard!

115
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,520
are you seriously going to let him wear a Kumarn Thong outfit to sleep like this?

116
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,080
Don’t give a shit!

117
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,880
Shit...
