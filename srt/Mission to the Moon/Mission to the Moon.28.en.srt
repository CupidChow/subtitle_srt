1
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
You're awake?

2
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,720
Please sit down.

3
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,640
It'll be done soon.

4
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Hey youu!!

5
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,920
What is it? Why are you so excited?

6
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,360
The shaman you asked me to find, I found him!

7
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,320
My mom confirmed he's really good.

8
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,720
No need,

9
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,360
he's gone.

10
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,680
Huh?! Seriously?

11
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,160
Was it that easy?

12
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,040
How'd you do it?

13
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,920
I didn't do anything.

14
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,520
Nothing at all.

15
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,240
Okay, well that's good then.

16
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,320
Is that Shaman  you mentioned really good?

17
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,360
Why?

18
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,880
If he’s really good, can he bring one ghost back to me?

19
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,720
Vee, are you okay? Huh?

20
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,240
Are you okay?

21
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,560
How to be okay?

22
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm not okay,

23
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
He  just disappeared without a word,

24
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,360
even though they knew everything.

25
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,920
I'm a person too, you know?

26
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,040
I have a heart.

27
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,040
Calm down.

28
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,280
I feel bad for our friend.

29
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,160
I think we should take him home.

30
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,120
Really?

31
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,920
Yeah, what else are you going to eat? You're drunk as hell already.

32
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,040
Let's go home.

33
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
I’m not going home. Don't bother me.

34
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
What are your symptoms? Tell the doctor!

35
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
What's wrong with you, huh?

36
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,520
The story you told us two,

37
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,920
it wasn't about your friend, it was about you, right?

38
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,800
It's about me.

39
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,160
I knew it.

40
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,440
I knew it too.

41
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,360
Don't you think I'm crazy,

42
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,600
but do you remember that ghost I told you guys about?

43
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,520
Umm, I remember.

44
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,800
That ghost is what made me this way.

45
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,880
Holy shit, so that means you and a ghost, a ghost, a ghost...

46
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah, I'm in love with a ghost, and I've already... done with the ghost.

47
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
You've already done with the ghost?!

48
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,920
Whoa, damn! I've listened to hundreds of ghost stories,

49
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,920
but your  story is truly the best!

50
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,200
This world is just full of unbelievable things.

51
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,760
And then... then he disappeared.

52
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,720
Yeah, what the hell kind of rule is that?

53
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,200
Aw, Vee, aww.

54
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,200
Aw, that's so sad.

55
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,320
So sorry for our friend.

56
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,400
It's okay, it's okay.

57
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,680
It's okay,

58
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,800
it's okay,

59
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,240
It's okay,

60
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
it's okay, Vee.

61
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,720
You just go back to being alone,

62
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,520
living life alone,

63
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,640
just like you used to.

64
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,920
You just go back to living alone, that's all.

65
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,400
What's so hard about that?

66
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,920
Are you sure you've made up your mind?

67
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,520
When your karma is depleted,

68
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,440
that's when you'll find true happiness.
