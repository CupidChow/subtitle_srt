1
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,520
Oh, How did I end up sleeping here?

2
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,080
This smell...

3
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,240
Even after making merit, if you still feel like he hasn’t gone.

4
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,240
The last way is...

5
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,720
A shaman.

6
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,360
A shaman?

7
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Yes.

8
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Really.

9
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,960
Okay, I believe you this time.

10
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,280
This house is really haunted by ghosts!

11
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,200
Then what should I do?

12
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,000
You don't need to do anything.

13
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
I'll take care of it myself.

14
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,760
Don't worry.

15
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,360
This ghost is just some weak wandering spirit.

16
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,280
It doesn't have any power.

17
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,480
What's wrong,shaman?

18
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,000
It's in the bathroom!

19
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,800
The bathroom?

20
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,880
Get out!

21
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,960
Ghost haunting!!

22
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,120
Ghost haunting.

23
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,680
What's wrong,shaman?

24
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,080
Ghost haunting!!

25
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,480
What's wrong with him?

26
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Hey...

27
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,920
What do you want?

28
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
We're going to talk nicely now, right?

29
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,640
What do you want to say?

30
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,000
I come in peace.

31
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,160
Peace? What’s time?

32
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,920
Probably in the afternoon.

33
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,920
Huh!?

34
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,640
You asked about the time.

35
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,960
Why are you laughing?

36
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,680
Nothing,

37
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,680
Just tell me what you want.

38
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,040
I have some reasons why I must return here.

39
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,960
Hmm, and what are those reasons?

40
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
I can't tell you much.

41
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,960
It's a rule of time.

42
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
Your memories will only return when you sleep.

43
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,240
All I can say is that I came back here for you to remember me.

44
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,360
I... uh...

45
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,360
I remember you.

46
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,480
Why do I remember you?

47
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,200
Because we used to love each other.

48
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Please go back to where you came from.

49
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,280
I can’t return.

50
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I must sleep with the one I love every night.

51
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,840
No way.

52
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
I have something to beg you.

53
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,840
I'd like you to change your outfit.

54
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Why do you want me to change outfits?

55
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,880
Your nipples bother me.
