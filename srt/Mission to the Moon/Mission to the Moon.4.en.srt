1
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,680
Shit,

2
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,120
Am I dreaming again?

3
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
I've been dreaming so much lately.

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Who are you?

5
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,200
Oh, the person we met last night.

6
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Did you drive me home?

7
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,240
No, that's not right.

8
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,440
Or... don't tell me... we two...

9
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,280
I’m Sri Sinwadee,

10
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,600
or Prince Sasin the royal son.

11
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,520
Hold on,

12
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
are you hungover or  just immersed in this role?

13
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
Don’t you believe me?

14
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,280
I don't believe you.

15
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,840
Okay

16
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
What the hell?

17
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,680
Shit...

18
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,120
Why do you have to look so disgusted with me?

19
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
Because you're a ghost.

20
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,800
Speak nicely.

21
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm not just any ghost, I’m much higher than that.

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Ghost is a ghost.

23
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,760
The fortune of those born on Monday is currently not good.

24
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,320
The fate has turned upside down,

25
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
and Enemies from a former life are not going away,

26
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,360
causing unhappiness in their lives.

27
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,520
Hey Vee, your luck is terrible.

28
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Would you go make merit?

29
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,560
Shit,

30
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,880
could it really be enemies from my former life??

31
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,160
Hello Bua, sorry for calling to wake you up.

32
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Yeah, what's up?

33
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,400
I saw a ghost.

34
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
What did you say?

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,920
A ghost followed me home.

36
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,160
What should I do?

37
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,280
You should make merit and dedicate it to your Enemies from a former life first.

38
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,400
Whatever has already happened cannot be avoided.

39
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
If it can't be avoided, what should I do?

40
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,400
You must live with it with a peaceful heart.

41
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,960
When people are in a very bad situation

42
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
they can lose money just by doing nothing.

43
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,680
The more you struggle and run away, the worse it will become.

44
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,160
Therefore, you must stay with it with a calm and mindful heart.

45
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,720
Live your life with awareness.

46
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,960
Got it.

47
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,000
and then follow it with making merit through donations and releasing animals.

48
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,760
It will help extend your life and improve your luck.

49
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,920
Finally, we met.

50
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,120
Thanks a lot for helping to protect Wirunwee,

51
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,560
until the day I returned.

52
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,840
He is still as stubborn as used to be.

53
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,840
You might be a little tired

54
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I could handle it before,

55
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,800
so why wouldn't I be able to handle it now?

56
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Did you call me for something?

57
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,240
Because I miss you.

58
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Can you sleep with me tonight?

59
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,360
No, I can’t.

60
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,160
Intruder! Intruder!

61
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,280
Hey.

62
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
You are not the only soldier here.

63
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,520
But I..

64
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,480
Stay with me.

65
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,200
I know that you can handle it,

66
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,200
Then what should I do?

67
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,920
Just don't startle him, that should be enough.
