1
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,280
For anyone who missed the Super Full Moon last time, don't worry!

2
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,360
Because tomorrow night, the moon will orbit close to Earth again.

3
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
Can I ask you something?

4
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,200
I want to know about that time,

5
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,480
two thousand years ago,

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,320
when you said we were lovers.

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,200
Did we love each other and then die,

8
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,200
or did someone separate us?

9
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,280
So, you're starting to remember.

10
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,880
Not exactly,

11
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
but I've been having strange dreams.

12
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:56,320
I don't know if there just dreams or if there is about two thousand years ago.

13
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Then tell me about it.

14
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,000
I can help you figure out if there is reality or just a dream.

15
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,120
The moment you remember me, I will depart forever.

16
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,520
That is my mission.

17
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,480
How’s that?

18
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,240
No, I don't remember anything anymore.

19
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,760
I don't remember anything at all.

20
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Then I will help you remember.

21
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,720
No, no, I don't want to hear it.

22
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,320
You don't have to tell me anything.

23
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,760
Maybe I ate too much and that's why I dreamt about it.

24
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,440
Are you sure?

25
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm sure.

26
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Navee.

27
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Virunvee

28
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
Navee,

29
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,320
Navee.

30
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,040
Ouch.

31
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,440
What's wrong with you?

32
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,640
What happened?

33
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
Navee,

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,960
Navee,

35
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Navee!

36
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,600
What happened?

37
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,920
Navee, I have somewhere I want to take you there.

38
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,360
Where is it?

39
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,080
You'll find out soon enough.

40
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,920
For your first date, you have to impress him.

41
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
How?

42
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,200
Your friend, right?

43
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,880
Yeah, he's my friend.

44
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,320
Then tell your friend not to forget to put on perfume, definitely.

45
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,840
Smelling good is half the battle won.

46
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,840
I guarantee he'll be impressed and want to stay close to you all day.

47
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Why are you checking? It's not you.

48
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,000
Uh... I forgot.

49
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,880
Oh, Vee. Stop lying that it's about your friend.

50
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Wasn't it smooth?

51
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,360
A lot.

52
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,760
How do you know?

53
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,200
You don't have friends,

54
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,760
only friends in your whole life are me and Thap.

55
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
That's harsh.

56
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,160
I won't pester you now.

57
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm not in a hurry,

58
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,760
but your date has to be fantastic.

59
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,480
Are you sure about this?

60
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
Sure, this is me.

61
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,920
It's exactly because it's you that I'm not confident.

62
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,480
Why? What about me?

63
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,640
You don't have a husband.

64
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,120
Vee, little jerk!

65
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
I'm annoyed!!

66
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,600
Smell good.

67
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
Smells good.

68
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,000
You always startle me!

69
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,040
Why are you startled?

70
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,680
Just in case it's a vengeful ghost coming to take my life!

71
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,480
How about we go on a date to a temple then?

72
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,800
No thanks, I don't like temples.

73
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,680
Alright, but you must promise me you'll make merit regularly.

74
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,480
Hmm, I'll try.

75
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,640
What is this?

76
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,080
It's an earbud.

77
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,360
From now on, when I walk with you,

78
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,560
I won't have to worry about what people think when I want to talk to you.

79
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,800
You want a couple's picture but don't have a picture of a couple?

80
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,560
Then can I describe their faces to you

81
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
and you draw based on what I tell you?

82
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,960
and full lips, pink,

83
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,000
kissable lips.

84
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,120
Huh?!
