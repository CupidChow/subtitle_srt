1
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,080
Hey Vee!

2
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,560
Umm.

3
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,360
Oh good, you're here.

4
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,080
What's up? What's wrong?

5
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
That's a shaman you found for me.

6
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Oh, Did the ghost leave?

7
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,680
If it leaves, I would thank you already,

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,000
not be sitting here waiting.

9
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,640
Huh?!

10
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,960
Why?

11
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,680
My mom said this person was the best!

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The best?

13
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,960
Look at this, Bua.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,680
What? What?

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,080
Shit...

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,680
that means it's strong.

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,480
Yeah, hurry up and find me a new shaman!

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,200
Okay.

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,520
This time I want a good one!

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,560
If you bring a fake shaman again,

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
I'll let  ghosts haunt you.

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,840
No,

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,600
next time I'll find a good shaman for you.

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,920
A really good one.

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,880
What are you doing on my bed?

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,960
Get down.

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
Why have you returned so late?

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
I have work to do.

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,560
Are you tired?

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,560
No,

31
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,320
I'm not tired.

32
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
You've never been able to lie to me even once.

33
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,920
Your face looks so tired.

34
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,760
I better go take a shower.

35
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,480
Why is my heart beating so fast?

36
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,440
Shit!

37
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,120
What are you doing?

38
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,640
Why did you come in?

39
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,360
I brought this for you.

40
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,960
Thanks, but no more next time.

41
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
We already agreed that you can't just pop in and out like this.

42
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,920
Sorry, I was just trying to be helpful.

43
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
I understand,

44
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,760
but next time wait for my permission first,

45
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,080
okay?

46
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,880
And why are you so shy?

47
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,720
I've already seen all of you.

48
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,920
Shit!

49
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,400
You saw all of me?

50
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,120
How long are you going to keep staring at me?

51
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,240
I thought you were asleep.

52
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,840
How can I sleep!

53
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
and who allows you to sleep on my bed?

54
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,520
I allow myself.

55
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,360
Get down, I don't allow you!

56
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,760
If you don't respect the rules of living together,

57
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,760
then I won't keep my promise either.

58
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,040
And I don't care about your crazy mission anymore.

59
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,760
Alright, alright.

60
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,560
I won't disobey your orders then.

61
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,960
Can't sleep?

62
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,080
I can help you, you know.

63
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,080
How?

64
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,880
By cuddling with me.

65
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,960
Formerly, whenever you couldn't sleep,

66
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,800
I would kiss your forehead and hold you tight.

67
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,880
You would fall asleep quickly,

68
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,840
even easier than a baby.

69
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,160
That's nonsense!

70
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
Who knows if you just made that up.

71
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,440
Good night.

72
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,640
Can’t you sleep?

73
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,720
Good night.
