1
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,040
What is it, Navee?

2
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,640
Can I see you forever?

3
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,400
Yes, if you ask.

4
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,840
What will you do?

5
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
Just stay still.

6
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,600
I think I might like you.

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,560
What did you say?

8
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,600
I said,

9
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,000
I think I might like you.

10
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Like?

11
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,960
Yes.

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,880
Just like?

13
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,280
Why don't you love me?

14
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,360
When I love you, I love you with all my heart.

15
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,280
Oh, we just met.

16
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,840
How can I fall in love that fast?

17
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,560
Letting you kiss me was already too much.

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,920
Then kiss me again.

19
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,080
Your lips are soft, I like it.

20
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,360
If you don't stop, I won't be able to stop either.

21
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,720
If you can't stop, then don't.

22
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,960
I'm curious to see what it's like to have sex with a ghost.

23
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,280
Navee, I have something for you.

24
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,400
Did you steal it?

25
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,520
I’m not.

26
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,240
If you didn't steal it, how did you get it?

27
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
Do you have money?

28
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,960
I just have done it but by telling her the lottery numbers.

29
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,120
In the end, she got more money than that necklace.

30
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,520
Four thousand baht.

31
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
Four thousand baht.

32
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,840
Yes

33
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
Do you want it?

34
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,600
So, you've already chosen?

35
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,440
Yes.

36
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,200
If you like it, I'll buy it for you.

37
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,320
Pick up the first lottery ticket from the bottom left row.

38
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,120
Oh, if it doesn't win,

39
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,120
you'll be a ghost who's both a thief and a scammer!

40
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,440
Just trust me.

41
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,240
Nothing will go wrong.

42
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,360
Just like my feelings for you—

43
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
It’s stable and unwavering.

44
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,320
I love you,

45
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,280
whether you're Wiranwee or Navee.

46
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Is something troubling you?

47
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,520
Is it about us?

48
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You don't have to worry about anything.

49
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,680
Even if the sky falls and the earth crumbles, I won't let anyone separate us,

50
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,720
because I love you.

51
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,480
And you, do you love me?
