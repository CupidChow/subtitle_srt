1
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,960
Humans really like to make trouble for themselves.

2
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
What trouble?

3
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,320
It’s about that thing you gambled on.

4
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,520
Oh, I just bought it for fun.

5
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,120
If I win, great.

6
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,360
If not, there's next time.

7
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,680
Don't you ever disappoint or regret?

8
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,840
Of course.

9
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,280
But it's probably the last hope for a human like me.

10
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,560
Humans always live on hope.

11
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,760
Even if you are a ghost, you still have hope.

12
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,960
Me?

13
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,480
The reason you came back is because you hoped I would remember you, right?

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,480
I wanted you to remember me

15
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
because I wanted you to know...

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,960
how much I love you

17
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,840
It has been so long, but my love for you remains unchanged.

18
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,480
Through tens of thousands of days, I still miss and yearn for you.

19
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,680
My love has never changed, it transcends time.

20
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,320
I wait patiently for destiny to bring our hearts together.

21
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,800
No matter how long it takes, my love belongs to you only.

22
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,400
Who are you?

23
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,840
My name is Srisinwadee, or Chao Fah Sasin.

24
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Because I want you to know...

25
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,600
how much I love you.

26
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,520
Hey Vee!

27
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,680
Oh good, you're here.

28
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,520
What's up? What's wrong?

29
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
That's a shaman you found for me.

30
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,480
Oh, Did the ghost leave?

31
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,120
If it leaves, I would thank you already,

32
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,400
not be sitting here waiting.

33
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Huh?! Why?

34
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,400
My mom said this person was the best!

35
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,280
The best?

36
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
Look at this, Bua.

37
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,120
What? What?

38
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,520
Shit...

39
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
that means it's strong.

40
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,400
Yeah,

41
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,920
hurry up to find me a new shaman!

42
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,320
Okay.

43
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,120
This time I want a good one!

44
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,520
You've never been able to lie to me, not even once.

45
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,840
Your face looks so tired.

46
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,000
Can't sleep?

47
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,600
I can help you.
