1
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,480
You can remember me now?

2
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,640
No.

3
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,760
I don't remember.

4
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,040
I don't remember anything at all.

5
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
It's time for me to go.

6
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,960
No!

7
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,480
You said you wouldn't go anywhere if I didn't remember anything.

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,680
I don't remember anything at all, so you'll stay with me forever, right?

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,840
You won't leave, right?

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,680
Even if you don't remember me, I still have to go.

11
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,600
No,

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,800
I won't let you go anywhere!

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,600
Before my last breath,

14
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:19,600
I prayed that I would return to you when the moon came closest to the Earth.

15
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,760
And that I would only leave when it came closest again in the next cycle.

16
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,720
And now, my friend has come to take me back.

17
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,440
Remember that I am always around you,

18
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,520
even if you can't see me.

19
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,560
And whenever you miss me,

20
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,680
look at that moon.

21
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
It will always shine brightly,

22
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,280
just like the love I have for you.

23
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,920
It will be beautiful and remain this way forever.

24
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,280
No matter how much time passes, my love for you will never change.

25
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,880
Even after tens of thousands of days, I still miss you deeply.

26
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,640
It has never changed.

27
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,120
Our love transcends time.

28
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,800
I wait for destiny to bring our hearts together.

29
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
No matter how long it takes, I will only love you.

30
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,200
Why do you always act like a barrier to joy  for others?

31
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,320
And you?

32
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,640
Why do you act so dishonorably?

33
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Honor?

34
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,120
What about a king who orders people killed just because they don't get their way,

35
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,200
and that person is someone his own son loves?

36
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,680
Is that what you call honorable?

37
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,760
Hey Sasin.

38
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,480
If killing someone is just to make your son king,

39
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,000
I refuse that honor.

40
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
You have no right to refuse.

41
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,600
Is that Shaman  you mentioned really good?

42
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
Why?

43
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,600
If he’s really good, can he bring one ghost back to me?
