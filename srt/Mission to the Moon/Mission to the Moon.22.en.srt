1
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,840
So, Viranvee,

2
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,760
do you love me?

3
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,520
I do.

4
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,160
I love you with all my heart.

5
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,720
Are you happy?

6
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Good morning.

7
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,760
Good morning.

8
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,360
Last night, we...

9
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,560
Hey, don't talk about it.

10
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,320
What happened last night is strictly forbidden to talk about.

11
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,720
Why don't you let me speak,

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
when you were willing and we got along so well?

13
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,000
just stop!

14
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Adorable.

15
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,560
You know that word too?

16
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,480
Well, you made me know the word "adorable."

17
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Oh my god,

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,160
are you selling Khanom Krok? You're so good at flirting!

19
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,320
Go take a bath.

20
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,320
I'll prepare breakfast for you.

21
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,120
Go out.

22
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,760
How am I supposed to go?

23
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm naked.

24
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
Naked?

25
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,560
What's naked?

26
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,480
Well, I don't have any clothes on.

27
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,160
How can I walk out?

28
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,920
Ahhh.

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,520
Why should you be shy?

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,640
Whether it's Viranvee or you,

31
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,320
I've seen all of you already.

32
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,560
If you don't stop talking about this,

33
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
I won't let you near me again.

34
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,760
Alright, I'll stop. I'll stop right now.

35
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,880
Um, get out.

36
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,240
Yes, sir.

37
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,600
Hey, it's just the two of us. Why so much food?

38
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Because I want you to eat a lot.

39
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,720
For what?

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,320
Well, you use a lot of energy.

41
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,560
You...

42
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,360
aren't you eating?

43
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,680
You're more appetizing than all this food.

44
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,600
I think we need to talk.

45
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,120
What’s up

46
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,960
It's true that we've sexual relations, but it was just once.

47
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,240
So, things between us are still the same.

48
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,520
The same?

49
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,800
Yes, until I'm sure I truly love you.

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Then we can talk about it again.

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Even after all this, you're still not sure?

52
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
I told you I loved you at least ten times while we were making love.

53
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't you remember?

54
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
No.

55
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,760
You're so light.

56
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,760
You said it,

57
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,320
don't complain later then.

58
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,200
Alright.

59
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,000
Then tonight I'll only say three words.

60
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,920
What will you say?

61
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
I love you.

62
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,720
I love you.

63
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,480
I should be more unsure.

64
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,080
I've never heard you say love.

65
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
But I already told you I like you

66
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,480
It's not the same.

67
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,040
Just wait then.

68
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,640
Everything's happening so fast.

69
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,000
Please wait for me.

70
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,320
Okay, but don't let me wait too long.

71
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,200
Huh... You're such a sensitive ghost.

72
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,360
Because I don't know how long I'll be able to wait to hear you tell me you love

73
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,200
What do you mean?

74
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,480
Nothing.

75
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,880
I just said that.

76
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,720
It's because no one knows the time or day.

77
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,120
It's about my friend's story.

78
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,960
Is it the same friend?

79
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,800
Your friend again.

80
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,000
The same person.

81
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Oh, how so? Tell us.

82
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,200
What’s up

83
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,880
Um,

84
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,640
how should I start

85
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,160
Just tell us, Isn't it about your friend?

86
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,760
Just tell us what happened 1, 2, 3, 4.

87
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,280
Then Bua and I can help give our opinions.

88
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,600
Yeah, hurry up and tell us! I want to know now.

89
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,760
So... My friend slept with someone who isn't their boyfriend.

90
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,360
Is that all?

91
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,040
What's so strange about that?

92
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,200
What's strange is...

93
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,920
Is what, Vee?

94
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,760
We like each other, but we're not together.

95
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,520
Oh, just ask him to be partners!

96
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,160
How hard can it be?

97
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,760
That's exactly what's hard.

98
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,960
Why? You're afraid to ask?

99
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,120
Yeah, exactly.

100
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,120
damn it!

101
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,360
Don't you have a mouth?

102
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,760
What are you holding in your mouth? Just say it!

103
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,760
If you keep waiting for him to ask, when will it ever happen?

104
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,440
You've come this far, just go for it!

105
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
So complicated.

106
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,200
You guys aren't scolding me, are you?

107
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,640
I'm not scolding you. I'm scolding your friend.

108
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
Or are you going to say it's about you?

109
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
My friend.

110
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,520
Okay, friend.

111
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,760
Why didn't you tell Navee the truth?

112
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,120
Whether I tell him or not, it won't change anything.

113
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,360
But at least he would be able to prepare himself.

114
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
I don't want Nawee to have anything else to worry about.

115
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,560
At the very least, he must be happy above all else.

116
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
When that time comes,

117
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,040
I believe he will get through it.

118
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,320
Why are you still outside after getting home?

119
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm tired today.

120
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,440
Do you want me to help you with anything?

121
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,680
Seeing your face makes my tiredness disappear.

122
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,920
Then why wait?
