1
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,160
Why are you still outside after getting home?

2
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,960
I'm tired today.

3
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you want me to help you with anything?

4
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,080
Can you help me up to my room?

5
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,080
I can't walk anymore.

6
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,600
Of course.

7
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Do you want me to help you with anything else,

8
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,920
or take a bath?

9
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,800
Okay, no problem.

10
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,040
And if...

11
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,520
If what?

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,480
What if it's more than that?

13
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,280
Well... that's okay too,

14
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,840
no problem either.

15
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,360
But you're tired.

16
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,920
Seeing your face makes my tiredness disappear.

17
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,800
Then why wait?

18
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,600
What's wrong with you?

19
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,680
Just say whatever it is.

20
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,200
You know?

21
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,680
I see you're quiet.

22
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
You've looked overthinking since you arrived.

23
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Is there something you want to tell me?

24
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm just thinking about us.

25
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,160
About us?

26
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,360
Well, you and me. Our status isn't clear.

27
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,760
You're a ghost,

28
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,760
and I'm human.

29
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,440
I just don't see how we can make this work.

30
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,880
Am I being here with you every day, every moment, not enough?

31
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,920
Never mind.

32
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,320
Trust me, I will be with you.

33
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,560
Whether it's last life, this life, or next life.

34
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,920
Even if one day you can't see me,

35
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,920
my heart will be with you forever.

36
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,440
What do you mean?

37
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,320
It means I love you,

38
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,720
Good night, Navee.

39
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,920
Good night, my ghost.

40
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,440
This ghost smells so good

41
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Good morning.

42
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,760
Um, good morning.

43
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
Wow... Is there anything I can help you with?

44
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,160
No, just sit down.

45
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Be careful, I might get spoiled

46
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
if you do everything for me like this.

47
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,640
Is that not good?

48
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,200
It's good, but...

49
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,640
Hmm?

50
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,920
Never mind.

51
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,760
Do you want to help, don't you?

52
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,080
Yeah.

53
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,480
Okay.

54
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,120
Then go chop the vegetables. That's the easiest.

55
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,480
No matter how much time passes, my love for you will never change.

56
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,880
Even after tens of thousands of days, I still miss you deeply.

57
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,800
It has never changed.

58
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,120
Our love transcends time.

59
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,920
I wait for destiny to bring our hearts together.

60
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm truly confused, honestly.

61
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,440
Suddenly, you appeared and said we used to be lovers.

62
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,040
And then you just vanish abruptly after showing up

63
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,160
That also scares me.

64
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,320
This is going to end up on The Ghost Radio; poor P'Jack.

65
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,440
But as time goes on,

66
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,040
more things surprise me.

67
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,720
The idea that we were once in love—at first, I half-believed it, half-didn't.

68
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,360
In the end, it turned out to be so true; being with you directly was utterly astonishing.

69
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,520
My heart tells me it's indescribable, like falling in love.

70
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Over time, it made me forget you for a while.

71
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,920
But in the end, I slowly came back to loving you.

72
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,400
No matter how long it's been since we last met or saw each other,

73
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,920
I still love you the same.

74
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,640
No matter how much time passes, my love for you will never change.

75
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,160
Even after tens of thousands of days, I still miss you deeply.

76
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,040
It has never changed.

77
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,280
Our love transcends time.

78
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,720
I wait for destiny to bring our hearts together.

79
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,360
No matter how long it takes, I will only love you.

80
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,320
You don't need to be this close.

81
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,680
Step back a bit.

82
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,120
Have you ever realized how annoying you can be sometimes?

83
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,520
But then when you're not around, I feel so lonely and empty, I can barely stand it.

84
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,640
I won't do anything to you here.

85
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,920
Don't be afraid.

86
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Oh, you!

87
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,160
That's not what I meant at all!

88
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,600
Your head is always full of those kinds of things.

89
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Done.

90
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,840
It wasn't difficult at all, was it?

91
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,920
It's easier to just order.

92
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,360
If one day I'm not here, how will you do it yourself?

93
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,920
Listen, if one day you're not here, I'll just order delivery!

94
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
but I've been having strange dreams.

95
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:27,200
I don't know if there just dreams or if there is about two thousand years ago.

96
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Then I will help you remember.

97
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,720
No, no, I don't want to hear it.

98
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,440
You don't have to tell me anything.

99
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,040
I have somewhere I want to take you there.

100
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,600
Where is it?

101
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,040
You'll find out soon enough.
