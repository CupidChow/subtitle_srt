1
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,320
Can’t you sleep?

2
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,520
Good night.

3
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,240
Don't worry about anything.

4
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,240
As long as I'm here,

5
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,720
you will have sweet dreams every night.

6
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,560
You...

7
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,400
You...

8
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,040
where have you been?

9
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,520
I have been gone for a moment,

10
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
and you're already calling for me?

11
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,200
Or have you finally admitted that you can't live without me?

12
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,160
Ghost like you is good at being self-centered.

13
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,520
I just had a nightmare

14
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,760
and felt like someone came into the house.

15
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,320
You don't have to be afraid.

16
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,520
I won't let anyone hurt you.

17
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
You go to sleep.

18
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,840
I'll be right here beside you.

19
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,960
You know. I had a dream last night too.

20
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,720
I dreamt that the two of us loved each other.

21
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,200
Do you have any errands to run today?

22
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,680
Yeah, I have to go to work tonight.

23
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,920
Why?

24
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,080
I want to go to the temple.

25
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Go to the temple?
