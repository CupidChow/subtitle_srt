1
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,360
Why are you following me?

2
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,040
I told you to separate at the temple.

3
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,000
I've come to escort you.

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,440
So, are we going together then

5
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,640
Let's go.

6
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
You told me to go together.

7
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,480
I was being sarcastic.

8
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,000
You don't have to believe every single word I say.

9
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,600
Why are human emotions so complicated?

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,880
Why don't you just say what you mean directly?

11
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,000
Don't change the topic.

12
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,840
I'm going to work.

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,040
You can't come.

14
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,200
It's because I'm worried about you.

15
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm afraid you'll be in danger if you're not by my side.

16
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,800
I can take care of myself.

17
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,200
I've been taking good care of myself all along,

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,520
even before you appear.

19
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,760
And don't you remember the rule I made?

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
We go our separate ways.

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,160
I had to break the rule

22
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,960
because what happened last night made me not trust leaving you alone.

23
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,000
Fine, we can go together.

24
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,240
Stay still.

25
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,720
I can sense something is not right.

26
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,280
Hey.

27
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,200
Hey..

28
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,080
Oh..

29
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,760
What are you laughing at?

30
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,120
This is called a vacuum cleaner.

31
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,400
Vacuum cleaner?

32
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,280
Umm.

33
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,280
	Yeah, it's for cleaning.

34
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,640
You won't have to use your own strength and get tired.

35
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,520
So, how did they clean your house before?

36
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,440
I had people do it for me.

37
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,840
	Oh really?

38
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,000
But now you have to do it yourself.

39
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,240
Me?

40
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,040
Yes, it’s you.

41
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,720
Since you've moved into my house,

42
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,000
you have to work for rent.

43
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
I have this one at my house too. I'll teach you how to use it.

44
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,400
I never knew such things existed in this world.

45
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,160
The world you're from is over two thousand years in the past,

46
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
Let it develop a bit!

47
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
Even so, things are going down every day.

48
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,560
Where does this sound come from?

49
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,200
I've looked around the room and haven't seen anyone singing.

50
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,400
It's coming from this.

51
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
Huh?

52
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
There are humans in there too?

53
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,640
Ugh, can you stop asking this and that?

54
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,560
It's annoying.

55
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
What?

56
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,200
Are you annoyed with me?

57
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Nothing. So sorry.

58
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,840
Oh boss, if you order it now, you want it right now.

59
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,120
Please have some respect for my dark eye circles.

60
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,560
Hey, did I press it already?

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,440
Or haven't pressed it yet?

62
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,120
I did press it... what is it?

63
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh boss, please let me take a rest.

64
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,120
I beg you.

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,760
Hey...

66
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
Hey... ghost! Ghost!

67
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,200
Even though the taste is bitter, it's surprisingly delicious.

68
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,320
I'm serious, this place has ghosts.

69
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,320
Oh Ton, you guys just haven't had enough sleep.

70
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,320
Yeah, maybe you're just out of it and blaming ghosts?

71
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,000
Umm.

72
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,080
That's right. Maybe the system's error.

73
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,080
I don't think so.

74
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,080
I really think it's ghosts.

75
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
I feel like something's weird.

76
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,480
Look, I'm even getting goosebumps just talking about it now.

77
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,280
What's that feeling?

78
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,720
I don't feel anything.

79
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,720
I think ghosts are nonsense.

80
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,800
Thup, you really shouldn't have said that.

81
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,080
But actually, our office hasn't had a merit-making ceremony in a year.

82
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,400
If there are ghosts, they might be coming to demand something.

83
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, let's have office merit-making. Please do it.

84
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,120
It would be good.

85
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,400
Yes, Let's do it.

86
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,880
Please.

87
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,440
I asked if you had a lot of fun.

88
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,320
I already answered that it was fun.

89
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,880
And what the hell does that two thousand year old story have to do with me?

90
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,880
Is it even real?

91
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
The past is the past, dammit!

92
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,440
Why are you digging it all up?
