I want to go away

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,420
You...

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,900
You...

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,580
You...

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,540
You're a rogue!

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:58,980
I...

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,500
You...

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,380
You...

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,660
You took advantage of me!

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,180
I...

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,540
I took advantage of you!

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,740
You acted like a ghost at night.

23
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,740
I took advantage of you!

24
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,740
I...

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,820
I'm catching a tiger!

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,860
What do you know?

27
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,020
What are you laughing at?

28
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,740
I'm here to talk to Jingqiu.

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,260
I'm telling you, little pregnant woman.

30
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,340
Why are you all

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,140
standing by Jingqiu?

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,860
What's so good about him?

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,380
Don't cry.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,740
I'm being seen here

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,740
and you think I'm bullying you?

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,620
You're here to punish me, aren't you?

37
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,620
That's true.

38
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,020
You can scold me if you want.

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,580
Anyway,

40
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,780
Jingxin has already

41
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,020
been born into my family.

42
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,300
I'm not going to be a bad person.

43
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,780
I'm not angry anymore.

44
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,780
I'm not as bad as you.

45
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,540
I'm a bad person.

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,540
I'm a bastard!

47
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,940
Are you satisfied?

48
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,020
You...

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,020
You're a bad mother, aren't you?

50
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
Stop crying.

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,220
Stop crying.

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,420
Look at you.

53
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,420
You've gone too far.

54
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
You're not being polite.

55
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,980
But if you can

56
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,980
correct your mistakes,

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,980
it'll be helpful.

58
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,180
Although you're a lot more lacking,

59
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,180
you're quite heavy.

60
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,780
But you're a lot more.

61
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,780
For example, you...

62
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,780
You're good at school.

63
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,780
You're famous in middle school.

64
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
You're good at playing basketball.

65
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,780
You're the champion.

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,780
And...

67
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,780
You're pretty.

68
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,780
I can see you

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,780
in a crowd.

70
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,780
And you're not bad at heart.

71
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,780
Otherwise,

72
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,780
you wouldn't be so sad.

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,780
I...

74
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,780
Alright. Stop crying.

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,780
So, what kind of person

76
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,780
is Jingqiu?

77
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
All these years,

78
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,780
Jingqiu has been working

79
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,780
and studying at the same time.

80
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,780
She's been bullied outside.

81
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
When she gets home,

82
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
she has to take care of Mr. Wang.

83
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,780
Don't think about how hard it is for her.

84
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
I...

85
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,780
I've never seen my parents since I was a kid.

86
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
I just...

87
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
I really hope

88
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,780
I can have a family

89
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,780
like Jingqiu's

90
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,780
and a good one.

91
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
After my dad left,

92
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,780
I felt that this world was too cruel

93
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,780
and unfair to me.

94
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,780
When my dad was away,

95
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,780
he took me to see Mr. Sun.

96
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,780
He was really nice to me.

97
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,780
But I thought

98
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
it was all right

99
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,780
for others to be nice to me.

100
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
God owes me.

101
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,780
Jingxin was nice to me too.

102
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,780
Jingqiu, I'm sorry.

103
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,780
They didn't force me.

104
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
I really think

105
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,780
I've gone too far

106
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,780
and childish.

107
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,780
So, I want to apologize to you.

108
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,780
I believe you.

109
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Come on.

110
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,780
It's worth celebrating today.

111
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
Jingxin,

112
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,780
Jingxin,

113
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
that day,

114
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,780
I...

115
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
Thank you, Jingxin.

116
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,780
This is really nice.

117
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,780
Listen,

118
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
there's a lot of fish in the river.

119
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,780
There are 15 fish in the river.

120
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Let's play.

121
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
Why are you laughing?

122
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,780
The End

123
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Slow down.

124
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
Come on. Let me do it.

125
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
Slow down.

126
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,780
Jingqiu, come on.

127
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
Let me do it.

128
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,780
Jingqiu,

129
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
why are you so hard-working?

130
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
You look like you're dying.

131
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,780
It's okay.

132
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,780
I just

133
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
had a meal

134
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,780
and forgot to eat.

135
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,780
You...

136
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,780
Wait.

137
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,780
Come on.

138
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,780
Take it.

139
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,780
Take it.

140
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,780
You're so hard-working.

141
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,780
You didn't fill your stomach.

142
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,780
If something happens,

143
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,780
I can't afford to do it.

144
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
Thank you, Brother Wan.

145
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,780
It's okay.

146
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
By the way, Jingqiu,

147
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
do you want

148
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,780
to get more salary?

149
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
Yes.

150
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
But I...

151
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,780
You must keep this news a secret.

152
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,780
There's a

153
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,780
official salary in the factory.

154
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
Really?

155
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,780
Can I apply for it?

156
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
You're

157
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,780
hard-working

158
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
and hard-working.

159
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,780
Unlike those who work hard,

160
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
you only know how to play the game

161
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
day and night.

162
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,780
These big brothers

163
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,780
are all watching you.

164
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Don't worry.

165
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,780
This salary

166
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,780
is yours.

167
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,780
Thank you, Brother Wan.

168
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,780
It's okay.

169
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,780
How can I apply for it?

170
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,780
I'm busy today.

171
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

172
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
Eat.

173
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,780
Go to work after you eat.

174
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,780
Okay?

175
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,780
Let me see.

176
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Is there a mole?

177
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
Dongmei,

178
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
there's a mole.

179
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,780
Let me see.

180
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,780
I saw it.

181
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,780
It's your name.

182
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,780
It's so obvious.

183
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
I didn't expect it.

184
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,780
They said the number of students

185
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,780
will increase this year.

186
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
Why is there no news

187
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
so far?

188
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
I heard that

189
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,780
the number of students who got the third place

190
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,780
in previous years

191
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,780
seems to have a higher chance of getting the third place.

192
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,780
This year,

193
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,780
it's okay.

194
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
We don't know.

195
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,780
But

196
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,780
some people

197
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,780
have been

198
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,780
behind the wheel

199
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,780
in Teacher Luo's place.

200
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,780
Why didn't even

201
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,780
get the third place?

202
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
Yes.

203
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
I guess

204
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,780
the school will be suspended.

205
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,780
Don't worry.

206
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
I've let it go.

207
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,780
Besides,

208
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,780
even if everything

209
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,780
is up to Teacher Luo,

210
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,780
it may not be school-shared.

211
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,780
What's your plan

212
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
in the future?

213
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,780
I'll work hard

214
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,780
and write articles

215
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,780
and submit to the newspaper.

216
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,780
Big newspapers,

217
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,780
small newspapers,

218
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
big magazines,

219
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,780
small magazines.

220
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,780
I'll submit them all.

221
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,780
As long as there's a little hope,

222
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,780
I'll write them down forever.

223
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,780
I've read

224
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,780
the newspaper,

225
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,780
ink and water.

226
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,780
When you become a big writer,

227
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
don't forget it.

228
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
I'll write it down.

229
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,780
I'll write it down.

230
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
Leaders,

231
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
colleagues,

232
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,780
I'm so lucky

233
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,780
to be here today

234
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,780
and receive this honor.

235
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
I want to thank someone

236
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
with all my heart.

237
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,780
You didn't eat again?

238
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,780
Today,

239
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,780
the schedule was not good.

240
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,780
I didn't have time to eat.

241
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
I'm sorry.

242
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
No matter what happens in the future,

243
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,780
you have to be on your guard

244
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
to do other things.

245
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Jiang Xiao.

247
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
You've entered the factory.

248
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Just do this job.

249
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
This bank account

250
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
needs to be detailed.

251
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
It's suitable for girls.

252
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,780
This is much better than playing the bow.

253
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
Not only is the salary high,

254
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,780
but also has benefits.

255
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Thank you, Brother Wan.

256
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,780
Come on.

257
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,780
Take this.

258
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
You can talk to him.

259
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
This way.

260
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
Come on.

261
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
Go on.

262
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Jiang Xiao.

263
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,780
This bank account

264
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,780
needs to be detailed.

265
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
It's not enough to have more or less.

266
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
You need to know it.

267
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
The key

268
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,780
I'll teach you later.

269
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
Don't move.

270
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
I just want to

271
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
see if your nails are cut.

272
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
Brother Wan.

273
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
I never leave my nails.

274
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
Can't you see?

275
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,780
You've done so much work.

276
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
Your hands are still so smooth.

277
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
Jingqiu.

278
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,780
Brother Wan is so considerate of you.

279
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,780
He can't even touch his hands.

280
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
I'm not going in.

281
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
I'm going in.

282
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,780

I'm going in.

285
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
I'm going in.

286
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,780
I'm going in.

287
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,780
I'm going in.

288
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
I'm going in.

289
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,780

294
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,780
I'm going in.

295
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,780
I'm going in.

296
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,780

00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,780
I'm going in.

298
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
I'm going in.

299
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,780

300
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
