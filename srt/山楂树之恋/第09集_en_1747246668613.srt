1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You are the only one I can trust.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will always be by your side.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I will always be by your side.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will always be by your side.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I will always be by your side.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Teacher He.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You must help me with the warehouse today.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Otherwise, you will not be here next time.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Come, come. Two people.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What's your name?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He Jingqiu.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Jingqiu?

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You go clean the Southern Palace dormitory.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Brother Wan, this is not very convenient.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You don't know that cleaning the dormitory is a lot of money.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's better than carrying a big bag here.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can even sweat if you are tired to death.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The key is that you don't have much money.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's because the person in charge of the cleaning didn't come today.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If he came, you can't get this job.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I am not looking at your little girl.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's not easy.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you, Brother Wan.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Go to the plate.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Next.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We teachers have to be responsible for our students.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is a matter of professional control.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You can give up.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I won't tell you where Jingqiu lives.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Teacher Luo, what's with the flashlights?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is anyone there?

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Isn't this the Southern Palace dormitory?

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why are you here?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am the cleaner sent by the Lin family.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Our dormitory also needs to be cleaned.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We have to be careful with everything.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Our room also needs to be cleaned.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I am only responsible for the public area.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is the public area. You can clean it.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Sit down.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who are you?

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What are you doing?

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You little girl.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And you.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You bastard.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Thank you.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Jingqiu?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's really you.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's me, Zhang Yi.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Zhang Yi?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's me.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's go.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't fight.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why are you fighting with them?

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm a wild child.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go home with Teacher Wang.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Eat. I'm full.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Here are the dishes.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Eat more to have strength.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Zhang Yi, if next time

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
someone calls you a wild child,

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
tell them that Teacher Wang is your relative.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Eat.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If it wasn't for you and Teacher Wang,

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I really don't know what I would be.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You didn't go to school after graduation?

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not a good student.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Later, I became a worker with the older brothers.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I was busy with fighting on the streets.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I gradually gained fame in this area.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's why those people in the dorms are afraid of me.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But Jingqiu, don't worry.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
As long as I'm here,

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
no one will bully you and Teacher Wang.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Jingqiu!

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you here?

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If I'm not here, how would I know you're so hypocritical?

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You look like you're being treated like a child.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And you're being treated like a child.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What are you saying?

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Zhang Yi.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Are you worthy of Brother Jianxin?

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Dan Niang, it's not what you think.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't blame me for telling you the truth.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You look so angry.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You dumped your brother, right?

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And you're here to vent your anger?

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Who are you talking about? You rogue!

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ji La, look in the mirror.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You'll know who's the one who's angry.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Say that again!

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You don't understand Chinese, do you?

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Zhang Yi, let's go.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You don't have to pretend to be a good person.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This isn't over.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Stop.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is this letter for you?

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We've made a great success in the village.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The principal is very satisfied.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Look.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The leader is happy and gave me a tea.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I think we should continue this operation.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Create a style.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
A style of literature.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're using everyone's work to make a contribution.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Jingqiu.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You're so well-informed.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I organized a literature lecture.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If you have any hobbies, you can discuss your writing experience.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're one of them.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let me give a lecture?

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But I don't know how to write.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't be a hypocrite.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Your article is very good.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The teacher values you.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The school leaders will attend the lecture.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They'll take advantage of this opportunity.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It'll be very helpful for you.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Third.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's been months since we went to Xi Sunping's funeral.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did the flower bloom?

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't be angry. Sun Jianxin is so blind.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't talk about Jianxin.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's go play.

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Good shot.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You guys.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't be so serious.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If you want to play good shot, you have to have a market.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If you want to compete with several schools of masters,

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
you have to defeat them immediately.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The champion?

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The runner-up.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The runner-up.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In terms of strength,

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
this match is definitely a tie.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do you know who your teacher lost to?

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Aren't you that Xiao Yuanfu?

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You...

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're a three-legged cat.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
How can you be so confident?

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was very polite to you last time.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't find it unfair.

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's have a competition.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Three-legged cat.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Good shot.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Good shot.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Good.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Take it.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Take it.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What's wrong?

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Brother.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What's wrong?

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you okay?

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Come on.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Slowly.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Isn't it just a ball?

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What's so great about it?

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It doesn't look like a woman at all.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're not good at playing the ball.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You have a tough mouth like your teacher.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You're not as good as my teacher.

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He's not only good at playing,

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
but also a high-class student.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He also participates in the school speech.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What are you going to compete with him?

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Exactly.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
School speech?

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No words left, right?

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
