00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,100
Three 真的就是三

2
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,960
in the spring of 1974,

3
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
I was selected by college,

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,700
to go to X 1080p to write a food magazine.

5
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,120
All the food were in the village.

6
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,520
Because of the three buns,

7
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,200
I became the third.

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,120
I didn't know

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,120
that this accident would change my life completely.

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,400
I'm starving.

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,840
The delivery man hasn't come yet.

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,400
How can I work?

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
Everyone, work harder.

14
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,400
Let's get the job done.

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,280
Okay.

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Twenty.

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
Twenty-three.

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Twenty-four.

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Twenty-five.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Twenty-six.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
Oh no.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to be late this time.

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Here you are.

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Thank you.

25
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Let me help you.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
No need.

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Jingqiu,

28
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,120
in order to improve everyone's life,

29
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,120
we finally made a bun.

30
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,640
We only had three buns.

31
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Look.

32
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,120
You wrote a good article,

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,640
so we asked you to write a new one.

34
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,120
According to your family,

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
you're not the only one.

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
But you

37
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
put your personal writing

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
on the bun more important than the group.

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
I don't have my own writing.

40
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
This is wrong.

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
This is wrong.

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
What do I write?

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
You must give a strict self-criticism.

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Luo.

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
I hope you and your classmates

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
can forgive me.

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Forget it.

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Give our buns to everyone.

49
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Let them all eat it.

50
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
We can't do anything about it.

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
I only met one stranger on the way.

53
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
He must have brought the buns.

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
But

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
I don't even know who he is.

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Grandma,

57
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
third brother is back from a business trip.

58
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,120
I want to go to the team

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
and find him to eat.

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Team?

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
The team that is nearby.

62
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Team?

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
What team?

64
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Right.

65
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Team?

66
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Madam,

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
I'll go.

68
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Look.

69
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Hello.

70
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Are you from the team?

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Yes.

72
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Who are you looking for?

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm looking for the third brother

74
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
who is with the aunt.

75
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
You're looking for the third brother?

76
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Third brother?

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Over there.

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Thank you.

79
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
You're welcome.

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,120
I'll find the third brother later.

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,120
Maybe I can ask him to help me.

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Zhiyun must be in the team.

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
What?

84
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
He's the third brother?

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Did he steal the buns?

86
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Are you the new writer?

87
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
I'm not a writer.

88
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm just a student.

89
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
What do you want from me?

90
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Well,

91
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Madam asked you to go home and eat.

92
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
That's all?

93
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
I see.

94
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Thank you.

95
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Pretending not to know each other?

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
You're so guilty.

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
What are you doing?

98
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Aren't we going to have lunch?

99
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Did you meet me

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
in the small alley in the village

101
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
this afternoon?

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
You asked me?

103
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
You don't have such a bad memory, do you?

104
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,120
My pen fell down the slope.

105
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
You picked it up for me.

106
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Do you remember?

107
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Of course I remember.

108
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
I'll write the pen

109
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
and thank you for what you just did.

110
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
But

111
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
did you take my three buns?

112
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I thought you were here to repay me.

113
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
But you're here to catch the thief.

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
No.

115
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
I can't let them get away with it.

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
I said it's not me.

117
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Do you believe it?

118
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,120
But I only met you today.

119
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Look.

120
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
You're sure I took it, right?

121
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Is it useful?

122
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
You're so unreasonable.

123
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
We have to eat first if we want to get through.

124
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Let's go.

125
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
The meal is ready.

126
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Did you miss me, Huan?

127
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Yes.

128
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Did you have a meal?

129
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Come down.

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Madam.

131
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Qiu,

132
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
look.

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
You're so clumsy.

134
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
I found out after you left.

135
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Huan hid three buns.

136
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,120
How about I explain it to Mr. Luo?

137
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Or you'll be scolded.

138
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
What should we do?

139
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,120
I left this for my parents and Aunt Jing.

140
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
It's okay, Madam.

141
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Mr. Luo also said

142
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
we often disturb you in the village.

143
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
It's a thank you.

144
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
You're welcome.

145
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Come on, Huan.

146
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Look at this kid.

147
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
He's causing you trouble.

148
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
No, Madam.

149
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Come on, let's eat.

150
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
Is it for me?

151
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Madam asked me to bring you some water.

152
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Thank you.

153
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Did Madam give you water?

154
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
I should have thought of another excuse.

155
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Let me introduce myself.

156
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
I'm Sun Jianxin.

157
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
You can call me Third.

158
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm He Jingqiu.

159
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,120
I misunderstood you about the past.

161
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
It's okay.

162
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Thanks to you, Madam and Huan

163
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
ate the buns.

164
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
I saw your classmates

165
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
listening to the stories of the old people in the village.

166
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
Why didn't you go?

167
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,120
I didn't say I'd go tomorrow.

168
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
They left when you went there.

169
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
What do you want to hear?

170
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
I'll tell you.

171
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Does this fan-tree really bloom red flowers?

172
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Because it's the blood of a hero.

173
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
So it's also called the hero tree.

174
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
I've been in the village for so long.

175
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
I know all the legends.

176
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Have you seen it bloom?

177
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
It blooms in two months.

178
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Two months?

179
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
But we can't stay that long.

180
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
You already know it's red.

181
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
But I haven't seen it.

182
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
What does that have to do with it?

183
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
You can write differently.

184
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Its flowers are red.

185
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
That's different.

186
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
It's a matter of sight.

187
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,120
I can't write like this without seeing it.

188
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
It's so strange.

189
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Although he's a scout,

190
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
he looks like a low-class asset.

191
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Help me take it.

192
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
So beautiful.
