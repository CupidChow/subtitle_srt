00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Are you going to buy it or not?

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Third, why are you eating walnuts all of a sudden?

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wait until I win. I want all of these.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You want it all?

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Jingqiao

7
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,160
My mom said that the ice is not good for your health

8
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,280
The walnuts here are good for your health

9
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,720
And also

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,660
The sugar is good for your stomach

11
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,980
But we can't buy the sugar here

12
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,180
You can take this

13
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
It's so heavy

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,160
Changlin and I just met a little seller who sells walnuts

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,960
So we didn't discuss it with you

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Take it

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,240
Thank you

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Here, eat the egg

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you, aunt

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Eat the egg

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you, aunt

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Little girl, you have so many things

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let Changlin send you

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Changlin

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Jingqiao, let me send you

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let me send you

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Changlin is going to work, don't delay the work

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't need it

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your team is so busy

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You are always busy

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You should have a good rest and recuperate

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He is free

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let him have a good rest

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's okay, aunt

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I will take care of it tomorrow

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't need to bother you

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You are a girl

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You are always walking on the mountain

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You are not afraid, but I am

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Aunt Jingqiao

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My dad and uncle like you

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Who do you like?

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No one needs to send me

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can carry it

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can carry it

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The walnuts are sent by aunt

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes, aunt is so kind

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Besides, I helped them a lot

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The walnuts are sent by aunt

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In our family

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We are always busy

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We are always busy

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You are so kind

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you are not busy

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I know, aunt

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Especially

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You are going to stay in school

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You should be more careful

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't let others catch you

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't worry, aunt

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am a black woman

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I am not a woman

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I am always a woman

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Aunt Jingqiao

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What a coincidence

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I told you not to send us

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I just arrived in the city

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I am not kidding you

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
My mom is not well

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What if she finds out?

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She can't be angry

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I know

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Jingqiao

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Something happened in the rehearsal hall

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Come with me

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No rehearsal

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How long have we been waiting?

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No rehearsal

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't go

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't worry

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I am looking for a classmate who can play the accompaniment

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Even if he can't come in the afternoon

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We can practice without accompaniment

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Without accompaniment

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How can we rehearse?

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who will play the zither?

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The principal

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I will

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Jingqiao

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Who is he?

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I am Jingqiao's cousin

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I came to see you rehearse

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I didn't expect to join the rehearsal

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He is too bold

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't stand there

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's start

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Forget it

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Just let him rehearse

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Youth flies in our heart

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Flowers in the dream are in the distance

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Smiling

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The sorrow of love

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The starlight flows in the distance

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The young friend sings

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The shanzha tree is in bloom

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The shanzha tree in my dream

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The past is in the wind

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The shanzha tree in my dream

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The past is in the wind

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't expect you to sing so well

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You are the one who makes people admire you

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You are so good at playing the zither

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You are so good at playing the zither

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Cousin

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Thank you for your kindness

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
People can be admired

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
For you, it is just an idiom

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But in my life

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I have to be careful

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Jingqiu

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you ok?

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am ok

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just a little bit of blood sugar

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Just a little bit of blood sugar

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It is not easy to find the sugar

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Only in the city

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So I followed you

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sorry

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I was rude

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You are kind

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You shouldn't say that

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Wait for me here

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I will give you the money

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can't take the money

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't accept the money

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't want the money

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't want the money

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I won't take the money

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I will buy the sugar for aunt

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't think too much

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We are close friends

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Besides

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You took the walnuts from Changlin

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It is dark when you go back at night

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I will wait for you in the city

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't wait for me

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Jingqiu

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I am leaving

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I am leaving

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Is it beautiful?

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Jingqiu

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why are you so quiet?

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I have been holding it

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Who was that?

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Who?

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Stop pretending

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I saw it

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't understand what you are talking about

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Men

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
are not credible

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They talk about it

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Actually

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They think they can take advantage of you

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
When they don't get you

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They are ugly for you

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
When you are sincere

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They give themselves out

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
When you are sincere

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Maybe they will not play with you

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
when they get over it

178
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He didn't

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I am leaving

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you have tickets?

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Hello

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you have tickets to Xicunping?

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
No, no, it is too late

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you have tickets?

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So expensive

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Miss, do you want to go out?

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It is cheaper

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I should go back

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This third

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I told you not to wait

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Come out

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I saw you

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I am leaving

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I am leaving
