00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,320
Thanks to Arie

2
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,600
Okay investment

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,420
Uh

4
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,680
Pour

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,120
Pour

6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,040
Pour

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,420
Pour

8
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,040
Pour

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,800
Har否

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
and spirit.

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
In the game,

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
whether it's technical moves,

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
or the outfit,

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
no matter how small the details are,

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,800
you must be strict.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,800
From now on,

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
you must be prepared,

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
and be ready for battle.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Let's start, coach.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Okay.

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Jingxiu,

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
I've emphasized

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
the game of the uniform.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm sorry, coach Luo.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I didn't show enough affection.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I understand that you have difficulties.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
But this is not a game

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
of the school's internal class.

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
The uniform is for the atmosphere.

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
The spirit is to show

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
to everyone.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Because you alone

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
destroyed the group.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Is that right?

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Facing difficulties,

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
you have to think of ways to solve them.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
How about this, teacher Luo?

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
You lend me money,

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
I'll buy a suit.

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
When I finish the game,

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
I'll return the money

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
I earned from work to you.

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
I'll give you time to solve it.

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
But you must wear the uniform

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
when the game starts.

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Jingxiu,

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
come out.

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Come out.

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
You're going to the game soon.

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Do you have the uniform?

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Take it and buy a suit.

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Mom,

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
no need.

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Let's return the debt first.

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Otherwise,

56
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
people will feel uneasy

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
if they owe others.

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Mom,

59
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
what are you doing?

60
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
I went to the game

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
to win the championship.

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
You should be happy for me.

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Besides,

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
the game is about

65
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
who plays better.

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
It's not about whose uniform is better.

67
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
It's about the way of thinking.

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
You really dare to say anything.

69
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Mom, I'm leaving.

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
But we have no feelings for each other.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:25,620
I just think she's a

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
good person.

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I'm leaving.

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
It's still early.

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Let's practice more.

77
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Let's win tomorrow.

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Are you ready?

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll practice with you.

80
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Go.

81
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Come on.

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Lower your center of gravity.

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Come on.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Move.

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Good.

86
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Come on.

87
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Keep your center of gravity steady.

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Be quick and steady.

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm leaving.

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Who is it?

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
The door is locked.

92
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
What's going on?

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
You look good in this ball suit.

94
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I'll return it to you when I save enough money.

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Is the game important?

96
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Let's talk about the rest later.

97
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
What I wrote in my letter is true.

98
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Stop talking.

99
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I just want to prepare for the game now.

100
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I'll practice with you more these days.

101
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Don't be late.

102
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't be nervous.

103
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Much better.

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Good.

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Much better.

106
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Good.

107
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Oh, my God.

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
How silly.

109
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,620
good

110
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,600
good

111
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,960
teacher Excuse me

112
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,960
What? You don't want me to come in and have a seat?

113
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Yes, yes, yes. Please come in.

114
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Please sit.

115
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Have some water.

116
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Teacher Lu, please sit.

117
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Teacher Lu, don't be nervous.

118
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,960
I just wanted to talk to you.

119
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,960
First of all, congratulations.

120
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,960
It seems that you will win this competition.

121
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
No, no. The leader is right.

122
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
The second is the most famous.

123
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960
The champion is the second.

124
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Winning is not a matter of time.

125
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Everything has to be planned.

126
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Now, the second is at a critical stage of a peace.

127
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,960
At this time, any honor

128
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,960
will have a very heavy weight on the balance of the sky.

129
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,960
So look at me.

130
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm here to see you.

131
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
It seems that

132
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,960
I'm going to trouble you.

133
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,960
No trouble.

134
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Now, the first is the champion.

135
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,960
The second is the champion of the league.

136
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,960
The third is the champion of the league.

137
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Jingqiu,

138
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,960
you can't go back on what you promised.

139
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
You and I can't afford to offend

140
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,960
the background of others.

141
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Is my effort so meaningless?

142
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,960
I don't even have the right to fight for myself?

143
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Nice shot!

144
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Nice!

145
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Nice!

146
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Nice!

147
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Nice!

148
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Focus!

149
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Jingqiu, if you have a big view,

150
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,960
can you really guarantee that you will win the championship?

151
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Schools are difficult.

152
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
You did this for the sake of unity.

153
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,960
You may also be able to stay in school.

154
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I want to win the game.

155
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Why should I lose on purpose?

156
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
I'm sorry.

183
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
