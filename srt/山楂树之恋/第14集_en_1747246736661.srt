1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
As Weree

2
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
As Weree

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
As Weree

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,960
when I heard the rain at night,

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,200
I felt the longing of the people in the distance.

6
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,000
Thirdly,

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,040
I feel like I've seen you.

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,920
It's been three months.

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,600
After the test,

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,680
I was assigned to the Ministry of Education

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,480
to be a financial advisor.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,160
I was told by the students

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,560
to take the examinations of the school leaders.

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
I've been very busy these days.

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,160
I have a lot of things to learn.

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,520
Although it's fun to interact with the students,

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,200
it's not easy.

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,280
Teaching is one of them.

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
You have to care about them

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,880
and know how to care.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,360
I often ask my mother for advice.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,360
Now, I rarely work in the forest.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,920
After work, I spend all my time on the project.

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,520
I hope

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,280
I can meet you

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,760
as a better person.

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,920
In addition,

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,920
I have something to tell you

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,240
during this period.

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,760
Jingqiu,

31
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,680
congratulations.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
You made it.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
I was right about you.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
I voted for you

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,000
when the teachers voted.

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,880
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,840
Sit down.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,400
Okay.

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,120
Jingqiu,

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,080
I read some of your articles recently.

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,280
I tried them out.

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,760
They were very good.

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,280
Coincidentally,

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,520
a friend of the provincial newspaper said

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,560
that it needed to reflect the youth of the times.

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,520
The article you wrote,

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
Xi Cunping, is good.

48
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,320
It can be renamed

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,040
as My Friends.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,080
You can take a look at it

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,200
and submit a draft.

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,080
It might be published.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I want to ask you

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,080
what you think.

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,760
Okay.

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
I will change it.

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,640
Here you are.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,240
I still agreed.

59
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,520
I wrote my classmates,

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,480
my friends,

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,320
and Xi Cunping's people.

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,120
And of course,

63
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,760
you.

64
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,680
I hope these stories

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,880
can be printed into signatures

66
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
and be seen.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,520
Even if the tofu is so big,

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm satisfied.

69
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,880
But...

70
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,880
Uncle.

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,160
Jingqiu, are you looking for the newspaper again?

72
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,720
The newspapers from these days are all in there.

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,600
You can look for them yourself.

74
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,880
Thank you.

75
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,720
You're welcome.

76
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
Mr. Luo said that

77
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,960
my article might be published this month.

78
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,600
But every time I asked him,

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,800
he said he didn't get any notice from his friends

80
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,240
and asked me to pay attention to it.

81
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,880
I had to wait for a few days

82
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,360
and went to the collection room

83
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,080
to search for the newspaper.

84
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,120
I wanted to see my name on it.

85
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,800
But I couldn't find it.

86
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,000
Uncle,

87
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,960
there are no newspapers from No. 7 and 8.

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
Did you see them?

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
The newspapers from the toilet are out of use.

90
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
I'll go get some more.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,760
Perhaps this article doesn't exist at all.

92
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,760
It's just my wishful thinking.

93
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
I'm so busy that I can't think of anything.

94
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,040
But I'm willing to let it

95
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
exist in this way for a long time.

96
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,560
It's like a dream.

97
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,880
I hope everything goes well for you.

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,880
I hope the letter will tell me about your situation.

99
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,360
No matter how small the matter is,

100
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,160
or how small the details are,

101
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,280
I hope

102
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,040
everything goes well for you.

103
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,760
Jingqiu.

104
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,960
Jingqiu.

105
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,080
The file has been turned over recently.

106
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,160
It's a mess.

107
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,920
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,040
You can look for them yourself.

109
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,160
Thank you.

110
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,960
You can look for them yourself.

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,880
Thank you.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

114
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
You can look for them yourself.

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,120
Thank you.

116
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

117
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
You can look for them yourself.

118
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,360
Thank you.

119
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

120
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
You can look for them yourself.

121
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,520
Thank you.

122
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

123
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
You can look for them yourself.

124
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,680
Thank you.

125
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

126
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
You can look for them yourself.

127
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,960
Thank you.

128
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

129
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
You can look for them yourself.

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Thank you.

131
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

132
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
You can look for them yourself.

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Thank you.

134
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
The newspaper and magazine are all here.

135
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
You can look for them yourself.

136
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
Thank you.

137
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Thank you.

138
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,480
Thank you.

139
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,040
Thank you.

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,600
Don't worry.

141
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,400
If you have difficulties,

142
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,520
please pay for your schools' fee accordingly.

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,360
I will apply to study at your school.

144
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,960
Don't feel burdened, too.

145
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,360
Thank you, Miss residue.

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,680
Jingqiu,

147
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,560
we are done.

148
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,760
Mr. Luo, you're so nice to your students.

149
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,200
I'm just a little bit of a help.

150
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,640
I can help with some things.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
Don't be so modest.

152
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,160
We have to learn from you.

153
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,800
I almost forgot.

154
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,360
I have to bring Mr. Luo a class.

155
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,120
Didn't he come this morning?

156
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,320
I think I saw him.

157
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,200
Who knows?

158
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,040
Mr. Luo has been taking a leave recently.

159
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,320
Look, it's still raining outside.

160
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,160
I heard he's preparing for a college entrance exam

161
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
at the school event.

162
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
He's a cultured person.

163
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,360
He doesn't need to eat rice noodles and rice noodles.

164
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm going to class.

165
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,800
Why are you here?

166
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,200
I'm here to help you.

167
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
Wipe it off.

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't catch a cold.

169
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,560
I'll do it myself.

170
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,160
Don't let the rain get on you.

171
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,960
I wonder who

172
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,440
promised to keep his promise

173
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
for a year.

174
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,400
He broke the rules himself.

175
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
What's wrong?

176
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,680
I found a newspaper for you.

177
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,440
Really?

178
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,440
Here.

179
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,480
Jingqiu.

180
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,400
Jingqiu.

181
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Here's the thing.

182
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,000
I've already

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,560
put this article on the ground for you.

184
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,960
The newspaper said

185
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,640
it's unnecessary to say the names of two people.

186
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
He decided to write my name on it.

187
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,800
When I find out,

188
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
it's too late to change it.

189
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,560
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,040
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
I'm sorry.

198
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
I'm sorry.

201
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
My bad.

202
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,800
I'm sorry.

203
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,440
I'll repay you one day.

204
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,320
As soon as I get Wenlian,

205
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,480
I'll make sure to recommend you

206
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,960
to send articles to Wenlian.

207
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,560
I just want what I have.

208
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,480
Daddy,

209
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,080
Granny coughed and didn't speak.

210
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,580
Okay?

211
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,580
Dad, I'm hungry.

212
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Go play for a while.

213
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
We'll have dinner soon.

214
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,580
Okay.

215
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,080
Go.

216
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Jiajia has a difficult memory.

217
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,080
My mother was a chronic patient.

218
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,080
She was in a hospital and was in a debt.

219
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
My wife couldn't stand the pain.

220
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
She ran away.

221
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
We were two children.

222
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
It was time to die.

223
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
When we transferred to Wenlian,

224
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,080
we could at least get five dollars more every month.

225
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,080
We could eat a lot.

226
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,080
I had no choice.

227
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Actually, I think you and I should be the same kind of people.

228
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
No background, no relationship.

229
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,080
We all have our own lives.

230
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
I...

231
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
I don't want to.

232
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,080
I just want to make myself more proud.

233
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Jingqiu.

234
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
For the sake of our business,

235
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
let's forget it.

236
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
Okay?

237
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
We're not the same kind of people.

238
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
It's seven dollars.

239
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
I didn't touch it.

240
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
I'm sorry.

241
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
I'm sorry.

251
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
I'm sorry.

258
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
I'm sorry.

260
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm sorry.

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080

I'm sorry.

268
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm sorry.
