00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,660
you

3
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,200
really don't remember me?

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,380
what makes us so emotional

5
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,580
to give something you

00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,140
why are you soæ”¶ citizen

7
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,720
I said that she's my friend

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
Look at the big grandson on the skin.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,680
His name is Sun Jianxin.

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,120
That doesn't prove anything.

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Come on, guys.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,760
Enough rest.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,480
Let's get some strength.

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,120
You're almost out of the team.

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,200
Give it to me.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,880
If you can answer the names of these three stones,

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,120
I'll give it to you.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,200
These are

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,520
Huagang salt, Xuanwu salt, Shihui salt.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,480
Which types of salt are they?

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,920
Chenji salt, Huocheng salt, Bianzhi salt.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
They're all salt.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,880
The eight main salt minerals of these three salt stones are...

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,960
Shiying, Changshi, Yunmu, Huishi,

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,040
Jiaoshanshi, Fangjieshi, Gaolingtu and Lunishi.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,280
This is my inspection notebook.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,440
I've observed and recorded

28
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
everything in it.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,760
Be careful next time.

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,920
Don't lose such important things again.

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
Are you TP?

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,680
Are you TP?

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,240
That's you?

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,080
Why did they abandon you?

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,480
They did that for their family components.

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,960
They're just suggestively.

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,160
It really fell apart for them.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is the gift for you.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,000
Here.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I just remembered that I have something to do.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll tell you the story next time.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm so annoyed.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why didn't you come that day?

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Teacher Luo was asking you.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Someone didn't tell me.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're still blaming others for your excitement.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Stop talking nonsense. Where's the book?

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's weird.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I remember it was in the book bag.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why is it here?

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The book doesn't have legs.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't give this out.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't give this out.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't give this out.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't give this out.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The handwritten book is what everyone is reading.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why do you have to take it out by yourself?

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Teacher Luo is praising you.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You want to be a writer?

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll wait for you for a few days.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll ask everyone's opinion.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Three days.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're so small.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The handwritten book is what everyone is reading.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It won't be a problem if you read it for a few days.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's none of your business.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you keep on arguing,

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
if Teacher Luo finds out that you're reading handwritten books,

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
it won't be good for everyone.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Three days.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Three days.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I've finished half of the book.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't finish it.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I haven't read the second half.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Should I make it up?

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How did you find it?

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I brought a few books to the inspection team.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Everyone can read them.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I happen to have this book.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I brought a few books to the inspection team.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Everyone can read them.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I happen to have this book.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The light bulb is too dark.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's hard to read.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll change it for you.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're going to copy it with me?

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Two people copy it together.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I should be able to finish it in three days.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But only three days?

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What happened to your hand?

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's okay.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Tomorrow is the third day.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't finish it no matter how hard I try.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Time is running out.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We're counting on everyone.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No problem.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We'll do our best.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't worry.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We'll take care of it.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's nothing.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't worry.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We'll take care of it.

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why does my heart beat faster every time I see him?

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If it weren't for your help,

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I would be in trouble.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I just can't stand being bullied.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not that easy to bully.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They don't want to take advantage of me.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mao Er, just sign it.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll leave in a while.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll sign it too.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I promise I'll finish it tomorrow.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Impossible.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This isn't the book.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The book was burned.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
There's a note of the Golden Ball on it.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You must have copied it again.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How did you know the book was burned?

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I never told anyone.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Jingqiu.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Jingqiu.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Jingqiu.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Jingqiu.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Nonsense.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please explain.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How did you know the book was burned?

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't think that

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Mr. Luo praises you a lot.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You forgot your name.

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You need to know your identity.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Of course I know.

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
If Mr. Luo praises someone else,

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm afraid you wouldn't dare to do this.

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You wouldn't let me go.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You can only bully someone with my identity.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't you think you look like you're falling off the cliff?

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Mr. Luo.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Look.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is Jingqiu's note.

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He copied the book.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He even tried to spread it among his classmates.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Jingqiu.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Jingqiu.

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Jingqiu.

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Jingqiu.

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Jingqiu.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Jingqiu.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Jingqiu.

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Jingqiu.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Jingqiu.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Jingqiu.

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Jingqiu.

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Jingqiu.

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Jingqiu.

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Jingqiu.

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Jingqiu.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Jingqiu.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Jingqiu.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Jingqiu.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Jingqiu.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Jingqiu.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Jingqiu.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Jingqiu.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Jingqiu.

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Jingqiu.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Jingqiu.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Jingqiu.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Jingqiu.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Jingqiu.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Jingqiu.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Jingqiu.

177
