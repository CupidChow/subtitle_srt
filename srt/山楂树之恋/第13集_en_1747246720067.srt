1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,520
And forget about the old past.

2
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,160
Don't spend for three configuration cards or praise items.

3
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,400
Jinqiu.

4
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,940
Come down, Jinqiu.

5
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,980
The temperature is really comfortable here.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

8
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Can we

9
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,300
Several

10
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,800
ominous

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's been a long time since I had such a dream.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I fell asleep like a fool.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's okay.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's good.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It would be great if it could go on like this forever.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's okay.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Wait a minute.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is this your house?

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is Jian Xin's house.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But according to our relationship,

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
it's also my house.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's the relationship between you two?

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I think

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
it's a bit urgent to get married so soon.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why don't you wait a little longer?

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll let you eat a meal.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I didn't ask you to propose.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's wrong? Are you afraid?

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't know.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Go away.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Zhang Yi, this is Uncle Sun.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello, Uncle Sun.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is what I often mention to you.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Zhang Yi.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I know your factory.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've sent a lot of soldiers here.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I remember when you were young,

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you went to their factory.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That time, the local and military

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
played a basketball league.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They had a fight.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't you have a sports meeting now?

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You won a championship last year.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What kind of game is it?

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I won the second place in the basketball league.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was a soldier.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm good at this.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm good at everything.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll show you.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I just saw a few little brothers playing.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's not a regular competition.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You hit the wall.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Uncle Sun was the most popular player in his youth.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't be so arrogant.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm not good at this.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Try it.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Try it.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Come on.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can't beat me.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Uncle Sun, are you okay?

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why didn't you hit it?

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Did I hit it?

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're strong. You must have a lot of work.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're good at this.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Did you make progress last year?

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've been doing well for years.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm not as good as I used to be.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
To be honest,

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was a little lazy before.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But I'll work hard in the future.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Tell me.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How are you going to take care of your mother?

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Uncle Sun,

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
my master said I was smart

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and talented.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I've been learning for a year.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I believe that as long as I work hard,

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll have a good life.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But now the situation is normal.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What's the plan for the future?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Young man,

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll give you a way.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
How about being a soldier?

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll be a soldier.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll be a soldier.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
How about being a soldier?

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Be a soldier?

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You don't have to answer now.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Take your time.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Uncle Sun,

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
it's time to eat. Let's eat and talk.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You eat.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Delicious.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Delicious.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Uncle Sun,

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll give you a toast.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Please.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This wine is spicy.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I won't be blind.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're a soldier.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Uncle Sun,

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you only care about this?

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I didn't forget your life.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This boy has a strong will.

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He has a dream.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He has a dream.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's very smart.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can't control my heart.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I entrust you to Zhang Yi.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He's also worthy of your father.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've finished my work.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
To be honest,

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm a little reluctant.

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Uncle Sun, thank you for taking care of me for so many years.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I want to thank you on behalf of my parents and myself.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I've always treated you as my biological father.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So I'll continue to take care of you.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you ready?

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Three, two, one.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is too expensive.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I can't take it.

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
When I went to see the team,

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
he was always standing at home.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is called waste of resources.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you ride a car,

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
you can go faster when you go to the forest.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You can save time to eat.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can save time to eat.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is your prize.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You be careful!

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't worry.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,500
Ah!

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I'm going back to the base!

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm going back to the base!

137
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm going back to the base!

138
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,600
Jingxiu!

139
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,800
Be careful.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,500
Mom.

141
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,600
Let me explain.

142
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Jingxiu,

143
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,600
stay downstairs for a while.

144
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
I want to talk to comrade Sun in private.

145
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,900
Sit.

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,500
Sit.

147
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,100
Mom.

148
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,700
Aunt.

149
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Call me teacher Wang.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Thank you.

151
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,400
You've helped me a lot.

152
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,400
Teacher Wang.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
With our family,

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,800
we can't talk about the future.

155
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
You two

156
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,800
are easy to talk about.

157
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
But if something happens,

158
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,200
with your family conditions,

159
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,200
there's a lot of room for improvement.

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
You can still go your way.

161
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
But what about Jingxiu?

162
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
He can't turn over

163
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
just because of a few words.

164
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,000
Teacher Wang.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I've thought about

166
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,000
all the questions you asked.

167
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,600
It's not an impulsive decision.

168
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,400
We're just being honest

169
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
and respect each other.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We appreciate each other.

171
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,000
We're also thinking about our future.

172
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
I can see that

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
you're a loyal, sincere

174
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
and assertive person.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
So I don't want to

176
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,000
stop you two.

177
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,600
But I have a request.

178
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Go ahead.

179
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,200
Anything is fine.

180
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
I think you know that

181
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
the most important thing

182
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,600
for Jingxiu is to stay in school.

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,800
There are so many competitors now.

184
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,600
The teachers of the school

185
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
have already come to report.

186
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
There's no wall that doesn't break through.

187
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
So I hope

188
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
you two

189
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
don't see each other this year.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
One year?

191
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,600
Then you two agreed?

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
If it were me,

193
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
I couldn't stand it.

194
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
I told you it's temporary.

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,800
Let's have a good talk.

196
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
Then let's have a good talk.

197
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll tell you.

198
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Go ahead.

199
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,400
I'll announce it to you.

200
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,000
This is my new fiance.

201
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,200
The atmosphere is good today.

202
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
I'll announce the news.

203
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm going to be a soldier.

204
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,600
Three years.

205
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Dan Niang,

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
I know you'll be upset.

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I didn't dare to tell you.

208
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
But I'm so old now.

209
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,600
It's the first time I force myself

210
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
to think about it.

211
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
I'm trying my best.

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I want to go to the army.

213
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,200
I want to live a better life with you.

214
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
I want you to look up to me.

215
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
So I have to

216
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
seize the opportunity to join the army.

217
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Don't blame me.

218
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
What are you blaming?

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
You're the heart of a man

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,200
and the father of a man.

221
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,600
Jingqiu and Jianxin Pavilion can wait.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,800
I can wait too.

223
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,800
Anyway, my home is your home.

224
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll be waiting for you

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
whenever you come back.

226
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Jingqiu,

227
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,600
I have a home.

228
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,800
I finally have a home.

229
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Don't cry.

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Who said

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,800
we were going to talk about the new life?

232
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
Let's go somewhere else.

233
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,400
How about the Great Wall?

234
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
What do you know?

235
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
The West Lake is beautiful.

236
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
The West Lake is beautiful.

237
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
The Great Wall?

238
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,000
Sorry,

239
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
none of you chose the West Lake.

240
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
Is there a Shanzha Tree?

241
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Shanzha Tree?

242
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Yes, there is.

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
Really?

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,800
Yes.

245
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Where is the Shanzha Tree?

246
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Young man,

247
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,000
look at the trees.

248
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
Shanzha Tree, Cherry Tree,

249
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Apple Tree,

250
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
everything.

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
When the Shanzha Tree blooms next year,

252
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,400
let's go to the West Lake.

253
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Okay.

254
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,800
Come on, four of you, look at the camera.

255
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Where is the camera?

256
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
There.

257
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Okay.

258
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Come on, ready.

259
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Smile.

260
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Three.

261
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,400
Let's go.

262
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Two.

263
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
One.

264
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Shanzha Tree

265
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Shanzha Tree

266
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Shanzha Tree
