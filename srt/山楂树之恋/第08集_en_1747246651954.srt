1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come on.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Come on.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Come on.

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Come on.

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Come on.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Come on.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You'll go to that room later.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Jiang Xin.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Drink some water.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Drink some water.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You'll grow up.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Drink some water.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Come on.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Come on.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Come on.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Come on.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Come on.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Good.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now,

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Er Zhong is in a critical stage of peace.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It seems

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm the one who's bothering you.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Richard?

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Richard.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Richard?

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why is it taking so long?

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why are you so angry?

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you doing?

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thank you, teacher.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Jingqiu.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Jingxing.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I thought you came to watch my game.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I didn't expect you two to know each other.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes, we know each other.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Then let's get to know each other.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hello, my name is Dan Niang.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm Jingxing's fiancee.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Dan Niang, you're messing around again.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hello.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Jingxing is shy.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He doesn't let me talk in front of strangers.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But I think I've seen you in Xicunping.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I didn't expect you two to know each other.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're quite fated.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Congratulations on winning the game.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have something else to do.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait a minute.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a pity to lose the last ball.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I guess you don't agree either.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's make an appointment privately.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'll make you lose.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No need.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm willing to bet on losing.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's right to have no illusions about your abilities.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So I advise you not to have any illusions about Jingxing.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Dan Niang.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't need this.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Just give it to you.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This way, you can remember how you lost to me.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Dan Niang, are you done?

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Although I didn't win the championship,

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
as long as I can wear new shoes,

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't feel wronged.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Mr. Wang has been looking for me.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He said you and a young man were very close.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He gave it to you.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Stay away from him.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mom, believe me.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Third brother is not a bad guy.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And our relationship...

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What relationship?

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Walnut, rock candy, and ball clothes.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Since you came back from Xicunping,

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
you've been in a state of panic.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I didn't see anything.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I know you know things.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So I don't want to say more.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But when are you going to stop hiding from me?

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You have to see clearly.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What's going on in our family?

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's going on in the third brother's family?

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Can we compare with them?

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a big deal.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Mom, I've been listening to you since I was a child.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You made me feel very small.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Even if I was bullied outside,

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I felt like I did something wrong.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I had to endure and let it go.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I tried my best to do everything

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
just to make you all satisfied.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't I deserve my own thoughts and feelings?

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have to be careful all my life.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Where's dad?

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Master, his father has been taken away.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The school shouldn't be in a state of panic at this time.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Teacher Wang, please understand.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because of your husband's background problem,

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I can't let you be a teacher anymore.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then your father was released,

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
but he has already collapsed.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then the school asked me to do chores.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm not afraid of working hard,

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
but the money I make is not enough to buy medicine for your father.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Your father didn't last a year,

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and he left.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I admit that I'm a little bit of a little boy.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But this is also the course of life.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But this is also the course of life.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Mom, don't worry.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I know what happened to Third.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You let this single mother go to another girl.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How dare you put my face in there?

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I let you into the army, but you refused.

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The provincial government invited you to the civil service.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You refused.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Have you ever given me any face?

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Uncle Song, don't be angry.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You entrusted me with the single mother.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You have to listen to me.

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Go back to the city and join the civil service.

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Find time to marry the single mother.

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You stop.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Bastard.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Dad,

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Mom, I like Jingqiu.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Mom, I will always see you as my sister.

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Who are you looking for?

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What team are you looking for?

134
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He quit.

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Stop.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you dare to leave today,

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
don't come back to this house.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Take care.

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Mom, I'm sorry.

140
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The End
