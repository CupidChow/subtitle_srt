The Long Ballad

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Great writer,

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you published such a big article,

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but you didn't tell us anything.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Shouldn't you celebrate it?

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Meino,

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to be a guest.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're so stubborn.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The color of your clothes is so beautiful.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I see.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It seems that someone is waiting to share your joy.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then I won't bother you.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Here's the newspaper.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Long Ballad

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Comrade,

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
hello, comrade.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Did you see Third?

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who?

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sun Jianxin.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He's from the team.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The team?

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He?

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The doctor advised him to stay for a few more days.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He insisted on leaving.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He went back to the team?

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I didn't know that.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He left a letter

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
saying that he saw a girl in red

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and came to him to give him the letter.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Jingqiu,

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry that I don't have the courage

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to say these things to you.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I had to write a letter

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
hoping that you would forgive me.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Sun Jianxin?

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I asked him to do more tests.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He didn't look like he had a normal cold.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But now,

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't know what kind of illness it is.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
During this time,

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
my father's health is very bad.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He wants me to go back to him.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So he has already found a job for me.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I spent that happy time with you.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have no regrets.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
As for the one-year contract,

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
it seems that I can't keep my promise.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Children's love

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
can't be compared to those high-level calls.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You can blame me

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
however you want.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's all my fault.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Good luck.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Goodbye.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Jingqiu?

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Where is Third?

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Third?

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He has been transferred. Don't you know?

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Jingqiu,

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
what's wrong with you?

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why do you look so pale?

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Madam, tell me.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Did Third really go to the Cultural Palace?

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Then take me to see him.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He went to the provincial cultural group.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's very far from the province.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It takes a day and a night to get there by car.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Then I'll go to the province to see him.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He...

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He hasn't reported it yet.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can't see him even if you go.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's still here.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Jingqiu,

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I know you are sad.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But don't think about him anymore.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Jingqiu!

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You ran around with a high fever.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If you come later, you'll have pneumonia.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Be careful.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Meiniu,

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
he might have a serious illness

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and deliberately hid from me

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
so as not to hurt me.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Jingqiu, don't be so kind to him.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You've read too many novels.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There are not so many diseases.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He's just tired of playing.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He doesn't dare to take responsibility.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's better for you to forget him.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The sooner, the better.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Who are you looking for?

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm looking for Sun Jianxin.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He's my friend.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let me in.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can't go in.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He's the commander's son.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry. I didn't hear about it.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Even if I were,

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I wouldn't let you in.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Then...

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Can I wait here?

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Can I wait here?

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're Jingqiu, right?

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm Sun Jianxin's father.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Jianxin is telling the truth.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I told her to move out.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll arrange a suitable marriage for her later.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't come to see Jianxin again.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I know, Uncle Sun.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I won't come to see him again.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was worried that he was sick

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and hid from me.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Now I know

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
it's good that he's fine.

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Jianxin asked me to give it to you.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Jianxin,

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Uncle Sun has found the best doctor for you.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't worry.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Your illness can be cured.

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Jingqiu,

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
eat something.

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No matter how bad you feel,

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
you have to eat something.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We have to get through this.

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Jingqiu,

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
if you keep being like this,

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll be more worried.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Jingqiu,

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I saw Third Brother.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Jingqiu,

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
why is it gone?

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's still gone.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's go over there.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I saw Third Brother here.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He must still be in the hospital.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's okay, Mei Nu.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Maybe he's gone.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Jingqiu.

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's late.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll go to class.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Jingqiu.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Red beans are born in South Korea.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Red beans are born in South Korea.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How many do you harvest in spring?

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
How many do you harvest in spring?

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Everyone, please continue.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I hope you can hear the Chinese language.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This thing is most similar.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Jingqiu.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Be careful.

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Are you okay, Jingqiu?

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm fine.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Zhang Yi.

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't be so hard on yourself.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Why did you suddenly come back?

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm busy.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I came to see you.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Did Dan Niang tell you about me and Third Brother?

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Jingqiu,

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you must take care of yourself.

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm fine.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't worry.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Jingqiu,

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
you said you would give me some waste paper yesterday.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Do you still have it?

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay, I'll get it for you.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll just use it to burn the fire.

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Dan Niang, there's more.

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Jingqiu.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Jingqiu.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Jingqiu.

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Jingqiu.

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let go of me.

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Jingqiu.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Third Brother.

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He has leukemia.

185
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The End
