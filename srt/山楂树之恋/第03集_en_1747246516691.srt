The Long Ballad

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Mr. Luo, you may not know,

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
this book is not a forbidden book.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There are several books in our team.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Jingxiu, come here.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The school sent you here to collect the food.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I sent you here to make friends.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You should pay attention to your behavior on behalf of the school.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I didn't know you would look at other people's faces.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I just read the book.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You can finish reading the book first.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, right.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You know how to make a pen?

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I learned it when I was in the forestry school.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I've finished it.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I won't fall into the water again.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What are you doing?

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Who are you?

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You thief.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Put the egg down.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Changlin.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You brat.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mom.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's eat.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Third, sit down and eat.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Sit.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sit.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Changlin, hurry up.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Changlin, this way.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Come, sit here.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sit down.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm a silly son.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm embarrassed to see a stranger eating with him.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Mom.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Look, I can't say it.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Changlin, add some more vegetables to Jingqiu.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Thank you.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Little girl.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
At your age, your mom didn't tell you about her in-laws.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Aunt, I'm still young.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Besides, my mom is not well.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She's always sick.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I need to do some spiritual work to make up for the family.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I haven't thought about anything else.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's time to think about it.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
At your age,

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you're a child.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If this family marries you,

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
it's a blessing.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You and Changlin

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
are a perfect match.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Mr. Luo is here.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Mr. Luo.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Aunt, let's eat.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Aunt, I'll leave you to eat.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm here to work for Jingqiu's family.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Jingqiu, thank you for your hard work.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You should study well.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You should know more about the history of the village.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You should write more materials for us.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You should write more materials for us.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Miss, our Changlin grew up in the village.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You can ask him anything.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've been in Xicunping for two or three years.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I know the countryside, the water, the land and the land.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can be interviewed anytime.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Jingqiu,

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
please follow the rules

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and be close to the people.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Aunt, I'm leaving.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Enjoy your meal.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Mother, I'm one of the people.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Of course.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Changlin,

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
don't be nervous.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Just say what you know.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You said there's a story

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
about the sacrifice of a man.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's all.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes, it's in the waterfall.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Jingqiu,

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
are you tired?

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Have some oranges.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you, aunt.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's so stubborn.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll finish my task

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and eat later.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll be honest with you.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What do you think of Changlin?

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Jingqiu,

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
your family is poor.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
People will look down on you in the city.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you marry Changlin,

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
it'll be different.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Our family is rich.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Your family will be rich too.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Aunt, I just remembered

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have to report something to Mr. Luo.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll come back and listen to Changlin's story.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Jingqiu!

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How about asking him?

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Forget it.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't drag Mr. Luo into this.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Where are you going?

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Jingqiu,

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
what story do you want to hear?

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll tell you.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That rich boy

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
fell in love with the girl

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
who came back from the city.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
She didn't care about her family's opposition.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
She gave up her family business

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and followed the girl to make a living.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The girl was captured by the enemy

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and the enemy attacked her village.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The girl was captured by the enemy

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and she was beaten by Yanxin.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
She died in the river.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What about the boy?

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Didn't he protect the girl?

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The boy followed the team to fight the guerrillas.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A few months later,

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the guerrillas were surrounded by the enemy.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The boy came here

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to help the army.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,620
In the

135
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,000
desperate situation,

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
he died here

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
even though he couldn't get out of the hospital.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Did they die

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
without knowing that they had been...

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The End

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Jingqiu,

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
as long as you have a good attitude,

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you can complete your task well.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mr. Luo,

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I found that there are many stories

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to be written in the village.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
In addition to these legends,

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I think some of the local situations in the village

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
can also be considered.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Jingqiu,

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you just need to complete the task

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that the organization gave you.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The organization will naturally

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
distinguish what is the focus.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You don't have to worry about this.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You will go back to the city in a few days.

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There was a program before.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Didn't I ask you to participate in the rehearsal?

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The show is almost over.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can go back and help me watch the situation.

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But Mr. Luo,

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I want to interview more during these days.

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Didn't Dongmei also participate?

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You let him go back first.

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can go back and see your mother.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You say it so well.

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Teacher,

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
this is also for you to consider.

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No one is willing to toss and turn.

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can only be used by the village.

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hey,

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Jingqiu,

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
you go back to your room and pack your luggage.

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't have anything to pack, Madam.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You go back to your room.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm going to cook.

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Usually,

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
she looks so stubborn.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
She has only been here for a few days.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm afraid she will be too stubborn to stand up for her.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Madam's son

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
is also very stubborn.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Indeed,

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
this person is not a risk.

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Her family is poor.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
In case the city people in the team are a little stingy,

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
she is a good farmer.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is called learning from the poor.

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And it is deep learning.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
