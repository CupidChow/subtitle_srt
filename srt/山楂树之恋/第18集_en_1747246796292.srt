1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,240
I had a lot of dreams in my dreams

3
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,960
You became a big writer and you wrote a lot of stories

4
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,840
There's also a me in it

5
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,520
The third in the dream is also hiding from me

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
In the dream

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The ending is not like this

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have a article that I'm going to publish

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll read it to you

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
My mountain

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
West Village

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A remote mountain village

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
My most loyal

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Is that lonely mountain

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Tree

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He lives on the edge of the village

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Become my heart

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Doctor, how is it?

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The patient's condition is very unstable

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But it's finally back

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If this problem occurs again, I'm afraid

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What did the doctor say?

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I didn't say anything

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Just say let us give you more nutrition

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
correct

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I have a gift for you

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll give it to you

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know what it is

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know what it is

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know what it is

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know what it is

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't know what it is

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know what it is

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll give it to you

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Look at the telegram

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Said the mine you were exploring before

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Confirmed existence

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And the mine is very rich

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I really want to see

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Will have a chance

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I mean

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Mountain tea tree

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't want to die like this on the bed

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Isn't this equal to killing him?

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Nonsense, no way

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Doctor, how long is the third child?

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This may not be three months

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
His situation is always possible

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I know, don't say it again

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I just said one word, no way

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Uncle Sun, I'm also very afraid

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Very painful

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think the third child has never asked me for this

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't afford it

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But this is his last wish

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's also the only thing we can do for him

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't want to disappoint him

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Today's situation is relatively stable

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Remember to take your medicine on time

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Third

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sorry

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Take me away

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go see the mountain tea tree

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's so late, don't push the patient everywhere

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm leaving

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ok

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Qingqing

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll do it myself

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm coming

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Be careful

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Be careful

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Be careful

73
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's all my fault, I hesitated

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I came too late

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Last night, Guo Dafeng was killed by Hua Quan

76
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Third

77
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We are finally at the mountain tea tree

78
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Girl

79
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Qingqing

80
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Promise me

81
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
To work hard

82
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
To live

83
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I promise you

84
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I will always be there for you

85
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Girl

86
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Continue writing articles

87
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Find a good teacher

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Find a person

89
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Get married

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Have children

91
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Live a happy life

92
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No

93
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No

94
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I won't

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I won't

96
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I thought

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You can live happily like this

98
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I feel like I'm still alive

99
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Third

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So good

101
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Third

102
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Qingqing

103
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Third

104
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Qingqing

105
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Qingqing

106
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Qingqing is dead

107
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Qingqing

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The rain has stopped

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The rain has been in my heart

110
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The flowers that bloom in the mountain tea tree

111
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Have you come back?

112
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The heart that was in the beginning

113
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The me that is in the middle

114
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The time that is going back

115
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
According to the will of the third

116
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
After he was burned

117
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He was lying under the mountain tea tree

118
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He told me when he was lost

119
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't wait for you for a year

120
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But I will be in another world

121
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Love you for a lifetime

122
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
In the future

123
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
In the dream

124
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I often go back to the mountain tea tree

125
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Here to rest

126
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The person I love

127
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The youthful adventure

128
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I wait for the end of the no one

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The lion's head to the wolf

130
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Someone

131
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The lion's man again

132
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Back to the heart

133
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Memories

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So far

135
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Missing

136
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So close

137
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The mountain tea tree blooms your dream

138
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The mountain tea tree falls my youthful color

139
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Love is so slow

140
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
How long is the time

141
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You hold me, I hold the wind, I hold the color

142
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I write you, write the rain, write the separation

143
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Too many encounters

144
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's always forever

145
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Too many stories

146
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's always a lifetime

147
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You miss the youthful adventure

148
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I wait for the end of the no one

149
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Too many encounters

150
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's always forever

151
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Too many stories

152
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's always a lifetime

153
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You miss the youthful adventure

154
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I wait for the end of the no one

155
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I wait for the end of the no one
