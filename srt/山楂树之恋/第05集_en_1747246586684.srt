00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,240
Episode 4

3
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,880
Come out.

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
I saw you.

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
Little girl,

6
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
come with me.

7
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Little girl!

8
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
Hold on.

9
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Come on.

10
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
You're pretty fast.

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Don't be afraid.

12
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
Come on.

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm here.

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Don't be afraid.

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
It's like a rabbit.

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Let me go.

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
Little girl.

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Are you hurt?

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
That's good.

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Thank you for what you did.

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
It's okay.

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,880
How did you know I was there?

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
I told you to wait for me.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
You didn't show up,

25
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,880
so I came to find you.

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Can I ask you a question?

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Go ahead.

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
What's your purpose?

29
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,880
You gave me the rock candy and walnuts,

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
and helped me rehearse.

31
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
You're still waiting for me here.

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
What's your purpose?

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Must I have a purpose?

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
I mean,

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,880
if you have any other ideas,

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
just give them to me.

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
I helped you before.

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
You can help me in the future.

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
We can help each other.

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Isn't that a close friendship?

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
Close friendship?

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
That's a good idea.

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Yes, it's a close friendship.

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,880
But I don't have anything to help you with.

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
There's one thing.

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Maybe you can help me.

47
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,880
I shouldn't have agreed to be so happy.

49
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Forget it.

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,880
Who told us to be revolutionary?

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,880
The number is 700.

52
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
No, we'll go to the real place tomorrow.

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
We'll go again tomorrow.

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
Okay.

55
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
You've done the rehearsal.

56
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Jingqiu is here.

57
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Come on.

58
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Come on in.

59
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Come in.

60
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
Here, find your names.

61
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Okay.

62
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Thank you.

63
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Third's.

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
These are all Third's.

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Let me see.

66
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
How embarrassing.

67
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Let me see.

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Let me see.

69
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
How embarrassing.

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Jingqiu.

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
So,

72
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
we're all Third's.

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
You're beautiful.

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
In their eyes,

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
only Third's.

76
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Third.

77
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
Jingqiu.

78
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,880
You know how bad it is to do this.

79
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Don't go to that Third.

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
You're always together.

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
How embarrassing.

82
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Teacher Luo.

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
My relationship with Third

84
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,880
is a high-class friendship.

85
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
I'm not afraid of others.

86
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,880
I went to him to write the village history.

87
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
I'm not afraid of him.

88
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
I'm not afraid of him.

89
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
I'm not afraid of him.

90
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
I'm not afraid of him.

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
I'm not afraid of him.

92
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
I'm not afraid of him.

93
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
I'm not afraid of him.

94
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
I'm not afraid of him.

95
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Where did you go?

96
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Interrogation.

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Interrogation?

98
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Do it looked normal to you

99
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
and must have been ìžˆ bacd coloru longer.

100
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Okay.

101
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Well thanks,

102
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
it's all right.

103
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Where'd Go highest in books?

104
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,540
CHUANCHUAN

105
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,880
I have a lot to learn about Xi Cunping.

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Here.

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Why is there sausage?

108
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,880
There is a tradition in our village.

109
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
If a young man likes a girl,

110
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
he will invite her to his house for dinner.

111
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,880
And he will secretly bury a few pieces of sausage in the bowl.

112
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,880
It means he is proposing to the girl.

113
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,880
If the girl eats it, it means she agrees.

114
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,880
This silly boy, say something.

115
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
What?

116
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
What a silly boy.

117
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Brother Changlin, I know you are good at this.

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
But...

120
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Zhengqiu, do you like Third Brother?

122
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
But Third Brother...

123
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Brother Changlin, I have something to tell you.

124
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
I will tell you another day.

125
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Can I ask you a question?

126
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Do you like stones?

127
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,880
You have a lot of stones in your notebook.

128
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,880
It's easier to deal with stones than with people.

129
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,880
Actually, I envy you.

130
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,880
You can stay here and hide in the world of stones.

131
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,880
You can also hide in the text.

132
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,880
I used to want to say that I wanted to hide in a person's world.

133
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
I only spent the whole day with stones.

134
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,880
I only felt lonely sometimes.

135
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,880
But then I found that sharing my hobbies with people

136
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,880
is happier than being alone.

137
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Someone is willing to see me in my world.

138
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
It makes me feel very happy.

139
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Third Brother!

140
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Changlin?

141
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Changlin, what are you doing?

142
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Zhengqiu, you don't like me.

143
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Okay, but what about Third Brother?

144
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
You can't hit people.

145
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
He has a fiancee.

146
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Who are you?

147
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Who are you looking for?

148
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Who are you looking for?

149
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Who are you? Who let you in?

150
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Where is Sun Jianxin?

151
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
I'm looking for Sun Jianxin.

152
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm looking for Sun Jianxin.

153
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
