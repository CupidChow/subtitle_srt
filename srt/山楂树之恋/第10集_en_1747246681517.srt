00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We Are The One

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Changlin, why are you here?

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You brought so many things for me.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My mom said you are in need.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
She misses you.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Huanhuan misses you too.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I...

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I almost forgot.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Third brother asked me to bring this to you.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Changlin,

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
how is Third brother?

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He is very busy.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The scout team is always up and down.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He is up early and has no rest.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He is thinner.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Jingqiu,

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I didn't want to tell you.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When we left,

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Third brother said the flower season of the gourd tree is coming.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can go back and have a look.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will go back and have a look.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Comrade, is Third brother here?

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He is over there.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The gourd tree

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Third brother is strange.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He is so rich.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He loves to go to the wilderness.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He is very hardworking.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I heard that he had a fight with his family.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now he doesn't want the money from his family.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
His life is over.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He still needs to save money to buy paper and ink.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He is still cultured.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He is different.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will wake him up.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't go.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let him sleep a little longer.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I will go.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You woke up.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You washed my clothes.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Me? Jingqiu washed it.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Jingqiu?

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He came here before. Why didn't you wake me up?

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He didn't want to.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He said he wanted you to sleep a little longer.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will go.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Jingqiu

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The flower bag

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The flower bag

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The moment I saw the flower bag

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I think

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I saw our future.

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The flower bag

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The flower bag

58
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Writing is not only an observation of the outside world.

59
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It is also a reflection of the inner world.

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
When I write

61
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I often think about my feelings.

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Speaking of Qingers

63
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Paying attention to devices

64
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Leave the people behind

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
doing your hair

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Jingqiu

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You two wait

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Jingqiu

69
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What are you doing here?

70
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,760
Isn't there a speech today?

71
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,240
A speech?

72
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,800
I don't know.

73
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
Did you remember it wrong?

74
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,240
Your dress is pretty.

75
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
It looks like you prepared it.

76
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,840
You are in the second grade.

77
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,520
Why did you come to our school?

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,760
Can't I?

79
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,240
Jingqiu.

80
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,120
Mr. Luo.

81
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,480
What's going on?

82
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,360
This is my fault.

83
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,720
I forgot to tell you.

84
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,280
The theater is being renovated in the second grade.

85
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,840
They are very anxious.

86
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,160
So they borrowed our auditorium

87
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,600
to use it first.

88
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,200
So the speech is cancelled?

89
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, let's find time.

90
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,760
Okay?

91
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,680
Mr. Luo.

92
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,440
Our school values this play very much.

93
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,600
Because we are going to the provincial tour.

94
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,440
So we will disturb you

95
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,880
for the next two or three months.

96
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,320
Don't bother.

97
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,280
The school leaders have already instructed us.

98
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
We will cooperate.

99
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,200
Mr. Luo.

100
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,920
Is the threshold of the speech very low?

101
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,440
Can anyone come?

102
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,000
Are you happy to do this?

103
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,160
Jingqiu.

104
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,920
Jingqiu.

105
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,360
Please wait.

106
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,240
Jingqiu.

107
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,240
Of course I am happy.

108
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,640
Jingqiu.

109
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,840
Jingqiu.

110
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,920
Stop.

111
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,760
Don't be too willful.

112
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,120
You say I am willful?

113
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,720
Is this fair to me?

114
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,680
You are overestimating yourself.

115
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,800
You even want the school leaders to be divided into three groups.

116
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,920
What can I do?

117
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,840
There is no such thing as fairness in the world.

118
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,360
Let me say,

119
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
bow your head and apologize.

120
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
Otherwise, it will be difficult for you to stay in school.

121
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,120
I am staying in school.

122
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,120
Mr. Luo.

123
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,440
I don't want it.

124
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,960
Zique has lost to link-seminarist Chen Z sjÃ¤l ensure

125
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,680
Inspired this surprise

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,800
I was about to say that I don't think he is the man I think so they are forces

127
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,480
And you were not right there and what kind of a shift was that

128
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,880
Okay, okay.

129
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,920
Danyang.

130
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,120
Jingxing.

131
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,280
What brought you here?

132
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,120
Wasn't there a text lecture today?

133
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
I don't know.

134
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Jiang Xin!

135
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Jiang Xin!

136
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,280
I used to think you were just being willful and childish.

137
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I never thought you could do such a vicious thing.

138
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
I... I... I was just being willful.

139
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
It's not as serious as you said.

140
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
You were being willful?

141
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Do you know what kind of harm you caused to others' lives?

142
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,280
For your own happiness, you can see others' dignity and sacrifice their efforts.

143
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Who gave you the right and the sense of superiority?

144
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,280
I... I... I didn't.

145
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I didn't.

146
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
I didn't.

147
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
I didn't.

148
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
I don't know such a big mother.

149
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Jiang Xin!

150
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Big Mother, are we still rehearsing?

151
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Shut up!

152
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Let's go. Let's go.

153
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Jiang Xin!

154
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Let's go.

155
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,280
It's much better to work hard and sweat.

156
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Jin Qiu, I'm sorry.

157
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Did you say that because of me?

158
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
I just think it's unfair.

159
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
I have to work hard for others.

160
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,280
I have to give 10 points or even 100 points for this.

161
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
But I just got a stroke.

162
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
And nothing happened.

163
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
But it's okay.

164
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,280
In this world, it's not always fair.

165
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
I'll do what I should do.

166
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Leave the rest to God.

167
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,280
I'll think of a way to talk about the speech.

168
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
What about you, Liu Xiao?

169
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Liu Xiao?

170
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Mr. Luo always holds me and ties me up with Liu Xiao.

171
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
He's like a spell.

172
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
I don't want to hope anymore.

173
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
The End
