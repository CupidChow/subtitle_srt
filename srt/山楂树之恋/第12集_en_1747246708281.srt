1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,100
The End

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let go of me!

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let go of me!

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't touch me!

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't touch me!

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You little girl!

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let me taste your blood!

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't come over!

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't come over!

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What are you doing?

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You're jumping off from here?

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're breaking your arms and legs.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You have to pay for your medicine

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and you're fighting for a few nights.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Listen to me.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Come down.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going to the factory manager to sue you!

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Sue me? How?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Sue me?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What did you sue me for?

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Who saw it?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You little girl

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is so scheming.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You're here to get more work

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and you're here to seduce me.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If this gets out,

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll sue you.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come down.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't come over!

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't come over!

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hey!

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's so late today.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a bit too hot today.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's go.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There's no one by the river. It's more comfortable than me.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm not going to the swimming pool today.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What's wrong with your arm?

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I got a little injured when I was working.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm fine.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll take you to the hospital to have a bandage.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Just a little scratch.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No need to go to the hospital.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm a little tired today.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going home.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Tingqiu, are you hiding something from me?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, I'm not.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just saw that there were few people today.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I want to work more.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Earn more money.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm greedy.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't eat.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You like to pretend to work more.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Our big writer is too ungrateful.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What do you know?

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is called experiencing life.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
With life,

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
there is art.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There's no good man.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No, we can't be bullied for nothing.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We have to find him and explain it to him.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That man

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
is just a head of the palace.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He has big ears and small eyes.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's a big head.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He bullies people in broad daylight.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's go.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's go find the factory manager.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Jingqiu, don't be afraid.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The factory manager doesn't care.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The police station does.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to the factory manager to sue you.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Sue me?

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What are you suing me for?

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Who saw it?

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're a young lady.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You have a lot of heart.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You came to the camp

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
to work more.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If this gets out,

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll be mad at you.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Think about it.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If this gets out

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and gets to your mother,

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
she'll be mad at you.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right?

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She'll bite you

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
if you say a word.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No one can beat her.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But if it gets out,

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
it'll be bad for the girl.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She'll be sure

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to make a rumor in front of people.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No matter how bad it is,

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it'll be bad for her.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I heard

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
someone beat Wan.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I thought it was a lie.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I didn't expect it to be true.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I heard it too.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's said that he was beaten badly.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Right?

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you know He Jingqiu?

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why did you beat him?

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He's drunk.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He's been upset for a long time.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He's been slandering people.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No one told me to beat him.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you know the consequences of beating someone?

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I know.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll do it alone.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He's a bad guy.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But he deserves to be beaten.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He's not honest. I'll keep beating him.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you know Jingqiu?

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It has nothing to do with him.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're still young.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's important.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If it gets in the file,

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
it'll have a big impact on them.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You need to know the situation to help you.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Tell me.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Comrade.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Zhang Yi went to the cinema with me last night.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He didn't go to fight.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Who's in charge here?

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Say something.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Over there.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Zhang Yi.

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Are you okay?

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm fine.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Come here.

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Brother Jiaxin.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You know the situation.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You made a mistake.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're fine.

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're good at starting things.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But you're not good at it.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You won't be punished if you start something.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't do it again.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Remember.

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't do it again.

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's go.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You scared me.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
How did you know?

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I went to ask about your injury at the factory.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I heard that

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
he was bragging.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I guessed it.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I heard it from a friend.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He said that

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
when he passed by the warehouse,

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
he heard someone talking.

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He heard your name.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But then Wan Changsheng came out alone.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I was a little surprised.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But don't do this again.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It will hurt you.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I know.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What's this?

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When I was on the street,

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
it was much darker than this.

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's darker than you.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Look.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You think you're a hooligan?

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Can you think of the consequences before you do something?

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The leader is right.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll go back and get some oil.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let my brain turn.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Jingqiu, this time we did something impulsive.

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But you have to promise us

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that next time we meet,

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
don't be alone.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes. Jingqiu.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You know who I am.

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't be polite to me.

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In the end,

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I blame myself.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I believed him.

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's why I made so much trouble.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How can you blame yourself?

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He caught your weakness and set you up.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You old fox.

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why do you have to go to the factory?

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's good to go to school.

188
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're talking nonsense again.

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm so good at it.

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If I could stay, I would have stayed.

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You know nothing.

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I know you want to stay.

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Our second school is starting to select.

194
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The school can be selected.

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Your eighth school hasn't started yet.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Look at my memory.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I've been busy lately.

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've been preparing for this.

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you, teacher Luo.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But,

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
this is the first time

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
we have this kind of selection.

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Many people applied.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's for the sake of beauty and fun.

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Not everyone can get a copy.

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But I think

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it's a good idea.

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Everyone can get a copy.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Even if you get a copy,

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the competition is fierce.

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You can try it.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But teacher Luo said

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the competition is fierce.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not worried.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm afraid you'll lose.

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sometimes,

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
you can survive

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
only when you use value.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm used to it.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Maybe I should wait until I succeed

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and stay for the day

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
so I won't be manipulated by him.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Wanli Changzheng has made a key step.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Do you want to celebrate it?

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes.

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000

I'm sorry.

279
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sorry.
