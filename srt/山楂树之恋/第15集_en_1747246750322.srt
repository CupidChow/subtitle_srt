The Long Ballad

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is your tuition fee.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I thought it was donated by a kind uncle.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hurry up and give it to him.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank you, Mr. Jingqiao.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Next month, I will come back from Xizunping

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to bring you some specialties.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You are from Xizunping?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was supposed to be back in two days.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But my family said it was raining heavily.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's not safe.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I heard there is a scouting team nearby.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They met a mud stream.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Many people were injured.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Jingqiao! Jingqiao!

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Mom, don't pull me!

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, don't go!

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Jingqiao, I heard from the radio.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What did you say?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I heard that the Xizunping rain was heavy.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Many people were injured.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The survivors are in the hospital.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Long Ballad

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Mr. Long!

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Jingqiao?

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Jingqiao?

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Are you okay?

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm fine.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The doctor saw that I was a bit tired.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He suggested that I stay here for a few days.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How did you get this wound?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's gone.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's just that I got a little skin injury

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
when I transferred to the camp.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's not serious.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are so careless.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't run away from the difficulties

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
that my teammates have faced.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We haven't seen the scene together yet.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's go and have a look.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Take care.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Jingqiao, I'm sorry.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hello, can I see this piece of fabric?

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Of course.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's so beautiful.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,720
The flower of the

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Shanzha Tree is almost the same color.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How much is this?

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is one dollar.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How much do you want?

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Please measure it for him.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's go.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you want to see me in new clothes?

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The Shanzha Tree is blooming.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm wearing new clothes.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's go and see it together, okay?

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The bus station is almost here.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Jingqiao, I promised your mother.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Now we will go back to the camp

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and settle down.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Next time, don't do it again.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't send me off.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Go back.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Your health is more important.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's okay. I'll send you.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You don't have to.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Be careful.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Jingqiao.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I forgot to take my things.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nurse Gao lives in the county.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This room was used by her

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
when she was in the middle and night shift.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
She rarely sleeps here.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
She changed the things on the bed yesterday.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They are all clean.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The hotel in the county is very expensive.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I really have to thank her.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You have been tired all day.

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Go to bed early.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll go to the basement.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll sleep in the basement.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You are a patient.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How can you do this?

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why not?

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm here to take care of you.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll sleep in the basement.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Besides,

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it's convenient to take care of you when you get up at night.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You sound like I'm getting old.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you sleep in the basement,

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll just stop sleeping.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You...

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Stay with me for a while.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You have read many novels, right?

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is there love in every story?

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Most of them.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Are they all true?

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I think so.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The novel says

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
lovers kiss

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
very sweetly.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I want to try.

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's bitter.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's like a poison.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What does it say in the novel?

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You have to do it again.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Is your lover

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
always

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
holding you tight?

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't remember.

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The End

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The rest

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
is not in the novel.

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Do you know that?

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They hug each other

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
like us.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They fall asleep.

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
When they wake up,

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
they live a happy life.

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The End

136
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The End

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The End

138
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The End
