The Long Ballad

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Jingqiu, don't go.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I... I didn't mean to break it.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I've been holding it for a long time.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I just feel like I still have to let you know.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you, Changlin.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I... I saw you so angry.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was worried about you. I...

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Jingqiu!

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mr. Long is calling you.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Do you know who's the person who took the bus to the village?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I asked around.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The scout team's young man is the son of the military commander.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The person who took the bus to the village is his fiancee.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What does this have to do with me?

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It must have been heard.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If he asks, what do you think you'll do?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What if things get worse?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're not going to tell me if you're famous or not?

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Do you want to stay?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll take care of it.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Does it hurt?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who did this? I can't spare him.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's just a wound. It's okay.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Go back to the city with me now.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's embarrassing to go to the hospital with such a small wound.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't be so nervous.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I told you I'd be back in a few days.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Go home with me now.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Uncle Song is sick.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You don't care about him and care about Ou Qi?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He wants me to go back to interview the scout team.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's right.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Uncle Song said he's much better than you.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you sure?

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I finally had a day off.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I came over to see you right away.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Uncle Song is really worried about you.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Otherwise, he wouldn't have called me over to ask you to go back.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Speaking of which, the scenery here is really nice.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I rarely go out to the city.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why don't you take me around?

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I heard you have a red flower tree here.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why don't you fold it for me? I'll put it in the garden.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
From now on, you stay here for one more minute.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll be back one day later.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You...

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You go straight to the school and go home early.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Leave the matter of the typhoon aside.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Leave the article and the material to me.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
By the way,

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
you go back and take time to write a summary of the typhoon.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I have a reference when I report to the principal.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go ahead.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll be back.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Third.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Fourth.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I used to enjoy being alone.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But then I found that

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
sharing my hobbies with others

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
is happier than being alone.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Someone is willing to see me in my world.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It makes me feel happy.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The car is his fiancee.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What if things get worse?

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If he doesn't tell me that his reputation is ruined,

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
do you want to stay?

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Jingqiu!

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Jingqiu!

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Jingqiu!

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Jingqiu!

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Jingqiu!

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Jingqiu!

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Third.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Jingqiu, let me explain.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Third.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
About the marriage proposal...

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Xi Cunping's days

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
are the happiest times

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've had in the past few years.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's like a dream.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But dreams always come true.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You are the son of the commander-in-chief of the military.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You are the son of the commander-in-chief of the military.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You are the son of the commander-in-chief of the military.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I am the daughter of the Black Five.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We'd better clear the boundary.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is the money for the rock candy and walnuts.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Here you go.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Jingqiu.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Jingqiu.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've been in the countryside for months.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I couldn't work.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Now I'm back.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Just remember it.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm leaving.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Take care.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Uncle Sun, here are your glasses.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Jianxin, where did you go this morning?

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I went to buy something for Duoli.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I want to see the team.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hello, Wu.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's me.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I've bought the books.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Tell me what you want to buy these days.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The team is your home.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is a hotel, right?

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If I live in a hotel, I won't live here.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Take your things and go now.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Uncle Sun, what Jianxin means is

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
this is not a hotel. This is a home.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right, Jianxin?

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Stop.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Sit down.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We never miss a penny.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You always humiliate us in front of neighbors.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're so polite.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're so mean.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mom, what's wrong with your leg?

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My sole is open.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I was in a hurry.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I accidentally touched it.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I didn't feel anything at first.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Maybe I stood for too long.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's why I feel uncomfortable.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Mom, buy another pair.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I can wear it to make up.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Jingqiu,

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
when I was buying groceries today,

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I met your classmates' parents.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They haven't come back yet, right?

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why did you come back alone?

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Teacher Luo said

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I should go to the bathroom.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll go with you.

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll go with you.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Teacher Luo said

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I wrote a good article.

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I did a lot of interviews.

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
She asked me to come back early.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I helped her prepare the report.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm not good at it.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's a special care for me.

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You came back in the middle of the night.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You went out in the morning.

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're out there all day.

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why did you come back?

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Didn't you say

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
you were going to the bathroom?

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was just fooling around.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I didn't play enough in the countryside.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I came back to the city and I was still studying.

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have an appointment with the leader of the Cultural Cooperation Team tomorrow.

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You go and meet him.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I have something to do tomorrow. I can't go.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Uncle Song,

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Jingxing didn't say he wouldn't go.

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He has something to do tomorrow.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's change the time.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't want to go to the Cultural Cooperation Team.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You play with the stone for your whole life.

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Uncle Song,

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Jingxing said all the bad things.

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He misses you in the countryside.

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's not talk about such a serious topic.

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let him rest first.

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I want Jingxing to go to the show with me.

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The show is about to start.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's go, Jingxing.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's go.

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's go.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Jingxing,

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
have you seen this show before?

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I have seen it before.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If I have the chance to play such a show,

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
that would be great.

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Dan Niang,

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I have a stomach ache. I need to go to the bathroom.

186
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Did you eat something bad?

187
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't know. I'll go to the bathroom.

188
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Jingxing,

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll wait in line.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Come back quickly.

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Jingqiu.

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The school's ping-pong team is starting training again.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They said there is a match in the city.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's important.

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You play well. Do you want to join?

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I heard that the champion's prize

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
is a pair of famous tennis shoes.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Tennis shoes?

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Who told you that?

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Teacher Luo.

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Teacher Luo also said

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
that if you want to participate in the game,

203
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you have to have a uniform.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It was not so strict before.

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So troublesome.

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
