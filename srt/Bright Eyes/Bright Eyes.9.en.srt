1
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:41,941
What a pity

2
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,412
So what if you know my plan

3
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,815
My son has grown up

4
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,552
It's impossible to be driven by you anymore

5
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,955
He still planned it like this

6
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,323
I've got no revenge

7
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,062
Just because you are a detailed work of the Northern Jin Dynasty

8
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,032
I'm not going to be the prince

9
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,168
I hate that your blood is slept in me

10
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,138
Just because I am your biological child

11
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,008
So I risk being killed

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,112
Go to Northern Jin to seize the proton and dragon jade

13
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,181
Go and fight and grab

14
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,851
That throne is worthy of

15
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,295
You're back this time

16
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,531
Then I'll kill you again

17
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,516
Zhian

18
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,621
Know peace and peace

19
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,604
How is the doctor

20
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,472
Return to the Seventh Prince

21
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,840
Pulse as normal

22
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:22,876
Good rest

23
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,410
I'll say goodbye first

24
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,058
Didn't the doctor say I'm fine

25
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,927
What is Zhu Huaijin touching around

26
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,062
Not frightened

27
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,338
Zhian

28
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,139
Where is this

29
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,841
Who are you, don't come here

30
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,775
Knowing peace is me

31
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,010
There are ghosts and ghosts

32
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,411
Zhian is me

33
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,613
Husband

34
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,017
Is it your husband

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,652
It's me who knows

36
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:07,887
Husband

37
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,023
I'm so scared

38
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,294
I heard a woman talking to me in Taimiao.

39
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,663
Then I don't remember anything

40
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,598
Nothing is wrong, no matter what, know

41
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,899
I am here

42
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,100
I'll protect you

43
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:23,970
This is over

44
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,940
Don't ask me what's going on

45
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,943
You won't really believe it

46
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,011
Li Zhian was possessed by Zhu Huaichen's mother

47
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,680
How is this possible

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,615
There are really ghosts in this world

49
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,551
The ghosts of her family had already rushed out and strangled her to death

50
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,553
You have to work so hard to protect her

51
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,023
Nothing impossible

52
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,993
Zhian means that auspicious people will have their own appearance in heaven

53
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,396
Even if you are possessed, it will not be affected

54
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,133
I can be reborn

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,403
What else is impossible in this world

56
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,374
you

57
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,011
OK I have nothing to say

58
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,183
He really believed it

59
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,351
True

60
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,086
Seven I heard with my own ears

61
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,490
The third prince said that you are a lucky person and you will have your own appearance.

62
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,992
Not frightened by this

63
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,662
This guy is not as smart as I thought

64
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,366
I think he was fascinated by love

65
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,101
As long as the prince's concubine said

66
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,335
The princes will believe it

67
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,703
How is it possible

68
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,007
All the tenderness of the royal children

69
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,409
All are tools for power

70
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,645
How could you have true feelings for me

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,182
The princess can see so clearly

72
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,418
Why did he marry the third prince

73
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,020
I see you all day

74
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,256
Very loving with the prince

75
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,792
I must have married him with all my heart

76
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,129
I'm really sincere

77
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,379
Who are you

78
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,381
Why are you hanging there

79
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,849
Don't come and leave quickly

80
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,527
Are you okay

81
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:28,995
careful

82
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,056
My eyes

83
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,292
My eyes can't see

84
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,460
Miss Li

85
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,964
Girl, you are hit with a little snake poison on your feet

86
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,632
So the eyes are a little affected

87
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,634
Who are you

88
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,604
Oh, I'm the one you saved just now

89
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,740
Your feet were bitten by a poisonous snake

90
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,776
So take off your shoes and let you blood

91
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,778
If there is any offense

92
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,313
Don't blame girls

93
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,315
Do you know who I am

94
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,484
I

95
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,620
Miss Li, I just picked some herbs

96
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,122
Oh, right

97
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,058
This is your dagger

98
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,902
Who are you

99
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,637
How could I know me

100
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,006
Miss Li, don't panic

101
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,475
You and I are old friends, right?

102
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,444
Oh, right

103
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,513
This is the Jinpu grass I just picked for you

104
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,181
It has detoxification effect

105
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,650
There is no other medicine now

106
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,318
Let's apply this medicine first

107
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,888
Um

108
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,383
It's all bad for me

109
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,652
Miss Li has waited for so long

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,156
I remember that this Jinpu grass grows on the cliff.

111
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,991
It seems that your legs are injured

112
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,359
How did you pick it

113
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,662
Nothing wrong

114
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,035
Why did your hand hurt?

115
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,838
Nothing wrong

116
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,741
There is no other way now

117
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,378
We will hurry up and go down the mountain to find a doctor tomorrow

118
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,514
I'll find something to eat first

119
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,782
You have a rest first

120
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,250
Um

121
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,537
Miss Li

122
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,210
I can only feel sorry for you to eat some fruit

123
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,050
Why did your hand hurt again?

124
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,454
You can eat first if it doesn't matter

125
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,591
This dagger is for you

126
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,093
You protect yourself

127
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,661
Stop being hurt

128
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,798
Thank you Miss Li

129
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,751
Miss Li

130
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,552
What’s wrong with you

131
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,054
Let's go down the mountain to find a doctor

132
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,797
But you will never know

133
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,634
What purpose was the person who was close to you at that time

134
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,971
Just remember the peace of mind and sweetness when you get along

135
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,976
But in the end, it may be found that everything is a lie

136
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,181
Know peace and peace

137
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,289
My eyes

138
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,525
My eyes can't see

139
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,326
Don't panic

140
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,460
girl

141
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,661
Don't panic

142
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:56,862
Who are you

143
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,298
I am the third prince of Nanliang

144
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,500
Zhu Huaichen

145
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,941
It's like I was with you at that time

146
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,677
Not the same person in front of you

147
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,449
The princess actually hasn't been with you all the time

148
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,683
Are you sitting on the ground

149
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,219
The ground is cool

150
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,123
Not the prince's concubine

151
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,324
Listen to me

152
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,993
Actually, I've been with you

153
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,095
I know how to draw plum blossoms

154
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,096
Listen to me

155
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,200
There are so many things in this world that are very interesting

156
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,903
Some people think they are smart

157
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,271
Can hide the truth

158
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,007
But the world is dazzling

159
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,441
Gods are learned

160
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,276
I'm blind

161
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,012
But the heart is not blind

162
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,014
Who treats me really

163
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,482
Who treats me to fake

164
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,317
I know in my heart

165
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,252
You mean you know seven

166
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,721
I know I know

167
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,056
I know you

168
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,691
Treat me sincerely

169
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,293
I also regard you as my good sister

170
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,129
Princess

171
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,197
What kind of virtue does a maid have?

172
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,366
I can't afford to treat you like this

173
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,968
Good sister, you match

174
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,205
I'm a little sleepy

175
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,676
Can you sleep with me today

176
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,181
Painting plum blossoms for two lifetimes

177
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,849
I'm lucky to be your sincerity

178
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,253
But I can't make things complicated anymore

179
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,121
You're good for me

180
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,856
I want to do your good, too
