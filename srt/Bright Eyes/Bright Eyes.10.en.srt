1
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,345
Chenlang, you're awake

2
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,180
How about it

3
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,182
Is it a headache

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,651
Where is this

5
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,754
This is in your room

6
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,523
I'll press it for you

7
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:05,799
wrong

8
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,735
Why did Li Zhian know my overall plan

9
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:13,706
Chenlang, don't panic

10
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,911
I've called the trusted doctor to see it

11
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,214
Li Zhian has lost his memory due to excessive frightening

12
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,582
What have you said

13
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,783
She doesn't remember at all

14
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,251
Absolutely not pretending

15
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,056
That's why she was really my mother

16
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,559
Although this matter is strange

17
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,762
But now we can't believe it

18
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:40,433
At present, the old subordinates of the Li family and Long Yu are still unknown.

19
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,704
Don't worry, Chen Lang

20
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,380
Zhu Huaijin frequently opposed the Taimiao plan yesterday

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,650
Later he could see Li Zhian

22
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,853
Where is he now

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,321
Call here for questioning

24
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,657
Taimiao lost fire before Li Zhian worship

25
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,826
The Emperor believes that this matter is unknown

26
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,730
Chen Lang had already asked someone to hold him accountable when he was sleeping

27
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,734
The Seventh Prince took the blame for Chen Lang

28
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,736
Already entered the palace to receive the punishment

29
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,010
alright

30
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,113
Go down

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,521
Father

32
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,358
How dare you burn the Taimiao

33
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,793
Damage to my southern good fortune

34
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,795
My son knows the mistake

35
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,900
Are you doing this for the Northern Jin woman?

36
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,336
Father

37
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,572
A great achievement

38
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,073
Don't have soft spots

39
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,675
You should understand

40
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,810
I allow her to come to Nanliang

41
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,581
It's for the Li family's Dragon Jade Treasure

42
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,152
All you have to do is find out the dragon jade and give it to me

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,722
If anything out of place is done

44
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,791
I'll solve her directly

45
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,960
The treasure I can't get

46
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,664
No one in the world can get it

47
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,501
Father, emperor, son, do not protect Li Zhian

48
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,203
It's just an urgent matter

49
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,038
Zhu Huaichen has colluded with Xiyu

50
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,507
If he can tell the whereabouts of the Dragon Jade Treasure

51
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,509
Then the consequences will be irreversible

52
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,747
This is evidence of the collusion between Zhu Huaichen and Xi Yu

53
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,616
Please read the father

54
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,132
I'm going to kill my son with my hands

55
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,736
This is your plan

56
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,638
The son dare not

57
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,345
What you have to do is not only to defeat your opponent

58
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,548
We must protect Nan Liang's decent

59
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,250
If you really have the will to protect the country

60
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,720
When solving the problem fundamentally

61
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,155
yes

62
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,972
This is the imperial guard token

63
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,709
Hope you won't let me down

64
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,348
Go down

65
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,985
My son thanks my father for his kindness

66
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,920
Destiny to be unfair

67
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,531
The son's resignation

68
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,350
emperor

69
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,987
You clearly helped the seventh prince deal with the traces of the Taimiao

70
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,457
He had already obtained evidence that the third prince had an affair with Xi Yu

71
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,459
Why not punish

72
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,331
These princes in my arms

73
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,866
The most outstanding one is Huaichen

74
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,970
But he was born to the Northern Jin spy

75
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,739
Fortunately, there is Huaijin

76
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,941
It grew out of the crack

77
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,078
Let me have someone to succeed in Nanliang's country

78
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,915
But he is not sharp enough now

79
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,218
But Huai Chen is his best whetstone

80
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,853
Take time

81
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,357
Huaijin himself will cut off this whetstone

82
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:02,595
It was then that he was worthy of protecting me, Nan Liang for thousands of years

83
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,064
The Emperor is wise

84
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,951
seven

85
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,920
How did you come

86
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,824
Who is the plum blossom

87
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,837
Or I'd better go back and ask Huamei to apply medicine for me

88
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,143
I'll give you medicine to my husband

89
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,117
My husband dislikes me

90
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,853
No

91
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,077
The letter from the Western Imperial Envoy is gone

92
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,014
He just came out of the palace

93
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,283
Could it be really left to Emperor Nanliang

94
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,218
But Emperor Nanliang got it

95
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,720
Zhu Huaichen colluded with the Western Imperial Envoy

96
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,189
It's impossible to have no action

97
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,991
Unless he intends to indulge

98
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,260
But why

99
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,309
This is the imperial guard token

100
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,145
When did Zhu Huaijin lead the imperial guards?

101
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,518
Could it be that he exchanged the power of the imperial guards for his letter?

102
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,554
Why is Emperor Nanliang acting so strange

103
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,256
At the same time, you want to hit him

104
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,824
Reward him

105
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:08,915
So seriously injured

106
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,786
I grew up with my father in the Li family military camp since childhood

107
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,221
What injuries were

108
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,123
I'll know with my eyes closed

109
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,894
My husband's wounds feel like a punishment from a military stick

110
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,463
When I just gave you my eyebrows

111
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,198
I heard him yelling

112
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,034
Your injuries have something to do with me

113
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,069
Why

114
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,705
Don't listen to him nonsense

115
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,707
This has nothing to do with you

116
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,018
Don't tell me the truth

117
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,591
I

118
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,230
Yes, you fainted in Taimiao that day

119
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,733
I'm in urgent need of help

120
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,868
So I knocked down the candlestick

121
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,470
Causing water from Taimiao

122
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,038
The father is furious

123
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,106
So I've punished me

124
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,141
You don't blame me for this

125
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,043
Don't blame yourself

126
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,480
It turns out that he did the fire in Taimiao

127
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,382
Why did he do this

128
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,118
Is it for me

129
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,387
It makes people unable to understand the reason

130
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,024
It's impossible for me

131
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:30,830
oops

132
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,532
I accidentally hurt my husband

133
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,333
fine

134
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:35,901
I don't hurt

135
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,974
Zhu Huaijin No matter whether your injury is suffered by me

136
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,509
This friendship

137
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,478
I've promised it
