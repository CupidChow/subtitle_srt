1
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,079
If it weren't for the dark

2
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm too lazy to save you

3
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,600
Seventh brother

4
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,560
It's better now

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,879
You saved me

6
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,920
Just think I'm grateful

7
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,879
What's the meaning

8
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:28,280
Back then, the third prince used Jinpu grass to cure snake venom for me

9
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,519
Take good care of me with the principle of a gentleman

10
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,800
I fell in love with him because of this

11
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,560
But why did he not recognize it today

12
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,400
You recognize it

13
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:39,439
I

14
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:40,119
I

15
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,600
How long do you want to deceive me

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,479
It is you who saved me

17
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:49,720
It's yours who take care of me

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Zhu Huaijin

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,519
Why did you give all of this to Zhu Huaichen

20
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,759
I always thought he had changed

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,759
actually

22
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,360
It's never been him

23
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,439
I'm sorry

24
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,639
Why did you do this

25
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,839
I don't have any reasonable explanation

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,239
But there are some things

27
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,039
I really shouldn't hide it from you anymore

28
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,280
If that day

29
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,720
I didn't break the murder of his mother

30
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,079
My destiny

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,720
It might be a different scene

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,639
But if that's the case

33
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,280
I'll never see you again

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
So I don't regret it

35
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:41,959
Later

36
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,360
I was controlled by Zhu Huaichen with Wushisan

37
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,879
For his use

38
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,360
When I first met you

39
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,439
You're like a beam of light

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,720
Shine into my life

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,879
I respect you and love you

42
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,639
I'm willing to do anything for you

43
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,039
But then

44
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,519
But I helped Zhu Huaichen hurt you

45
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,519
You're blinded by venomous snakes

46
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,239
It's not a coincidence

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,039
It's Zhu Huaichen's trap

48
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:23,600
And I

49
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,400
It's an accomplice

50
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,200
I'm not qualified to love you

51
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,079
I just want to stay with you

52
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,839
Atonement

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,119
Zhu Huaichen is narrow-minded

54
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,000
So he hates you

55
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,239
After using me to deceive your feelings

56
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,839
Leave me by your side again

57
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:57,959
So his purpose

58
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,920
It's Dragon Jade

59
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,119
right

60
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,280
But I will never help him get the whereabouts of Dragon Jade

61
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,759
I'm by your side

62
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,959
Just to protect you

63
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,360
Zhian

64
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,319
You can trust me

65
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:20,000
A person who has deceived me for so long

66
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,119
I want me to believe you

67
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,079
Zhu Huaijin

68
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,720
Is this all you hide from me

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,920
Nothing else

70
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,680
I

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,479
have

72
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,000
There is the secret of my rebirth

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,560
I've worked hard all the way

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,439
There are also those who were massacred by Zhu Huaichen in the Li family

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,560
How can I tell you this

76
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,560
Know me

77
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,360
I believe you have affection for me

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,360
But I don't believe you won't hurt me

79
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,239
I can't afford to lose

80
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,039
girl

81
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,079
This is the scepter of the princess' old friend General Xiao

82
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,360
Please pass it to the princess for me

83
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,280
Just say that Li Zhian has important matters to discuss

84
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,159
OK, wait a moment

85
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,239
Fortunately, I was prepared

86
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,159
The princess will definitely meet me when she sees the scepter

87
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,600
Zhian

88
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:17,959
Zhian

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,200
Zhian

90
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:21,959
Zhian

91
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,959
The princess said she was tired today

92
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,680
You seem to have eye disease

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,119
It is inconvenient for you to go deep into and out of the mountains

94
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,479
Let me take you down the mountain

95
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,000
Why this scepter

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,759
Let's be more comfortable with the female official

97
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,400
She came with me

98
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,400
You're leaving too fast

99
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Why don't you wait for me

100
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,959
It turns out that this noble man is the Seventh Prince

101
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,439
Please follow me

102
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,959
How did you get here alone in the mountains

103
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,360
What to do when you encounter danger

104
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,920
Do you want me anymore

105
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,079
Seventh Prince, please respect yourself

106
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,879
You can have a simple and easy-to-eye princess

107
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,079
Why bother yourself

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,319
Play your enemy by my side

109
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,200
I

110
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,079
Please

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,479
Princess Jin'an

112
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,000
You are the woman who wants to see with Xiao Lang's scepter
