1
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:37,203
That blind man is really annoying to take a look at him more

2
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,439
You pretend to be me and accompany Li Zhian

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,808
Punish the whereabouts of Long Jade as soon as possible

4
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:43,610
yes

5
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,413
Don't say that my brother doesn't love you

6
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,415
This is the Five Stones to reward you

7
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,483
Just find the whereabouts of Dragon Jade

8
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,853
This Five Stones will definitely be enough for you in the future

9
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:55,789
Brother Xie

10
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,832
You're still smart

11
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,034
After returning to Nanliang

12
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,703
You continue to be the manager of our house

13
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,706
Treat that blind man well for me

14
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,689
Is it my husband?

15
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,392
It's me who knows

16
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,128
He is obviously Zhu Huaijin

17
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,329
Why do you want to lie to me

18
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,199
I'm his sister-in-law

19
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,034
How dare he get on my carriage

20
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,315
It's okay, Zhian

21
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,249
fine

22
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,353
Why does he look at me like that

23
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:09,395
This sound is so similar to the voice of the person I spent day and night with.

24
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,533
Could it be that Zhu Huaijin is always around me

25
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,872
Zhu Huaichen, you actually bullied me and insulted me so much

26
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,587
Zhian Why are your hands so cold

27
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,759
What's this

28
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,130
This is given to me by my mother

29
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,132
I'm thinking about leaving my hometown

30
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,467
Miss her a little

31
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,371
rest assured

32
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,406
I'll treat you well

33
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,376
good

34
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,313
You dirty disciple, you must die

35
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,081
Zhian

36
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,685
Are you so gentle when you think I am Zhu Huaichen now

37
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,354
He is not worthy of your entrusting

38
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,937
I'll send you here

39
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,305
Go in by yourself

40
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,348
They bully me blind

41
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,917
Let me live in such a dark and gloomy

42
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,586
A dilapidated place

43
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,631
This is for me

44
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,973
This Beiyuan is where the servants live

45
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,208
Why is the princess arranged here?

46
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,443
Didn't see it just now

47
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,811
This princess is a blind man

48
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,745
Living in Nanyuan Beiyuan

49
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,479
What's the difference

50
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,147
What princess

51
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,150
I think that Manager Duan is the hostess

52
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,585
You guys are talking about it like this

53
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,886
I'm afraid it's not very good

54
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,121
Oops it's okay

55
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,588
Dead blind

56
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,889
Be more content

57
00:04:58,831 --> 00:04:59,966
Princess

58
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,070
I am a servant who was sent by Mr. Duan to serve you

59
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,806
Just call me Mama Qin

60
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,576
I met an acquaintance so soon

61
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,616
Princess, you have worked hard all the way

62
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,455
Please use tea

63
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,198
So that's how you treat me

64
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,238
Please

65
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,350
From now on, you will be mine

66
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,752
I'm from a military family

67
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,754
Get used to life and death on the battlefield

68
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,958
Knowing that people's so-called high and low are all over the cloud

69
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,827
Life is precious

70
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,396
As long as you are alive, you can change your fate.

71
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,765
I know the servants in the deep courtyard

72
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,767
Often tend to be inclined to the point of being incest

73
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,035
Everyone is in danger

74
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,238
Don't need to do this in my room

75
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,874
Even though I can't see it

76
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,243
But it can't tolerate people on both ends of the rat

77
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,946
I will never let anyone hurt me

78
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,849
I will do my best to protect those who protect me

79
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,253
From now on, your work and life are all based on your heart

80
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,721
Don't want to do it

81
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,289
Leave now

82
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,324
Willing to stay

83
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,793
If you get old in the future, don't want to serve again

84
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,429
I will prepare pension money for you

85
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,865
But you must remember

86
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,033
You are all mine

87
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,635
I'll make it clear

88
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,840
The princess is really a good person

89
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,009
If I had been born for decades

90
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,312
I'm sure you'll point me to a good family

91
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,648
You'd better have a tea first

92
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,451
The princess's cup of tea is cold

93
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,119
I'll change you a cup

94
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,654
It's not intrusive

95
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,324
If it is poured, wouldn't it be wasted this cup of good tea

96
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:06,492
But

97
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,129
Oh, our princess is thrifty

98
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,031
What's your girl?

99
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,003
What's wrong

100
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,305
Why did you kneel down

101
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,308
Then I'll give you this cup of tea

102
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,529
Mama Qin, why are you calling me

103
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,766
without

104
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:47,834
fine

105
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,603
Thank you Master for your tea

106
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,373
The servants of your prince's mansion are really abide by the rules

107
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,276
Get my dowry box

108
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,412
I'll give you some gifts

109
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:03,749
You can speak softly

110
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,952
Don't make any noise for the princess to hear it

111
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,320
I'm scared

112
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,165
Why is this woman so powerful

113
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,633
Could it be

114
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,069
Could it be that she is pretending to be blind

115
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,443
Come and lift your feet

116
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,546
What is this old woman going to do

117
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,116
Mama Qin, where are you going to take me

118
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,452
Go back to the princess

119
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,723
I will take you to familiarize yourself with the road to the prince's mansion

120
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,759
Here

121
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,733
This old woman is really vicious

122
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,134
If I stop

123
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,069
She knew I could see

124
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,305
But if I continue to walk

125
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,310
I want to see if you are really blind or pretending to be blind
