1
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:36,244
Life is a series of
never-ending initiations.

2
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,704
Being part of the Whispers
means being obedient.

3
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,801
You always have to know
to follow the rules

4
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:53,582
and to listen no matter what.

5
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:57,406
Because the true essence
of this sisterhood

6
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,321
is being open to everything.

7
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:03,304
No fear, no secrets.

8
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:05,584
And as the final step,

9
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,587
you have to undress.

10
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:11,617
Oh, what are you waiting for?

11
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:13,537
Take your blindfold off.

12
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:22,103
What?

13
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:23,724
Take your clothes off.

14
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:38,660
In silence, we rise.

15
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:41,999
That's the saying that
strengthens the Whispers.

16
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,112
Welcome to the group.

17
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:42,251
[background chatter]

18
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,541
Am I late?

19
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:59,428
You're just in time.
He just arrived.

20
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:04,122
Let's begin.

21
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,225
Oh, shit.

22
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:06,978
Professor Landico,

23
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,382
the man who can smell fear
like blood in a room.

24
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,133
He's not just a terror,

25
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,095
he's like an executioner
in the middle of war.

26
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,329
Martinez.

27
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:21,519
Sir, he's absent.

28
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,395
Alright, next.

29
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:27,899
Cassidy Del Mundo.

30
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,706
Tell me about the case
People vs. Chua.

31
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:46,376
The facts, the issue, the ruling.

32
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:03,686
People vs. Chua

33
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,429
is a 2004 Supreme Court case

34
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,941
involving a man convicted of
raping his 14 year-old daughter.

35
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,446
The case examined the
credibility of the child victim.

36
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,741
The sufficiency of circumstantial evidence,

37
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,493
and the defense's claim of fabrication.

38
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:22,537
What made this case significant

39
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,497
is that the court emphasized

40
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:26,542
how victims of abuse,

41
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,376
especially minors,

42
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,045
often remain silent for long periods

43
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:35,050
due to fear, shame, or manipulation.

44
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:37,302
Silence does not mean consent.

45
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,472
Delay does not mean fabrication.

46
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:42,433
The court said

47
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:45,936
“A rape victim's testimony, if credible,

48
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,038
does not need corroboration.”

49
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,316
The law doesn't expect a
child to remember every detail

50
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,277
after enduring such trauma.

51
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,823
It was a reminder that abuse
is not always loud.

52
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:01,785
Sometimes it hides in silence.

53
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,745
In locked doors.

54
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:07,081
In homes that look
normal from the outside.

55
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,261
Well said.

56
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:10,622
Take a seat.

57
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:13,307
Alright...

58
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,841
As Del Mundo said,

59
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:19,553
this case was significant because

60
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:22,889
of the abuse that took
place behind closed doors.

61
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:28,553
Actually, you're really my favorite
among all our members.

62
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:33,733
Because, you know, the others
are so cheap and tacky!

63
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:36,028
Right? You noticed that too?

64
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,297
Anyway, you know about
Franco's fraternity, right?

65
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,032
Our partner frat.

66
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,475
This is my boyfriend.

67
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,637
Babe!

68
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,957
Hey. Hi, babe.

69
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,380
By the way, you know
Cassidy, right babe?

70
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:58,633
Yeah, I know her.

71
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,886
Nice to meet you, Cassidy.

72
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,767
By the way, babe,

73
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:11,396
don't forget about
the party this Saturday.

74
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,190
- Of course, babe.
- Are you coming?

75
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:17,690
Of course!

76
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,322
She's my new girlie, right?

77
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,881
Great!

78
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,675
See you?

79
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,708
Alright, babe, I'll head out now.

80
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,012
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

81
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,715
Party? This Saturday?

82
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:38,757
I'm not really into parties.

83
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:43,245
As long as you're with me, you're safe.

84
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:45,856
As long as you follow the rules,

85
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:49,903
you'll be safe.

86
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:55,273
And we are the rules.

87
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:46,634
What the hell?

88
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:50,711
Hi, girl! Are you enjoying?

89
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,301
- Sandra, you look pretty tonight!
- Thanks, girl!

90
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,993
Are you guys having fun?

91
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,312
- Yeah!
- Are you having fun?

92
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,465
This is life, Cass...

93
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,076
Fun...

94
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:15,953
Wet...

95
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,163
Daring.

96
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,583
If you don't explore,

97
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,211
you won't learn.

98
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,422
You'll forever be a loser.

99
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:33,446
- Five seconds! No malice!
- Party!

100
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,474
- Five seconds! No malice!
- Have fun! Dance!

101
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,521
Let's dance. Come on. Come on.

102
00:08:41,562 --> 00:09:07,547
[crowd shouting]

103
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:12,243
Shot!

104
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:22,656
[crowd shouting]

105
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,082
Are you having fun?

106
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:32,463
[crowd shouting]

107
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:48,713
[crowd shouting]

108
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:07,023
[crowd shouting]

109
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,587
Are you okay, girl?

110
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:23,831
[crowd shouting]

111
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,798
You want some show?
I'll give you a show.

112
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:22,938
You look like you saw a ghost?

113
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:25,011
It's nothing.

114
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,890
I'm just not used to partying.

115
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,725
Especially like this.

116
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,726
Are you okay?

117
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,231
Breathe.

118
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,259
You need to get used
to things like this.

119
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,251
Alright, everyone...

120
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:01,817
I hope you prepared for our
second round of recitation.

121
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,970
Alright, for our first one,

122
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,764
Carla Rivera.

123
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,429
Tell me about the People v. Santiago.

124
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,213
The case involving abuse,
and LGBTQ rights.

125
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,657
What was the ruling?

126
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,244
Uhm...

127
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,556
Alright, next.

128
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,156
Remain standing.

129
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,096
Selene Hernandez.

130
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:04,557
In People vs Santiago, the court
ruled in favor of the victim,

131
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:06,461
emphasizing that abuse,

132
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:10,027
regardless of gender identity
or sexual orientation,

133
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,344
must be prosecuted
with equal weight.

134
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,513
The case set precedent

135
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,513
for protecting LGBTQ
individuals under the law.

136
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,939
Reinforcing that discrimination
should not interfere with justice.

137
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:25,329
Good. And why was
this case significant?

138
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:28,768
Because it challenged biases
in the justice system.

139
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,073
It reaffirmed that LGBTQ individuals

140
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,642
deserve the same legal
protection as anyone else.

141
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,471
Preventing abusers from using
societal prejudice as a shield.

142
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,046
Tell me, Ms. Hernandez,

143
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:49,105
if I was to give you a score of one,

144
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,383
and Ms. Rivera a five,

145
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:52,804
would that be just?

146
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:03,518
Yes.

147
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:05,606
Why is that?

148
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:10,261
Because fairness doesn't mean
treating everyone the same.

149
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:14,407
It means recognizing effort
and responsibility.

150
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,292
I studied. I prepared.

151
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:20,514
I took the time to understand
the case because it matters.

152
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:23,624
Just like justice matters
in the real world.

153
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,906
If someone fails to meet the standard,

154
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:27,513
they should be held accountable.

155
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,098
That's how the law works.

156
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,034
Well said, Hernandez.

157
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:34,604
Take a seat.
You get a grade of one.

158
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,126
And for you, Rivera, five.

159
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,584
So now, you understand how
the law works. Right?

160
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:59,671
You guys better study
next time, alright?

161
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,879
Shit. Poor Carla.
Selene didn't even hesitate.

162
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,397
Yeah, she had a point,
but still, it's brutal.

163
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:15,426
Selene really doesn't
spare anyone, huh?

164
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,386
Typical. She's pretty and smart,
but damn, she's a devil.

165
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:21,599
You'd think she's nice, but nope.

166
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,773
She's all about justice and
accountability like she's some saint.

167
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:27,244
Be careful. Someone might
hear you and get you in trouble.

168
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:28,964
Wait, is that...

169
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,710
Do you want me...

170
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,294
or do you want to be me?

171
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,588
Hey, Cass!

172
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,768
Oh my god!

173
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,417
So funny.

174
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:49,277
Look at this. So funny, right?

175
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:56,363
Uh... Sandra,

176
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:59,918
do you remember what
you did at the party?

177
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,544
What? What did I do?

178
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,009
There's so many...

179
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:17,724
Well anyway, just a reminder,
party this weekend.

180
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,852
With the new frat
and sorority members.

181
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:26,464
Sandra, can I skip this one?
I still have tons of readings.

182
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:27,736
Ugh!

183
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,736
Duh? Of course not!

184
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:33,741
It's your party, right?
You're one of the new members.

185
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:36,909
Alright...

186
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,072
Good girl.

187
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,250
Bye!

188
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,779
Are you going to the welcoming party?

189
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,183
I don't know. Do we even have a choice?

190
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,141
Good point...

191
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,394
I don't have time
for these parties.

192
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,859
I still have three case
studies to review,

193
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:14,398
four hundred pages of law readings,
and an upcoming mock trial.

194
00:26:14,483 --> 00:26:17,928
I know, but we have to.

195
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:21,259
We need to survive on this campus.

196
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,876
We need to belong.

197
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,780
Otherwise, you're irrelevant.

198
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:28,010
Did you know...

199
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:34,426
Even before I joined this campus,
I heard a lot of things.

200
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,267
They're seriously powerful.

201
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:43,471
They can make someone fail,
even get a student kicked out.

202
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:46,482
Or ruin your reputation.

203
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,336
Some stories are scary. But...

204
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:56,844
I still want to be part of it, so
I'm enduring the initiation process.

205
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:02,387
I thought this was just a simple org.
That's how college is, right?

206
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,915
At first, the process was fun,

207
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,877
but now they're making us
do all sorts of things.

208
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,252
I kind of want to quit.

209
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,106
But then I think about all
the time I've already put in.

210
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:17,948
I'm already here, so I might as
well continue. It's just a sorority.

211
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:21,652
This isn't just a sorority, Cass.

212
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,756
It's power.

213
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,895
Influence. Protection.

214
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,079
Do you know how long
Whispers has been around?

215
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:31,631
Decades.

216
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:32,897
Look,

217
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:38,907
politicians, CEOs, people
in the highest positions,

218
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:45,080
all of them, almost all of them
have connections to Whispers.

219
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,875
That's how much they
can shape our future.

220
00:28:14,664 --> 00:28:15,664
Let me go!

221
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:25,252
You sons of bitches!
What do you want from me?

222
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,240
I don't have money!
You'll get nothing from me!

223
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:30,809
Damn you!

224
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:37,060
Damn you! What do you want?
Who are you?

225
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,554
Let me go!

226
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:51,605
Welcome to Whispers!

227
00:28:56,787 --> 00:28:58,864
Oh my god, Cass!

228
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,948
I knew I liked you among
the new dogs.

229
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,372
You're ready to bite all of us!

230
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:07,397
Roar!

231
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,709
Congrats!

232
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,090
- Congrats!
- Cheers!

233
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,409
Congrats!

234
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:28,429
Let's go, guys!

235
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,409
Let's go, guys!

236
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,247
Whose drink is this?

237
00:29:34,034 --> 00:29:35,170
Cheers!

238
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,204
Party! Party!

239
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:46,117
Screw all of you! Screw you!

240
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:48,501
Cheers!

241
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,552
Screw all of you! Screw you!

242
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,024
This is fun!

243
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,858
Shit! Let's party!

244
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:33,009
What do you think you're doing?

245
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,547
Cheers, guys! Everybody, cheers!

246
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,597
Cheers!

247
00:30:57,284 --> 00:31:00,317
Why did you drag me here?
Are you drunk?

248
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,008
I thought you don't care about me?

249
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:05,878
You know?

250
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,682
For a new member, you're
pretty brave talking to me like that.

251
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,884
Why? How am I supposed
to talk to you then?

252
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,704
Like this?

253
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,875
Hm?

254
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,977
Just kidding!

255
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,532
Take care of yourself.

256
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:27,827
You seem like a good student.

257
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:33,769
Those new members, after class,
they're like animals out of their cage.

258
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,598
They're like wild animals

259
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:39,913
who can eat you
alive in any way.

260
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:43,532
They're smart and dumb
at the same time.

261
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,900
You don't want to be one of them.

262
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:51,388
Why, aren't you one of them?

263
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:17,888
You know, I think about you.

264
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:30,431
You want to know the truth?

265
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:34,313
I joined because of you.

266
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:04,442
You were so beautiful, I got confused.

267
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,192
I didn't know if I wanted you, or...

268
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:12,920
if I wanted to be like you.

269
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,328
But there was one thing
I'm sure about.

270
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,415
I wanted to get to know you
no matter what.

271
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:37,488
Am I crazy for wanting
your attention?

272
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:42,019
You're drunk.

273
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:44,866
So what?

274
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:37,041
Don't you think you'll regret this?

275
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:38,779
I won't.

276
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,299
If the other members find out,
this will spread around campus.

277
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,285
Are you okay with people
talking about you?

278
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:48,515
I thought you didn't care
what others thought?

279
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:35,346
It's actually really nice here
in the morning.

280
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,372
Yeah...

281
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:43,268
This used to be my sanctuary.

282
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:51,077
When I was a kid, I used to hang out here
whenever I wanted some peace.

283
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:56,624
When I got older, Mama turned it
into a sorority house.

284
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:04,260
So at night, this is where people party.

285
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:06,841
This is where they drink.

286
00:42:08,145 --> 00:42:11,860
Until I eventually
joined the Sorority too.

287
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,377
And suddenly,

288
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,063
this peaceful place became chaotic.

289
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,425
But somehow, I can still
find beauty in this place.

290
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,321
It's so noisy around me, Cass.

291
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:54,070
I still haven't
gotten used to it.

292
00:42:57,538 --> 00:42:59,332
When Mommy and Daddy fight...

293
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,915
When I don't follow what they want...

294
00:43:05,258 --> 00:43:06,347
Even at school...

295
00:43:07,113 --> 00:43:08,607
The backstabbers...

296
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,663
It's all just so loud.

297
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,390
At night, the parties are loud.

298
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:25,249
It's so noisy inside my head, Cass.

299
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,658
It's deafening.

300
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,976
Don't listen to them.

301
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:44,965
When it gets too loud,

302
00:43:47,155 --> 00:43:48,633
cover your ears.

303
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,711
Close your eyes,

304
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,294
and take a deep breath.

305
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,003
I'm just right here...

306
00:44:12,372 --> 00:44:15,843
Until all the noise in
your head goes away.

307
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:01,254
So you thought just because
he approached you,

308
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,748
my boyfriend wants to
flirt with you?

309
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:09,490
Did you think he was single?

310
00:49:10,044 --> 00:49:16,648
Don't you know the whole university
knows he's my boyfriend, bitch?

311
00:49:17,692 --> 00:49:21,848
He's the one who flirted
with me! I swear!

312
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:28,452
I really thought it was okay, Sandra.

313
00:49:28,537 --> 00:49:31,885
- I'm sorry...
- Oh, you're talking back now?

314
00:49:33,068 --> 00:49:36,206
What do you think
I am, huh? Stupid?

315
00:49:43,295 --> 00:49:49,528
I'll make sure you spend your
remaining days on this campus in hell.

316
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:54,471
Sandra?

317
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:57,758
Selene.

318
00:49:58,751 --> 00:49:59,751
Cass!

319
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:03,286
I didn't know you were here.

320
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,479
You disappeared from
the party last night.

321
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,361
Where did you go?

322
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:15,287
She got drunk and kept
throwing up, so I took her home.

323
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,494
You didn't tell me.

324
00:50:18,844 --> 00:50:20,359
I could've taken care of you.

325
00:50:21,155 --> 00:50:23,602
Huh? You, taking care
of someone who's drunk?

326
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,493
Hey! I'm super nice now, you know.

327
00:50:30,148 --> 00:50:33,110
Well, anyway, see you guys later.

328
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:34,453
Bye.

329
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,213
Oh my god!

330
00:52:42,072 --> 00:52:43,072
Remove it.

331
00:52:43,689 --> 00:52:44,850
Excuse me?

332
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,369
Why are you always like that?

333
00:52:47,596 --> 00:52:48,695
What's wrong, Selene?

334
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:52,797
She deserves that because
she was flirting with my boyfriend.

335
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,878
You know it's the other way around, right?

336
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:01,794
Guys will be guys.

337
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,093
It's normal.

338
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:08,525
What's not normal
are girls who flirt back.

339
00:53:09,313 --> 00:53:12,145
Are you saying that
because you trust Franco,

340
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,387
or are you just being blind?

341
00:53:17,454 --> 00:53:18,454
Seriously?

342
00:53:22,178 --> 00:53:23,520
This is your last warning,

343
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:26,742
I won't call you out again.

344
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,439
If you have a problem,

345
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,186
take it out on Franco.

346
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,546
Not on other girls.

347
00:53:33,552 --> 00:53:36,382
What if I don't stop?

348
00:53:37,689 --> 00:53:39,083
You gonna have me voted out?

349
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:41,332
Or kicked out, even?

350
00:53:44,506 --> 00:53:48,493
Just because your mom is the
Head Director of Whispers?

351
00:53:50,466 --> 00:53:51,466
Or...

352
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,461
What if I tell her

353
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:56,923
that her one and only daughter

354
00:53:58,663 --> 00:54:02,827
is gay as hell?

355
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,823
What would mommy say?

356
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,671
Rina?

357
00:55:07,835 --> 00:55:10,933
I don't know what I did wrong.

358
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:17,707
I don't know what happened,

359
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:21,732
but I'm sure...

360
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,720
I was drugged.

361
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,255
Sandra set me up.

362
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,089
That night,

363
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,051
I was drinking alone at a bar.

364
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:50,797
Then...

365
00:55:51,586 --> 00:55:54,208
Franco's friend approached me,

366
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:58,133
acted all nice.

367
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:01,388
He comforted me...

368
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:03,568
Shit!

369
00:56:05,411 --> 00:56:07,026
Turns out it wasn't real.

370
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,979
He spiked my drink.

371
00:56:42,894 --> 00:56:44,562
After I went to the restroom,

372
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,541
I just blacked out.

373
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,158
I'm so stupid!

374
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,113
Everything will be okay.

375
00:57:01,968 --> 00:57:04,388
No, it won't be okay, Cass.

376
00:57:06,252 --> 00:57:07,795
They already kicked me out.

377
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:12,782
The university

378
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,890
already advised me.

379
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,379
Just like that.

380
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:21,979
It's over...

381
00:57:25,799 --> 00:57:27,715
This is what they're really like, huh?

382
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:33,849
They hold all the power.

383
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,137
People like us?

384
00:57:38,881 --> 00:57:39,881
We're nothing.

385
00:57:41,362 --> 00:57:43,031
We're not allowed to make mistakes.

386
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,868
We're not allowed to fight back.

387
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,372
Because if we do,

388
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,522
the punishment is brutal.

389
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,756
There's no other path but to lose.

390
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:30,798
Sandra!

391
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:35,492
What's this?

392
00:58:37,785 --> 00:58:39,558
My little pet coming for me?

393
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,836
You drugged Rina.

394
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,024
Huh?

395
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:50,901
Me?

396
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,904
Drugged someone?

397
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,656
Cassidy...

398
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,086
Sweetheart,

399
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,813
that's a very serious accusation.

400
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:08,456
Do you have any evidence or proof

401
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:12,878
to support your claim, Your Honor?

402
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,833
Don't come at me
with baseless accusations.

403
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,600
You won't win against me.

404
00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:33,945
Whoa!

405
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:35,029
The hell?

406
00:59:38,124 --> 00:59:39,960
I don't need to win.

407
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:45,417
But I won't stay silent
like everyone else here.

408
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,891
At least I did something.

409
00:59:50,581 --> 00:59:52,285
I stood up to someone like you,

410
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,480
who thinks she's God.

411
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:56,342
You're not a God.

412
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:57,965
You're just rich.

413
00:59:59,435 --> 01:00:00,747
You just have connections.

414
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:06,766
I'll make sure everyone sees
exactly how rotten you are.

415
01:00:11,805 --> 01:00:13,040
What the hell?

416
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:21,296
And I hope that when you graduate

417
01:00:21,933 --> 01:00:24,009
and land on your dream career,

418
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,920
you'll see the way people look at you.

419
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,944
Looks of disgust.

420
01:00:32,373 --> 01:00:35,521
Because no matter how pretty
you look on the outside,

421
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:37,547
you're rotting inside.

422
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,520
You can fool people

423
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,494
but not forever.

424
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:52,946
Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!

425
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:58,149
Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!

426
01:00:58,999 --> 01:01:03,203
Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!

427
01:01:03,676 --> 01:01:07,626
Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!

428
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,905
Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!

429
01:01:12,198 --> 01:01:15,873
Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!

430
01:01:16,087 --> 01:01:17,713
You bitch!

431
01:01:18,498 --> 01:01:21,698
Whoa!

432
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:24,404
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

433
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:28,266
Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!

434
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:32,403
Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!

435
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:52,393
[people laughing, murmuring]

436
01:01:52,663 --> 01:01:56,250
- Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!
- Sandra! Sandra! Drug addict!

437
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:01,928
Oh my god! Did you know?

438
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:03,552
Sandra wants Cassidy
out of the sorority!

439
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:05,623
Yeah! She thinks
she's so tough.

440
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,010
I pity her. She has
no idea who she's up against.

441
01:02:12,272 --> 01:02:13,272
You're so brave.

442
01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:17,536
That's just how I am.

443
01:02:18,047 --> 01:02:19,776
I get reckless when I'm mad.

444
01:02:20,718 --> 01:02:21,903
Anger issues...

445
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,162
For years,

446
01:02:30,986 --> 01:02:31,986
I did nothing.

447
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,074
I didn't stop them.

448
01:02:37,944 --> 01:02:38,986
I was just there.

449
01:02:40,772 --> 01:02:43,835
Even before I became
a member or student,

450
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,207
I didn't do anything because

451
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,137
I thought it was okay.

452
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:54,046
Because I wasn't the one doing it.

453
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,707
I was born into a family
of so-called leaders.

454
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,014
They wanted me to be great.

455
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:06,911
And being great means
having power,

456
01:03:07,452 --> 01:03:08,724
no matter what the cost.

457
01:03:11,262 --> 01:03:12,262
Growing up,

458
01:03:13,306 --> 01:03:14,902
I just followed
what they wanted.

459
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:17,836
They didn't know,

460
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:21,178
I just wanted to be normal.

461
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:24,029
To

462
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:27,000
live a

463
01:03:28,676 --> 01:03:31,974
quiet and peaceful life.
There's no one to please.

464
01:03:32,535 --> 01:03:34,078
without being judged.

465
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,212
I just wanted to be
a regular student.

466
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,330
Thank you.

467
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,051
I just wanted to be
brave like you.

468
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,276
You can be.

469
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,438
Will you be okay?

470
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:20,076
You understand me, right?

471
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,573
When I'm ready...

472
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,733
When the time comes

473
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:39,901
that I can defend
myself and others,

474
01:04:41,407 --> 01:04:44,060
that I can stand by
what we feel.

475
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,847
Maybe then, we'll be ready.

476
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,348
I love you, Cassidy.

477
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,394
I love you.

478
01:07:14,211 --> 01:07:15,444
I may not show it…

479
01:07:19,506 --> 01:07:20,506
but I care.

480
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:33,632
I see you.

481
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:53,024
You reminded me of everything I lost
trying to survive in this place.

482
01:07:58,514 --> 01:08:01,808
And maybe that's why I kept
looking out for you.

483
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:05,109
Even when I wasn't supposed to.

484
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,066
Babe, your turn.

485
01:08:39,118 --> 01:08:40,118
Is it good?

486
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:42,826
Good job!

487
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,141
Hands up!

488
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:08,621
You're under arrest for possession
and use of illegal substances.

489
01:09:09,056 --> 01:09:12,290
A shocking development tonight
as members of the elite sorority

490
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:15,568
and fraternity circles of the
university, have been arrested

491
01:09:15,593 --> 01:09:17,471
for drug possession and usage.

492
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:21,334
Among the arrested is the daughter
of Congressman Alfonso Ponce,

493
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,937
- Ms. Sandra Ponce.
- How dare you! Call my daddy now.

494
01:09:24,404 --> 01:09:25,404
Ugh!

495
01:10:17,688 --> 01:10:22,026
The 2025 Philippine Bar Examinations
are currently being administered

496
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,948
across various universities
in the country.

497
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:26,928
Do your best!

498
01:10:27,178 --> 01:10:28,859
Our niece...

499
01:10:29,013 --> 01:10:32,575
Every day she's working hard,
buried in her books, day and night.

500
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:35,539
This has always been her
dream, and I know today

501
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,054
she's making it come true.

502
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:40,377
- This is for her.
- Yes, this is for her.

503
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,231
This is for her.

504
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:48,910
Dreams...

505
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:50,787
We build them,

506
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,372
break them,

507
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,099
and fight for them.

508
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,407
But more than dreams

509
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:59,595
it's the choices we
make that shape us.

510
01:11:01,072 --> 01:11:03,414
To keep going even
when we're afraid.

511
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,826
Even when it feels like
we have no one to turn to.

512
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,916
Even when the world tries to silence us.

513
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,403
Change is always in our hands, right?

514
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:20,818
Good luck.
