But things didn't get better,
so we only did things online.

The idea of only having online events
again this year

90
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,970
was very discouraging.

for the first concert, which was online...

92

00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,104
And it also was slightly awkward.

94
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:17,318
So, we were very worried
since it would be an actual live event.

95
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,030
At the time, I felt like
we were finally doing something

96
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:25,451

So as much as I felt relieved,

The concert started off the same way.

174
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:12,863
It started with the LED panels opening.
So it kind of reminded me of our showcase.

So it's been three years.

Come on. You almost ripped my bangs off.

[Yeonjun] I wish Hueningkai
were here too, but he's a homebody.

-[Beomgyu] That's too bad.

347

I think it all depends
on who leads the conversation.

348

I completely trusted Yeonjun.

349
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,815

350

-I got really nervous.

I did great.

353
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,824
-Three years since I've had shaky legs.
-It's not because of me.

354
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,161
Great job. I finished my first line
with confidence.

355
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,497
I was about to read the next line,
when suddenly...

356
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,665
I couldn't remember anything. [laughs]

357
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,668
-You just get stuck.
-So I laughed and said I'd do my best.

and let's walk with him.

Let the staff know
that we're moving on foot.

372

-Hi, everyone.

You have a role in the band,
would you say, a specific role,

385
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,940
and does that change
for each song that you make?

386

a role in the band.

387

to be before you found music?

502
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:35,686
[Taehyun] But they want it.

503
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,230
They want to see your performance.

504
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,400
Uh. Today is...

505
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:45,613
-Soobin, Soobin! [chuckles]
-[Taehyun laughs]

506
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:51,786
[in Korean] As for me, when I saw Beomgyu,

507
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:57,291
I didn't try to be extra nice

508
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:02,838
or try to comfort him.
Instead, I tried to act normal.

509
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,841
I think that's what I did.

510
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,553
Soobin and others came up to me
and asked how I was.

511
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,807
They told me I could trust them
and to take it easy.

512
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,727
They always spoke quietly
about such things.

513
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,146
I said, "Say that
when the camera's around."

514
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:23,484
"Nobody will know about it
because there's no one around."

515
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,944
"It's okay to be loud about it."

516
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,114
"It won't sound fake at all."

517
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,699
But they said they just couldn't do it.

518
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,034
[Yeonjun] It's a little awkward for us,

519
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,789
uh, to show off our caring side
in front of the camera.

520
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:41,085
The truth is, we do care about each other,
and try our best to be considerate.

521
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,504
We also talk to one another a lot.

522
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,341
That's how we have built our teamwork.

523
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,927
-[crew member] Good job.
-[Yeonjun] Beomgyu!

524
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,054
We did it!

525
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:57,810
-Was it okay?
-[Beomgyu] Yes.

526
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,896
I gritted my teeth and toughed it out.

527
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,859
Usually, we jokingly say
we can't stand each other,

528
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,569
but when one of us gets sick,

529
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:10,072
we gather up even though
we all have our separate rooms.

530
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:16,746
When times get tough,
we're always there for each other.

531
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,707
We become a family.

532
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:24,211
I got a lot of energy from them
during the tour.

533
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,424
[director]
How did you form such a relationship?

534
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,552
Because we've been together
for so long. [laughs]

535
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,596
[crew member]
I'll deliver whatever you need.

536
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:34,889
Anything other than beer?

537
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,141
I want a late-night snack with Soobin.

538
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,896
-[Beomgyu groans, laughs]
-[laughs]

539
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,278
[upbeat music playing]

540
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,363
As for me,

541
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,241
without Soobin,

542
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,787
I could not have made
a debut as TXT. [laughs]

543
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,497
That's how much

544
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:03,042
Soobin means to me.

545
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,377
When I first became a trainee,

546
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:09,465
I was just a beginner
while others had more experience.

547
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:14,261
When I didn't know what to do,
Soobin was the first to reach out to me.

548
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,848
I was happy
that Soobin was our leader.

549
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:20,101
I'm happy that he took the role.

550
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:24,480
It's not that I do something special
as a leader,

551
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,525
but the burden of the title itself

552
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,946
is heavier than I thought.

553
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,656
[video game sounds]

554
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,616
[Yeonjun] He's a perfect leader
for our team.

555
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,077
He's just the kind of leader we need.

556
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:42,790
[Taehyun] Soobin has his unique
kind of power.

557
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,876
[Soobin] Through this position,

558
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:50,047
I think I've become a better person.

559
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:54,051
I really believe
he is a leader like no other.

560
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,595
Soobin, you look good.

561
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,306
-Are you taking my picture?
-I'm taking your picture.

562
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,393
Great. Hey, take a look.

563
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,186
It's insane.

564
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,438
You must have zoomed in like crazy.

565
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,275
-[laughs]
-Let me see.

566
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,193
-[laughs]
-[Taehyun] What is it?

567
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,696
-It's better than in real life. [laughs]
-[Hueningkai laughs]

568
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,323
["No Rules" playing]

569
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,786
We have four more concerts left
in three cities.

570
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,876
-[camerawoman] One, two, three. Last time.
-[camera clicks]

571
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,336
Beomgyu trust me and try this.

572
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,714
Saltiest food I've ever had.

573
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,840
-Is it salty? [laughs]
-One, two.

574
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,050
[camerawoman] Hold the banners higher.
They're casting a shadow.

575
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,638
-[audience cheering]
-[in English] Hi, Dallas! Hey, guys!

576
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,196
[sighs]

577
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,947
[in Korean] Who knew
I loved Korean food this much?

578
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:12,379
[crowd cheering]

579
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:14,506
We're here.

580
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,258
The stage is easy to see. That's good.

581
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,470
It'll be fun once people come in.

582
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,223
-If this place is packed--
-[director] Come, Huening.

583
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,349
Okay.

584
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:24,767
[audience cheering]

585
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:29,897
-[in English] One more time, louder, MOA!
-[audience screaming]

586
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:36,820
LIKE STARS ABOVE
ALWAYS TWINKLE, OUR FIVE STARS

587
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,454
[in Korean] I see one every day.
I have an elephant in my room.

588
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:46,830
[Soobin] Shall I end him?

589
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:59,093
-[car door closes]
-[in English] Let's go! Let's go!

590
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:02,846
[in Korean] I'm on my way
to my aunt's house.

591
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:06,517
When I visited America last time,

592
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:13,190
I was nine,
and I stayed until I was almost 11.

593
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:14,692
So, for nearly two years.

594
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,903
I barely remember.
It's been about 12 years.

595
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:22,491
After 12 years, I'm returning to the place
where I used to live.

596
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:25,536
This is taking a trip down memory lane.

597
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,873
It's a familiar place that I've missed.

598
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:35,629
So I feel a little weird right now.

599
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:40,092
I once made a list called
"Yeonjun's Dream Jobs"

600
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,844
and shared it with my family.

601
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,054
[chuckles] Interestingly,

602
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:48,767
singer was second on the list
after painter. [chuckles]

603
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,564
I didn't really know much back then.
But I just thought singers were cool.

604
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,774
I thought, "Maybe I should be a singer."
[chuckles]

605
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,484
That's why it was my second choice.

606
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:02,448
[clicks tongue] And I became one. [laughs]

607
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,116
I'm excited.

608
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,036
Oh, what do I do?

609
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,878
I'm not emotional now,
but I might feel overwhelmed

610
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,963
and weird once I arrive.

611
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:23,677
[gasps] It's this place.
It's been a while.

612
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:26,764
Oh!

613
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,391
-[director] How about walking from here?
-Sounds great.

614
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,894
[breathes heavily, chuckles]

615
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,854
-[director] Do you remember?
-It's been ages. Yes.

616
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,607
-[crew member] I'll close it.
-Is it this way? Hold on.

617
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,817
This is the back door.

618
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,739
It's changed a lot. This is the back door.

619
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,367
[gasps, exclaims]

620
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,120
I used to live here.

621
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,164
I came here every day.

622
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,458
-Everything looked so big back then.
-[basketball thudding]

623
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,503
-This looks so small now.
-[boy 1 exclaims]

624
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:58,712
-[boy 2 in English] What's up?
-Hi.

625
00:38:58,796 --> 00:38:59,797
Hi.

626
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,383
[in Korean] Oh, my God. That's it. [gasps]
There it is!

627
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,344
That's the house.
Gosh, it's changed a lot.

628
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,012
It looks completely different.

629
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,933
It's been 12 years! [laughs]

630
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,311
-[man] Hey!
-[grunts, sighs]

631
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:15,854
-[crew member] Nice to meet you.
-[man] Thank you.

632
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,481
This is my crew. And he's the director.

633
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,316
-[man] I see.
-Hi.

634
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,151
-[girl] Hey.
-[chuckles]

635
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,071
[chuckles]

636
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,658
-It's amazing. This part hasn't changed.
-[girl laughs]

637
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:33,288
-[woman] Gosh, you must be tired.
-[Yeonjun] I'm fine.

638
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:34,331
[woman laughs]

639
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:36,208
-Thank you so much.
-[crew member] Have a lovely time.

640
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,584
-[woman] You're all leaving already?
-[crew member] Yes.

641
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,627
[man] Thank you.

642
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,045
[crew member] Let's get in touch tomorrow.

643
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,380
-Okay.
-[woman] See you tomorrow.

644
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:42,840
-[crew member] Have a great time.
-[woman] Thank you.

645
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:44,758
-Thank you. Bye.
-[woman] Thank you.

646
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:47,469
See you, sir. [chuckles]

647
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,054
Wow.

648
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:54,017
-This is crazy. [gasps]
-[woman] This takes you back, right?

649
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,936
-[Yeonjun] It sure does.
-[man] Thanks again.

650
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:59,064
[upbeat music playing]

651
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,028
[interviewer]
Who do you think can make a debut?

652
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,407
A sincere one.

653
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,492
A person...

654
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:16,540
who is sincerely committed to it,
be it singing or dancing.

655
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,584
[interviewer]
So do you think you can make it?

656
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:21,462
Yes, I think I can.

657
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,728
[Soobin]
I didn't expect it to be this cold.

658
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,192
It's probably the same in L.A. too.

659
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,028
L.A. might be warmer.

660
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,030
It's very close to here.

661
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,324
[director] This is backstage, guys.

662
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,617
-[Yeonjun] I see.
-[Hueningkai] Is it here?

663
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,784
[director] Yes, this space.

664
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,287
-[crew member] It's pretty long.
-[director] It is.

665
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,705
[Hueningkai] Oh, is it? But...

666
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,458
[director] It's quite long.

667
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,335

-I'm already a little worried.
-Me too.

1190

I'm a bit worried too.

1191
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,551
I'm sure there'll be people
who aren't familiar with K-pop.

1192
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:36,345
We'll be performing on stage
and they'll say...

1193
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:37,971
[in English] "Oh, who's that?"

1194

-I do.

It's such a big set
and we're pressed for time.

1201
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,536
[staff member] We should rehearse it then.

1202
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:02,329
[Taehyun] And work on the weak spots.

1203
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:03,997
That's a good attitude.

1204
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:06,250
-Yeah, that's great.
-Let's rehearse first.

01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:25,352
I think I've gained a lot of confidence
during my stay here.

All my worries about Lollapalooza
before going on this U.S. tour

1212

have disappeared.

1213
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:35,445
I think it's because of all the practice
and just the tour itself here in the U.S.

[Beomgyu] It was very different.
It was a huge stage.

that many people there didn't know us.

Lollapalooza is an outdoor show.

we wouldn't be able to hear anything.

But sure enough,
it was louder than the other concerts.

I'm always happy
with an audience packed with MOAs.

in front of other fans.

[Beomgyu] Thanks a lot!

1349
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,278
Thank you, guys!

[Yeonjun] Love you, Lollapalooza!

1351
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:19,743
[Hueningkai]
Thank you, everyone! Thank you, everyone!

1352
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:21,494
[Taehyun] Thank you so much!

1353
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:23,204
Thanks a lot!

1354
01:16:24,873 --> 01:16:26,958
Bye, guys!
We'll see you again!

1355
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:28,543
-[Hueningkai] Good job!
-[Taehyun] Thank you!

1356
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:29,753
[Hueningkai] Good job!

1357
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:33,882

-[j-hope] Did you have fun?
-It was so much fun!

1362
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:00,742
[crew member] Take off your mics.
Let's go down.

1363
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,663
[Hueningkai] We gave it our all.

1364
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:09,084
We totally crushed it.
As we trudged down the steps,

1365
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:11,044
we started noticing

1366
01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:15,215
that the people downstairs
were all clapping for us.

1367
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:20,178
Even the other staff members
also joined in on the applause.

1368
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:22,764
We were all so touched

1369
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:24,349
and felt so grateful.

1370
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:27,769
[crew members clapping, cheering]

1371
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:29,562
It really feels like we're the headliner.

1372
01:17:35,527 --> 01:17:37,529

[overlapping chatter]

1374
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:41,116
You guys nailed it!

1375
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:42,409
Thank you.

1376
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:48,248
Why am I so tired? I haven't sweated
this much in a long time.

1377
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:50,417
It was really hot,
and I guess I was too excited.

1378
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,169
I was excited from the start.

1379
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:54,796
I thought I was toning it down.

1380
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:58,341
It was a great concert.
It really was a memorable event.

1381
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,886
Thanks for giving us
such great memories, MOAs.

1382
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,598
It was my first performance
where I went all out.

1383
01:18:05,974 --> 01:18:09,436
It's not that I'm exhausted
and tired because I went all out.

1384
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:12,397
It's a strange mix of feelings.
A little bit of pride,

1385
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:15,567
and a feeling of overwhelming emotion.

1386
01:18:15,734 --> 01:18:20,071
As soon as it was over,
all these emotions rushed in.

1387
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:25,410
That's when I felt it.
I was glad I became a singer.

1388
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:29,831
I always say that the reason
I'm a singer is because of MOAs.

1389
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:34,127
I'm sure it's very similar
to what most artists

1390
01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:35,879
repeatedly tell their fans.

1391
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:39,007
But on that stage, I realized,
"This is it."

1392
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:42,010
"This is exactly why I'm a singer."

1393
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:45,263
I just kept thinking that over and over.

1394
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:49,267
[Taehyun] It was a performance that
gave me so much confidence.

1395
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:52,729
Whenever I prepare for other performances,

1396
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,647
I'll think back to that moment.

1397
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:56,941
[crew member 1] We should get going.

1398
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:01,446
[crew member 2] Good job.
That was an awesome performance.

1399
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:02,822
[Soobin] Thank you.

1400
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:08,995
[chuckles] You know, after Lollapalooza,

1401
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,582
I cried so hard in my hotel room.

1402
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:17,545
All the other members were saying
it was their happiest day

1403
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,632
since their debut as singers. But...

1404
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:26,554
I didn't feel the same. [chuckles]

1405
01:19:27,347 --> 01:19:28,389
Well...

1406
01:19:31,518 --> 01:19:34,562
When there are no dance moves,
and I'm supposed to just let go,

1407
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:36,648
I can't seem to enjoy myself,

1408
01:19:36,815 --> 01:19:39,400
and I feel like
I'm moving in an awkward way.

1409
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:41,778
[clicks tongue] Um...

1410
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:48,660
I'm a singer because I want to perform
and earn love and support from the fans.

1411
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:51,830
But when I wasn't getting that...

1412
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:54,707
I really felt isolated.

1413
01:19:58,086 --> 01:19:59,420
-[in English] Goodbye.
-[woman] Goodbye.

1414
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:00,755

[in Korean] Sit.

1418
01:20:22,944 --> 01:20:25,238
[Soobin] I want to be able to

1419
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:26,614
hold on...

1420
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,492
to all my fans...

1421
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:34,289
so they won't leave me.

1422
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:38,293
Even though I couldn't enjoy
all my performances,

1423
01:20:38,418 --> 01:20:40,545
I always gave my best because...

1424
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,840
I wanted to repay the fans for their love

1425
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,926
and express my love for them as well.

1426
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:49,387
That's why I worked so hard.

1427
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:51,556
[Taehyun] Bye! Now we can leave happy!

1428
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:53,808

-[crew member] We're all set. Thank you.
