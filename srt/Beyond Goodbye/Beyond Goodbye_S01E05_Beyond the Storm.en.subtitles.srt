1
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,875
Come on…

2
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,833
Don't look at me while I'm sleeping.

3
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,958
Good morning.

4
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,750
Don't change the subject.

5
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,166
Huh?

6
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:05,875
What?

7
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:07,791
Did you go somewhere?

8
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,708
Yeah, I went to feel the Earth a bit.

9
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,291
-What?
-Can I tell you something?

10
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:19,458
I love the face you make
when you sleep, Saeko.

11
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:21,916
Have you heard?

12
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,041
If you love someone's sleeping face,
it means you'll love them forever.

13
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,583
That's news to me.

14
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,416
But it's true.

15
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,166
And I love your face when you're asleep.

16
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,291
How do I put this?

17
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,708
It's almost like I prefer it.

18
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,125
What?

19
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,083
Sorry.

20
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,416
That came out wrong.

21
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:43,750
Oh, right.

22
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey! The sand!

23
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,291
-It's fine.
-The sand!

24
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,208
Come here.

25
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,416
Can you feel it?

26
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:57,958
Here.

27
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,875
Can you feel the fluttering of my heart?

28
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,291
I can't tell.

29
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,041
That's weird.

30
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,916
Oh, how about this?

31
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:17,500
When you listen to my heartbeat,

32
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:22,958
it's an incredibly comforting rhythm.

33
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,541
It must warm you up.

34
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,208
What is going on here?

35
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,708
No matter how I think about it…

36
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,125
you say the same things Yusuke would say.

37
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,125
"Yusuke"?

38
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,375
Yusuke Nakamachi.

39
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,166
He's…

40
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,666
my late partner.

41
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,666
Yusuke…

42
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,000
Nakamachi…

43
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,125
Could it be?

44
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,708
Oh, hey!

45
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:35,916
Mr. Shinoda.

46
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:37,958
What is it?

47
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,875
Oh, nothing's wrong.

48
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,708
Did you not get my call?

49
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,458
Oh, I'm sorry.

50
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,291
It's not a big deal, but…

51
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,416
But what?

52
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,708
Did you

53
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,125
get it working?

54
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,041
Sure did.

55
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,250
No way. That's incredible!

56
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,666
That's a pretty nice sound.

57
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,375
Yeah, it sounds nice.

58
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,375
I told you. Fate brought us here.

59
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,583
It was waiting
for the day we'd finally meet.

60
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:29,375
The rain cleared up too,
as if in celebration.

61
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,708
Thank you.

62
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,291
Please place those here.

63
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,958
-I'll put these here too.
-Okay, thank you.

64
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:23,958
YUSUKE NAKAMACHI

65
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,375
YUSUKE NAKAMACHI
MARU COFFEE CAFÉ

66
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:37,958
YUSUKE NAKAMACHI
MARU COFFEE CAFÉ, OPENING SOON

67
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,583
OPENING ON OCTOBER 1

68
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,000
TRANSIT BUS CAUGHT IN AN AVALANCHE
FALLS OFF A CLIFF IN OTARU, HOKKAIDO

69
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:08,625
A MALE FRIEND OF
THE LATE YUSUKE NAKAMACHI (30) SAYS…

70
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,416
I hate how nice the view is from here.

71
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,541
This is a surprise.

72
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,583
Yes.

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,041
Yusuke is…

74
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,375
His heart is…

75
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:09,833
here, isn't it?

76
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,625
It's inside your body.

77
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,666
Yes.

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Thanks to the heart transplant…

79
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,666
I'm alive today.

80
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,666
My own heart was…

81
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,666
at its limit.

82
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,083
I'm grateful.

83
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,875
I could never thank him enough.

84
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,083
Are you…

85
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,958
and your family…

86
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,625
living a happy life?

87
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,375
Yes.

88
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,833
I'm impressed, Yusuke.

89
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,541
Even after death,
you're making people happy.

90
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,041
You're like an angel.

91
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,416
But is it true?

92
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,875
I mean, we have no proof.

93
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,666
They'd never tell us

94
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,458
who the donor and recipient were.

95
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,791
This could all be a coincidence,
or maybe we just want to believe--

96
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,791
The letter.

97
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,666
Did you get it?

98
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,583
The thank-you letter.

99
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,833
What?

100
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,000
Here is what I wrote.

101
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,666
"If it's within my power…

102
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,083
I would even like to come to your aid."

103
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,208
"I know it's impossible."

104
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,041
"I apologize for writing such things."

105
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,708
-"My heart…"
-"My heart

106
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,250
can't help but feel this way."

107
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,625
I sent a reply too.

108
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:39,041
"Is my loved one's heart working well?"

109
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,500
"I get the feeling that the heart might be

110
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,458
-a bit mischievous."
-"A bit mischievous."

111
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:50,000
"Has it been giving you any trouble?"

112
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,000
So, it's true.

113
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,458
The two of us

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,500
weren't supposed to meet though.

115
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,041
I'm happy…

116
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,375
that I got to meet you.

117
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,625
Th-Thank you.

118
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,791
I'm still not quite sure
where to go from here.

119
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,666
But I'm also happy
I got to meet you, Mr. Naruse.

120
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,500
Would you like to take a look?

121
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,041
This is him.

122
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,625
Yusuke.

123
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,458
This person…

124
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,166
I like him.

125
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,791
That's the only bus coming for a while.

126
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,166
What? Oh!

127
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,666
-Sorry, um…
-Oh.

128
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,250
See you later, Yusuke.

129
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:01,916
I'll visit again.

130
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,958
Hey, hurry!

131
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,375
-You're too fast.
-Oh, wait.

132
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,500
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

133
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:13,916
I'll flag it down!

134
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,500
Thank you.

135
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,458
-Thanks again.
-And thank you.

136
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:46,916
It's good.

137
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,583
Right?

138
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,166
Yes.

139
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,625
I just had a thought.

140
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,875
That proud look on your face

141
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,625
and your immodest behavior

142
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,875
is kind of like Mr. Shinoda.

143
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,541
Company culture, perhaps?

144
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,625
Company culture?

145
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,000
But you might be right.

146
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,875
We don't act humble when we don't need to.

147
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,083
"You did great."
"Yeah, we're doing great, huh?"

148
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,416
That might be how we are.

149
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,250
That's what I like about my company.

150
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,708
I see.

151
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,833
You must be curious about what it's like

152
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,625
to have Yusuke's heart here.

153
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,250
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

154
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,916
I'm not sure if I can describe it…

155
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,833
but I think his memories are in here.

156
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,500
That's the only explanation
for all of this.

157
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,083
His memories?

158
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,708
Yes.

159
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,416
Just like a brain,

160
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,750
this heart has memories inside of it.

161
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,458
Ordinarily, I live out my days as Naruse,

162
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,708
but Yusuke's memories
occasionally come back to life.

163
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,333
They're completely different
from my usual self.

164
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:54,500
Yusuke resides in a part of my body.

165
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,791
And now I can play the piano,
even though I'd never played before.

166
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,875
What?

167
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,625
Oh, it's like…

168
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,666
Or something.

169
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,875
Mr. Naruse.

170
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,708
Did you happen to visit Hawaii recently?

171
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,958
Did you play at the airport?

172
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,750
Yes.

173
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,333
I went in May with my wife.

174
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,833
Were you… there?

175
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,666
Yes.

176
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,750
What are we supposed to do?

177
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,583
Um…

178
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,625
Yes?

179
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,125
Can I…

180
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,291
listen to your heartbeat?

181
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,125
Yes.

182
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,208
I'm sorry.

183
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,541
I found out.

184
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,416
What did you find out?

185
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,291
Who this heart came from.

186
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,041
I found out.

187
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,208
You know, when we were
in the car the other day…

188
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,333
Don't tell me.

189
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,500
What?

190
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,125
Don't tell me.

191
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,375
I can understand why you're curious,

192
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,416
but I don't want to know.

193
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,083
So, don't tell me.

194
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:38,833
I'm sorry.

195
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,791
I'm thankful to the person
who enabled you to live.

196
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,416
I really am.

197
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,541
Right.

198
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:56,625
I also understand that traces of him
remain inside of you.

199
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,000
But…

200
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:07,916
I've decided to think of
all those things as you…

201
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,333
and to love you in your entirety.

202
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:19,333
So, I don't want to know.

203
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,708
I'm sorry.

204
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:29,041
I don't want to know
the specifics about some other person.

205
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,000
Okay.

206
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,208
Sorry.

207
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:42,708
It's fine.

208
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:46,375
I understand.

209
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:48,791
I'm sorry.

210
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,458
Miki.

211
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,375
Thank you.

212
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,208
Thank you.

213
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:21,750
Yeah.

214
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,750
It's ready!

215
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:27,666
It's done?

216
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,250
-Oh, wow.
-Come here, Yuma.

217
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,458
-Looks great.
-Thanks for waiting.

218
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,375
That's amazing.

219
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,083
It's so good.

220
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,666
-Really?
-Is it? That's a relief.

221
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,208
-It's great.
-That's tasty!

222
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,750
-Really?
-Yeah.

223
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,708
It's delicious.

224
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,708
I'm glad. Even the floor was a mess.

225
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,333
…is one thing the students requested.

226
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,291
I'll ask the suppliers
if it can be done before we open.

227
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,708
Thank you. I'll leave it to you.

228
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,208
Isn't this one nice?

229
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,208
-It looks cool.
-But this one's nice too.

230
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,250
Isn't it?

231
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,916
-The design is comforting.
-Yeah, I agree.

232
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,375
It's Mr. Naruse.

233
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,500
-Let's ask him to choose.
-Yeah, sounds good.

234
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,583
-This is too hard for us.
-Let's ask him.

235
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,041
-He'll choose.
-They're all cute.

236
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,458
-Oh, the logo design?
-Yes.

237
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,666
Hard choice, huh?

238
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,500
Which one speaks to you?

239
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,416
Well, this is a tough decision.

240
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,416
It's time.

241
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:02,750
Okay.

242
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,708
Oh, one second.

243
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:17,791
Okay.

244
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,791
-Ready?
-Ready?

245
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:24,416
-Oh.
-All right!

246
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:26,500
Perfect.

247
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,833
Let's make this our main product then.

248
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:31,750
Okay.

249
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,208
We currently have a long line.

250
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,833
Please be patient.

251
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,833
Please look over the menu while you wait.

252
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,666
OTA CAFÉ
A CAFÉ RUN BY COLLEGE STUDENTS

253
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,416
Then, put the beans in.

254
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,833
After that…

255
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,166
-Shake it like this.
-Okay.

256
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,166
-Throw them in.
-Sorry.

257
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,875
Okay. That looks good.

258
00:25:58,583 --> 00:25:59,541
How's it going?

259
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,416
There's nothing to say.

260
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,250
Everything's perfect.

261
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:04,875
I know, right?

262
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,416
Is it company culture?

263
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,250
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

264
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,041
Hawaiian Kona, huh?

265
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah.

266
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,500
-They're great beans.
-Yes.

267
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

268
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:21,833
Good work today.

269
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,500
This is amazing. What a crowd.

270
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Did you expect less?

271
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,083
Sorry.

272
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,750
It was company culture.

273
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,083
What?

274
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,208
I see.

275
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:35,916
It's nothing.

276
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:13,125
Isn't it surprising
that stuff like this actually happens?

277
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,875
Yusuke's heart is alive.

278
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,791
In Mr. Naruse, with its memories.

279
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,208
Isn't that incredible?

280
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:27,708
What's he like?

281
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,166
A good guy. A really good guy.

282
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,083
Very nice.

283
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,708
You'd know if you meet.

284
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,041
I see.

285
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,583
Huh?

286
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,625
His heart, huh?

287
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,250
What?

288
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,750
Well, I don't want to meet him.

289
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,208
Why?

290
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,250
I think you should stop seeing him too.

291
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:59,250
Yeah, maybe Yusuke's heart
still contains his memories,

292
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,583
but that guy isn't him.

293
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,625
He's not Yusuke.

294
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,041
Yusuke is obviously gone.

295
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,416
I know that.

296
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,333
But why would you say that?

297
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,166
Yusuke's not the reason
you're enjoying yourself.

298
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,708
Maybe you like the guy.

299
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,291
What? That makes no sense.

300
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,083
How does he feel?

301
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,041
I told you. It's not like that.

302
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:37,666
I think you should stop seeing him.

303
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:42,500
No.

304
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,750
I mean, Yusuke's in there.

305
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,166
I can hear Yusuke's heart,
and it remembers me.

306
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:53,166
Yusuke's still here in this world.

307
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,791
So, I'm going to keep meeting him.

308
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,583
I see.

309
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,708
Well, do whatever you want.

310
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:04,583
I think I'll pass.

311
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,875
Don't say that.

312
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:28,458
I'm going home.

313
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,791
Sorry about that.

314
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,541
Come on in.

315
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:45,625
Yes?

316
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,833
Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:54,875
Are you by chance Mr. Naruse?

318
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,583
What?

319
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:09,375
Thank you.

320
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:15,958
You heard about me
from Ms. Sugawara, right?

321
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,666
Yes.

322
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,708
I found this café
when I looked up Mr. Nakamachi.

323
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:26,500
I see.

324
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:29,666
But when I started walking…

325
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,916
I had no trouble finding my way here.

326
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,833
Is that so?

327
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,125
This is a nice café.

328
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,500
Yusuke, he…

329
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:00,958
What?

330
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:06,041
Yusuke grew that plant.

331
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,750
I told him that growing
a coffee tree in Hokkaido is impossible.

332
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,541
But Yusuke insisted it would work.

333
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,041
I see.

334
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:32,083
When you saw me earlier,

335
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,875
you looked surprised.

336
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,833
Yes, I was. I'm sorry.

337
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,083
Do you remember me too?

338
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:53,291
Yes.

339
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,458
Seriously?

340
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,875
Are you for real?

341
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,583
I'm sorry.

342
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,625
It feels like…

343
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:20,583
all I do is bring trouble to people.

344
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,666
-Saeko.
-Huh?

345
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,166
Oh.

346
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,375
If Yusuke were here…

347
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,416
what would he do…

348
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,250
when you're feeling down?

349
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:34,916
Please tell me.

350
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,250
It's okay.

351
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,000
Please tell me.

352
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:06,541
Hey!

353
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,166
He would've danced.

354
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:24,375
What?

355
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,750
Something silly. As if he's breakdancing.

356
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:33,416
You're kidding.

357
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,541
I'm serious.

358
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,500
It would be super intense.

359
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:41,000
He would spin on his head and jump around.

360
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:47,250
Um… What?

361
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,291
Go ahead.

362
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,625
In that case…

363
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,750
maybe my body will remember.

364
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:02,750
Yes.

365
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,541
Like this?

366
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,375
I lied.

367
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,166
What?

368
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,166
Sorry, it was a lie.

369
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,166
What?

370
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,166
Wait. Huh?

371
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:45,375
No way. How could you do that?

372
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,791
I got ready to dance and put my head here.

373
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,541
I thought my body would take over.

374
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:55,000
Come on. That's mean.

375
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:58,250
I can't do it if it's a lie.
A disaster in the making.

376
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:00,958
That's why I stopped you.

377
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:01,875
Hold on.

378
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:04,083
That's true, but…

379
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,625
Maybe I should've watched a bit longer.

380
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:10,250
Excuse me?

381
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:39,625
Yusuke must have fulfilled any request…
no matter how crazy it was.

382
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:18,708
When you listen to the sound of Yusuke…

383
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,833
does it help ease the pain?

384
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,833
We have until the next train.

385
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:05,916
I don't understand my own feelings either.

386
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,291
I truly love my wife.

387
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,458
That will never change.

388
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,833
But…

389
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:31,041
there's a part of me
that keeps thinking about Saeko.

390
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:36,583
I want to make her happy somehow…

391
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,916
and make her feel joy.

392
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,125
I have all these feelings.

393
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,500
But I can't tell.

394
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:57,583
Am I the one who wants to see Saeko,
or is it Yusuke?

395
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,625
But I do want to see her.

396
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,500
And it's a fact that I enjoy seeing her.

397
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,583
I don't know…

398
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,125
what I'm supposed to do.

399
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:27,458
I don't know.

400
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,166
I just don't know!

401
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:39,916
What am I supposed to do?

402
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:54,500
RANKOSHI STATION

403
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,916
Hey, there. You're back late.

404
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,083
Hi.

405
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,875
