1
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,250
I can't believe this.
How can it be raining?

2
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,958
I'm pretty sure
this wasn't on the weather report.

3
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:43,750
Was it?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,291
It wasn't, right?

5
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,208
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,833
-Hey.
-Thank goodness.

7
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,916
What? Why are you barefoot?

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,750
I don't want these to get wet.

9
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,041
They're important to me.

10
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,750
These Louboutin stilettos
serve as proof of how hard I work.

11
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,208
Where's the umbrella?

12
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,291
I don't have one.

13
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,041
Excuse me? What do you mean?

14
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,166
I texted you to come get me
since I'm hiding out from the rain.

15
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,916
-Didn't I?
-Yeah, you did.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,958
I got your text.

17
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:43,041
That's why I said I'd come right away

18
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,708
and rushed over.

19
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,000
You were supposed to bring an umbrella.

20
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,583
What? But I didn't have one.

21
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,208
Wait, sorry.

22
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,666
I seriously don't understand.

23
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,333
Why did you even come here?

24
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,750
Well…

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
To hide from the rain with you?

26
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,750
-What?
-Well, think about it.

27
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,666
It's way more fun if you're with someone.

28
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,791
Oh, if you're in the mood…

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,375
why don't we dance together in the rain?

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,958
Hey.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,958
Come on!

32
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:27,958
Stop that.

33
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,666
-Let's dance.
-I'm not dancing.

34
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,041
-Why?
-Get back here.

35
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,125
You're getting wet.

36
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,791
-Come on.
-I will not.

37
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,958
Hurry up and come back.

38
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,375
Sorry to keep you waiting.

39
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,833
Are you okay?

40
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,791
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

41
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,333
-Miki, could you stop a second?
-Sure.

42
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,416
Just our luck, huh?

43
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,750
It just keeps coming.

44
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,833
How long do we have to wait here?

45
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,625
We're gonna catch a cold.

46
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,541
Please use this, if you'd like.

47
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,875
-And these too.
-What?

48
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,666
They're both old,
so feel free to toss them later.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,833
Goodbye.

50
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,333
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

51
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,875
Jeez…

52
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,333
This is so great.
We're sharing an umbrella.

53
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,250
I'm so happy. This is the best.

54
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,333
Then you should've brought one.

55
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,916
Okay…

56
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,750
What is it?

57
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,791
Hey, Miki.

58
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,500
Yeah?

59
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,208
I think I'll do it.

60
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,500
The transplant.

61
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,291
NISEKO STATION

62
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,250
Thank you.

63
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,541
I'll be off then.

64
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,583
Have a good day.

65
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,041
-Stay safe.
-Okay.

66
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:18,833
SAEKO SUGAWARA: KENGO, CAN I ASK A FAVOR?

67
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,291
TELL ME SOME OF YOUR MEMORIES WITH YUSUKE

68
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,708
Yeah, okay.

69
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,833
I'm such a nice guy.

70
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,750
Thank you

71
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,000
for coming with me.

72
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,791
I wanted to see
the town where Yusuke grew up.

73
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,208
Of course. I'm happy to be here.

74
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,375
I've never seen it either.

75
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,750
You know, this is actually…

76
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,083
Hmm?

77
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,583
It's the first time
in my entire life that I'm doing this.

78
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,083
Playing hooky.

79
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,041
Oh, I've taken a lot of days off,
but because of my poor health.

80
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,041
There were a lot of days
when I'd suddenly have to call in sick

81
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,083
for both work and school.

82
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,083
It actually felt like
I was wasting an opportunity.

83
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,250
I couldn't even imagine
playing hooky like a healthy person does.

84
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,166
I never got to try it.

85
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,333
So, this is fun.

86
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,875
I see.

87
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,833
It's your first time, huh?

88
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,833
Yes.

89
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,708
Maybe it's because Yusuke is in here.

90
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,458
It's like

91
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,500
this yearning for freedom.

92
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,916
-I see.
-Yeah.

93
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:20,750
Here we are.

94
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:27,416
YUSUKE'S FAVORITE PLACES

95
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:38,041
THE SHRINE WE ALWAYS PLAYED AT TOGETHER

96
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,166
"We would often climb
the big chestnut tree."

97
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,166
"Yusuke was a tree-climbing expert."

98
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,916
"He especially loved
the chestnut tree there."

99
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,875
A big chestnut tree?

100
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,500
Maybe it's this one.

101
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,208
Yeah, that's big all right.

102
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,375
Wait.

103
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,625
Don't push yourself, okay?

104
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,541
That's dangerous.

105
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,416
No, you should stop now.

106
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,000
-There we go.
-Mr. Naruse.

107
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,583
I climbed it.

108
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,541
I got up here, but…

109
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,208
Be careful.

110
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,416
Th… There we go.

111
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,000
Go slowly.

112
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,708
-There.
-Whoa!

113
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,750
-Jeez.
-I'm fine.

114
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,333
-That was dangerous.
-Oh, thank you.

115
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,916
MT. MANMARU

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,583
Oh, wow.

117
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,958
The air feels great here.

118
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,500
Oh, I think I can do it.

119
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,125
THE STEPPING STONES

120
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,791
Oh, but this one's tough.

121
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,791
Looks difficult.

122
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,083
The distance here is a bit difficult.

123
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,083
Oh, but…

124
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,291
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

125
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,291
-Oh, no!
-Yes!

126
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,458
I can't do this part.

127
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,416
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

128
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,583
Darn.

129
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,541
All right!

130
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,625
Ready? Oh, but… Whoa!

131
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,916
Here you go. The extra-large.

132
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,083
-Good luck.
-Thank y…

133
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,041
YUSUKE'S FAVORITE FOOD

134
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,541
Oh, man.

135
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,250
This is crazy.

136
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,208
So, that's the extra-large
that Yusuke would order.

137
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,250
Can you finish it?

138
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,833
Of course.

139
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,166
Let's eat.

140
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,625
Let's eat.

141
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,458
Wow, this is good.

142
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,666
-Oh, you're right.
-Yeah.

143
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,875
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

144
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,000
Have a good day.

145
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,541
All done.

146
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,958
All done.

147
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,458
After that…

148
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,375
Two jumbo-sized okonomiyaki
with meat and seafood.

149
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,041
-What?! But…
-This is…

150
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,541
something he never ate.

151
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,958
This is great, Mr. Naruse.

152
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,083
You're so gullible. I love it.

153
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,791
Yeah, sure.

154
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:49,750
MEMORIES CAN BE TRANSFERRED

MOUNTAIN BUS ACCIDENT

156
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,875
THE CAFÉ IN THE NEXT TOWN OVER

157
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,041
The café you're going to now

158
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,458
is run by Yusuke's mother.

159
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,166
She left home when Yusuke was still young.

160
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,666
But she was in the next town over,

161
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,500
and I often went with Yusuke.

162
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,791
He'd say, "My mom is in there."

163
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,458
But he never went in.

164
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,916
I think he probably wanted to see her.

165
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:15,916
I want to go in.

166
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,208
Let's do it.

167
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,500
Welcome.

168
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,208
May we sit down?

169
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,000
Go ahead.

170
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,958
Is coffee okay?

171
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,958
Sure. Yes.

172
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,875
Excuse me. Two coffees, please.

173
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,000
Coming right up.

174
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,750
Sorry. Thank you for the coffee.

175
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,958
"This is the final stop."

176
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,500
"Yusuke's favorite spot."

177
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,625
"The windy path."

178
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,083
Wow.

179
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,500
I think I kind of understand…

180
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,375
why he liked this spot so much.

181
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,625
Me too.

182
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,083
Thank you for today.

183
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,208
I had a wonderful time.

184
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,291
And thank you as well.

185
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,416
It made me realize

186
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,958
how little I knew about Yusuke.

187
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,583
It was always on my mind.

188
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,708
He would always try to entertain people.

189
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,958
He always had to help
people who felt down.

190
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,083
He said he wanted to be
a softener for the world.

191
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:37,708
He must have had many sad, lonely days,
and it made him upset…

192
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,333
about how lonely the world could be.

193
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,208
That was my take on it.

194
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,000
I see.

195
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,083
I'm blushing.

196
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,583
I complimented him too much.

197
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,458
He'd sometimes let it get to his head.

198
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,916
I'd be like, "Snap out of it."

199
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,500
I'm sorry.

200
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:21,375
-What?
-I guess it's weird for me to apologize.

201
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:25,916
Oh, right.

202
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,000
Let's take a photo.

203
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,833
I'll send it to Kengo.

204
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,250
Right.

205
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,500
-How do I…
-I'll take it then.

206
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,875
-Oh, sorry.
-Here.

207
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,791
Huh? Shouldn't it be more this way?

208
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,791
-Like this?
-Yes.

209
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,083
Oh, well, um…

210
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,291
A bit more…

211
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,125
-How's this?
-No, wait.

212
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,541
It looked better before, over here.

213
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,666
Oh, Mr. Naruse, come more this way.

214
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,166
THANK YOU FOR TODAY
I'LL TELL YOU MORE WHEN I VISIT NEXT TIME

215
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,750
Oh, thank you.

216
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,666
Let's see. You had one Guatemala.

217
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,041
That will be 800 yen.

218
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,333
Oh, you have to tap it.

219
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,250
Here.

220
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:14,916
Please come again.

221
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,000
It's 180.

222
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,333
What if you subtract 30?

223
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,625
-Is it 150?
-Oh!

224
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,041
-Whoa.
-Whoa. That's right.

225
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,583
You're Ms. Saeko Sugawara, correct?

226
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,416
What?

227
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,458
May I ask who you are?

228
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,708
Are you Ms. Saeko Sugawara,

229
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,791
Yusuke Nakamachi's fiancée?

230
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,916
And you are?

231
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,083
I'm Miki Naruse.

232
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:39,541
What?

233
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,791
Kazumasa Naruse's wife.

234
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:46,958
I see.

235
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,291
I'm sorry for surprising you like this.

236
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,500
It's fine. Um…

237
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,625
Thank you.

238
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,458
Thanks to Mr. Yusuke Nakamachi…

239
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,791
Thanks to his heart donation,

240
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,166
my husband's life was saved.

241
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:11,166
I am truly grateful.

242
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,375
Don't…

243
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,916
I'm not the one you should—

244
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,750
Could you please stop?

245
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,083
What?

246
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,958
I understand how you feel.

247
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:28,500
Yes, your lover's heart
is in Naruse's body.

248
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:31,541
But Naruse is Naruse.

249
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,541
He's not your fiancé.

250
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,291
So, please stop trying
to get close to him.

251
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,833
"Get close to him"?

252
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,166
Are you serious? I--

253
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,833
Isn't that what's happening?

254
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:49,583
Given his situation,
of course he would be kind to you.

255
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:50,916
He's indebted to you.

256
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:52,583
And so…

257
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:55,666
He's…

258
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,625
He's finally healthy.

259
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:03,458
He can enjoy
a normal life with his family now.

260
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,791
Please don't destroy that.

261
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:10,375
I know he's alive
because of your fiancé's heart,

262
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,125
but Naruse is Naruse.

263
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,541
He's not Mr. Nakamachi.

264
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,916
Wait a second.

265
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:17,708
Did he…

266
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:22,375
Did Mr. Naruse say all that?

267
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,583
He wants to help me
because he feels sorry for me?

268
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,166
Is that what he said?

269
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:38,791
No.

270
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:46,166
Mr. Naruse and I aren't like that.

271
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,250
I don't have feelings for him.

272
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,958
I don't think he does either.

273
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:56,375
Why don't you go ask him yourself?

274
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Also…

275
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,208
You said you understand how I feel.

276
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,000
But what do you know?

277
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,916
Don't say things like that so lightly.

278
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,458
After all, the person you love
is still alive.

279
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,125
Right?

280
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,208
He's alive, isn't he?

281
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:33,416
How would you know how I feel?

282
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,916
I won't stop.

283
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:42,875
I want to see him.

284
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,416
After all, that's Yusuke's heart.

285
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,041
It remembers me.

286
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,250
So why can't I see him?

287
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,166
What if it were you?

288
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,208
What if Mr. Naruse got in an accident,

289
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,833
and his heart
was still alive in someone's body?

290
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,875
Would it not matter,

291
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,458
since he was pronounced dead?

292
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:18,750
If that heart remembered you

293
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,541
and the life you lived together,

294
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,750
how would you feel?

295
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,416
Would it not matter to you?

296
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,875
Is that how you see it?

297
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,041
I'm not like that.

298
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,541
What…

299
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,291
What did I do to deserve this?

300
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:58,833
Why…

301
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,875
Why is this…

302
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,208
An affair would've been so much easier.

303
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,250
I'm sorry.

304
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,625
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

305
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:27,541
Yes.

306
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,333
Hello.

307
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:46,500
Hello.

308
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,375
Here are the Guatemala samples.

309
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,500
Thank you.

310
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:56,041
I'll send them over for tests and cupping.

311
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,125
Thank you.

312
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,958
How long do I have…

313
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:17,666
until this heart stops?

314
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,583
-Mr. Toda.
-Coming.

315
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,625
-You're in Room Five.
-Here we go.

316
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,333
Whoa.

317
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,625
That hurt.

318
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,583
Jeez!

319
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,541
I knew it was you.

320
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,333
Huh?

321
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:32,625
Why…

322
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,500
Oh, right.

323
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,291
Get on.

324
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:42,791
What?

325
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,416
You can't walk, right?

326
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:48,666
Get on.

327
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,041
Go ahead.

328
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,375
Here.

329
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:13,250
Thank you.

330
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:15,666
It's no problem.

331
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:35,791
Why are you here?

332
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,166
Oh…

333
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,875
I was walking aimlessly

334
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,708
and saw a familiar house.

335
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,333
A house with blue walls.

336
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,833
It was your house.

337
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,208
I felt…

338
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,791
sort of happy.

339
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,083
It was a strange feeling.

340
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:18,791
I was happy that you live there.

341
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,041
Am I heavy?

342
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:42,333
I wouldn't say you're light.

343
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,750
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

344
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,416
Oh, jeez.

345
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:54,791
What?

346
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:56,416
Well…

347
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,041
This is another first for me.

348
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,333
Carrying a woman on my back.

349
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:05,208
I see.

350
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,291
You must've done this with Yusuke, right?

351
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:12,916
He seems like the type.

352
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,500
Don't fall, okay?

353
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:34,541
-What if I do?
-You get punished.

354
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:36,916
I won't let that happen.

355
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Hey, stop that!

356
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,958
Look, I'm doing great.

357
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,708
-Nice.
-Yeah.

358
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:51,916
I'm not so sure.

359
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,333
We're here.

360
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:18,791
Hey, Miki.

361
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:21,958
Yeah?

362
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,000
I think I'll do it.

363
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:31,041
The transplant.

364
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:32,750
What?

365
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,375
Really?

366
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,458
Yeah.

367
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:46,375
If it works, and I get better…

368
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,000
we should have a fight.

369
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:59,208
Like, I'll act like an idiot or something

370
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:01,958
and do something dumb.

371
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,625
Then, you'll be like,

372
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:06,666
"What were you thinking?
You're so stupid."

373
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,708
Doesn't that give off a healthy vibe?

374
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,416
It would feel like we're alive.

375
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:23,916
But it won't be easy.

376
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,958
Having a transplant

377
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:35,166
would also mean that the donor's life
continues, without passing on.

378
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:44,166
I'd be living a new life
alongside my donor.

379
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:27,583
Actually, it is our first time
sharing an umbrella.

380
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:28,958
Right?

381
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,500
I'm glad it rained.

382
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,708
Things that seem awful at first

383
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:39,166
always turn into something fun.

384
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:43,666
You really are an interesting guy.

385
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,166
All I ever do is get angry.

386
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,958
Life might be more fun
if we spend it together.

387
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:54,250
What?

388
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,333
Was that a proposal?

389
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,416
-No way.
-No, it was!

390
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,625
It wasn't.

391
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:05,083
Okay, if I propose right now,
will you say yes?

392
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:06,958
-No.
-What?!

393
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:08,541
You wouldn't?

394
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,250
You're kidding.

395
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:51,875
