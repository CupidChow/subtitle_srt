1
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,916
Dang it!

2
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,375
He's not Yusuke. Maybe you like the guy.

3
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:36,041
An affair would've been so much easier.

4
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,791
If Yusuke were here, what would he do?

5
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,791
What do you all want me to do?

6
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,958
How long do I have…

7
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,875
until this heart stops?

8
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,875
From now on,
it won't be in terms of years.

9
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,125
Please think in months…

10
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,541
or weeks…

11
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,125
when considering
the remainder of your life.

12
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,500
Sorry.

13
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,500
I'm just…

14
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,708
overwhelmed.

15
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,458
Sorry, I need a moment. Excuse me.

17
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,541
That… hurt.

18
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,458
Ow…

19
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,833
Huh?

20
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,000
That was scary.

21
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,541
That was really scary.

22
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,375
I was so scared.

23
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,416
Man, that was scary.

24
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,541
Why am I freaking out like this?

25
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,375
I look like a fool.

26
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,250
Hey, Saeko.

27
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,583
Seriously?

28
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,416
Are you an angel or something, Hiro?

29
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,333
What?

30
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,541
Yeah, that's right.

31
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,791
-You noticed?
-Just now--

32
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:24,291
-Hey, listen. So…
-Did you happen to see my wings?

33
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,791
I was hiding them.

34
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,416
You got me… Ouch.

35
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,125
Hello?

36
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,250
Hiro?

37
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,250
Hello?

38
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,791
Hiro?

39
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,208
Oh, boy. Sorry about that.

40
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,958
I hurt my back recently.

41
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,291
Oh, are you okay?

42
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,500
Man, I'm getting to that age. I hate it.

43
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,541
It's things like this
that can really ruin your mood.

44
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,000
I was thinking about this orchard's future
and started feeling blue.

45
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,875
It made me want to see your face.

46
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:05,458
But now that I've seen you,
I feel better. Mm-hmm.

47
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,208
You're the angel here.

48
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,083
Huh?

49
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,333
What's that?

50
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,625
Something wrong, Saeko?

51
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,250
What is it?

52
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,208
Saeko, what happened?

53
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,500
DID YOU SEE THIS?

54
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:42,250
Let's hear from the woman
who actually encountered the bear.

55
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,750
Sorry to bother you at a time like this.
Are you okay?

56
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,375
-Yes, I'm fine.
-Good.

57
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,041
What happened exactly?

58
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,833
Well, the area around me was dark,

59
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,250
but I made eye contact

60
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,166
and realized it was a bear.

61
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,625
You made eye contact? How far away was it?

62
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,041
I think it was around there.

63
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,708
About three meters away, I guess.

64
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,666
Three meters is quite close, isn't it?

65
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,125
I'm amazed you could fend it off
with just your eyes.

66
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,791
-Wow.
-How did it feel?

67
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,083
She beat a bear?

68
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,583
-Yuma!
-It was scary.

69
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,333
Come on, it's time for school.

70
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,833
My body was frozen.

71
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:24,958
I see.

72
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,166
How big would you say it was?

73
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,416
How big? Well…

74
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,166
-Was it big?
-Come on.

75
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,291
You'll be late.

76
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,500
Come over here!

77
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,000
-What is it?
-Do bears…

78
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,041
-The TV.
-…often appear in residential areas?

79
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,541
Well, um…

80
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,875
-Saeko?
-For real?

81
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,916
Do they? I think it's a first.

82
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm not sure though.

83
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,583
-I see. The street is quite deserted.
-Saeko…

84
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,166
-What were you doing?
-What's with those track pants?

85
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,500
-Well…
-Right?

86
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,208
-Is Saeko okay?
-I guess I was jogging?

87
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,208
SAEKO:
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A BIT TODAY?

88
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,041
Can I go now?

89
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,541
Hello.

90
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,750
Oh, hello.

91
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,250
Are you okay?

92
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,416
Oh, are you referring
to the bear incident?

93
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,583
Yes, um, that's right.

94
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,583
The bear incident.

95
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,250
I was worried.

96
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,541
-About the bear?
-Yes.

97
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,875
No, wait.

98
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why would I be worried about the bear?

99
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,208
You know,

100
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,250
I'm kinda relieved.

101
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,541
Relieved?

102
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:43,125
We're supposed to feel
really awkward right now, aren't we?

103
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,500
After what happened last night.

104
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,291
I mean, it was on your mind too, right?

105
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,083
Like, "How should I act
the next time we meet?"

106
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,416
I bet you had a serious look on your face.

107
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,166
But now… right?

108
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,958
Yes, well…

109
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,125
I guess you could say

110
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,083
the shock caused
the awkwardness to fly away.

111
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,958
Were you surprised
by my tacky track pants?

112
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,083
No, I didn't really notice them.

113
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:29,000
You know, I thought
I was going to die right there.

114
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,583
From a bear attack.

115
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,041
Right.

116
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,166
I didn't want to die in those clothes

117
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,333
or get transported in them.

118
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,125
"Why do I have to die in these,
after all the money I spent on fashion?"

119
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,000
"This is unacceptable!"

120
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,500
I see.

121
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,458
It seems…

122
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,250
we've met before.

123
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,000
And we never noticed.

124
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:06,958
Yes.

125
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,833
So it seems.

126
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,208
I was surprised when I saw the boots.

127
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,416
Seriously, it's all just…

128
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,541
Even if this is fate,

129
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:27,125
it's totally unclear
what it entails or where it's headed.

130
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,416
That's true.

131
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,750
Are you okay?

132
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, yes.

133
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,333
I'm completely fine.

134
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,666
I see.

135
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,041
Yes.

136
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:59,875
I'm not going to meet with you anymore,

137
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:01,833
Mr. Naruse.

138
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,541
What?

139
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,625
This is just too hard for me,
in a lot of ways.

140
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,958
Here's how I honestly feel.

141
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,625
I'm getting more and more confused

142
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,958
about this relationship.

143
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,833
My whole life, I never fell for anyone
as hard as I did for Yusuke.

144
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,708
I loved him.

145
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,333
Even now, I still love him.

146
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,041
Right.

147
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:43,208
The Yusuke who passed away
is alive in your body.

148
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,541
He's not only alive,

149
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,250
but his soul,
or rather his memories, are still there.

150
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,708
Yusuke is definitely there.

151
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,125
And so, I want to see him.

152
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,083
Of course I do.

153
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,083
After all, he's in there.

154
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,833
But…

155
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,541
My mind's a mess now.

156
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,416
Do I want to see Yusuke,
or do I want to see you?

157
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Do I like Yusuke, or do I like you?

158
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,375
We ended up kissing and almost had sex,
but we couldn't in the end.

159
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:31,958
I'm sorry.

160
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,500
But I feel like…

161
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,583
I can't do this anymore.

162
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,916
I'm at my limit.

163
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,541
I don't want to get tossed around
or become an awful woman.

164
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,708
At this rate,
I'll want to be with you forever.

165
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,958
But I don't think that's right.

166
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,916
After all, you have a family.

167
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,833
I have absolutely no desire
to mess with that.

168
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,500
But then, I wonder about what you think

169
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,166
and how you feel about me.

170
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,000
Are you nice to me because you're Yusuke

171
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,416
or because you're Mr. Naruse?

172
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,916
When I think about how you feel,
rather than Yusuke,

173
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,208
I feel like I'm going crazy.

174
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,625
My mind shuts down
when it gets overloaded.

175
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,041
On top of that, I even ran across a bear.

176
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,666
Until I got here…

177
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,000
I was planning on lying to you today.

178
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,750
"I love Yusuke,

179
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,541
but I don't love you,
so I won't meet with you anymore."

180
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,125
I planned to say that

181
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,416
and distance myself from you.

182
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,500
But that's a lie…

183
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,791
and I don't want
to lie to you, Mr. Naruse.

184
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,291
Our relationship was an odd one,

185
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,000
but it was fun.

186
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,916
And I'm thankful.

187
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:27,041
I don't want those moments
to become a lie.

188
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,208
It's your fault
for being a bit nice and charming.

189
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,208
Anyway, I can't do this anymore.

190
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,041
Sorry for not making much sense.

191
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,375
I'm sorry.

192
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,625
It made sense to me.

193
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,500
And that's that.

194
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,958
Thank you for everything.

195
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,666
Bye, Yusuke.

196
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:28,375
Please… take good care of Yusuke.

197
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,208
Excuse me, Midori.

198
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,375
Do you have time?
I want your advice on something.

199
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,291
What is it?

200
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,166
Oh, wow.

201
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,958
You say you want advice,

202
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,541
but your face
says you've made up your mind.

203
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:45,750
What?

204
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,958
I love when women make that face.

205
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,583
It's beautiful.

206
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:57,333
But as the CEO, I get the feeling
I won't like what you have to say.

207
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,041
Let's see…

208
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,000
How should we do this?

209
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,875
Want to treat me to lunch, perhaps?

210
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:08,875
I do.

211
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,333
I see.

212
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,000
Got it.

213
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,291
Thank you.

214
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,083
What are you up for?

215
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,750
Mr. Shinoda.

216
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,666
Hi there.

217
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,791
Hey, which would you choose?

218
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,166
I like this one.

219
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:02,916
I knew it.

220
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,375
-Hey.
-Yes?

221
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,333
-Time to roast them.
-I'll get ready now.

222
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,500
I'll be your new point person.

223
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:29,541
I'm Kashiwagi from Akane Inc.

224
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,583
Nice to meet you.

225
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,583
Nice to meet you. I'm Naruse.

226
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,500
What a nice café area.

227
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,916
Thank you. Your company was a huge help.

228
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,125
Um…

229
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,041
Yes?

230
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,666
Oh, it's nothing.

231
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,125
-I look forward to working with you.
-Me too.

232
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,083
Nice to meet you.

233
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,791
I'm your new point person.

234
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,958
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

235
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,083
What is this? This is so cool!

236
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,833
It is, isn't it?

237
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,250
-Huh?
-What?

238
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,333
We won't get to live
a whole life together.

239
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:18,666
I'm sorry.

240
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,416
What…

241
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,041
What should I do?

242
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,833
Yusuke, what do you want to do…

243
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,500
with the time we have left?

244
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:10,666
All right.

245
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,291
Welcome.

246
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,166
Do you know where Saeko is?

247
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:35,375
I don't.

248
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,291
What is it?

249
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:55,750
Well…

250
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:01,000
I really need to talk
to her about something.

251
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:03,291
I see.

252
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:05,500
Could you tell me?

253
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:09,750
Please.

254
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,916
I really need to tell her something.

255
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:19,833
Maybe you should just forget about Saeko.

256
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,750
She chose to stop seeing you, right?

257
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,000
Yes.

258
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:29,208
Then isn't that enough?

259
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,416
For her sake.

260
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,041
Just leave her be.

261
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,166
Please tell me.

262
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,916
You told me before

263
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,083
that it feels like

264
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,375
you bring trouble just by being alive.

265
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,125
You don't have to feel that way.

266
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,250
Or rather, you should
stop feeling that way.

267
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,250
I think that you being alive

268
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:06,791
probably brings happiness
to a lot of people.

269
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:09,916
So…

270
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:14,125
please relax and live your life.

271
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,291
Thank you.

272
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,666
But…

273
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,083
That won't work for me.

274
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:56,708
Hey…

275
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:03,166
The train on Platform Five
will arrive momentarily.

276
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:34,041
The train bound for
New Chitose Airport will soon depart.

277
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:37,083
Please be sure to board on time.

278
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,500
The doors will now close.
Please stand clear--

279
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:55,916
