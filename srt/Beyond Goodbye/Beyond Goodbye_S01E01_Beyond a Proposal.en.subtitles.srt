1
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,666
By the way, where are we headed?

2
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:25,416
It's a secret.

3
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,666
-Why?
-You'll see when we get there.

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,583
Man, I hate stuff like this.

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
I can't even order omakase sushi.
I want to choose for myself.

6
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,875
So, where are we headed?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,375
It's a secret.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,833
I'm getting off.

9
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,041
You can't.

10
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,916
You can't get off.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,291
Hey, you need to enjoy life more.

12
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,291
Surprises make life fun.

13
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,541
No, that's not always true.

14
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,833
-You're so tense.
-Do you even know what "life" is?

15
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:06,291
Come on, let's be a bit more relaxed.

16
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,833
Okay?

17
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,875
That's why I'm here.

18
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,541
To soften you up, Saeko.

19
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,375
Well, that's true.

20
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,125
You're my softener, Yusuke.

21
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:26,958
-Oh, put that there.
-Got it.

22
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,750
-Fastening it now.
-Okay.

23
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,375
Great, I've been waiting. Thanks!

24
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,291
So, where are we going?

25
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,416
Fine, but only the location.

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,333
Okay.

27
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:42,416
We're going

28
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,208
over the mountain.

29
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,041
The highlands.

30
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,958
Oh, really?

31
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,250
And what's over there?

32
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,208
You'll find out soon.

33
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,916
It seemed like
the perfect place to propose.

34
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,250
What?

35
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,458
Huh?

36
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:07,916
You just…

37
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,750
What?

38
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,666
Huh?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,833
What?

40
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,208
Oh, man.

41
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,208
Oh, man.

42
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,250
Why did I say that?!

43
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,291
You want to marry me, huh?

44
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,791
You sure have guts.

45
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,291
You like a challenge.

46
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,208
What?

47
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:53,875
Thank you.

48
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,583
My answer is yes.

49
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,250
-Really?
-What?

50
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,750
For real?

51
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,958
No way!

52
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,958
This is great. I'm so happy!

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,041
I'm over the moon.

54
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,458
Thank you!

55
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,541
Thank you, God!

56
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,958
They'll reach the spot in 20 minutes!

57
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,083
-Okay!
-Okay!

58
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,416
Wait, what happens once we get married?

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,250
We're gonna live together!

60
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,500
There's this amazing house in the north

61
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,583
with these blue walls.

62
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,041
It's this cute, little thing.

63
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,166
I haven't settled on it or anything,

64
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,916
but I thought it
looked nice when I saw it.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,875
It's available too.

66
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,041
-Nice, let's go take a look.
-Okay.

67
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,208
Man, we're gonna have so much fun.

68
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,458
Having breakfast together every day
sounds great, right?

69
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,500
Hooray, I'm so excited!

70
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,166
Who'll make the coffee?

71
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,458
-Me.
-Me. No, it has to be me.

72
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,000
-Definitely me.
-No way.

73
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,375
It's better if I do it.

74
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,750
Hold on a second.

75
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,083
What?

76
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,916
Well, um…

77
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,416
The proposal.

78
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,333
Is it over already?

79
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,458
Yeah, I guess it's done.

80
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,708
What? Already?

81
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,458
What do we do?

82
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,583
Everyone, light them up!

83
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,666
-Light them?
-Light them!

84
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,166
-Already?!
-It's so early!

85
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,208
Oh, crap!

86
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,750
Hurry up!

87
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,250
Go!

88
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,833
Wow, look at that!

89
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,541
It's beautiful!

90
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,375
Wow, that's so pretty.

91
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,208
How nice.

92
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,833
Oh, wow.

93
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,166
Look.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,791
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

95
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,583
Congratulations!

96
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,583
Yusuke, I'm glad I met you.

97
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,041
I'm glad I met you, Saeko.

98
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, it's a miracle.

99
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,708
-It sure is.
-Yeah.

100
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,916
Miracles really do happen.

101
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,791
That’s what makes them miracles.

102
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:53,875
Yeah.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,625
OTARU CITY BUS

104
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,416
One rescue target confirmed.

105
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,166
-Begin rescue.
-Yes, sir.

106
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,958
-Can you hear me?
-Are you okay?

107
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,000
Can you hear me?

108
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,750
More rescue targets here!

109
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,666
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

110
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,500
Are you okay?

111
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:31,958
Can you hear my voice?

112
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,750
Can you hear me?

113
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,833
Can you hear me?

114
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,458
Okay, let's move them!

115
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:45,875
One, two, three.

116
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,375
There we go.

117
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,333
Can you hear me?

118
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,541
-Scissors.
-Here.

119
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:25,833
I've isolated it.

120
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,416
Let's begin.

121
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,416
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,875
Hello? Transport will begin soon.

123
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,208
Removing now.

124
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,875
-Ms. Sugawara?
-You can't touch that.

125
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,750
-Calm down!
-You'll hurt yourself!

126
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,333
Departing now.

127
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,083
-Ms. Sugawara!
-Are you okay?

128
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,875
Yusuke…

129
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,666
Ms. Sugawara, please calm down!

130
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,083
-Yusuke!
-Ms. Sugawara!

131
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,583
-Ms. Sugawara!
-Yusuke!

132
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,541
Yusuke…

133
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,750
Get the doctor.

134
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,708
Ms. Sugawara.

135
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,666
-Get the stretcher!
-Please.

136
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,458
Are you okay, Ms. Sugawara?

137
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,416
Are you okay?

138
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,375
Yusuke…

139
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,125
It's arrived.

140
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,041
-Begin trimming.
-Got it.

141
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,583
HIRO TREE FARM

142
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,416
Nice.

143
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:13,250
A LETTER OF GRATITUDE
TO THE DONOR'S FAMILY

144
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,291
Oh, no.

145
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,166
RANKOSHI STATION

146
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,458
I'm getting on!

147
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,208
Come on, wait for me.

148
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,541
Thank you for riding with us today.

149
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,375
Is there anyone without a ticket

150
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:44,208
or who needs to change
their destination and fare?

151
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,875
Is there anyone without a ticket…

152
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,416
Good morning, everyone!

153
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,916
Good morning!

154
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,958
Hi, Carlos.

155
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,791
Saeko, how have you been?

156
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,958
Great, thank you.

157
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,208
How are the fields?

158
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,833
Well, I was worried
because of the dry spell we were having,

159
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:50,000
but we got some proper rainfall
thanks to your rain dance, Saeko.

160
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,875
I knew it.

161
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,458
You're a goddess, Saeko.

162
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,458
Yes, all right.

163
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,708
Well then, shall we get to work?

164
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,958
Sounds good. Thank you.

165
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,625
Your Spanish has improved.

166
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,791
No, I still have a lot to learn.

167
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,250
That's for sure.

168
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,708
Yes.

169
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,500
Are you okay?

170
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,541
Yes, I'm fine.

171
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,666
Sorry, but I'll have
a lot of work for you.

172
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,125
Given how capable you are.

173
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,458
Is that okay?

174
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:36,958
Thank you!

175
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,291
Nothing's more satisfying than good work.

176
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:12,750
Saeko.

177
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,916
Guatemala's size and water content
are more consistent than last year.

178
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,541
Really? Great, thanks.

179
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,458
Mr. Shinoda, I hope
you're not slacking off.

180
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,041
Right back at you.

181
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:34,958
Hey.

182
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:36,875
Over here.

183
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:39,875
Ethiopia.

184
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,041
It's spicier than I expected.

185
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,666
Right?

186
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,875
Can you put the beans in?

187
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,958
Hello?

188
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,000
I just landed, so I'm heading over now.

189
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,791
Sorry, Saeko.

190
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,333
Hiro keeps saying
he wants to quit the farm

191
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,125
and that he wants to talk to you.

192
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,291
Right… I wonder what's wrong.

193
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,625
Anyway, I'm heading over.

194
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,500
Yes, I'll let you know
if there are any updates.

195
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,791
Yes, it'll be fine.

196
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,208
Bye.

197
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,333
Hiro.

198
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,791
Hiro!

199
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,083
Saeko!

200
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,041
-Hiro!
-Hey.

201
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,916
Don't trip.

202
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,833
Welcome back.

203
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,250
I've been waiting.

204
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,291
I heard you're concerned about work.

205
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,833
So, what happened?

206
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,625
-You can tell me anything.
-Well…

207
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,291
It's nothing.

208
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,833
Everything's going well. Nothing's wrong.

209
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:03,958
What?

210
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,708
I found out about Yusuke.

211
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,333
It's a sad thing.

212
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,708
So I wanted to see you.

213
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
I thought coming to Hawaii
would do you good.

214
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,666
These plains…

215
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,916
The wind and sky… will surely

216
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,791
give you strength and good fortune.

217
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,916
That's how I felt.

218
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:46,375
Yeah.

219
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,500
When I spoke with my wife at her grave,

220
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,000
she said to call you over.

221
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:57,583
But it's not that easy,
since you have work and all.

222
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,458
And it's not cheap.

223
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:02,625
That's why…

224
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:11,708
I lied and told them
I wanted to talk to you about work.

225
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,708
What?

226
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,625
You got here on the company's dime, right?

227
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,166
All right.

228
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,791
For real?

229
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,291
Come on, Hiro.

230
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,416
All right then.

231
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,375
Let's get going.

232
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,000
We have a proposal for you.

233
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:39,916
FOUR YEARS AGO

234
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,250
We promise to bring your farm
even greater happiness and abundance.

235
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,666
You make wonderful coffee,

236
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,833
but your current distribution method
doesn't do it justice. It's a waste.

237
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:51,916
So, here's our plan.

238
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,125
Sorry, not interested.

239
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,041
Wait a second,
I haven't told you anything yet.

240
00:23:56,125 --> 00:24:00,083
We can distribute your coffee
at a price you can agree with, and…

241
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,833
I'm not doing this for the money.

242
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,750
That's not what I meant.

243
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:11,666
Go home.

244
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,958
Please, let me finish.

245
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,666
Actually, I--

246
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,708
Go home.

247
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,333
I'm done listening.

248
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,083
Please wait.

249
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,833
I'm begging you.

250
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,000
Please hear me out.

251
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,708
My late wife and I

252
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,375
spent 40 years building up this farm.

253
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,625
I don't plan on changing a thing.

254
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,291
My answer won't change.

255
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,291
Sorry, but give up.

256
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:32,500
Want me to tell you
what you need most right now?

257
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,500
Huh?

258
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,125
So, what's your name?

259
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,708
My name…

260
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:48,416
Hypothetically,

261
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,583
let's say it's Saeko for now.

262
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,458
My name is Yusuke.

263
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:57,416
That's not hypothetical.
It's really Yusuke.

264
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:05,541
You're probably upset over
something bad or sad that happened.

265
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,791
So, why not have some coffee
and settle down first?

266
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:11,625
Drinking coffee might not fix the problem,

267
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,083
but taking a breather

268
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:16,500
can make your situation
seem a little less overbearing.

269
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,708
You'll think, "It's okay. It'll work out."

270
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:23,250
It can also help you see new things
or find beauty you didn't notice before.

271
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:27,541
Coffee has that kind of power.
Did you know that?

272
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,625
What you need right now

273
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,750
is probably… coffee.

274
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:41,666
So, what's your dream?

275
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,250
My dream?

276
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,041
You want to know my dream all of a sudden?

277
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,750
To live a cool life
and become happier than anyone.

278
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,375
To live a fulfilling life with good taste.

279
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,541
To actually contribute
to society through my work.

280
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:06,833
And…

281
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
to find a man who'll fall
head over heels in love with me.

282
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:13,875
I could go on.

283
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,166
But what about you?

284
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,458
My dream is to be a softener.

285
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:23,541
What's that mean?

286
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,958
Well, softeners are a necessity,
aren't they?

287
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,375
Without them, the world feels all coarse.

288
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,875
It's the same with coffee.

289
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,916
It's kind of a softener too.

290
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,833
What?

291
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,500
Thank you for the coffee.

292
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,291
What do you want?

293
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,458
I thought you left.

294
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,708
I didn't finish what I came to say.

295
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,208
Please hear me out until the end.

296
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,583
Forget about the contract.

297
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,166
Just listen to my story, please.

298
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:40,958
The work at my last company

299
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,583
was so hard that it broke me
mentally and physically.

300
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:48,083
I couldn't take it,
so I quit and went on a solo trip.

301
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,291
To this island.

302
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,958
I was fed up with everything.

303
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,625
What saved me then

304
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,083
was the cup of coffee
I had at a small café.

305
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,291
It was so good,

306
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:07,541
I couldn't believe
something that tasty existed.

307
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,375
It was so good, it even made me laugh.

308
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,708
That's when I decided
I wanted to keep living.

309
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:19,375
The barista there told me
that the coffee came from this farm.

310
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:22,916
Then, I went back to Japan

311
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:25,708
and joined a company
that works with coffee.

312
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:31,791
I thought I could help people
going through tough or trying times.

313
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:36,500
Since then, I've wanted to
thank you properly one day,

314
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,500
and I knew your coffee
could find even greater recognition.

315
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,541
That's why I'm here.

316
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,250
I wanted to be of help.

317
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:50,250
But I'm not in it for the money either,
so I'll stop talking about business.

318
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,791
For now, let's just
harvest as much as we can.

319
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,208
I'll pick berries too.

320
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,208
What?

321
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,500
Don't be ridiculous.

322
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,458
I don't budge once I've made up my mind.

323
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,750
Sorry, just give up.

324
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,333
Fine, then.

325
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,083
And who's that guy?

326
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:18,708
My thoughts exactly.

327
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,333
Oh, well, I…

328
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,250
I've put my hat in the ring
as a potential suitor.

329
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:31,250
I see.

330
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,916
I… see.

331
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,708
And so, I'll be helping out too.

332
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,833
I don't have a job right now,
so it's totally fine.

333
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:41,916
I'll be in your care.

334
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,333
Give me a break.

335
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:46,750
Give me a break.

336
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45,916
There we go.

337
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,291
I'll say it again.

338
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,625
Just as I thought, your coffee

339
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,375
is the best.

340
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,583
Well, I think so too.

341
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,125
It's the best in the world.
No doubt about it.

342
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,625
-Whoa!
-Woo-hoo!

343
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,000
This is amazing!

344
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,333
Woo-hoo!

345
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,083
Wow.

346
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:16,083
You doing okay?

347
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,291
Yeah, I'm good.

348
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,583
Okay.

349
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:25,041
-Wow.
-Incredible.

350
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,041
-Okay.
-A photo, eh?

351
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,875
-I can't press it.
-Oh, okay. Got it.

352
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,250
-All right. Thanks.
-Sure.

353
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,166
It's so good.
Hey, there's something inside.

354
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,958
Aren't you a bit close?

355
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:48,500
-You're too slow.
-You're too close.

356
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,750
I can just go for it, right?

357
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,666
Whoa.

358
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,083
Wow, this is nice.

359
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,708
Hey, look at this.

360
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,708
Wait for me.

361
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,125
Whoa. They're swimming!

362
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,833
-You're right.
-Looks refreshing.

363
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,250
I bet it feels good.

364
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,333
Hey. Hold on.

365
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,833
Don't do anything crazy.

366
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,875
You scared me.

367
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:18,208
But you know, I'm going to keep my name,
my age, and where I Iive a secret.

368
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:20,458
And I won't ask.

369
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:22,250
So…

370
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,208
I'm simply "Saeko."

371
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,208
Why?

372
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:33,000
I mean, we met when I was at a low point.
And it was abroad, to boot.

373
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,625
I know it sounds like fate and all,

374
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,250
but I hate stuff like that.

375
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,791
I don't want to get caught up in things,

376
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:46,958
so let's just have fun in the moment
while we're on this vacation.

377
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,041
Got it?

378
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:49,916
Got it.

379
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,291
-I'm fine.
-You're walking like this.

380
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,083
Drunk Saeko.

381
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,541
-Now then…
-I'm totally normal.

382
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,500
Come on.

383
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,333
You're so slow.

384
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,666
Wow, I'm beat.

385
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,000
Good night.

386
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,000
Good night.

387
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,458
Good night.

388
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:30,833
Good night.

389
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,916
-Which room?
-Which room?

390
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,000
Yours?

391
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:06,375
You're right.

392
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,958
You are a softener.

393
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,708
You want to cuddle me?

394
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,375
I do now.

395
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,125
I'm positive we'll meet again someday.

396
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,166
Why's that?

397
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:58,750
Well, even if you get further
and further away from my sight,

398
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,708
you'll always make your way back to me.

399
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,166
After all,

400
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:08,875
the world is round.

401
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,000
Are you for real?

402
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:17,833
When we meet again somewhere,
then it'll be fate.

403
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,041
You have to give up and be my girlfriend.

404
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,666
Promise me.

405
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:26,083
Sure, I'll be your girlfriend.

406
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,333
I promise.

407
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,375
Excuse me. Where is the owner?

408
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,666
Oh, he's inside.

409
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,625
Thank you.

410
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,416
Excuse me.

411
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,375
I'm Sugawara from Akane Inc.

412
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:20,250
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Sugawara.

413
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,375
You asked to do
a coffee collaboration with us, right?

414
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:28,041
Yes, I just really want
to serve delicious coffee.

415
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:30,583
Oh, I love projects like that.

416
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,250
I know we'll do great. Leave it to me--

417
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:36,875
Huh?

418
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,333
Yusuke.

419
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:52,666
I knew we'd meet again, Saeko.

420
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:01,500
Do you remember

421
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,833
our promise?

422
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,208
I remember.

423
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Wait. How?

424
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,708
Stuff like this really happens?

425
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,333
I mean, I…

426
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,375
regretted it so much.

427
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,416
I left like it was nothing,
but I missed you.

428
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,958
But I only knew your name!
I kept kicking myself.

429
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,875
Don't laugh!

430
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:00,291
Yusuke!

431
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:06,958
This world is so boring
without you, Yusuke!

432
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,000
Oh, sorry.

433
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:46,666
To the one who reads this letter.

434
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:52,750
The rules say I cannot share my name.

435
00:46:55,041 --> 00:47:00,750
I'm not sure how to put
my current feelings into words.

436
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:07,125
All I can do is be grateful
for the life I've received

437
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,083
and keep living on.

438
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,041
And I pray

439
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:18,041
that whoever is reading this letter

440
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:21,375
will find happiness.

441
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,833
If it's within my power,

442
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:29,375
I would even like to come to your aid.

443
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,083
I apologize for writing such things.

444
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:40,541
My heart can't help but feel this way.

445
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:19,875
