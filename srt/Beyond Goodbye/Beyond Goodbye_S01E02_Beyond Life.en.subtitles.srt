00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:24,208
OTARU GENERAL HOSPITAL

2
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,416
Kazu.

3
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,916
You can see fireworks right now.

4
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,250
What?

5
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,041
See?

6
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,708
You're right.

7
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,416
-That's odd for this time of the year.
-Yeah, that's true.

8
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,416
They're so far away.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,458
And small.

10
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,208
I wonder where they're coming from.

11
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,666
I think it's around Mt. Misato.

12
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,375
Makes sense.

13
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,833
This is nice.

14
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,041
Fireworks sure are great.

15
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,666
I wonder if they're celebrating something.

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,333
Maybe so.

17
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,875
Yeah, that has to be it.

18
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,166
Congratulations!

19
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,083
Let's go see the fireworks again
in the summer, okay?

20
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,083
Sorry.

21
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,458
Why are you apologizing?

22
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,916
The summer fireworks

23
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,833
will probably be hard for me.

24
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,000
I can tell.

25
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,375
I have faith.

26
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,416
I know you'll be fine.

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,791
You'll live, Kazu.

28
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,166
And then, you'll go
to the fireworks show with me.

29
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,458
I see. I'm going, huh?

30
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, you're going.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,791
How about an apple? I brought some.

32
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,916
I'll have one too.

33
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,791
No, I'm not really…

34
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,208
What?

35
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,583
I'll eat one. I want to.

36
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,083
I was just craving an apple.

37
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,416
This is great.

38
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,833
Hooray, I win.

39
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,833
Hey, what do you want to do
when you get better?

40
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,500
Well…

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,833
Diving.

42
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,416
Like skydiving.

43
00:02:58,958 --> 00:02:59,958
Or bungee jumping.

44
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,000
That's bad for your heart.

45
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,083
Just say you want to go on a trip with me.

46
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,041
Right.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,416
Yeah, a trip sounds great.

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,333
Where to?

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,208
Maybe somewhere warm. How does that sound?

50
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,541
Yeah, that sounds nice.

51
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,666
Hey, this tastes good.

52
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,000
Right? I picked the good ones.

53
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,791
Just what I'd expect
from a former Miss Apple.

54
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,291
Oh, wow.

55
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,500
MISS APPLE

56
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,125
Oh, what a lovely smell.

57
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,083
There we go.

58
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,875
I'm back.

59
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,000
Welcome home.

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,000
Hey, how do you do this?

61
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,750
How was Mr. Naruse?

62
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,083
Hm? He was as handsome as ever.

63
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,333
Hey, be serious.

64
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,458
I see. He was handsome, huh?

65
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,916
-Glad to hear it.
-Yeah.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,708
Man, he really was handsome.

67
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,875
Come on.

68
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,708
When is he coming home?

69
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,458
Well, I'm not sure. Why?

70
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,708
I want someone to help me with school,

71
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,541
but he's the only one
in this family who can teach me.

72
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,041
What?

73
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,833
Hey, are you saying we're all idiots?

74
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,458
Gee, sorry.

75
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,416
I'll tell him to hurry home,
or else your brain will turn to mush.

76
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,333
Thank you.

77
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,916
Yeah, make sure you tell him.

78
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,458
-I'm sorry.
-I can help too!

79
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,500
We should be the ones apologizing.

80
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,833
Nice colors this year.

81
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:05,875
Yeah, this is great.

82
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:06,916
Mm-hmm.

83
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,083
Hello? Naruse speaking.

84
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,333
Yeah.

85
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,208
You've got this.

86
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,750
It's a sign from God. Telling you to live.

87
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,666
Yeah.

88
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,041
It's arrived.

89
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,125
-Begin trimming.
-Got it.

90
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,208
Ischemia time?

91
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,791
An hour and forty minutes.

92
00:07:58,875 --> 00:07:59,708
Okay.

93
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,000
Kazu.

94
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,541
Can you hear us?

95
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,125
Kazu?

96
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,500
Kazu.

97
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,166
I'm glad…

98
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,750
to see you again.

99
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,666
Are you feeling okay?

100
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,916
Yeah, I'm okay.

101
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,458
My body feels comfortable.

102
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,500
It's so much lighter.

103
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,625
Oh, really?

104
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,666
Dad, they're back.

105
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,125
Huh? Oh.

106
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,541
I'm back.

107
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,458
Welcome home!

108
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,500
-Welcome home!
-Uncle!

109
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,416
Hey, Yuma!

110
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,291
You've gotten bigger!

111
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,416
-Sure did!
-Welcome home!

112
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,250
Hi, everyone.

113
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,625
Sorry for worrying you all.

114
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,166
-So relieved.
-Let's go.

115
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,333
-Come inside.
-Go on.

116
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,416
-My luggage.
-I'll bring it.

117
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,375
-Tomo, come help.
-I'll do it.

118
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,208
-Are you sure, Dad?
-It's fine.

119
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,041
-It's heavy.
-What's in here? You carry it.

120
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,083
I'll bring it!

121
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,833
-You sure? Be careful.
-I'll be fine.

122
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:23,833
Hold it steady.

123
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,625
-In the middle.
-I know.

124
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,791
Ta-da!

125
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,833
-Oh, wow!
-Make some room.

126
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,416
-That's so cute.
-Let's eat.

127
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,250
Okay, time to choose drinks.
Who wants coffee?

128
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,458
-Me.
-Me.

129
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,041
-Here.
-One, two, three…

130
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,333
Wait. Don't you hate coffee?

131
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,250
Oh, right.

132
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,125
Strange. I suddenly have a craving for it.

133
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,666
What did the doctor say?

134
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,375
Well, I'm sure it's fine.

135
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,250
As long as it's not alcohol.

136
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,333
-I want coffee too.
-Here.

137
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,833
-You, Yuma?
-Coffee?

138
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,166
I bet it's still too bitter for you.

139
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,500
I'll pour some then.

140
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,750
Blech!

141
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,541
See, I told you so!

142
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,250
-It's bitter.
-Okay, Yuma, here's your juice.

143
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,250
-Woo-hoo.
-Woo-hoo.

144
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,791
Bitter, right?

145
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,083
It's good.

146
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,916
It tastes good.

147
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,500
-What?!
-Yeah.

148
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,541
How are you feeling? Tired?

149
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,500
Oh, thanks.

150
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:09,333
I'm doing okay right now. Totally fine.

151
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,625
But,

152
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,541
it feels a bit odd.

153
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:22,208
It's like my body
hasn't accepted this heart yet.

154
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,625
No, it's more like this heart

155
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,791
hasn't accepted my body.

156
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,541
It's like someone else is here.

157
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,666
It's a strange feeling.

158
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,916
I see.

159
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,833
Yeah.

160
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,416
But I can't believe
how much energy I have.

161
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,041
I feel unstoppable.

162
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,958
That's good to hear.

163
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,833
Thanks for everything.

164
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,208
Sure.

165
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:11,541
I can get back to work
once my doctor approves it, right?

166
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:12,958
Yeah.

167
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,875
It's a good thing you had faith
in the future and asked for leave,

168
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,833
instead of quitting.

169
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,833
Thank you.

170
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,416
Before that, should we go on a trip?

171
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,291
Now you're talking!

172
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,666
And…

173
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,625
I hope

174
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,041
we can have kids one day.

175
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,333
-So many people, huh?
-Yeah.

176
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,041
Oh, I'll be right back.

177
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,833
Sure. I'll be upstairs.

178
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,750
Okay.

179
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,416
That was incredible.

180
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,166
You can play, huh?

181
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,625
Kazu.

182
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,750
Let's go, okay?

183
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,083
Let's go.

184
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,291
Yeah.

185
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,291
Are you nervous?

186
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,416
It's been a while, after all.

187
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,083
It sure has.

188
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah.

189
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,791
It'll be fine.

190
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,083
Yeah.

191
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,041
NISEKO STATION

192
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,250
Thanks. I'll do my best.

193
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,583
Right, good luck.

194
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,125
But don't push yourself.
Call me on your way back.

195
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,833
Sure. I'll be off, then.

196
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,291
See you later.

197
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,458
Okay, everyone. Have a good day today.

198
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:04,375
And for those of you
who just finished work, good work today.

199
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,333
For those neither coming nor going
to work, thank you for riding.

200
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,125
This is Otaru Station.

201
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:39,750
OTARU UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION

202
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,416
Use this as an example.

203
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,750
Okay, thank you.

204
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,583
-Here.
-Thank you.

205
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:51,875
-Hello.
-Good afternoon.

206
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,958
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

207
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,500
Understood. Heading over now.

208
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,416
Building four? Got it.

209
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,083
I'll be right back.

210
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,333
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

211
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,500
Thanks for waiting!

212
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,958
Next person.

213
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,000
-Cutlet sandwich, please.
-Coming right up.

214
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,791
-Mayuka!
-Oh, sorry.

215
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:40,416
Mr. Naruse!

216
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,333
Hello.

217
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,500
-Thank you.
-Have a seat.

218
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,208
Um…

219
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,541
Sorry for causing so much trouble.

220
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,125
Not at all. Welcome back.

221
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,041
Yeah.

222
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,541
Wait. Are you drinking coffee, Mr. Naruse?

223
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,041
He really is.

224
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:09,208
Oh, I've somehow gained a taste for it.

225
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,791
-Oh, wow.
-I see.

226
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:11,708
Yeah.

227
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:19,041
A lot of students have been requesting
that we build a café here.

228
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,958
They've asked
the Student Affairs Division.

229
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,500
A café, huh?

230
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,000
Sounds nice.

231
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,458
Yeah.

232
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,958
Hi, it's Akane Inc.

233
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,458
I'm here.

234
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:02,000
So, here are
the Guatemala Antigua washed beans.

235
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,250
And these are the natural beans.

236
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,041
Wow, thank you so much.

237
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,250
-How are they?
-Really nice.

238
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,083
I guarantee it.

239
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:17,208
Then I ran through the airport,
like in the movies, yelling "Yusuke!"

240
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:18,541
Wow.

241
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,416
Even though it couldn't be him.

242
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:25,791
Well, knowing Yusuke, I feel like
he could be out there somewhere.

243
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:27,958
You're right.

244
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,000
But still, I wonder what that was.

245
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,000
-What about you, Kengo?
-What?

246
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,333
How are you?

247
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,833
I'm managing.

248
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,875
We have to get used to living
in a world without Yusuke.

249
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,416
As boring as it may be.

250
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:54,250
Yeah.

251
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,875
-Oh, right.
-Hm?

252
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,458
I got a thank-you letter.

253
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,250
The person who received Yusuke's heart

254
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,625
sent a thank-you letter or something.

255
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,708
Oh, they do that?

256
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,291
Yeah, without revealing
either side's identity.

257
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,666
But it was a really nice letter.

258
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,625
They seem like a really great person.

259
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,166
I see.

260
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,125
Yeah.

261
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:30,500
It made me kind of happy.

262
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:41,000
It's nice that it went
to a good person, right?

263
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,833
-I guess so.
-Yeah.

264
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,833
What a relief.

265
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,958
They seem pretty nice.

266
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,250
I see.

267
00:27:58,541 --> 00:27:59,375
Yeah.

268
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,958
Could I ask you to water the plants?

269
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,291
Of course. My pleasure.

270
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:27,000
After all, Hawaii always gets
rain in the afternoon, right?

271
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,750
This seems about right.

272
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,625
Here's where your late lover's
café-owning best friend

273
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:43,708
would say that the best way to get over
an old love is to find new love.

274
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,333
What a cliché.

275
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,500
Why don't you give love a go?

276
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:53,291
I haven't totally written off love, but…

277
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,583
Oh, really?

278
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,958
Tell me more.
What kind of man do you want?

279
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,375
Let's see…

280
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,583
A guy who's always
on the lookout for something fun.

281
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,708
One who always looks at the positive side
of things, unlike me.

282
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,000
He'd also be dumb in a cute way.

283
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:15,708
He'd never be able to keep
important stuff to himself.

284
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,166
And he'd be head over heels
in love with me.

285
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,125
You're just describing Yusuke.

286
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,125
You're right. Oh, no!

287
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:26,958
Oh, no!

288
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,083
That's enough.

289
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,833
To the person who wrote the letter.

290
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:39,666
It seems I'm allowed to respond,
so I'm writing back to you.

291
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,666
Thank you for the letter.

292
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,666
Your words gave me so much joy.

293
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,625
I read them multiple times a day.

294
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,541
TO THE ONE WHO READS THIS LETTER

295
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,125
They never fail to comfort me.

296
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,416
They give me strength.

297
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,833
Thank you.

298
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:14,416
Your letter will be a treasure to me.

299
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,958
How is your body doing?

300
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:26,250
Is my loved one's heart working well?

301
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:31,583
Apparently I'm not supposed to
write stuff like this,

302
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:36,708
but I get the feeling that the heart
might be a bit mischievous.

303
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,000
Has it been giving you any trouble?

304
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,208
I hope…

305
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:54,750
I hope from the bottom of my heart

306
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,541
that you live a healthy life.

307
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,541
I don't believe we'll ever meet,

308
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,625
but let's both keep doing our best.

309
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,000
Take care.

310
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,083
Goodbye.

311
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,708
Welcome back.

312
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,041
Thanks.

313
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,583
-I'm back.
-Good work today.

314
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,625
What's wrong?

315
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:02,750
It's just…

316
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:08,833
I'm so full of happiness.

317
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,083
What?

318
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:18,916
I got off at the station,
and your car was outside to pick me up.

319
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,208
You greeted me with a smile,

320
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,708
saying, "Good work today."

321
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,958
That face of yours…

322
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:30,791
was so cute.

323
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,333
It made me think,
"Man, I really love her,"

324
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,583
and I realized how lucky I am.

325
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:44,708
It made me glad that I got healthy again.

326
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,541
Yeah, like that.

327
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,541
I'm glad to hear it.

328
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,291
Yeah.

329
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:56,166
I'm glad.

330
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:00,208
How about

331
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,416
we take a detour?

332
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:03,916
What?

333
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,250
Sure.

334
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,458
We apologize.

335
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,708
We've received word that the tracks
up ahead have been suspended.

336
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:00,833
We will stop briefly.

337
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,916
What? Suspended?

338
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,583
What happened?

339
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,041
Seriously?

340
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,041
We apologize.

341
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:21,833
Please be patient.

342
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:24,000
Apparently, we can't move past here.

343
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,250
My apologies.

344
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,875
You may wait
on the platform if you'd like.

345
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,291
How long will it take?

346
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,958
They're heading over now,
so they don't know yet. I'm sorry.

347
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,666
We'll update you when we can.

348
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,041
You have no idea?

349
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,708
-So inconvenient.
-We apologize.

350
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:40,791
I'm sorry.

351
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,708
It's all right.

352
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:47,666
What?

353
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,291
I was thinking of making some coffee.

354
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,625
Can I help?

355
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,083
What?

356
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,708
Oh, thank you.

357
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:49,416
Well, in that case,
maybe you could help with…

358
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,000
Oh, I'll do this.

359
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,125
Okay, thank you.

360
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,333
This is nice.

361
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,250
I agree.

362
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:07,208
I bought all this just yesterday.

363
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,375
The moment I saw it, it just felt right.

364
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,541
I didn't expect to use it
like this though.

365
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,833
But I thought coffee sounded nice

366
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,458
at a time like this.

367
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,833
You know, since everyone's so annoyed.

368
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,166
Oh, right.

369
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,583
Yeah.

370
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:39,875
Drinking coffee might not fix the problem.

371
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,000
But…

372
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,833
But taking a breather

373
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:50,708
can make your situation
seem a little less overbearing.

374
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,583
You'll think, "It's okay, it'll work out."

375
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:57,791
It can also help you see new things

376
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,958
or find beauty you didn't notice before.

377
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:10,500
I feel like coffee has that kind of power.

378
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:14,833
Coffee has that kind of power.
Did you know that?

379
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:17,583
Don't you agree?

380
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,791
Yes, you might be right.

381
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:23,500
Yeah.

382
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,000
I think so.
