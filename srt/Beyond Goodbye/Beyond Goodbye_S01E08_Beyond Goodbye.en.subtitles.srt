1
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,666
I'm back.

2
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:28,916
I'm back.

3
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,708
Hey, welcome back.

4
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:36,333
But you know, I can never get used to it.

5
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:40,000
Seeing my face wherever I look.

6
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,125
Get used to it.

7
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,041
We're getting even more Hiro merch.

8
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:44,958
Oh.

9
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,000
How was the bank?

10
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,708
It was fine. Leave the negotiating to me.

11
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,500
I'm impressed.

12
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,333
Whenever I go, it always ends in a fight.

13
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:00,125
Hiro, only two kinds
of people exist to you.

14
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:05,541
Those you love who always get their way,
and those you hate who you always oppose.

15
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:10,166
But you do realize that most people
in the world are neither, right?

16
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,000
You sure have a way with words.

17
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,458
Well, it's my job.

18
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,375
Phew.

19
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,500
Will you be okay?

20
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:25,500
I won't be here forever.
You know that, right?

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,250
I do.

22
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:31,791
Coffees all over the world
are waiting for you to discover them.

23
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,291
Exactly.

24
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,583
I can hear them calling out to me.

25
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,541
But are you okay, Saeko?

26
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,500
I heard you drink too much sometimes.
That you get rowdy and burst into tears.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,500
Sounds rough.

28
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,541
Who told you that?

29
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,166
What?

30
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,541
Everyone.

31
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,458
"Everyone"?

32
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,708
Yeah.

33
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,500
"Everyone"?

34
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,833
I see.

35
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,791
Let's see here.

36
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,250
Hello?

37
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,458
Yes, this is Sugawara.

38
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,041
I've been here before.

39
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,916
Or rather, Yusuke has.

40
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,666
Why are you here?

41
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,625
Sorry for dropping by unannounced.

42
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,875
Please let me stay for just three days.

43
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:02,875
What?

44
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,625
I'm not here as Naruse,

45
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,000
but as Yusuke Nakamachi.

46
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,375
Sorry, I don't understand.

47
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,125
Right, of course.

48
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,250
Do you remember that day

49
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,500
when you rambled on
without letting me speak, and then left?

50
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,041
Yes.

51
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,833
There was something
I wanted to tell you too.

52
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,125
Oh, I'm sorry for rambling on by myself.

53
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,291
No, it's fine.

54
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,083
Um, it's about my health.

55
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,291
Your health?

56
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,458
Oh, that must sound ominous.

57
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,875
But it's quite the opposite.

58
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,500
-The opposite?
-Yes.

59
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm incredibly healthy and healing well.

60
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,375
It seems I'm all better now.

61
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:56,458
My heart is doing really well,
and I'll probably live a long life.

62
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,625
Oh, that's great.

63
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:03,583
The signs of transplant rejection
are slowly going away.

64
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,916
So, that means…

65
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,791
that Yusuke's memories
will soon disappear completely.

66
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,791
He will truly

67
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,708
disappear from this world.

68
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,666
So, I came here

69
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:31,083
because I wanted you to spend time
with Yusuke before he's gone.

70
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,416
While we're here together,

71
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,333
please spend your final moments
with Yusuke.

72
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:44,250
Please say your goodbyes
so that you have no regrets.

73
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,541
Saeko.

74
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,041
Oh.

75
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:49,958
Everything okay?

76
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:50,875
Yeah.

77
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,708
Um, this is…

78
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,416
How about some coffee?

79
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,625
Of course, I believe you

80
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,375
about everything.

81
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,458
Isn't this great, Saeko?

82
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,083
So many people

83
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,541
suddenly part with those they love

84
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,500
and wish their whole lives

85
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,791
that they could've had a proper farewell.

86
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,041
Right.

87
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,333
The ones who leave
and the ones left behind

88
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,916
both feel this way.

89
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,708
This world is full of feelings like that.

90
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:13,083
But you get to say
a proper goodbye to Yusuke, right?

91
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,958
That's why Naruse came here.

92
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,416
You're very lucky.

93
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,625
Yes.

94
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,500
I appreciate this.

95
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,708
Thank you.

96
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:35,958
It's delicious.

97
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,375
Good.

98
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,916
Saeko, don't worry about work.

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,791
You've done enough already.

100
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,541
Think hard about what you'll do together
and enjoy yourself.

101
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,708
For Naruse, who came all this way,

102
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,000
and for Yusuke too.

103
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay?

104
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,291
Thank you.

105
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,458
Phew.

106
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,166
Huh?

107
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,791
-Huh?
-Huh?

108
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,833
-How's this?
-So clumsy.

109
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,250
-Okay, all done.
-Whoa.

110
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,291
You're good at this.

111
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,208
-I am, right?
-Yeah.

112
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,125
Okay, then.

113
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,708
-That scared me.
-Me too.

114
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,666
It's okay.

115
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,041
Now, let's eat.

116
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,458
Okay.

117
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:39,875
Smells great.

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,625
I wonder if I'll get to drink
alcohol one day.

119
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,333
What?

120
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,791
What if I'm actually an angry drunk?

121
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,458
I'd scream, "Bring me another drink!"

122
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,583
How do I put this?

123
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,375
Like a bad guy.

124
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,291
Your idea of a bad guy is interesting.

125
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,333
You're like a kid.

126
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,875
-I see.
-Yeah.

127
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,250
Maybe it's because I always
wanted to be someone like that.

128
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,166
What?

129
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,250
A bad guy.

130
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,083
I think I never grew out of it.

131
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,916
Oh, but the kind of person
I most wanted to be…

132
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:35,291
was someone who would do silly things
that other people couldn't quite fathom.

133
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:36,875
Someone fun.

134
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,750
Oh, I see.

135
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:45,375
Maybe it's because I always lived quietly
so that I wouldn't cause anyone trouble.

136
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,208
I already worry people
just by being alive.

137
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,166
So, because of that,

138
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,958
I was happy that Yusuke came to me.

139
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,166
It's like I became a bit more fun,

140
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,333
and his memories are all fun too.

141
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,458
Yeah, it's great.

142
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:17,333
So, I'm a bit sad
that I'll have to say goodbye soon.

143
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,083
Yeah.

144
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:29,750
Sorry.

145
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,583
I said I came here as Yusuke,

146
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,833
but I've just been talking about myself.

147
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,750
Why are you apologizing?

148
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,125
You don't have to. I'm enjoying it.

149
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,500
You mean the stuff about me?

150
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,791
Yeah, it's fun.
I'm glad I got to know more about you.

151
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:53,916
I see.

152
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,375
Yeah.

153
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:56,791
That's a relief.

154
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,666
Oh, no!

155
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,166
What a mess.

156
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,500
Oh, man.

157
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,125
Is this the kind of stuff
you wanted to do?

158
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,000
It's because I never got to
live with Yusuke.

159
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,083
-Thank you.
-No problem.

160
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,208
Huh?

161
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,791
Hand it over.

162
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:31,791
Hello?

163
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,500
Yes, this is Sugawara.

164
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,041
This is Miki Naruse.

165
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,416
Naruse's wife.

166
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,291
I'm sorry for the sudden call.

167
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:49,375
I believe Naruse will arrive there soon.

168
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,041
What?

169
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,916
And he's going to tell you

170
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,000
that his body is in great condition,

171
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,125
which means

172
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,583
that your boyfriend's memories
will disappear.

173
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,666
Because of that, he wants you to spend
whatever time is left with him.

174
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,625
That's why he came.

175
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,416
But

176
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,250
that's a lie.

177
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,083
His heart…

178
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,708
will stop functioning soon.

179
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,333
Which means he's going to die.

180
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,291
He's already growing weak.

181
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,250
And yet, even in those circumstances,

182
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,416
he said he absolutely had to see you.

183
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,875
He can't help himself.

184
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,500
He wanted to see you that badly

185
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,541
before he passes away.

186
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,541
That's what he said.

187
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,166
But that's…

188
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,041
Why would you…

189
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,375
Because I love him.

190
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,333
The love I have for him
isn't just any love.

191
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,166
That's why I let him go.

192
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:36,333
The reason why I'm calling you now…

193
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,375
is because I want you to suffer too.

194
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:51,625
I want you to go along with this lie
that he's risked his life to carry out.

195
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,625
I want you to shoulder

196
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,333
the same level of pain as me.

197
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,250
I'm sure he'll pretend
that he's healthy right now.

198
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,958
But he can only do so much.

199
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,166
There are a lot of things he can't do.

200
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,333
If he pushes himself too hard,
he might lose his life on the spot.

201
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,208
I could never bear that.

202
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,791
First, he cannot have alcohol.

203
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,208
Don't let him run or carry heavy things.

204
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:34,916
And…

205
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,208
And…

206
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:53,750
As for sex…

207
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,250
It could endanger his life.

208
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,416
That's everything.

209
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,583
Please look after him.

210
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,208
Wow, that's amazing.

211
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,833
Oh, is that spam?

212
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,125
Wow!

213
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,625
What?

214
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,041
Really?

215
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,666
Dance?

216
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,833
Like this?

217
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,416
Wait.

218
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,750
Wait, come join us, Saeko.

219
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,416
Come here.

220
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,458
Go, Saeko.

221
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:07,708
All right.

222
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,041
Um…

223
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,125
This hand?

224
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,250
Can I?

225
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,333
Yeah.

226
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,083
Can you hear it?

227
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,250
Yeah.

228
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,750
Go to sleep…

229
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,666
while listening to Yusuke.

230
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:00,666
Okay.

231
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,125
You know what?

232
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,125
We're a T.

233
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:38,625
A "T"?

234
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,833
Yeah.

235
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,333
The shape of the letter T.

236
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,541
Oh.

237
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,083
T.

238
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,666
We're a T.

239
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:19,958
Good night.

240
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,125
Good night.

241
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:42,916
I'm sorry.

242
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,125
My tears got you all wet.

243
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:52,666
It's fine.

244
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,916
I can't hear it if you're laughing.

245
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,333
Sorry.

246
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,166
Stop it.

247
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,875
Yeah, okay.

248
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,875
Oh, right. I wonder what that was.

249
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,833
What do you mean?

250
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,250
When I first met Yusuke,
he played piano for me at the airport.

251
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,125
That song. "I Want You Back."

252
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:28,125
But when he started playing,
it was some kind of strange song,

253
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,833
or I guess it was more like a melody.

254
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,083
I wonder what that melody was.

255
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,208
I…

256
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:06,500
I mean, Yusuke…

257
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:11,333
saw you here for the first time.

258
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:26,666
You looked like

259
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,333
things weren't going well

260
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,500
or something had upset you.

261
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,583
It looked like
you weren't ready to go home.

262
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:40,583
You were crying.

263
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:50,500
So, I thought about
what I could do for you…

264
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:53,708
and I played the piano.

265
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,291
I wanted you

266
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,625
to cheer up and stop crying.

267
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:09,625
To show you

268
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,041
that the world's not all that bad.

269
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,875
I wanted to express this somehow.

270
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,166
And so…

271
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,500
See? Look here.

272
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,583
I wanted to tell you

273
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,583
this one word.

274
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,416
"Smile"?

275
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:22,666
Saeko.

276
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,166
Smile.

277
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,333
From here on out.

278
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,833
Always.

279
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,125
Thank you

280
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:33,250
for coming.

281
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:39,583
You're welcome.

282
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:47,791
Mr. Naruse, I'm so glad
that you're in this world.

283
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:58,458
Hang in there.

284
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,833
You too, Saeko.

285
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:38,625
Don't worry.

286
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,000
You look lovely.

287
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,333
Welcome back.

288
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:28,708
I'm home.

289
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,250
-Here.
-Got it.

290
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,083
-Don't bruise them.
-Okay.

291
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,000
All right.

292
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,833
Here. They're super red, huh?

293
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:52,416
Thank you.

294
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,541
Hey, be careful!

295
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,625
Oh, you're right.

296
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,000
There we go.

297
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,958
Here you go.

298
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,166
Thank you very much.

299
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,958
Hey, Kengo.

300
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:03,291
Sorry if I've got this wrong.

301
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:05,416
What?

302
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:11,333
Let's try not to fall in love
with the same person next time.

303
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:21,750
Sounds good.

304
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:25,958
Yeah.

305
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:30,625
Oh, right.

306
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:37,000
Could you water the plants?

307
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:38,791
Sure.

308
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,625
Oh, Saeko!

309
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,458
-Saeko!
-Saeko!

310
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:27,958
Saeko!

311
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,291
Why are you here?

312
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,958
Well, I had some business in Otaru,

313
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,291
and I wanted to see your face, Midori.

314
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,416
That's great.

315
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,458
-Whoa!
-What?

316
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,000
Huh?

317
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:47,500
I didn't just gain belly fat
since we last met, you know.

318
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,375
What?!

319
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,958
You never know what could happen in life.

320
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:00,083
Congratulations.

321
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:02,166
Thank you.

322
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:17,166
Mr. Shinoda.

323
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:19,875
Hey there.

324
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,083
Come here.

325
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:29,958
How is it?

326
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,875
What is this?

327
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:33,625
It's new to me.

328
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,875
Nice, right?

329
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,750
Is there anyone without a ticket

330
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,708
or who needs to change
their destination and fare?

331
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,500
THIS IS MIKI NARUSE.

332
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:32,125
WE'RE BUSY WITH APPLE PICKING
AND NEED MORE HANDS.

333
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:34,500
IT STARTS ON OCTOBER 6TH.
I WILL SEE YOU THEN.

334
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:36,958
What is this?

335
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:39,750
I don't get it.

336
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:50,375
NISEKO STATION

337
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:01,125
Excuse me…

338
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:04,875
Get in.

339
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,291
Wait, um…

340
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:20,666
Sorry, I don't really get
what's going on here.

341
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23,458
Why did you call me here?

342
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,333
What? It's in the text.

343
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,166
We need more people to help pick apples.

344
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,250
Okay, well, that's true,

345
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:34,791
but what does that have to do with me?

346
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:39,833
I was wondering if there was
someone out there who owes me something.

347
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:44,000
Someone who feels apologetic towards me.

348
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,791
Is there anyone like that?

349
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,708
I'll get them to help.

350
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,500
Oh, I thought of someone.

351
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,166
Saeko Sugawara.

352
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:54,208
There you go.

353
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,416
I see.

354
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:12,250
Thank you.

355
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:15,958
Sure.

356
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,791
I'll expect your help every year.

357
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:23,958
-Huh?
-Huh?

358
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:31,000
I want to see you every year.

359
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:43,916
Got it.

360
