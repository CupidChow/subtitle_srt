1
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,291
-Please have some.
-Oh, thank you.

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,791
-For the conductor too.
-Oh, I couldn't.

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:21,916
I insist.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,750
In that case, thank you.

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,166
It's delicious.

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Thank you.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,833
Not a problem.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,875
Oh, have some.

9
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,416
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

10
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,666
It's so pretty.

11
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,333
I've never noticed the view before.

12
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,250
I ride this line all the time,
but I never took a good look.

13
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,583
I agree.

14
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:13,958
Yeah.

15
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,375
I've never gotten off here before either.

16
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,791
Maybe we were actually lucky.

17
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,333
The train stopped, we discovered this view

18
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,583
and found a beauty that we'd never known.

19
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:52,708
By the way…

20
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,041
Haven't we met somewhere before?

21
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,416
What?

22
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,500
Um, when could it have been?

23
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,166
I don't believe we've ever met.

24
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,125
Wait, we've never met?

25
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,625
That doesn't seem right.

26
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,083
Oh, I'll take that.

27
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,000
No.

28
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,416
Wait, I apologize.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,416
That wasn't my intention.

30
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,875
-That's not--
-Where's the dish towel?

31
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,125
Oh, the dish towel is over here.

32
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,333
-Thank you.
-Here.

33
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,666
We're done here.

34
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,208
Wait, I still wanted to talk about…

35
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,750
Thank you for your kind patience.

36
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,666
I truly, sincerely apologize

37
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,375
for making you spend
your valuable time waiting this morning.

38
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,583
We will depart shortly.

39
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:09,583
Also, to the passenger
who provided everyone with coffee,

40
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,416
I truly appreciate it.

41
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,958
It brought me to tears.

42
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,625
Please board and wait for our departure.

43
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,833
Thank you.

44
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,416
Oh, it was nothing.

45
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,750
Thank you for the coffee.

46
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:22,708
Thank you.

47
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,583
-It was great.
-I'm glad.

48
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,583
Thank you.

49
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,416
Good morning.

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,750
Good morning!

51
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,666
-Sorry I'm late.
-Let's get started.

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,750
-Okay.
-Okay.

53
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,333
Let's start with the dry beans.

54
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,250
-Okay.
-Right.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,833
Your opinions?

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,166
I liked the lightness of Number Three.

57
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,416
It had a very refreshing finish.

58
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,750
Its unique aroma was nice.

59
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,541
But I think it's a bit too bright.

60
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:59,041
I think the slight depth
of Number One was nice.

61
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,500
It had a rich sweetness
reminiscent of brown sugar.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,666
I thought Number One had a nice depth,

63
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,500
but isn't it missing something?

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,416
Since it seems a bit flat,

65
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,375
could we adjust the roasting time
to bring out its flavor?

66
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,208
This one's unusual.

67
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,333
It's really spicy and could be risky,
but it tastes good.

68
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,875
Well…

69
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,250
It's unique.

70
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,250
And it has a rich flavor.

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,333
It's hard to balance those two things.

72
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,166
But you have the skills, Mr. Shinoda.

73
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,250
No, this isn't worth
sweet-talking me over.

74
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,541
If we can sell this,
it could be another signature product.

75
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,208
I'm saying we can't sell it, moron!

76
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,833
-Okay, if I may.
-Huh? What is it?

77
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,666
Let's go back to basics.

78
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,583
Huh?

79
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,541
-Mr. Shinoda.
-Yeah?

80
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,166
Which flavor feels more like us?
Number One or Two?

81
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,625
Probably Number One.

82
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,375
So you see,

83
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,583
when I thought about it,

84
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:15,083
the fact that he made coffee
and chatted with me isn't all that weird.

85
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,708
I just got angry for no reason
when he sounded like Yusuke.

86
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:23,875
I feel stupid.

87
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,708
I don't get it.

88
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,750
Oh, really?

89
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,083
Yeah, he seemed like a great guy.

90
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,791
Man, I think I was out of line.

91
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,000
When he asked me if we met before,
I snapped and said, "No."

92
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,666
It might just be
that I resemble someone he knows.

93
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,916
I mean, we ride the same train, after all.

94
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,541
I see.

95
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,208
Yeah.

96
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,666
Sorry, I don't have any wisdom to share.

97
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,875
Lending an ear
is all you need to do, Kengo.

98
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,125
Oh, so I'm just here to listen to you?

99
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,375
Yeah, we need listeners like you
in this world.

100
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,708
If everyone on Earth
just talked all the time…

101
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,500
Basically, if everyone were like me,

102
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,583
the world would be so annoying.

103
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,041
I'd hate it.

104
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:14,708
Oh, really?

105
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,416
I guess it's fine then.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,833
Yeah.

107
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,000
But, you know…

108
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,750
You were Yusuke's listener too, right?

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,333
Were you like that since you were kids?

110
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,208
More or less.

111
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,416
I see.

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,958
What's that?

113
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,333
Oh, wow.

114
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,750
You know…

115
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,666
What?

116
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,458
I thought you'd only learned
to tolerate coffee,

117
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,000
even though you don't like it.

118
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,875
But judging from this,
you aren't just tolerating it.

119
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,916
You like it now.

120
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,875
Oh, yeah. You might be right.

121
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,208
Yeah.

122
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,000
I see. You like it, huh?

123
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,583
-It's good to like new things.
-Yeah.

124
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,125
It's wonderful.

125
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,083
But I hope you don't start to hate
the things you used to love.

126
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,750
What?

127
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,875
That hasn't happened.

128
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,416
It hasn't.

129
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,250
I am who I am.

130
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,541
The things I love won't change.

131
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,916
My favorite ramen is miso.

132
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,958
That won't ever change.

133
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,625
Was that the point here?

134
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,833
I need sauce for my sunny side up eggs.

135
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,916
That won't change either.

136
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,666
Hayao Miyazaki likes them that way too.

137
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,958
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

138
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,041
Wait, who cares?

139
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,708
Hmm, what else?

140
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,958
Maru Coffee!

141
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,875
I thought it sounded cute.

142
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,750
It's so hip!

143
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,208
How trendy. Who came up with this?

144
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,708
-Who was it?
-It was Yusuke.

145
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,791
Maru Coffee.

146
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,916
The world is round.

147
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,750
-Yeah.
-Maru is "round" in Japanese.

148
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,625
Even if we end up apart,

149
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,083
we'll reunite eventually, you know?

150
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,083
That's what "maru" means.

151
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,625
The world is round.

152
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,291
-Hey!
-What?

153
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,583
The moment you do that,
the coffee is ruined.

154
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,791
No way! This one's…

155
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,666
-It's true. You…
-Stop that.

156
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,416
-This is so good!
-It's tasty.

157
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,416
Really?

158
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,583
-Come on!
-All right! We did it!

159
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,541
-We're just getting started.
-What?

160
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,208
All right. Here it comes.

161
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,166
It's here!

162
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,666
-There they are!
-Whoa, they're so big!

163
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,291
Fireworks are the best!

164
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,083
The best!

165
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:58,208
-And Saeko in a yukata is the best too!
-Woo-hoo!

166
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,833
Hooray!

167
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,208
There's more coming!

168
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,541
You'll get sunburned lying there.

169
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,750
-That's okay.
-You're okay with that?

170
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,083
I want to get a tan.

171
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,041
Whoa, stop that.

172
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,416
-That's dangerous.
-Yeah.

173
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,375
-Stop it.
-Oh, over here.

174
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,625
I'm getting a great shot from here.

175
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:18,958
Oh, that's awesome.

176
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,000
Yusuke!

177
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,708
But it sure is nice here.

178
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,333
What's your favorite part?

179
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,250
Kengo.

180
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,500
My favorite part?

181
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,416
Yeah?

182
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,041
Let's shake hands.

183
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,208
Okay? Here.

184
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,166
Come on. You can do it.

185
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,750
You know, if I see
coffee cherries grow on this tree,

186
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:34,833
I'm going to cry.

187
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,250
Yeah, I'm totally going to cry.

188
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,791
Isn't it cute?

189
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,208
Those apples are red.

190
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,750
-You're right!
-Look over there.

191
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,500
-There are red apples.
-So pretty.

192
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,875
-Look.
-Phew.

193
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,666
Oh, wow!

194
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,166
-A centipede?
-Good luck!

195
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,791
Slow down!

196
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,291
Be careful.

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,583
-Thank you for hosting us again this year.
-Oh, of course.

198
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,666
-We'll be in your care.
-Thank you.

199
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,875
The kids were really
looking forward to this.

200
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,541
Hello. Thank you for coming.

201
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,291
Thank you.

202
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,791
Wow, these apples look incredible.

203
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,833
They look delicious.

204
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,041
-I know!
-Okay.

205
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,958
It's because it's not getting sunlight.

206
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,125
Correct. I'm impressed.

207
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:09,333
Okay, grab this and twist it
so that the sun shines on it. You did it!

208
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's clear all the branches here
so that they get plenty of sunlight.

209
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,708
Hold on there.

210
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,583
-Wait!
-Watch out!

211
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,416
Run away!

212
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,416
Watch out!

213
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,541
Oh, there you are!

214
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,166
Be careful!

215
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:37,916
Miki!

216
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,375
Excuse me!

217
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,708
Yes? What is it?

218
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,500
Um…

219
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,375
Please go out with me.

220
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,916
With intent to marry.

221
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,458
Please.

222
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,166
What?

223
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,541
We can get married right away.
I really like you.

224
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,625
I can't hold in my feelings anymore.

225
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,916
Sorry,

226
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,916
you should probably give up on me.

227
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,708
I won't.

228
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,333
Wait, I'm happy that you asked, but…

229
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,375
Thank goodness.

230
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,000
No, wait.

231
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,583
I mean, I'm so plain.

232
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,125
It's okay. I'll stand out
for the both of us.

233
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,583
I'm boring.

234
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,791
It's okay. I'm interesting
enough for the both of us.

235
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,541
I'm not very dependable.

236
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,750
Or rather, I come off as weak.

237
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,833
See? I'm a man,
but look at how little I eat.

238
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,666
It's okay. I'm strong and dependable.

239
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,208
I eat a bunch too.

240
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:24,875
Well…

241
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
I don't know if you're aware or not…

242
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,333
but I have a weak body.

243
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,416
It's my heart.

244
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,208
It's okay. My heart
is strong enough for the both of us.

245
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,583
What?

246
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:46,958
Huh?

247
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,125
It seems

248
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,958
I have no reason to decline.

249
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,875
After all, for a long time now…

250
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,833
I've had feelings for you.

251
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,166
Ever since you were Miss Apple.

252
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,166
What?

253
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,875
What?

254
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,500
Are you serious?

255
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,791
I'll be in your care.

256
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:39,916
I'll be in your care.

257
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,791
Is it good?

258
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,416
-It's tasty!
-Who wants more?

259
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,916
Oh, I'll take that.

260
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,541
-Thank you.
-I'll have some.

261
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,541
Give me that.

262
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,750
Here are some new ones.

263
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,750
We still have more.

264
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,625
-Come here.
-Look, I have two!

265
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,250
Hey.

266
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:14,791
What is it?

267
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,583
I'm so happy for Mr. Naruse.

268
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,625
Why's that?

269
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,541
It's such a relief.

270
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,625
Isn't it great how lively he's gotten?

271
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,708
Stop it.

272
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,333
Huh? Stop what?

273
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,458
Of course I'm glad he's healthy now.

274
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,333
But stop saying how great it is
that he's more lively.

275
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,750
It implies his old self
wasn't good enough.

276
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,333
Come on. That's not what I meant.

277
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,416
That's what it ends up meaning!

278
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,583
I fell in love with and married him
when he wasn't as lively or healthy.

279
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,208
It's an insult to me.

280
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,541
Is that what I'm doing?

281
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,625
It is!

282
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,041
So, stop saying
that you're glad he's lively now.

283
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:00,791
Okay.

284
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,500
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,333
Wow, isn't it great
how lively Naruse has gotten?

286
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,541
-Ms. Tada was saying…
-He's like a different person.

287
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,958
They want to come back in the fall.

288
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,416
-So good.
-We ate a lot, huh?

289
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,083
-It's great!
-Hm? It sure is, isn't it?

290
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,375
-Huh?
-About the other day…

291
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,416
I sincerely apologize.

292
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,125
Oh, don't say that. I was also--

293
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,208
No, I'm the one at fault.

294
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,041
You did nothing wrong.

295
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,750
I really didn't want to leave you thinking

296
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,083
that I'm an overly sensitive,
egotistical lady.

297
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,833
You were kind enough
to make coffee for us like that.

298
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,166
I'm truly sorry for spoiling everything.

299
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,916
No, but…

300
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,333
Don't say you did anything wrong.
I'm the only one who acted poorly.

301
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,208
Okay, I understand.

302
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,333
Sorry for acting scary during my apology.

303
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,750
Oh, it's fine.

304
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,916
Would you like to sit?

305
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,875
Um, my name is Naruse.

306
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,208
Nice to meet you.

307
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,000
I live in Niseko.

308
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,791
My wife's family owns an apple farm there.

309
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,125
I see.

310
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,416
It's nice to meet you.

311
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,458
I'm Sugawara.

312
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,833
I get on at Rankoshi Station,

313
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,541
but I only recently started living there.

314
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,166
Oh, are you from Otaru then?

315
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,458
No, I was born and raised in Tokyo.
My parents are still there.

316
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,375
After some twists and turns,
I ended up finding a job here.

317
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:11,958
I see.

318
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,958
Oh, no.
I don't think I can hold my tongue.

319
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,916
-Huh?
-Well, you see.

320
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,708
I actually work in the coffee business.

321
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,458
Wow.

322
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,583
Wait.

323
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,000
Are you a coffee expert then?

324
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,291
Oh, well, yes.

325
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,250
Man, you should've said so sooner.

326
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,000
I ended up lecturing you about coffee.

327
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,708
When would I have told you?

328
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,708
That's true, but…

329
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,833
Does that mean
you're an expert at making coffee?

330
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,583
Yes, that's right.

331
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,791
Jeez, I bet
I was really bad at making coffee.

332
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,208
Yes, it was horrible.

333
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,375
I'm sure it was.

334
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,583
I'm so embarrassed.

335
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,291
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

336
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,375
Can I give you a tip
on how to make good coffee?

337
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,125
Yes, please.

338
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,083
-First, let's say that this is a dripper.
-Okay.

339
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,583
Pour hot water from the center

340
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,208
and move gently like this,
allowing it to take in the water.

341
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,125
Right.

342
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,125
-Goodbye then.
-Goodbye.

343
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,458
-Have a good day.
-You too.

344
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,458
Excuse me.

345
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,250
Oh, hello.

346
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,458
How can I help you?

347
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,166
-I have a question about this.
-Okay.

348
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:10,750
Excuse me.

349
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,083
Excuse me.

350
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,666
Coming.

351
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,125
Is this what she meant?

352
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,083
Everyone, please have some.

353
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,875
I tried making some coffee.

354
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,500
-Really?
-Oh, wow.

355
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,541
Thank you!

356
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,708
-Are you sure? Thank you!
-Go ahead.

357
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:52,791
Wow. Coffee?

358
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,416
-What a nice aroma.
-What's this?

359
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,083
I tried making some coffee.

360
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,166
It's good.

361
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,500
-It's great.
-Really?

362
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,958
It's like coffee from a café.

363
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,416
It's so good.

364
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,125
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

365
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,333
I feel so relaxed.

366
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,875
Mm-hmm, this is good.

367
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:12,791
It's delicious.

368
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:20,000
The local train heading for Oshamambe
will soon depart from Platform Two.

369
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,875
Please be sure to board on time.

370
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,833
Oh, hello. Good to see you.

371
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,166
Good to see you too.

372
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,041
What a coincidence,
running into each other twice in one day.

373
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,333
Well, there's only one train an hour.

374
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,583
Oh, that's true.

375
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,250
I'm jealous.
I want to go back to those days.

376
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:07,208
No, it's really hard
for students nowadays,

377
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,458
with job hunting and such.

378
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,833
Why did you decide to work for
a coffee company, Ms. Sugawara?

379
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:17,125
It's a long story. Is that okay?

380
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,458
Yes, I'm curious.

381
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,375
Our company's interesting.

382
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:26,291
All the employees are people
who have been saved by coffee once.

383
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,250
Wow.

384
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,583
Saved by coffee…

385
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:32,791
I see.

386
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,791
You make a good
conversation partner, Mr. Naruse.

387
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,125
Huh?

388
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:41,166
I kept saying we should keep going,
but they insisted we leave.

389
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,500
So I said I'd go alone.

390
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,541
I asked which way to go
and started walking.

391
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:48,833
Then, before I knew it,

392
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,750
I was lost in the mountains of Costa Rica.

393
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,666
Jungle as far as the eye can see.

394
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,791
That's crazy.

395
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,083
I was like, "Where are we?"

396
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,625
Wanna sit here?

397
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,041
Excuse me.

398
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,166
Oh, wow.

399
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,250
They're flirting on the train.

400
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,416
No, we're not.

401
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,291
-Are you flirting?
-No, no.

402
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,958
-We're not.
-Lovey-dovey!

403
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,916
Hey, stop that! I'm sorry.

404
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,250
Huh?

405
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,333
Good evening.

406
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,375
I wanted to hear the rest of your story.

407
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:56,958
I found out there's a plan

408
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,583
to hold a surprise birthday party for me.

409
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh, now I see.

410
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,250
Wait. When is it?

411
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,458
Well, it's tomorrow.

412
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,333
-I see.
-But that's beside the point.

413
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,583
I overheard them planning the surprise.

414
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,708
What do I do?

415
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:18,041
Should I pretend like I didn't know
and just act surprised?

416
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:18,958
What do you think?

417
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,041
Well…

418
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:25,458
Maybe you should act surprised
and pretend like you didn't notice,

419
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:27,125
since they went to the trouble.

420
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,916
-Right.
-Yeah.

421
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,166
Actually…

422
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,000
That's not right.

423
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,208
It's not?

424
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,708
That's what the usual me would do.

425
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,750
But it should be more fun.

426
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,291
Huh?

427
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,625
Pretend you didn't notice, act surprised,

428
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,375
and party as hard as you can.

429
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,250
Then, when the party's heating up,

430
00:28:56,333 --> 00:29:00,208
create your own surprise
by saying, "Actually, I already knew."

431
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:03,416
Then, give everyone a small present.

432
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,583
That should liven things up.

433
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,041
-I see.
-Yeah.

434
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,416
Thank you.

435
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,416
I'll give it a try.

436
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,041
Good luck.

437
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:18,375
Thank you.

438
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,291
Now that I know, happy birthd--

439
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,416
No, not yet.

440
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,083
You shouldn't say that stuff early.

441
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,208
If you say it early,
you lose the chance to say it later.

442
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,791
Okay, got it.

443
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,833
In that case, I'll say it tomorrow.

444
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,250
Thank you.

445
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,000
What's wrong?

446
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,833
Oh, nothing.

447
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,916
It's just that…

448
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,708
I felt something strange.

449
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,416
I don't know how to describe it.

450
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,041
Sorry about that.

451
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,541
Sorry for asking so suddenly.

452
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:39,958
Is missing work really okay?

453
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,708
Yeah. It's totally fine.

454
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:46,416
Leave it to them
to both get a fever at the same time.

455
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:51,625
Still, I'm excited
for my very first farm show.

456
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,250
Yeah.

457
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,083
Thank you.

458
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:27,541
Are you okay?

459
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,791
Yeah, I'm fine.

460
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:34,083
It's been a while since our last outing.

461
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:35,541
Yeah.

462
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,750
Kazu! Are you okay?

463
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,000
Can you breathe?

464
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,083
Kazu, stay calm.

465
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,208
Are you okay?

466
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:39,416
The local train heading for Oshamambe
will soon depart from Platform Two.

467
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,250
Please be sure to board on time.

468
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:48,833
The local train heading for Oshamambe
will soon depart from Platform Two.

469
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,208
Please be sure to board on time.

470
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,083
Miss.

471
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,208
Miss?

472
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,125
We're here.

473
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,833
I'm sorry.

474
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:19,083
RANKOSHI STATION

475
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,541
Huh? Is this how you do it?

476
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:33,833
Hello?

477
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,458
Is it… Oh, this way.

478
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,375
Let's see here…

479
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,375
Hi, Saeko!

480
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,333
Doing well?

481
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,000
That face tells me you're not well.
What's wrong?

482
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:47,916
What?

483
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,000
Are you walking?

484
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,333
Oh, jeez.

485
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,208
Yeah, I'm walking.

486
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,375
What is this, Hiro?

487
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,958
Is something up?

488
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:03,041
Well, I could sense
that you were feeling a bit blue.

489
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,666
Was I right?

490
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,041
I see.

491
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,666
I was right, huh?

492
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,333
This is what people call a good man.

493
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:13,875
Right?

494
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,375
Jeez…

495
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,166
Thank you.

496
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,291
When someone I've lost
comes up in my mind,

497
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:32,541
I think it's because
that person misses me.

498
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,500
That they have come to see me.

499
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:42,000
My wife's been gone for eight years,

500
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:46,333
but she comes to see me every day.

501
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,208
She must be crazy about me.

502
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,541
Right?

503
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:55,041
So, I'm more than happy to have them
appear in my head.

504
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,291
And Saeko…

505
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:02,666
I know you said it's hard
to look toward the future,

506
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,250
but it's okay.

507
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:08,875
Unlike cars, humans aren't designed
to walk backward easily.

508
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:10,708
Right?

509
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:16,333
So, that means that
if you're walking every single day,

510
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,333
you're moving forward.

511
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,833
You're taking steps forward.

512
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,833
Okay?

513
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,333
Follow your heart.

514
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:36,250
Okay, Saeko?

515
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,333
Okay.

516
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,041
You see that?

517
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,458
Look.

518
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,583
The Hawaiian skies.

519
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,416
I'm sure you'll be fine.

520
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:07,083
Everything will work out, Saeko.

521
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:23,583
Memories from the person
who gave me their heart…

522
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:28,875
are inside of me.

523
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,416
Is that possible?

524
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:39,875
Medically speaking…

525
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,125
It might not be medically proven,

526
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,375
but similar cases
have been reported, right?

527
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,666
I'm right, aren't I?

528
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,791
My heart…

529
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:04,333
It has memories that aren't mine.

530
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,000
I can't see it any other way.

531
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,083
What…

532
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:15,416
does this heart want?

533
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,416
It's like…

534
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,333
When I think about what might happen…

535
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,583
I get scared.

536
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,375
Uncle, let's play!

537
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:04,375
Sure.

538
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,833
What do you want to play?

539
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,000
-Spinning tops.
-Tops?

540
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:12,208
There we go. Oh, no!

541
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,958
-Yay! I win!
-You're good.

542
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,083
If I win this one,
you have to do as I say.

543
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,625
What?

544
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,541
Sure.

545
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:21,750
-Here we go.
-Okay.

546
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,125
Ready, set…

547
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,375
-Yay!
-You're so good.

548
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,625
Now, do what I say, okay?

549
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:30,541
What is it?

550
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:36,416
Uncle, you had surgery
and evolved into your second form, right?

551
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,666
Huh?

552
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,958
Show me your scar.

553
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,291
What?

554
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,041
Come on. You promised.

555
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:49,958
Please?

556
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,083
But it could be scary.

557
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,416
You might cry.

558
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,291
I totally won't cry.

559
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,708
Come on, you promised.

560
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,541
Isn't it okay then? Please?

561
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:02,958
It's okay, right?

562
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:04,666
Please.

563
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:07,000
I promise I won't cry.

564
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,166
-Do you want to see?
-Yeah.

565
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:21,833
-Here goes.
-Okay.

566
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:36,041
Whoa, it looks super cool!

567
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,666
-What?
-It's super cool!

568
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:44,916
-Really?
-Yeah.

569
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,875
-It's cool?
-Yeah.

570
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:49,875
I see.

571
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:53,041
Okay, let's go look at the apples.

572
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,125
Huh? Apples?

573
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,583
Yeah, come on.

574
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:57,125
-What about this?
-Come on.

575
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,833
Wait up.

576
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,041
-Hurry!
-I'm coming!

577
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,166
Careful, Yuma.

578
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:20,875
