1
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,791
Here you go.

2
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,208
Thank you.

3
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,833
You know,

4
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:35,208
today should be a public
holiday worldwide.

5
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,541
The Birthday of Saeko Sugawara.

6
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,791
-What?
-Well, think about it.

7
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,916
The world is a brighter place
because you were born.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,791
You bring happiness to the world.

9
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:50,666
Thank you

10
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,500
for being born.

11
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,875
Thank you.

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,208
Happy birthday.

13
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,041
Thank you.

14
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,125
I'm gonna cry.

15
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,208
Just kidding.

16
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,125
What? You were kidding?

17
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,041
-You're not crying?
-Nope.

18
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,250
You're tearing up.

19
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,291
Hey, stop making that face.

20
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,291
I'm…

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,875
I'm sorry about the other day.

22
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,250
I promised to wish you
a happy birthday, and yet…

23
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,791
You should be sorry.

24
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,541
I was looking forward to it.

25
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,375
Oh, um, forgive me.

26
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,666
That day…

27
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,041
I'm sorry. I sincerely apologize.

28
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,958
It's not that big of a deal.

29
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,666
I wanted to meet someone,

30
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,750
but it wasn't necessarily you.

31
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,583
Let me be frank.

32
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,416
Okay.

33
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:25,125
Sometimes, the things
you say are really similar…

34
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,500
to the person I loved.

35
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,083
I'm not talking about your face.

36
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,541
You look nothing alike.

37
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,833
But it's surprising
how similar you two can be.

38
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,750
I keep imagining that you're him.

39
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,541
It's fun for me.

40
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,291
That's why I look forward
to seeing you here.

41
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,291
I really loved him.

42
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,416
But it's not a good idea.

43
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,125
So, I'll stop.

44
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:04,958
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,166
No, don't be.

46
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,166
Why are you apologizing?

47
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,541
You didn't do anything wrong.

48
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,125
It bothers me.

49
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,208
The more fun I have remembering him,

50
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,541
the sadder I get.

51
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,958
And if it gets me confused

52
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,125
and I end up falling in love with you,

53
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,708
that would be bad too.

54
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,041
It's wrong, and it'd bring you trouble.

55
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,541
You and me both.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,791
Plus, you're not my type at all.

57
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,500
Right.

58
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,875
I'm sorry. I just insulted you
in a roundabout way.

59
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,041
No, that's…

60
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,958
Well, I understand.

61
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:59,958
I was actually thinking about
changing trains to avoid seeing you.

62
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,666
But trains are infrequent here,
so that's hard to pull off.

63
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,583
I'm sure we'll run into each other.

64
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,250
We don't have to ignore each other.
We can be acquaintances.

65
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,958
But please limit it to just saying hello.

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,666
Well, thank you

67
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,416
for everything.

68
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,666
Oh, um…

69
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,708
About that person…

70
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,083
No, never mind.

71
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,791
And that was that.

72
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,791
It's like a mini love story
on the train, right?

73
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,333
With someone who
kind of resembled my late fiancé.

74
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,666
You and that guy had a love story?

75
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,916
No, that's not what I meant at all.

76
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,708
-I see.
-Yeah, it's different.

77
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,791
Was he that similar to Yusuke?

78
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:05,916
Wow.

79
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,583
Don't you want to meet him?

80
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,125
No, I wouldn't want to.

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,750
After all, he's not Yusuke.

82
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,458
Yeah, that's true.

83
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,416
You're right, Kengo.

84
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:29,958
Are you okay, Saeko?

85
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,791
What? Yeah, I'm good.

86
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:38,416
Well… don't put yourself
through any more hardship.

87
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,458
Okay?

88
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,791
I won't. Thank you.

89
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,000
-They're here.
-Let's go.

90
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,000
Hurry up.

91
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:57,916
Phew.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,166
We'll run into traffic.

93
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,375
-Hurry up!
-All set.

94
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,375
Hey.

95
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,208
We'll miss the fireworks!

96
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,875
We're really going, huh?

97
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,208
Just like you said.

98
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,416
You were certain we would go.

99
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,875
Yes, I sure was.

100
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,791
Thank you very much.

101
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,208
Don't be silly.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,791
Auntie! Uncle!

103
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,958
Hi, Yuma!

104
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,208
Hey.

105
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:31,750
Yes?

106
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,250
I told you

107
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,458
the doctor couldn't come up with
a scientific reason, right?

108
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,666
Yeah.

109
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,291
Still, I think…

110
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,250
there's someone else

111
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
living inside of me.

112
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,541
That's how it feels.

113
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,375
And I think…

114
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,875
It might be the person

115
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,791
who gave me their heart and saved my life.

116
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,458
I think that person's memories

117
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,166
are inside of me.

118
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,625
The doctor said that
anything could happen after the implant.

119
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,083
Nothing is impossible.

120
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,500
Since there's still a lot we don't know.

121
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,125
That's why…

122
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,666
I just have to live with it.

123
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:49,166
I have no choice but to live together
with this person's memories.

124
00:08:58,916 --> 00:08:59,750
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,750
You have nothing to apologize for.

126
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,708
Okay.

127
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,583
I guess that's just how it is.

128
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,541
I'll accept the whole package.
Bring it on.

129
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,625
Thank you.

130
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,583
I'll be in your care.

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,666
Yeah, you can count on me.

132
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,291
-More importantly…
-Yeah?

133
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,708
You should compliment my yukata first.

134
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,416
Oh, sorry, um…

135
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,375
You look so beautiful,
I was at a loss for words.

136
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,041
-Don't lose them.
-Sorry.

137
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,000
Thanks for waiting, Sis!

138
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:46,916
Let's head out!

139
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:48,958
-Let's go.
-Okay.

140
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,833
The fireworks will begin soon.

141
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,166
Is it already time?

142
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,166
Yusuke used to love fireworks.

143
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:17,416
For as long as I knew him,
he would be like, "Fireworks are my life!"

144
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,833
I can imagine.

145
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,666
It's just like
when he planned his proposal.

146
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,875
He was like, "It has to have fireworks."

147
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,625
So, we had fireworks.
He asks you to marry him. You say yes.

148
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,416
And then, boom!

149
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,333
It was so much work.

150
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,291
Right, guys?

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,833
Thank you. Yusuke looked really happy too.

152
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,083
The last time I saw his face,

153
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,708
the fireworks had made him so happy.

154
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm glad.

155
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,500
Thanks for inviting me.

156
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,916
After all, the fireworks show
comes every year.

157
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,208
I need to get used to it.

158
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,291
It's started!

159
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,333
Wow, amazing!

160
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,958
-This is amazing.
-It really is.

161
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,458
Wow.

162
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,291
Here they come.

163
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,583
Wow, that's incredible!

164
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,875
Right?

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,916
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,125
"Boom!"

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,958
Wow, look at them go!

168
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,083
So cool!

169
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,166
Oh, it's time!

170
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,000
All right!

171
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,708
Here they come!

172
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,708
All right! Boom!

173
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,333
Boom!

174
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,083
I love fireworks!

175
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,583
I love fireworks!

176
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,833
I love Otaru!

177
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,666
I love Otaru!

178
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,500
I love Saeko in a yukata!

179
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,541
I love it!

180
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,791
There are more!

181
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,083
Fireworks are the best!

182
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,625
The best!

183
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,625
Otaru is the best!

184
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,250
The best!

185
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,166
Fireworks are the best!

186
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,666
The best!

187
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,833
-Hey!
-Hold on! Yuma!

188
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,041
-Yuma!
-Don't run!

189
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,583
That's dangerous!

190
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,083
-Yuma!
-He's running.

191
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,250
Yuma!

192
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,583
Hey, I've been thinking…

193
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:12,916
Yeah?

194
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,208
I don't want to think about it, but…

195
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,916
What if the situation was reversed?

196
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,625
Reversed?

197
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,458
Well…

198
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,208
I don't know how to word it.

199
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,833
This is just an example.

200
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's say the person
who lived with that heart

201
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,625
had someone they loved,
like a spouse or partner.

202
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:42,958
Okay.

203
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,250
That partner's loved one passed away,

204
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,208
but their heart was still alive.

205
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,875
It was living on in someone else's body

206
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:58,083
with that loved one's
memories still inside…

207
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,666
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

208
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,333
If that happened,

209
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,416
would they want to meet that heart?

210
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,875
If it were me…

211
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,958
I would want to.

212
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,916
Despite everything.

213
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,291
Midori.

214
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:04,958
Huh?

215
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,833
Oh, are you…

216
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,541
Oh, I'm sorry.

217
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,708
Should we talk about work
and forget you saw anything?

218
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:22,375
Or… do you want to ask me
why I'm crying first?

219
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,625
Well…

220
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,250
I guess I'll ask?

221
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,708
Thank you.

222
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,625
Let's talk over lunch.

223
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,416
Take a seat.

224
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,166
Let's eat.

225
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,541
Oh, it's eel!

226
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,458
So, basically,

227
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,583
in my case,

228
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,250
work might be going well,
but I have terrible luck with love.

229
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,583
It's so bad,
I can't think of it any other way.

230
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,125
Nothing good ever happens
when I'm in love.

231
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,500
It's no use.

232
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,958
Yeah, that's my fate.

233
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:13,958
It's fate.

234
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,041
Well, here's what I think.

235
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:24,166
People use the word "fate"
for things that are already set in stone,

236
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,291
but I disagree.

237
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,291
We decide our own fate, right?

238
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,083
What?

239
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,583
I think the act of living
means we're always making choices.

240
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,000
It's a never-ending cycle of choices.

241
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,625
And the future of everything
is on the other end of those choices.

242
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,416
In other words, we decide everything.

243
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,583
We make it happen.

244
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,625
I see.

245
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,416
You get rewarded
for making the right choice.

246
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,250
It's your fault if things go south.

247
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,125
We don't blame others.

248
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,208
Let's think of it that way.

249
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,208
Love is just like work.

250
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,958
It's not fate.

251
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,208
Midori.

252
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,666
Keep making your own choices.

253
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,375
Don't give up and blame fate.

254
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:13,125
If you do that, you never know
what will happen in life.

255
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,166
I see.

256
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah. Roger that.

257
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,208
What's this?

258
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,625
You cried, said your bit,
had good food, and now you're fine?

259
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,791
You could tell? Sorry.

260
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,875
I don't mind either way.

261
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,500
I can't believe I'm here
discussing fate with you.

262
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,583
So, what work did you want to talk about?

263
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,625
Well, there are two projects
I want your help with.

264
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,958
Want me to choose for you?

265
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,250
Or will you choose?

266
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,250
Based on what you just said,
I bet you want to choose.

267
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,333
Huh? I guess so.

268
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,875
One is pretty exciting.

269
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,125
A presentation,
going up against a big company.

270
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,916
The other isn't that big
and won't make much profit,

271
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,583
but it's an investment in the future.

272
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:04,916
So, which one?

273
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,375
Well…

274
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:24,875
Good morning.

275
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,291
Good morning.

276
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,750
A lot of students have been asking
for some good coffee to drink.

277
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,125
I see…

278
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,458
Is that the spot?

279
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,875
We're using it as storage for now.

280
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:01,791
I see.

281
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,125
Wait. What is this? It's so cool!

282
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,875
It is, isn't it?

283
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:14,750
Huh?

284
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,041
What? Why are you here?

285
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,041
No, wait.

286
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,041
I should be the one asking you that.

287
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,375
What? Well, I'm here for work.

288
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,458
Oh, are you here about the coffee?

289
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,333
I'm Sugawara from Akane Inc.

290
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:36,333
Oh, I'm Naruse
from the Student Affairs Division.

291
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,458
You two know each other?

292
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,041
What's happening here?

293
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,083
-What do you mean?
-This!

294
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:52,583
Oh, I was told it's been here for a while.
They want me to dispose of it.

295
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,875
I see.

296
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,458
This is a roaster, right?

297
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,833
It sure is.

298
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,916
It's impressive.

299
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,541
It is. It must be really old.

300
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,500
It's like the photos I saw
while I was studying coffee.

301
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,333
Oh, really?

302
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,125
I mean, it's old enough
to have been on the Titanic.

303
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,083
What?

304
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,875
Seriously?

305
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,333
Actually, I made that up
to convey how amazing it is.

306
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,750
Oh, did you really?

307
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,458
Sorry. Um…

308
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,916
Can I take a photo for the office?

309
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,916
Oh, of course.

310
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,416
Go ahead.

311
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,541
-I'll leave it to you then.
-Okay.

312
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,708
-It was nice to meet you.
-You too.

313
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,541
This is so cool.

314
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,166
Oh, wow.

315
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,333
Wait.

316
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,166
Did you say you're throwing it away?

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,833
Yes.

318
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,375
They want to make space for the potatoes.

319
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,250
No, do you hear what you're saying?
You can't do that!

320
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,708
Oh, I'm sorry.

321
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

322
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,125
This is just great.

323
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,000
Is this for real?

324
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,125
What?

325
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,041
No, it's nothing.

326
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,083
Oh, I have to take this.

327
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Hello?

328
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,666
Yes, it is.

329
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,041
It's an amazing find, isn't it?

330
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,791
Yes.

331
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,166
What?!

332
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,875
Okay.

333
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,958
Right. Got it.

334
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,708
I'll keep you updated.

335
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes, I'll tell them.

336
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,833
Goodbye.

337
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,041
So, about this roaster…

338
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,875
I've been told it's an old PROBAT machine.

339
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,041
There are only a few people
in Japan who can repair it.

340
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:02,750
And one of them is Shinoda,
a roast master who works at our company.

341
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,166
Really?

342
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,041
Apparently, he's on his way.

343
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,958
He said he saw the photo and cried.

344
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,958
I see…

345
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:22,666
-But it's amazing, huh?
-Yeah.

346
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,208
This is fate, isn't it?

347
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,166
Yes.

348
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,625
Right?

349
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,333
Huh?

350
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,625
Oh, I mean…

351
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:39,875
Well...

352
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,875
This is just a coincidence.

353
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:46,541
Fate is just what you say
to make coincidences sound cooler.

354
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,041
Oh.

355
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,166
Yeah, that's true. You're right.

356
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:54,791
Yes.

357
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,291
-Ms. Sugawara.
-Hmm?

358
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:22,041
Well, I wasn't sure if it's a good idea
to offer you our coffee,

359
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,750
but I figured it's important
for you to know our current state.

360
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,250
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

361
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,791
-I appreciate it.
-The pleasure's mine.

362
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,500
-Let's give it a try.
-Please.

363
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,416
Hmm…

364
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,500
It kind of makes you go silent.

365
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:50,000
Is that so?

366
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,083
I'm sorry.

367
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,250
It's fine. It only motivates me.

368
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,583
This space is nice.

369
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,541
I like it.

370
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,833
It really is nice.

371
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:06,208
Thank you. I'm glad to hear it.

372
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:11,791
Coffee from a university café
should make you feel like chatting, right?

373
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,166
Yeah.

374
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:21,250
Yeah, so I think something
a bit milder would be better.

375
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,083
Sorry.

376
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,875
I'd always disliked coffee,

377
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:31,083
so I haven't learned much until recently.

378
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,125
Oh, really?

379
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,041
Yes.

380
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,875
I had a bit of a major surgery

381
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:42,083
and experienced some changes
in my physical disposition.

382
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,583
Now I really like coffee.

383
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,916
That can happen, huh?

384
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,833
Yeah.

385
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,250
Welcome to being a coffee addict.

386
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,083
Thank you.

387
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,416
My personality changed a little too.

388
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,333
I, um…

389
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,333
Well…

390
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,000
What? Please tell me.

391
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,666
What similarities were there

392
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,708
between me and the one you loved?

393
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

394
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:24,958
No, it's fine.

395
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,041
Um…

396
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,083
Was he a fun guy?

397
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,708
Yes, incredibly so.

398
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:37,458
Wow, so maybe my changes
are why I resemble him.

399
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,791
I was originally pretty dull.

400
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:43,041
I've never thought of myself as fun.

401
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:44,625
I see.

402
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,708
Did he like coffee?

403
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,041
Yes, he even ran a café.

404
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,875
Wow, that's impressive.

405
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,041
But I was better at making coffee.

406
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,041
Oh, really?

407
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,375
I really loved him.

408
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,000
But he died.

409
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:04,916
What?

410
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,833
Oh, I'm sorry.

411
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh, don't be.
I shouldn't have said that during work.

412
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,333
No, I'm the one who brought it up.

413
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,625
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

414
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:24,625
Um…

415
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:30,708
I want this project to go well.

416
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:34,750
Of course.

417
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:36,541
Let's do our best.

418
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,833
Hey, where is it?

419
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:41,750
Mr. Shinoda, it's over here.

420
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,541
-You mean this way?
-What?

421
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,791
Oh, um…

422
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,708
Wow.

423
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:08,916
I dreamed of meeting you one day,
and now you're here.

424
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,291
This is fate.

425
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,333
Was it you?

426
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,166
-What?
-This thing here.

427
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,916
Oh, right. Yes.

428
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:26,916
Thank you.

429
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,666
No, it's fine.

430
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,083
I'm truly thankful.

431
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:34,208
Leave this to me.

432
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,291
I'll bring you back to life.

433
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:52,666
-The large Typhoon 13…
-Seems like a big one.

434
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,791
Will the trains be okay?

435
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:58,250
Looks like we should
clock out early today.

436
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,916
It's moving northeast
at a speed of 20 kilometers an hour

437
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,750
and is expected to soon hit Hokkaido.

438
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,500
With the typhoon drawing near,
Hokkaido will enter the storm area…

439
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:17,791
Where's Mr. Shinoda?

440
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:20,208
Oh, he went to the college campus earlier.

441
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,375
He was worried about the roaster.

442
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,416
Seriously?

443
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,041
Will he be okay?

444
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,541
Hey!

445
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,125
-Uncover it.
-Hold on.

446
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:37,916
Wait.

447
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,958
Did you uncover it?

448
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,875
-Okay
-All right.

449
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,125
Okay.

450
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,958
-Hand me that.
-Here.

451
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,375
Hello?

452
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:52,208
Kazu, is everything okay over there?

453
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,375
Yeah, we're fine. What about you?

454
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,750
-Brought it.
-It goes there.

455
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,458
We're bringing the apples in.

456
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,041
I think we'll finish in time.

457
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,000
That's good to hear.

458
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,333
All the trains have stopped.

459
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,166
The lounge is open
for students who are stranded,

460
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,666
so I think I'll stay the night
until I can get home.

461
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:13,875
Okay, got it. I'll stay safe.

462
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,291
Watch over everything at home, okay?

463
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,041
Come in.

464
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:25,916
Hello.

465
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:28,041
-Hey.
-How is everything?

466
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,708
Nothing seems amiss.

467
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,833
I see.

468
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,041
I hope it clears up quickly.

469
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:37,375
Well, I don't see that
happening any time soon.

470
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,500
It's going to be a long night.

471
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I see…

472
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,166
Wow, look at all that rain.

473
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,833
Huh?

474
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:10,791
I'm borrowing this.

475
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,416
What are you doing over here?

476
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,750
When I got out of the taxi,
the rain and wind were so strong,

477
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,250
I couldn't move.

478
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,416
But it's fine. I don't want to bother you.

479
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
-It's not fine at all.
-What?

480
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,750
It's going to get worse. Come with me.

481
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,000
I'll take this.

482
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,500
Thank you.

483
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,416
Where's Mr. Shinoda?

484
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,791
He's inside, safe and sound.

485
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,500
Oh, I see. What a relief.

486
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:42,875
Are you okay?

487
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,583
Yes.

488
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,916
-Let's go.
-What?

489
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:37,208
Yes. I see.

490
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,250
Mr. Shinoda.

491
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,208
Hey. You came?

492
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,500
Yes. I was worried about you.

493
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,333
I thought you'd fly away.

494
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,333
Don't be ridiculous.

495
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,833
I guess we're staying up all night.

496
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,083
Yes.

497
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,208
Isn't this kind of exciting?

498
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:07,250
A university campus at night.

499
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,625
Feels like something could happen.

500
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:23,166
POTATOES

501
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,625
We made some buttered potatoes.

502
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,750
-Are they ready?
-Coming right up.

503
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,208
Do we have coffee?

504
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:36,958
Could I use some?

505
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,666
-Hello.
-Hello.

506
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,083
Here you go.

507
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,291
That must've been heavy.

508
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,083
-Here's coffee.
-Here.

509
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,416
Thank you.

510
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,083
Take some butter too.

511
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,083
Here you go.

512
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:54,875
-Excuse me. I'll help.
-Oh, hello.

513
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:55,791
Enjoy.

514
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,791
Sorry, can you get that pot?

515
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,583
-Oh, please put it here.
-Okay.

516
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:01,291
Here you go.

517
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,208
-Is this spot okay?
-Yes, thank you.

518
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:06,041
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

519
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,083
Enjoy.

520
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,916
We have warm buttered potatoes here.

521
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:11,583
-Careful. It's hot.
-Okay.

522
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,000
-Here.
-Thank you.

523
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,291
-Careful. It's hot.
-Thank you.

524
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,208
-Here.
-Thank you.

525
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,083
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

526
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,625
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

527
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:23,916
-Here.
-Thank you.

528
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,916
Of course.

529
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,041
-Here.
-Thank you.

530
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,625
Do you need a blanket?

531
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,708
-We're fine.
-We're fine.

532
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,375
Sorry, do we still have water?

533
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,291
Water? I'll bring some from downstairs.

534
00:35:58,375 --> 00:35:59,833
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

535
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,666
I really like libraries.

536
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,083
I've never seen this one before.

537
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:33,666
Hmm?

538
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,708
Come on…

539
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,750
Don't look at me while I'm sleeping.

540
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,625
Yusuke.

541
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:05,375
Jeez, are you watching me sleep again?

542
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,375
Oh.

543
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:22,666
Oh, I'm sorry.

544
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,416
No, don't be.

545
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,416
Um…

546
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,250
Yes?

547
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:39,458
Well…

548
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,583
There's something I want to tell you
that just came to mind.

549
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,166
Okay.

550
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:55,666
Can I say it?

551
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:58,875
Okay.

552
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,000
It's what I couldn't say…

553
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,500
on your birthday.

554
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:22,083
Happy birthday.

555
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,208
Today…

556
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,208
should be a public holiday worldwide.

557
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,041
It's a special day.

558
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:51,125
The Birthday of Saeko Sugawara.

559
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,750
Because you were born…

560
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:04,416
the world is a brighter place.

561
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,416
You bring happiness to the world.

562
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,208
Thank you.

563
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,916
Thank you…

564
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:28,708
for being born.

565
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,500
Happy birthday.

566
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,083
How…

567
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:53,916
Why…

568
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,333
Yusuke?
