=The Glamorous Revenge=

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,980
=Episode 22=

21
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,319
Miss Xu is showing signs of poisoning.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,000
She must have ingested
the poison some time ago.

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,680
This poison only causes
drowsiness at first.

24
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,959
But, over time,

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,400
it will damage the internal organs,

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,120
or even lead to a condition
where the soul seems to leave the body.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,599
In the worst case,

28
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,080
she might not even
recognize her closest kin.

29
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,519
And if it comes to that,

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,080
I'm afraid...

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,959
What will happen?

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
If there's no antidote,

33
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,800
she might

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
die from the poison.

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,599
Is there an antidote for this poison?

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,400
This poison

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,680
is very unique.

38
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,119
Unless we find the one who made it,

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,720
there may be no cure.

40
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,759
I understand.

41
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,039
I'm afraid

42
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,759
I can't help with this.

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,119
I'll take my leave now.

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,559
If I had known this,

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,080
I wouldn't have let her meet Zhou Jia.

46
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,880
This isn't your fault.

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,679
She became like this because of me.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
Right now,

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,880
the most important thing
is to find the antidote.

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,919
Please take good care of her for me.

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,600
Your Majesty.

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,320
Your Majesty arrives.

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,520
Forgive me for not
welcoming you properly.

54
00:02:59,119 --> 00:02:59,520
I am

55
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,880
guilty beyond forgiveness.

56
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,559
Rise.

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,520
I am guilty,

58
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,919
and I have no face to meet Your Majesty.

59
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,919
This matter has not been concluded yet.

60
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,360
I came today

61
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,440
to hear what the Chancellor has to say.

62
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,320
Please rise.

63
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

64
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,119
Your

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,039
old leg injury flared up again?

66
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,720
Whenever the weather is humid,

67
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,520
the pain becomes unbearable.

68
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,119
But it's been so many years,

69
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,279
I've gotten used to it.

70
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,479
It's nothing serious.

71
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,000
Please, Your Majesty.

72
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,720
Before Zhou Jia died, he accused you

73
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,119
of corruption,

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,679
deceiving the royal us,

75
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,000
and even

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
harboring rebellious intentions.

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Your Majesty,

78
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,880
I dare not!

79
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,320
Zhou Jia...

80
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,119
Zhou Jia deserved to die.

81
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,720
His accusations were
nothing but slander.

82
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,119
Do not believe his words, Your Majesty.

83
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,360
Your Majesty,

84
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,679
considering

85
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,720
that most officials
in the imperial court

86
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,119
are my disciples,

87
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,360
if I were truly rebellious,

88
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,679
the entire imperial court
would be in chaos.

89
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,320
It's true that once they heard
you were in trouble,

90
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,039
every one of them

91
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,959
immediately submitted petitions

92
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
on your behalf.

93
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,320
Even an old servant like me

94
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:23,720
sometimes

95
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,480
misjudges people.

96
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,119
Speaking of Zhou Jia,

97
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,920
I supported him back then,

98
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:29,959
but I didn't expect him

99
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,920
to be so greedy.

100
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,119
He embezzled the military pays

101
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,119
and repeatedly

102
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,320
pressured me

103
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,559
to recommend him

104
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,959
for Your Majesty

105
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,720
to be the General of the nation.

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,480
I refused him many times

107
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,399
and eventually scolded him harshly.

108
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,720
He held a grudge against me for that.

109
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,920
According to what you told me,

110
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,399
it indicates that you suffered

111
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,920
because you were acting
in my best interest?

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,679
Your Majesty

113
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,959
is wise and discerning.

114
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,160
After Zhou Jia's death,

115
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,359
I feared for the stability
of the military,

116
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
so I immediately sent someone

117
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,079
to comfort them.

118
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,519
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

119
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:07,720
I will

120
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,480
do my best

121
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,600
to make up for my mistakes.

122
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,000
The Chancellor remains

123
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,519
as thorough as ever.

124
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,320
Being able to ease
Your Majesty's burdens,

125
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,440
I will

126
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,119
never refuse.

127
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,320
Now that this matter

128
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,320
has caused such an uproar
in the imperial court,

129
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,799
if I handle it hastily,

130
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,279
people might accuse

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,559
me of

132
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,119
favoritism toward you.

133
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,079
Your Majesty need not worry.

134
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,000
I will not let this put you
in a difficult position.

135
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,679
I humbly ask Your Majesty
to issue a decree

136
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
confining me

137
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
to my residence,

138
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,320
so I may reflect on my mistakes

139
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,920
and calm the public's concerns.

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,679
Lin Muxuan.

141
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,399
Where are you going?

142
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,480
I can't just stand by and watch her die.

143
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,640
Please

144
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,279
take care of Zhaozhao for me.

145
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,000
The Shadow Pavilion

146
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,079
has lost many men
to the Chancellor Residence.

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,760
You're the only one left now.

148
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,480
Are you sending yourself to death?

149
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,399
No matter what,

150
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,959
as long as there's a chance,

151
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,799
I have to try.

152
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,279
If you die,

153
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,359
there will be no hope
for Zhaozhao anymore.

154
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,119
Young Master Lin.

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,399
Young Master Lin,

156
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,679
I've brought something

157
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,399
that may

158
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,519
help you.

159
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:39,920
This isn't the antidote.

160
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,320
But, it can temporarily

161
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
suppress the poison.

162
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,519
Why would you help us?

163
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,359
Who knows if this is an antidote

164
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,799
or a poison?

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,799
Young Master Lin,

166
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,519
you can try it yourself.

167
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,720
If you are satisfied,

168
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,679
the person who gifted you this

169
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,519
invites you to a game of chess tomorrow

170
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,200
at Fragrant Pavilion.

171
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:58,920
Farewell.

172
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,519
This person is not to be trusted.

173
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,679
You cannot go.

174
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,920
We have no other options.

175
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,279
Even if it's a trap,

176
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,000
I have to try.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,160
Now, the black pieces

178
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,760
are in a dire situation.

179
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,000
Young Master Lin,

180
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,399
it's your turn.

181
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,679
(Ever since the entire
Bai family was annihilated,)

182
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,959
(I've been plotting
and scheming to revenge.)

183
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,279
(For this,)

184
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,760
(I've even manipulated innocent people.)

185
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,160
(My buddies)

186
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,160
(sacrificed to protect me.)

187
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,760
Young Master Lin,

188
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,519
sometimes

189
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,200
attacking the weak spots

190
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,040
can be just as effective.

191
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,920
One wrong move

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,359
can lose the entire game.

193
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,359
But,

194
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,959
if you play this game right,

195
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,119
you can protect

196
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,519
more than just

197
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,200
this black piece.

198
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,079
To win,

199
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,440
you must win the whole game.

200
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:25,959
Success or failure

201
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,600
doesn't hinge on one piece alone.

202
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,119
(The past is gone.)

203
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,480
(I can't make the same mistakes again.)

204
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,039
(What matters now)

205
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,280
(is saving Zhaozhao.)

206
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,640
Great!

207
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,520
One move solves two problems.

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,840
What an awesome game!

209
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,960
Young Master Lin,

210
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,000
today

211
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,200
you've helped me
with this chess dilemma.

212
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,000
I have a gift

213
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:55,479
for you.

214
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,840
Lin Muxuan,

215
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,559
this person

216
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,719
is quite capable.

217
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,440
Everyone,

218
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,599
do you believe

219
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
the existence of

220
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,919
Disguise Technique?

221
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,520
(Oral Narrative)

222
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,320
There are rumors

223
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,919
that the Bai family of Yingchuan

224
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,080
possesses

225
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,760
a secret book of the Disguise Technique.

226
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,919
But three years ago,

227
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,799
(Oral Narrative)
the Bai family

228
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,119
suffered a great tragedy.

229
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Ever since then,

230
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,960
the people in the town

231
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,719
have been disappearing constantly.

232
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,239
Everyone, please

233
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,400
think carefully,

234
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,760
could there be a connection

235
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,359
between these two things?

236
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:49,919
(Oral Narrative)

237
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,479
It turns out

238
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,440
that the person
who killed the Bai family

239
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,679
and the one kidnapping people

240
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,479
are the same.

241
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,760
This powerful official

242
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,760
has been using his authority,

243
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,159
asking his subordinates
to arrest the innocent people,

244
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,159
and have their faces skinned.

245
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,760
Not only that,

246
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,000
but he's also corrupt.

247
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:13,559
Liu,

248
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,280
you lead the others
to distract the guards.

249
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,960
If there's danger, run immediately.

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,599
Understood?

251
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:17,960
Understood!

252
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,400
Go!

253
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,400
Uncle.

254
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:23,840
Uncle.

255
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,400
Uncle, please pity us.

256
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,599
Uncle.

257
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:26,320
What are you doing?

258
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,080
Uncle, please pity us.

259
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,359
Get off!

260
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,559
Everyone, take a look here!

261
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,840
The Chancellor Residence...

262
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,159
Get off!

263
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,159
Buying and selling official positions!

264
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,559
Accepting bribes!

265
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,599
The Chancellor Residence is corrupt!

266
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,159
What are you doing?

267
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,960
Buying and selling official positions!

268
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,559
The Chancellor Residence

269
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,799
is corrupt!

270
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,760
This man is already
in such a high position,

271
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,119
(Oral Narrative)
but still trying hard to climb higher.

272
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,760
Is he plotting to usurp the throne?

273
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,599
Usurping the throne!

274
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,760
Sir,

275
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,599
are you referring
to the current Chancellor?

276
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,599
Yes, it's him.

277
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,000
The Chancellor's accounts of corruption

278
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,239
have all been posted
outside his residence.
