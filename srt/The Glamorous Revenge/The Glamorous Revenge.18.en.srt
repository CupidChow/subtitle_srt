Xu Zhaozhao,

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,960
you've just barely been released.

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,520
If you dare play tricks on me,

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,740
I'll kill you immediately.

30
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,520
General Zhou,

31
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,119
the military pay you owed
is not a small amount.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,880
And, I am

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,440
willing to help you

34
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,960
make up for the deficit.

35
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,119
I only have one request.

36
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,360
Let's join forces

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,559
and get rid of Zuo Wenan.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,839
That's

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,759
not enough.

40
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,119
What if

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,559
I add evidence
of Zuo Wenan's corruption?

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,000
If it were that easy to bring him down,

43
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,720
I wouldn't have tolerated him
for so many years.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,759
He's second only to the emperor,

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,960
and he's much respected
by all the laymen.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
Then, we'll let

47
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,199
the emperor deal with him.

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,520
General Zhou,

49
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,520
this is your only chance.

00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:50,639

51
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,160
Aren't you curious about what it is?

52
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,240
It's your turn to make a move now,

53
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,839
General Zhou.

54
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,320
Lin Muxuan!

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,799

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,119
Today is your last chance.

57
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,359
Tell,

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
or not tell?

59
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,799
Stop talking nonsense.

60
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,239
Just go ahead.

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,119
What's the rush?

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,440
Chancellor.

64
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,160
Something bad happens.

65
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,959
General Zhou has led the troop
into the Chancellor Residence.

66
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,040
What?

67
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:48,640
Follow me over there!

68
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,160
- Yes!
- Yes!

How dare you!

71
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,559
Here's the imperial decree.

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,040
By the grace of heaven's will,

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,399
His Majesty hereby proclaims

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,320
that Chancellor Zuo Wenan

75
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,760
is suspected of violating
the laws of the nation,

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,440
sowing disorder and rebellion.

77
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,399
The Chancellor should
be immediately taken

78
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,760
to the Ministry of Justice

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,359
for a thorough investigation.

80
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,239
This is the Emperor's command.

81
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,160
Chancellor,

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
please make your move.

83
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,559
Lin Muxuan.

84
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,200
Zhaozhao.

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,799
Don't speak.

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,959
I'll get you out of here.

87
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:46,320
Zhou Jia,

88
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,839
do you think by betraying me
to the Emperor,

89
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,160
you'll have a good end?

90
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,839
Don't forget that I still
have leverage against you.

91
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,359
I am

92
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,720
under imperial command
to arrest the criminal Chancellor.

93
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,559
However, the Chancellor resisted
and attempted to escape.

94
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,200
I had no choice but to chase after him.

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,559
Then, the Chancellor

96
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,160
took his own life to avoid punishment.

97
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,399
So, I bring back only

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,600
your corpse.

99
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,720
You've created a nice story.

100
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,559
But, too bad

101
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,760
you won't get the chance
to tell this to Him.

102
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,920
Never forget,

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,959
it was you who helped me eliminate
my biggest obstacle in the same way,

104
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,559
which allowed you to rise in rank.

105
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,119

107

108

Where is Zhaozhao?

109
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,000
You should rest and recover for now.

110
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,959
Just leave everything else

111
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,720

112

No.
