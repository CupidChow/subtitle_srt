"If he's not around"?

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,199
Isn't this just the "Blossom Contest"?

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,239
Could there

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
be some changes?

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,559
Forget it.

27
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,559
Let's focus on the task at hand.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,760
Only these?

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,199
The Shadow Pavilion is still acquiring.

30
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,639
Everything will be received
after two days.

31
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:01,959
You fetched it personally.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't let her find out.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,839
Master, if you don't want
Miss Xu to take the risk,

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,680
we can come up with another plan.

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
We shouldn't miss this opportunity.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
As for Xu Zhaozhao,

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
I'll weigh the situation.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,199
Such delicate craftsmanship.

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,160
Lin Muxuan, look at this.

40
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,360
What are you thinking about?

41
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:31,839
Nothing.

42
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,399
Why don't we head back first?

43
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,800
I've asked Lin Fan
to buy the cosmetics things.

44
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,440
Didn't you say a makeup artist
should have tools that suit them,

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,839
just like how a martial artist
has their own weapons?

46
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,360
Or are you tired?

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,360
Shall we go back first?

48
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,080
No, I'll stay with you.

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,600
Stop.

50
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,279
What's inside?

51
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,199
Officer, these are our fresh herbs.

52
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,240
Fresh herbs.

53
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
You may go.

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,039
Xu Zhaozhao.

55
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,479
Xu Zhaozhao!

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,240
The experiment on new
alchemical puppet failed again.

57
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,160
It seems over the years,

58
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,279
you still haven't learned
to be well-behaved.

59
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,600
General Zhou is here.

60
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,000
Chancellor.

61
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:40,600
Here is the official list
of participants for the Blossom Contest.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,960
Please take a look.

63
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,420
(Beauty Pavilion, Xu Zhaozhao)

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,800
Have you seen a lady?

65
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,240
She has big eyes.

66
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,000
About this tall.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,800
No.

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,039
Master!

69
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,440
Master!

70
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,000
Have you found her?

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,600
No, Master. Please don't worry.

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,039
What?

73
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,559
Xu Zhaozhao might not
have been captured by Zhou Jia.

74
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,520
I know without her, the plan will...

75
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,759
Who cares about the plan at this point!

76
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,760
Hurry up! Find her now!

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

78
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,480
Xu Zhaozhao.

79
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,480
Please, nothing must happen to you.

80
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,799
Please, nothing must happen to you.

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,000

86

Why didn't you inform me?

87
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,559
Do you know that I...

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,799
I...

89
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,959
I've already told you,

90
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,600
you didn't hear me.

91
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,839
Look.

92
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,160
I bought you a sword.

93
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
It cost me all the silver

94
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,279
I've earned recently.

95
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,440
It is very expensive.

96
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,679
You don't like this?

97
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,760
I'll exchange it for another one.

98
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,359
I like it very much.

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,480
But, why did you give me this?

100
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,160
It's because of the strange thing
you said the other day.

101
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,640
Although I don't know what will happen,

102
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,959
I have a feeling

103
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,040
that something will happen

104
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,440
on the day of the Blossom Contest.

105
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,239
I don't want you to be in danger,

106
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,359
so I bought you a sword
to defend yourself.

107
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,399

you kiss someone like this?

118
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,760
This is a gift of gratitude

119
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,359
from the borderlands.

120
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,799
You're taking advantage of me.

121
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,760
I'll teach you
the Floating Cloud Sword Technique

122
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,040
as compensation.

123
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,399
Raise it a little higher,

124
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,760
keep your hands steady.

125
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,359
I can't hold it anymore.

126
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm done.

127
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,000
This sword is so heavy.

128
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,760
I should've gotten you a lighter one.

129

If you don't learn now,

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,359
when you face trouble in the future,

131
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,079
you won't even have
a way to protect yourself.

132
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,600
I can run away.

133
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,959
Moreover, what kind
of trouble would I get into?

134
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,359
Xu Zhaozhao,

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,359
this Blossom Contest

136
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,239
is far too difficult for you.

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,160
If you want to give up now,

138
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,079
I won't oppose it.

139
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
What makes you suddenly become kind?

140
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,320
Or...

141
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,000
Are you

142
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,679
regretting you kissed me earlier?

143
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,760
Don't even think about backing out.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,079
I tell you,

145
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,200
the champion for the Blossom contest
will obtain a lot of silver.

146
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,160
You don't try
to keep it all for yourself.

147
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,160
I'll continue.

148
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,040
The Blossom Contest is drawing near,

149
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,239
yet you keep persuading
Zhaozhao to quit.

150
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,799
Have you

151
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,480
fallen for her?

152
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,239
Shall we change the plan then?

153
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,600
There's still time to give the order.

154
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,559
I cannot let my personal feelings

155
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,000
to forsake the blood feud
of the Bai family.

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,160
I will do everything I can
to protect her.

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If something unfortunate happens to me,

158
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,839
