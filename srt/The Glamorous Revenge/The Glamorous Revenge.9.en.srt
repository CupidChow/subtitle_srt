21
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:45,279
How about it? Do you feel like
you're in the past now?

22
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,639
I do look good

23
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,480
with these wild flowers on my hair.

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,480
Actually, it's not that you wish

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,839
to restore your once
youthful appearance.

26
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:55,000
You just wish to replicate
that sense of shyness and joy.

27
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:58,599
That's how you felt
when you first fell in love.

28
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,480
The sense of falling in love

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,839
is something that others
find difficult to replace or replicate.

30
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,279
Master, everything has been arranged for.

31
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,839
Got it.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,639
As for Miss Xu,

33
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,000
if your plan does work,

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,520
I'm afraid she'll be...

35
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,520
Since it has come to this,

36
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,399
there's no choice but to do so.

37
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,520
Proceed according to plan.

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,440
Miss Zhaozhao,

39
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,839
are you sure I look okay?

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,240
You look very beautiful.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,800
You can ask them
if you don't believe me.

42
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,919
Go now.

43
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,479
You've been waiting for this day
for so many years.

44
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:50,639
General Zhou.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,440
Miss, what do you need?

46
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,520
General Zhou,

47
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,479
do you still remember me?

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
Miss,

49
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,520
we've never met before.

50
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:01,399
May I help you?

51
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,279
I...

52
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm Qiluo.

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,320
Did you forget about me?

54
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:06,639
Qiluo?

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
He's not even getting off the horse.

56
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,080
Don't tell me he forgot about her?

57
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,800
That shouldn't be.

58
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,639
Although Qiluo is old now,

59
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,919
she didn't change much.

60
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,240
Don't tell me he's pretending
to be ignorant?

61
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,600
Miss Qiluo might be disappointed.

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,639
She's so pitiful.

63
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,399
She's all by herself.
No one's there to back her up.

64
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,520
Who said so?

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,639
I'll demand an account from him
on her behalf right now.

66
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,960
General Zhou,

67
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
I assume you forgot about her
because you were too busy.

68
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,199
Hand over the Bai Family's
Disguise Technique!

69
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,720
Arrest them!

70
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,039
What are you doing?

71
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,039
Miss, you don't need to be nervous.

72
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,800
You just look familiar.

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,240
Have we seen each other before?

74
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,320
Stop pretending.

75
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,320
Take a close look.

76
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,119
Look at her.

77
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,040
Do you know her?

78
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:20,679
I have never seen her before.

79
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,519
But since fate has led us to each other,

80
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,399
ladies,

81
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,640
why don't we have a meal together?

82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,320
Master, don't you think
it's fun to see her provoking him?

83
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,000
Look at that Zhou fellow.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,839
He keeps staring at Zhaozhao.

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,239
Now, he's asking her
to join him for a meal.

86
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,559
I'm sure he intends to strike soon...

87
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,839
Tell Xu Zhaozhao to come back.

88
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,559
If so, our plan is...

89
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,679
Right now.

90
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,640
Yes, sir.

91
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,440
This area is quite deserted.

92
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm afraid it's quite unsafe.

93
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,920
You guys should follow me home.

94
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,119
Miss, Young Master wants you
to take Miss Qiluo back to our residence.

95
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,040
But...

96
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,880
General, thank you for your intention.

97
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,959
I shall not bother you.

98
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,720
But...

99
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,640
Chancellor, this is
the new alchemical puppet.

100
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,920
This is merely something trivial.

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,519
You shouldn't deliver it
to me personally in the future

102
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
so that other people
won't have the goods on you.

103
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,679
Yes, Chancellor.

104
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,399
Chancellor,

105
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,000
I have a request.

106
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,200
Regarding the military supplies,

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,040
I find it difficult
to cover the deficit.

108
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,079
Chancellor, please lend me a hand.

109
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,799
You started the coin speculation
of your own accord.

110
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,799
Even I can't help you out.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,519
By the way,

112
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,600
the new Blossom Contest

113
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,440
will begin in a few more days.

114
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,679
Chancellor, please honor us
with your presence by then.

115
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,720
Honor you with my presence?

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,839
The Blossom Contest has already
been held for three years,

117
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,200
yet none of them could
compete with the Bai Family.

118
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,920
There's no point in attending it.

119
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,600
Chancellor, I'm sure you'll be
pleasantly surprised this time around.

120
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,839
If that's the case,

121
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,600
I'll be looking forward
to your performance, then.

122
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,839
If you stay loyal to me,

123
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,640
I won't leave you in the lurch.

124
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:33,480
Thank you, Chancellor.

125
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,399
Lin Muxuan, guess
what's in my hand right now?

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,839
Congratulations.

127
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,799
I can't hide anything from you, huh?

128
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,640
Initially, I wanted
to give you a surprise.

129
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,600
I'm very happy
that you've obtained the right

130
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,920
to participate in the Blossom Contest.

131
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,200
Xu Zhaozhao, you're great.

132
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,839
You're even better
than what I've imagined.

133
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,040
But of course.

134
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,959
Don't worry.

135
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,600
I'll definitely win the Blossom Contest

136
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,920
