(Bingxin, the top courtesan, is hiring
a makeup artist for 10,000 gold taels)

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,319
She's hiring for

23
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,400
10,000 gold taels?

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,440
My goodness.

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,120
I suggest you guys
spare yourself from the trouble.

26
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,919
Even the Grand Beauty Hall
can't deal with her demands.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,879
It's not that easy

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
to earn her money.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,360
I'm sure it's difficult
to earn her money.

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,160
Excuse me.

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,519

The appearance of a new shopkeeper
at Beauty Pavilion

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,839
has already caused a stir.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,479
Next,

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,119
I would like to seek your help.

39
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,240
I'm indebted to you.

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,080
Of course I have to repay your kindness.

Please wait a moment.

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,600
I'll try and see which one
of them suits you better.

45
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,360
Miss Bingxin.

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,119
Are you the person
who took down my notice?

47
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,679
Your Beauty Pavilion
doesn't look as grand

48
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:07,039
as Grand Beauty Hall.

49
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,960
Miss,

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,399
as the saying goes,

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,960
“It's not the size
of the dog in the fight,

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,320
but the size of the fight in the dog."

53
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,360
Our customers are akin to our parents.

54
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,479
How could one's parents

55
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,279
be hard to serve?

56
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,360
Miss,

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,679
I heard that you're hiring
a makeup artist for 10,000 gold taels

58
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,639
to prepare for

59
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,279
the courtesan selection in three days.

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,800
Everyone is giving it their all

61
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,600
for the next selection.

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,559
Therefore, my makeup

63
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,520
must take them by surprise.

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,839
At least

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,240
my makeup must resemble
the Golden Phoenix Makeup in some form.

66
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:51,960
Miss,

67
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,919
I'll be blunt with you.

68
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:55,600
That makeup

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
doesn't suit you.

70
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:10,880
Lin Muxuan,

71
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,000
Bingxin is very picky.

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,520
I'm sure an ordinary makeup
won't even catch her attention.

73
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,519
Since you're an amazing makeup artist,

74
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,079
why don't you impart
some of your techniques to me?

75
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,480
Many makeup artists have tried

76
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,480
to put on makeup for her.

77
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,440
Most of them
failed to satisfy her demands.

78
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,399
That means

79
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,679
she doesn't want something eye-catching.

80
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,600
She wants something
that truly suits her.

81
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:29,880
You do have a point.

82
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:36,959
You!

83
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,519
How could you just
take that with you casually?

84
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,200
One can paint a tiger's fur,

85
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,040
but not its skeleton.

86
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,000
If you wish to be good
at putting on makeup,

87
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,880
you have to understand
the skeletal structure

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,399
of a human face.

89
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,440
Since you'll be taking over
Beauty Pavilion,

90
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,399
you have to learn

91
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,600
how to do Imitation Makeup eventually.

92
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,519
You can practice with this first.

93
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,320
I...

94
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,040
I dare not do so.

95
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,799
I don't dare to touch it!

96
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,920
What about this?

97
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,480
You can touch my face.

98
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,079
I said, touch my face.

99
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,600
Feel it with your heart.

100
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Do you understand the difference?

101
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,839
No.

102
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,040
Forget it.

103
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,200
There's no point
in being impatient here.

104
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,239
We can continue the training tomorrow.

105
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,040
No.

106
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,640
I've already accepted the task.

107
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,160
I should touch your face again.

108
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:22,559
I was referring

109
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:23,519
to it.

110
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,640
This makeup looks
fresh and elegant on me.

111
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,079
Shopkeeper Xu, seems like
you've done your homework.

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,920
Miss Bingxin,
thank you for the compliment.

113
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,880
But we lack the icing on the cake.

114
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,119
Miss, I'll deliver it to you
during the selection.

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,320
I guarantee it'll be eye-catching.

116
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,679
Make way.

117
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,839
Hurry up.

118
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,440
You won't be able
to see my masterpiece if you're late.

119
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,480
Did you forget?

120
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,399
I've watched you practice the same thing
in the shop countless times.

121
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,160
How could that be the same?

122
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,279
Bingxin is coming!

123
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,239
No wonder you added the drape.

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,880
She looks reserved
and elegant with it.

125
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,480
It adds a touch of girlish charm
to her look.

126
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,640
What do you think?

127
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,480
It's pretty good, right?

128
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,880
What about

129
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,000
we make a bet?

130
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,920
I bet that Bingxin
will be selected as the top courtesan.

131
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,399
How can the bet be valid
when we're betting on the same result?

132
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,399
It's because I chose
the right shopkeeper.

133
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,040
Everyone,

134
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:55,839
please shout out

135
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,239
the name

136
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,959

137
