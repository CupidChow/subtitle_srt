What?

22
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,639
I don't know who's messing with us,

23
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,400
but we're losing ground.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,440
General, we've embezzled

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,319
military funds.

26
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,120
Shut your mouth!

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,160
Go and look into it.

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

29
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,279
Who did it?

30
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,400
Don't let me catch him!

31
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,559
I'm back.

32
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,960
Kids, I'm back.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,839
What took you so long, Miss Zhaozhao?

34
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:12,639
Yes.

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,160
Miss Zhaozhao,

36
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,039
how did you do that?

37
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,559
You're as pretty as a fairy.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,960
So I wasn't a fairy before?

39
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,559
Miss Zhaozhao, where have you been?

40
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,320
- We're starving.
- We're starving.

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,919
You guys don't know
I met a weird guy today.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,600
I almost didn't make it back.

43
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,520
Miss Zhaozhao,

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,720
is he the weird guy
you're talking about?

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,080
You...

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,160
I'm a friend of your sister's.

47
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,160
Your sister bought you something

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,320
and forgot to take it.

49
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,360
Stay still.

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
What do you want?

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm sorry for abducting you

52
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,006
earlier,

53
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,919
so

54
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,160
I've brought some gifts
for you in person.

55
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,240
Is that a visit

56
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,759
or a threat?

57
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,320
Here it is.

58
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,520
You bad girl,

59
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,559
I knew

60
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,360
you'd come back to Ciyou Hall.

61
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,520
Let's see where you can run this time.

62
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,119
Darn girl,

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,000
give us back our money.

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Or

65
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,360
I'll burn this house down

66
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,839
and leave you with no place to live.

67
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,639
Yes.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,919
Give us our money back.

69
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,520
Come on.

70
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,240
Liu, get them out of here.

71
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,279
Quick.

72
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,119
Go inside now.

73
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:27,559
Pay up!

74
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,639
Yes, pay up!

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,520
In business, there are
always profits and losses.

76
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,759
Why didn't you appreciate me
when I made you earn a profit?

77
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,759
How dare she quibble?

78
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,679
Let's go

79
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,080
and burn down her house first!

80
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,759
You... Who are you?

81
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,759
How much does she owe you?

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,399
I'll pay it for her.

83
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,559
Is there really such a good thing?

84
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,919
You don't have to look at me like that.

85
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,199
I'm helping you

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
on a condition.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,600
Of course

88
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,759
you can refuse.

89
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,160
Darn girl,

90
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:56,320
say yes

91
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,759
and let him pay back the money for you.

92
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:58,759
Otherwise,

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,199
I'll burn down Ciyou Hall now.

94
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,039
Hey.

95
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,440
Gosh, say yes now.

96
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,160
Pay us back immediately!

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,720
Yeah.

98
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,640
Come on.

99
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,119
Gosh, you...

100
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,040
Okay.

101
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,720
Yes, please help me.

102
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,160
Tell me.

103
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,760
You paid the money for me
and did my make-up for me,

104
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,160
what do you want?

105
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
What is this?

106
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,640
Promissory note.

107
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,760
Promissory note?

108
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,519
The money I just paid out
to the small investors for you

109
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,200
is 1,396 taels.

110
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,920
You'll work as a maid at my mansion
for 10 wen a month,

111
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,959
with food and shelter.

112
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,160
At this rate,

113
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,640
it'll only take you 24 years

114
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,119
to pay off your debt.

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,239
How many years?

116
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,679
24 years?

117
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,359
I'll be an old woman in 24 years

118
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,320
and I'll still have to serve you
who only eats and never poops?

119
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,399
I'm a fair man.

120
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,920
If you do a good job,

121
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
I'll give you a raise.

122
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,519
By the way,

123
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:23,880
I'm

124
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,160
Lin Muxuan.

125
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,720
So you knew

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,359
that Zhou Jia was manipulating
the currency market

127
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,839
with information from the war report,

128
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,880
that's why you used your financial power

129
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,559
to disrupt the situation.

130
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,480
You're killing two birds with one stone.

131
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,000
The show has just begun.

132
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,920
Xu Zhaozhao has also stepped in.

133
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,040
Recently, our secret agents have found
a lot of suspicious people in the city.

134
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,000
They must be spies sent by Zhou Jia.

135
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,279
The bait's been laid.

136
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,040
Let's wait and see what happens.

137
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,279
Xu Zhaozhao appears
with the face of Miss Bai,

138
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,399
and Zhou Jia must believe that the
Disguise Technique is back in the world.

139
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,160
General.

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,559
Something's wrong, General.

141
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,359
We found the person
who was gathering small investors

142
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,119
against you the other day.

143
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,600
What's the fuss about?

144
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,000
She seems to be the daughter
of the Bai family.

145
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,920
Hand over the Bai family's
Disguise Technique!

146
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,320
Get them!

147
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,040
Send some trusted men.

148
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,720
Don't let it get out.

149
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,279
Keep a good eye on her.

150
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,559
Yes.

151
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,040
(Could it be the Disguise Technique?)

152
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,279
He went to all that trouble

153
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,119
to make me a maid?

154
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,799
I don't believe it.

155
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,839
It scared the shit out of me.

156
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,799
Did you just say

157
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,000
those

158
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,359
are painting tools?

159
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,559
They're

160
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,880
skulls and masks?

161
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
They're all fakes.

162
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,920
So that's what you used
for my face, too?

163
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,440
Painting and make-up are
from the same source.

164
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,959
There are masters
and mediocre painters,

165
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,920
and the same goes for make-up.

166
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,860
(Bone-changing Technique)

167
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,160
Bone-changing Technique?

168
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,279
Changing bones?

169
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,040
It's too bloody.

170
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,720
Haven't you heard

171
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,880
that beauty is in the bones,
not in the skin?

172
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,279
If you want to change
a person's appearance,

173
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,679
you have to change their bone structure.

174
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,519
Face changing?

175
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,279
Isn't face changing
just a form of disguise?

176
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Rumor has it

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,679
that there's a strange art
in the martial world

178
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,239
that comes from the Bai family
of Yingchuan.

179
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,239
But wasn't the Bai family
of Yingchuan wiped out a long time ago?

180
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:34,960
Shiwan!

181
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,239
Miss Xu,

182
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,039
it's good to be smart,

183
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,080
but it's not good for you

184
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,840
to know too much.

185
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,919
Well,

186
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm only asking because I'm curious.

187
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:03,320
I'm just curious.

188
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,239
Go about your business.

189
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,679
Go ahead.

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,479
I just asked him a question today

191
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,039
and he reacted like that.

192
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,080
Could it be

193
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,359
that he wiped out the Bai family

194
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,640
and also stole
the Bai family's secret technique?

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,239
No way.

196
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,679
I can't stay here anymore.

197
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,719
I...

198
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,479
I've got to get Liu, Qi
and the others out of here.

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,400
Master,

200
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,200
something's up.

201
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,640
Xu Zhaozhao has run away,

202
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,520
back to Ciyou Hall, I think.
