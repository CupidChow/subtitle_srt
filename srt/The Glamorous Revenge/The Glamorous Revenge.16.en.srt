21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,919
Zhaozhao.

22
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,040
Let's leave here quickly.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,760
You were also a part
of Lin Muxuan's plan.

24
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,599
Meeting you

25
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,080
was indeed arranged by him.

26
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,480
So, you knew from the beginning

27
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,480
that Lin Muxuan never liked me.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
You told me

29
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,800
that he liked me

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,279
just to avoid raising my suspicions

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,480
and keep me by his side.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,080
I'm sorry, Zhaozhao.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
So, you became friends with me

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,279
also because of Bai Shiwan?

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
No.

36
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:22,479
I truly saw you as a friend.

37
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,199
Truly?

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't even know
what "truly" means anymore.

39
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,839
Zhaozhao.

40
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,440
Zhaozhao.

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,960
Zhaozhao!

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,160
I've never considered you
as just an outsider.

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,600
Lin Muxuan wasn't indifferent
to you either.

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,679
Anyway,

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,039
he told me to wait for you here.

46
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:47,639
Where is he now?

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,399
He'll stay
at the Chancellor Residence.

48
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,199
He said

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,199
that after finding Bai Shiwan,

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,360
his desires had changed.

51
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,479
He will live happily

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
with Bai Shiwan
in the Chancellor Residence.

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,160
Let's leave here first.

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,240
What's inside here is exactly

55
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,800
the Bai family's
Disguise Technique secret book.

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,039
Bring it here.

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
The Chancellor may not know this,

58
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,559
but this box is designed
with a special mechanism.

59
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,639
If anyone other than
a Bai family descendant opens it,

60
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,160
the contents will be destroyed.

61
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,679
If that's the case,

62
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,279
then you open it.

63
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,000
You still dare to play games
with me even at this point?

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,440
Do you really think
I can't see through your trick?

65
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:58,080
I ask you one last time,

66
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,839
where exactly is

67
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,240
the Bai family's
Disguise Technique secret book?

68
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,080
There never was any
Bai family's Disguise Technique.

69
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,279
It was all

70
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,520
just a figment
of your delusional obsession.

71
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,440
Is that so?

72
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,040
I have plenty of ways

73
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,000
to torture you
until you feel neither living

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,600
nor dying,

75
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,359
until you hand over the secret book.

76
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,000
Take him away.

77
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,980
(Inner Pier)

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,799
You should leave now.

79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,200
I've already prepared a boat.

80
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,200
The children at the Ciyou Hall
are still waiting for you.

81
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,799
What about you?

82
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,399
Where else could I go?

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,440
Of course,

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,880
I'll have to go back to being a dancer.

85
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,399
You're lying.

86
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,559
It's already come to this point.

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,640
There's nothing else
you should hide from me.

88
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,440
I did deceive you alongside Lin Muxuan.

89
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,799
But from now on,

90
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,200
you should live well

91
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,359
with the children in the Ciyou Hall.

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,160
I'll go back to my Twilight Pavilion.

93
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,359
Do you still need this

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
to return to Twilight Pavilion?

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,640
This is my...

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,079
If you don't tell me the truth,

97
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,480
I won't leave.

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
It's Lin Muxuan,

99
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,079
right?

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,799
He told me there was a way to save you,

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
but I never expected

102
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,000
that way

103
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,559
would be a life for a life.

104
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,959
Hold on.

105
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,160
He told me

106
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,040
that he's going to marry
Bai Shiwan after two days

107
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,239
at the Chancellor Residence.

108
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,399
Bai Shiwan

109
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,279
has already died.

110
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
You're such a glutton for punishment.

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
You feel suffered for not being beaten,

112
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,640
huh?

113
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,839
The Bai family's integrity

114
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,799
is something a treacherous man
like you won't understand.

115
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,040
Integrity?

116
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,959
The so-called integrity

117
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,920
is just because

118
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,239
it hasn't touched a person's
weakest spot yet.

119
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,799
You came here alone
to exchange your life for hers.

120
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,440
You must have planned a way out for her,

121
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,760
right?

122
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,600
The children in the Ciyou Hall

123
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,239
are being well taken care of,

124
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,679
which shows that

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,399
she is a kind person.

126
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,799
Don't ever try to hurt them.

127
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,760
You're willing to risk your life

128
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,200
for the Bai family's secret book,

129
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,200
but what about Miss Xu?

130
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,000
You don't care

131
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,040
about her life either?

132
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,399
It seems you truly believe

133
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,359
in the existence
of the Bai family's Disguise Technique.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,799
In that case,

135
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,000
if I die,

136
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,600
the Bai family's Disguise Technique
will disappear with me.

137
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,359
If you dare hurt her,

138
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,640
you'll never get
the Bai family's Disguise Technique.

139
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,279
After all,

140
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm the only one left

141
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,399
who knows anything about the Bai family.

142
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,640
If you don't want me to hurt her,

143
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,559
hand over the secret book.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,799
Someone!

145
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:00,559
Keep questioning him. If he still
insists on not telling anything,

146
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:01,959
beat him

147
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,600
until he does.

148
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,559
Yes, sir.

149
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,239
What a stubborn man!

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,359
