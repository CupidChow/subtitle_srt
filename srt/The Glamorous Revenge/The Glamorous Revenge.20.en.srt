Lin Muxuan?

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,279
Why are you here?

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,959
Bingxin,

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
I have something to ask you.

26
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,319
Has something

27
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,720
happened to Zhaozhao recently?

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,319
I've noticed she doesn't seem right,

29
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,279
but I can't pinpoint why.

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,760
I've noticed that too.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,760
She has been looking pale

32
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,080
and always seems worried.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,680
I've asked her,

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,839
but I can't get anything out of her.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,279
Please keep an eye on her for me.

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,319
I won't be at ease

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,919
until I have an answer.

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,240
Alright.

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Why do you keep looking
towards the door today?

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
Are you waiting for someone?

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,320
No.

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,520
I'm just...

43
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,119
I'm wondering why Mrs. Huang

44
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,039
didn't come

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,960
with Mrs. Lan today?

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,320
I made a special appointment
with Shopkeeper Xu today

47
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,679
to have a customized makeup look.

48
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,000
If she comes along,

49
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:40,839
she must have imitated me again.

50
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,119
Mrs. Huang,

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,320
your complexion is getting better.

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,919
You could be my signature
when you go out.

53
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,199
Zhaozhao,

54
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,160
have you found someone to marry?

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,720
If not,

56
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,119
how about I introduce you to someone?

57
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,119
Mrs. Huang,

58
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,399
I'm still young.

59
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,520
I haven't thought about marriage yet.

60
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,279
Mrs. Huang,

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,320
please wait for me a while.

62
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:17,960
Alright.

63
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,759
Why are you here?

64
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,960
I heard that Blooming Beauty Parlor
is short of staff recently.

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,399
I came to see

66
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,839
if I could help out.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,479
Zhaozhao,

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,880
I know you haven't wanted
to see him for now.

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,399
But, nowadays,

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,759
we have too many customers.

71
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,520
His show up

72
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,960
would come in handy.

73
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,320
Blooming Beauty Parlor
isn't like Beauty Pavilion.

74
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm afraid

75
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,800
we can't afford Young Master Lin.

76
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:46,720
You can afford me.

77
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,160
You don't even have to pay me.

78
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,279
Since he said so...

79
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:54,759
Zhaozhao.

80
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,720
He's the young master
who painted my portrait before.

81
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,679
If it weren't for him,

82
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,119
I wouldn't have found you.

83
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,119
Oh,

84
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,399
do you two know each other?

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,919
Greetings, Mrs. Huang.

86
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,639
You two look like a perfect match

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,919
standing together.

88
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:13,839
Mrs. Huang,

89
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
you mentioned

90
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,359
about introducing me to a marriage.

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,600
Is it still available?

92
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,000
Of course.

93
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,600
When are you free?

94
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:23,920
How about tonight?

95
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,839
I'm sorry to trouble you

96
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,760
to find me

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,760
a perfect match.

98
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,320
Zhaozhao,

99
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:51,880
it's late now.

100
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,959
Where are you going?

101
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:57,839
Young Master Lin,

102
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,079
I'm no longer employed by you.

103
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,200
I don't think I need to inform you

104
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,839
where I'm going.

105
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,399
If you insist on staying to help,

106
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,799
you'll have to take care

107
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,119
of your own food and lodging.

108
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,720
Wait a moment.

109
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,040
The food outside isn't hygienic.

110
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,440
Here's something to eat and drink.

111
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,279
Take it along.

112
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm only

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,399
going out on a date,

114
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,320
not on a long journey.

115
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,119
You can

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,920
keep these for yourself.

117
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
This is my new clothes.

118
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,880
Go ahead.

119
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,519
Young Master Liu,

120
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,559
actually I...

121
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:04,959
Zhaozhao.

122
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,000
I've been looking for you.

123
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,799
Why are you here?

124
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Hey, young master,

125
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:19,880
do you mind having one more friend

126
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,720
eat with you?

127
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,040
Zhaozhao,

128
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,760
who is this gentleman?

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,880
I'm her cousin.

130
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
A distant one.

131
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,519
Distant...

132
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,399
I'm worried if my cousin
meets the wrong person,

133
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,799
so I'm here to check on her.

134
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you, cousin.

135
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,279
In the past,

136
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,519
I wasn't

137
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,359
very good at

138
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:43,959
reading

139
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,880
people.

140
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,640
Don't you worry.

141
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,559
This distant cousin,

142
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,640
I'll treat

143
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,279
my future wife, Zhaozhao,

144
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,799
very well.

145
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:00,760
Waiter, we're ready to order.

146
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,559
Faster, we want to order.

147
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,600
Here's the menu.

148
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,720
Bring us

149
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,079
all your specialties.

150
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,119
Alright, no problem.

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,920
Spicy chicken.

152
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,880
Zhaozhao, look at this spicy chicken.

153
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,720
I don't eat spicy food.

154
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,000
I think this is good.

155
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:15,839
Really?

156
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,519
Let's order some more.

157
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:20,799
A spicy stir-fried lotus root.

158
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,920
A spicy stir-fried lotus root.

159
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,000
A spicy stir-fried pork.

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,959
A spicy stir-fried chillies.

161
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,399
A spicy stir-fried chillies.

162
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,359
The spicier, the better.

163
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,160
Did you hear that?

164
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,600
The spicier, the better.

165
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,399
I don't eat spicy food.

166
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,320
Wait a moment.

167
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,119
Zhaozhao,

168
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:44,839
this spicy chicken tastes good.

169
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm hungry too.

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,359
Zhaozhao,

171
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,279
these chillies are...

172
00:07:59,279 --> 00:07:59,880
Wait a moment.

173
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,519
I love this too.

174
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,359
I like to eat this.

175
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,440
Cousin, you are very cool.

176
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,239
Come on.

177
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:18,920
Let me toast to you.

178
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:24,600
This...

179
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,080
If you can't handle the spice,
don't torture yourself.

180
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:49,520
Zhaozhao,

181
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,320
you still remember what I like.

182
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,599
I thought you had forgotten.

183
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,280
Zhaozhao,

184
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,880
from the beginning,

185
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,119
I've been liked you.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,559
So, I asked Mrs. Huang

187
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,840
to arrange a date for us.

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,799
I...

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
I like you.

190
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,559
How about you...

191
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,200
Thank you for your gift,
Young Master Liu.

192
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,679
I think

193
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,159
you're a great person.

194
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,400
See,

195
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,679
you're gentle,

196
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,000
considerate,

197
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:40,159
and always speak softly to me.

198
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,000
A man

199
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,320
as gentle as you

200
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,559
must be

201
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,880
very popular, right?

202
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:55,520
You...

203
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,840
How can you hold his hand?

204
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,000
You've just met for a brief time.

205
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,400
It's improper for a man
and a woman to touch each other.

206
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,400
If this spreads out,

207
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:02,599
it will ruin your reputation.

208
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:04,719
Distant cousin,

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,119
you can't blame Zhaozhao.

210
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,000
It's my mistake.

211
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,919
You shouldn't blame Zhaozhao.

212
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,039
Get away! I'm not your cousin.

213
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,000
Zhaozhao.

214
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,000
It's improper for a man
and a woman to touch each other.

215
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,359
Both of you should
keep your distance from me.

216
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:16,719
Young Master Liu,

217
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,479
I'm sorry that I get to go now.

218
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,479
I'll treat you

219
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,320
to a meal another day.

220
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,239
Zhaozhao.

221
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,159
Zhaozhao.

222
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,320
You...

223
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:26,919
You...

224
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,159
This meal is on me.

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,799
You don't have to treat her again.

226
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,719
Wait...

227
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,719
You...

228
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,719
