Don't scare me. I'm back.

You're back.

Lin Muxuan,

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,960
where did you get all the kids
from Ciyou Hall?

32
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,320
Don't think I don't know

33
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:28,600
you're a ruthless killer.

34
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,000
Who said I killed anyone?

35
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,960
Still pretending?

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,160
You lied to me that the skins and skulls
in the darkroom were fakes?

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,759
I think they were all killed by you.

38
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,320
Listen,

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,759
I'm not afraid of you.

40
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,960
Hand over all the kids quickly!

41
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,600
Xu Zhaozhao,

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,520
drop the knife!

43
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,839
You're just in time.

44
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,559
I know you abducted the kids.

45
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,160
Let the kids go right now!

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,160
Or I'll kill you right now.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,759
Young Master didn't abduct the kids.

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,000
He even injured his arm

49
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,119
trying to save the kids.

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,320
How can you repay his kindness
with vengeance?

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Master, something's up.

52
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,440
Xu Zhaozhao has run away,

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,240
back to Ciyou Hall, I think.

54
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,199
Ciyou Hall is her weakness.

55
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,679
It seems we need to put on a show

56
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,639
to get her to be at my disposal.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,960
Miss Zhaozhao.

58
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,479
- Miss Zhaozhao.
- Miss Zhaozhao.

59
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,080
Liu!

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,279
Are you all right?

61
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,960
- We're fine.
- We're fine.

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
Miss Zhaozhao,

63
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,160
in order to save us,

64
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:38,839
he fought with several bad guys

65
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,960
and bled a lot.

66
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,000
If you want to leave,

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,960
then leave.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,880
I never thought

69
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:50,000
I'd be such a bad person in your eyes.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,440
Liu, take them back first.

71
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,679
I have something

72
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,399
to say to him.

73
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,399
Go.

74
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,440
Let's go.

75
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,080
Let's go.

76
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,160
Well,

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,760
why don't I help you with the medicine?

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,600
I was worried

80
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,799
so I misunderstood you.

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you all right? I'll be gentle.

82
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,000
If you don't trust me,

83
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,040
what's the point of keeping you here?

84
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,480
I said

85
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,480
you could leave.

86
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,600
I, Xu Zhaozhao,

87
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,600
am not the kind of person
who doesn't know how to return favors.

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,399
I'm willing to stay and work for you.

89
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,600
But

90
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:10,200
you have to tell me

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,399
what

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,880
you want me to do for you.

93
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,180
(Beauty Pavilion)

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,359
This is where you first abducted me

95
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,600
to do my make-up.

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,000
Why did you bring me here?

97
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,679
It's called Beauty Pavilion.

98
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,679
It's my beauty parlor.

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,040
I want you to run the business with me

100
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,799
and be the shopkeeper.

101
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,679
Just for this?

102
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,839
Yes.

103
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,600
You're going to all that trouble
to hire a shopkeeper?

104
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,480
It's not some kind
of illegal business, is it?

105
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm telling you,
I have a code of ethics.

106
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,399
I won't do anything that's illegal.

107
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,799
You're worrying too much.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,359
As a man,

109
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,760
I make women uncomfortable
when I come and go from here.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,040
What do you think?
You'll be the shopkeeper,

111
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,239
and we'll split the profits 50-50.

112
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,200
Well,

113
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,679
what about the kids at Ciyou Hall?

114
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,440
I'll send someone to look after them.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,799
Deal.

116
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,959
(Grand Beauty Hall)
(He can't be bad if he saved the kids.)

117
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,200
(The most important thing now is
to run Beauty Pavilion well.)

118
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,320
(If I make money, the kids at Ciyou Hall
will be well fed and clothed.)

119
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,440
This is the best beauty parlor
in the capital.

120
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,519
I'm going to check it out.

121
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,340
(Grand Beauty Hall)

122
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,720
Registration is now open.

123
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,000
First come, first served.

124
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,679
Please queue up for your number.

125
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,519
Look at this.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
(I was coaxed
into spending all the money)

127
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,640
(in my pocket within a quarter
of an hour of entering the shop.)

128
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,239
(This Grand Beauty Hall
is not to be underestimated.)

129
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,279
(If I don't learn something today,)

130
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,399
(I'll be at a loss.)

131
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:21,720
Goodbye, Miss.

132
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,000
You're a spy, right?

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,600
Come with me.

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,399
I...

135
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,519
I'm not a spy.

136
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,519
Let go of me.

137
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,519
Stop it.

138
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,399
Goodness.

139
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,600
Young Master Lin,

140
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
it's been a long time.

141
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:08,760
Right,

142
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,399
I was just about to tell you
that your custom-made jewellery set

143
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,839
is almost finished.

144
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,440
You've been away for half a day.

145
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,520
I've missed you.

146
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,080
You're here at last, darling.

147
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,159
You've got a conscience.

148
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,440
So she's your wife.

149
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,080
It's all a misunderstanding.

150
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,239
Misunderstanding?

151
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
The jewellery set

152
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,080
was meant for my wife.

153
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,320
I told her to rest at home,

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
but she was so worried

155
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
she had to come
to see if you were committed.

156
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,440
But you did this to her.

157
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:08,919
It's okay.

158
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,640
It's okay.

159
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,239
It's just

160
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
that my arms hurt.

161
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,479
All your purchases here
are now free of charge.

162
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,919
My neck is hurting more.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,200
How about another set of Beauty Cream?

164
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,880
