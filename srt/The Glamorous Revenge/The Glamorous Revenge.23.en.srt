21
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,000
Chancellor.

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,519
Chancellor, something
terrible has happened.

23
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,599
Why are you so flustered?

24
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,919
Lin Muxuan is spreading rumours about us

25
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,120
capturing people to be
the alchemical puppet in the town.

26
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:48,080
Also,

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,519
someone has posted at the gate
of the Chancellor Residence

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,360
with the detailed evidence of you

29
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,519
buying and selling the official
positions over the past few years.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,519
Now, the residents
are causing a disturbance,

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,879
trying to storm the Chancellor Residence

32
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,720
to find out what's going on.

33
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,400
What a mad dog, Lin Muxuan.

34
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,199
Does His Majesty know about this?

35
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,759
Chancellor.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,320
I, the humble general,

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
greet the Chancellor.

38
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,399
His Majesty has learned
of the disturbance outside your residence,

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,639
accusing you of corruption

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
and unsettling the public.

41
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,119
He sent me with troops
to guard the residence.

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,160
The troublemakers outside
have been cleared.

43
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,720
You may rest assured, the Chancellor.

44
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,720
Please convey my gratitude

45
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:30,919
to His Majesty

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,279
for his concern.

47
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,759
Once

48
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,119
my confinement is lifted,

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,000
I will personally

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,279
go to express

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,800
my gratitude to His Majesty.

52
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,960
I get to leave first.

53
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,399
Chancellor,

54
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,279
His Majesty still
holds you in high regard.

55
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,559
Lin Muxuan and his kind

56
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,800
are mere jesters.

57
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:54,279
They can't affect the bond

58
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,679
between you and His Majesty.

59
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:56,919
You may leave now.

60
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:57,800
Yes.

61
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,320
(I can no longer)

62
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,119
(read His Majesty's mind these days.)

63
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,220
(The Register of Names for Testing
the Art of Disguise Technique)

64
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,279
Chancellor.

65
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:34,919
Your Majesty.

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,559
I, your servant,

67
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:37,960
bow before Your Majesty.

68
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,919
Where

69
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,360
are you going?

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:43,880
I...

71
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,240
Your Majesty,

72
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,080
this book records the alchemical puppet
who has been arrested by the Chancellor

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
over the years for experimentation
with the Disguise Technique.

74
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,399
There are about 360 people.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Chancellor,

76
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,759
it's come to this point,

77
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,000
what more do you have to say?

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Your Majesty,

79
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:08,919
those were all

80
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,559
forged accusations by Zhou Jia.

81
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,279
I haven't had a chance
to dispose of them.

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,279
Your Majesty, please have
a thorough check.

83
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,119
Your Majesty,

84
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,160
my loyalty to you

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,760
is universally recognized
and undeniable.

86
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,720
Loyalty?

87
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,519
Do you think

88
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,279
I don't know what you want
this Disguise Technique for?

89
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,119
You don't want to serve under anyone,

90
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:30,079
want to replace me
and become the Emperor yourself.

91
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,399
Your Majesty,

92
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
I have been falsely accused!

93
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,160
The Chancellor has deceived the Emperor,

94
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,760
harmed the residents,

95
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,760
and committed heinous crimes.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,839
His sins

97
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,079
are indeed unforgivable.

98
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,279
From today,

99
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,920
imprison him in the jail
of the Ministry of Justice

100
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:44,959
to await further punishment.

101
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,679
Your Majesty!

102
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,239
I am innocent!

103
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,519
I am innocent!

104
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,720
Zhaozhao,

105
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:58,679
you're awake.

106
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,359
Zhaozhao.

107
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,399
Lin Muxuan,

108
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,720
there's only three days left
until the Blossom Contest,

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
and you haven't finished teaching me.

110
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,239
There's no time left.

111
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,279
Blossom Contest?

112
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,880
Yeah,

113
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,799
I promised you

114
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,720
I'd win the championship
at the Blossom Contest.

115
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,320
Why are you having this expression?

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
What's wrong with you?

117
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,920
Zhaozhao,

118
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,760
the Blossom Contest isn't important.

119
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,519
I just want to stay with you.

120
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:50,920
Lin Muxuan,

121
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,359
you...

122
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,880
What are you doing?

123
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,119
Lin Muxuan,

124
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,559
why are you walking so slowly?

125
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,279
Today, we have to pick out

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,320
the clothes and accessories
for Qiluo's meeting with General Zhou.

127
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,760
Hurry up!

128
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:15,920
I'm coming.

129
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
You

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,799
suddenly become so gentle.

131
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,760
I'm not used to it.

132
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,679
It seems Shopkeeper Xu

133
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,399
prefers my old self.

134
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,600
Well, then remember,

135
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,480
the dishes of today's lunch

136
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,359
had scallions,

137
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,279
ginger,

138
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,359
and chili.

139
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,799
I wasn't happy about it.

140
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,519
So, I've decided

141
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,559
to deduct half a month of your wages

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,119
as a small punishment.

143
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,559
No way!

144
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
Lin Muxuan, you're joking, right?

149
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
I've forgotten again,

150
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,079

You can kill me now.

175
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,320
I won't kill you.

176
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,320
Killing you is too much

177
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,400

I have one question to you.

180
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,880
All the poison at Zhou Jia's residence
was made by you.

181
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,919
Tell me

182
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,119
where the antidote is.

183
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Antidote?

184
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,960
Is it because your little sweetheart

185
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,359
has ingested the poison?

186
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,719
Is that real?

187
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,960
Man,

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,679
will meet the same fate as me.

191
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:43,359
Stop talking nonsense.

192
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,679
Tell me

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,119
where the antidote is.

194
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,559
It should be me asking you,

195
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,320
does

196
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,119
the Disguise Technique even exist?

197
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:57,479
The Disguise Technique

198
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,520
doesn't exist at all.

199
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,400
Coincidentally,

200
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,000
just like the Disguise Technique,

201
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,320
the antidote doesn't exist either.

202
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,080
You're lying.

203
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,960
What can you do to me even if I'm lying?

204
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:15,919
Lin Muxuan,

205
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:19,520
you'll watch the one you love

206
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,159
slowly die before your eyes,

207
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,599
just like you lost the Bai family

208
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,119
and Xu Zhaozhao.

209
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,880
You'll have nothing left.

210
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:35,880
The Imperial decree arrives.

211
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
By the grace of heaven's will,
His Majesty hereby proclaims

212
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,880
Chancellor Zuo Wenan has repeatedly
violated the laws of the nation,

213
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,940
harmed the people,

214
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,719
and committed reckless crimes.

215
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,119
After thorough investigation,

216
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
the evidence is irrefutable.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,119
He will be executed
by the Ministry of Justice

218
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,520
and beheaded this afternoon.

219
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,080
