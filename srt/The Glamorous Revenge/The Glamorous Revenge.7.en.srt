21
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,080
(Why is he collecting all of these?)

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,959
(Seems like)

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,279
(our encounter was premeditated.)

(Qi Bingxin, Zhang Qiao'er)

25
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,919
He's so mysterious.

26
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,319
He had all those paintings on his table.

27
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,680
What does he mean by that?

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,519
I don't know what's going on.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,279
Anyway, he...

30
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,720
The more I think about it,
the weirder it gets.

31
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,720
He even drew portraits of me.

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,080
Why else do you think he did so?

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,399
Yeah.

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,479
Why else did he do so?

35
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,919
Maybe

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,080
he fancies you.

37
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,880
Are you saying

38
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,800
that Lin Muxuan

39
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:45,320
fancies me?

40
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,260
(Beauty Pavilion)

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,919
Due to the high number
of customers we've received,

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,679
we have switched
to an appointment-based system.

43
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,479
We only receive

44
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,279
ten customers per day.

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,160
(Beauty Pavilion)
Only ten.

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,559
It's first come first served.

47
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,559
The number of customers is
even greater than I had imagined.

48
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,399
Please come inside.

49
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,679
I'm sure Qiluo will
place more trust in us

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,399
(Beauty Pavilion)
upon seeing this scene.

51
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,199
Two more slots remaining.

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,880
Xu Zhaozhao has come up
with plenty of ideas lately.

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
- She seems pretty smart.
- Please come in.

54
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:33,520
(He did fall for my wit and beauty.)

55
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,679
(On account of your fondness for me,)

56
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,479
(I'll let bygones be bygones.)

57
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,000
It's just

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,160
that I think she's been acting strange

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,119
ever since she became great friends
with Bingxin.

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,720
Master.

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
Has our prey taken the bait?

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,600
Wrong.

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,800
The bait has delivered herself
to our doorsteps.

64
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,119
What do you need?

65
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,199
Bring them there.

66
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,520
Miss, would you like
to make a makeup appointment?

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,360
Welcome.

68
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,720
You may purchase
whichever product you like.

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,959
If you need to make
a makeup appointment,

70
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,920
I can do that for you as well.

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,640
So, Miss, what do you want...

72
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,079
Miss, I heard that you came up
with both the Golden Phoenix Makeup

73
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,880
and Queen of Flowers makeup.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,880
I wish to ask you

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,839
if you could

76
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,880
make me look 17 again?

77
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,359
Make you

78
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,119
look 17 again?

79
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,720
That's quite difficult.

80
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,799
However,

81
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,399
I can help you put on

82
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,119
a trendy makeup that's suitable for you.

83
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,040
You should take a look first.

84
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,679
Come.

85
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,359
Have a seat.

86
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,920
Take a look at our catalog.

87
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,000
We have this, this, and this.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,279
Which one do you like?

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,279
I don't want any of them.

90
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,920
I just want you to make me look 17 again

91
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,279
so that I could meet my old flame.

92
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,760
This is the portrait I had commissioned
from an artist when I was 17.

93
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,480
Miss, take a look.

94
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,000
See if you can do anything about it.

95
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,279
Speak up.

96
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,040
What do you need?

97
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,600
One of the customers
had a special request.

98
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,839
She requested me
to make her look 17 again

99
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,399
so that she could
meet her old flame again.

100
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,079
Look.

101
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,920
This painting depicts her and her lover.

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,040
It's a difficult task
considering your current level.

103
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,799
The underlying principle

104
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,920
is the same as Bingxin's makeup.

105
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,040
You have to start from
her facial structure.

106
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,200
But why does the man

107
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,519
look so familiar?

108
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,799
Have you seen him before?

109
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:26,839
I haven't.

110
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,839
I'm full now.

111
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:28,920
Lin Muxuan!

112
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,239
I'm curious about something.

113
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,359
Say,

114
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,480
not only do you possess makeup skills,
but you also know how to manage a business.

115
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,600
Why are you making an amateur like me
manage your business

116
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,880
and steal your profits from you?

117
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,720
Was it truly because you didn't want
to bother yourself with the business?

118
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,480
Or did you

119
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,799
open Beauty Pavilion

120
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,119
for another reason
besides making a profit?

121
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,160
Hey!

122
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,600
Am I a moneygrubber to you?

123
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,519
Isn't that the case?

124
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,640
Of course not.

125
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,200
Although

126
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,000
I did join hands with you
for the money initially,

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
I've come to understand the significance
of managing one's appearance over time.

128
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,200
I also wish to promote Beauty Pavilion

129
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,320
so that I could help out other people

130
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,279
and help you...

131
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,519
And help you to achieve your goal.

132
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,079
Managing Beauty Pavilion adequately

133
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,519
is your goal.

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,880
You'll be free
after achieving your goal.

135
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,480
You don't need to care about the rest.

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,839
Lin Muxuan.

137
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,880
You can place more trust in me.

138
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:37,399
Since we're business partners,
we have to help each other out.

139
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,000
Even if you do have other goals in mind,

140
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,640
how will you know that I won't help you out
if you don't ask me?

141
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,119
Just fulfill your duties,

142
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:50,000
and I won't give you a single cent less.

143
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,079
You ingrate!

144
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,239

145
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,399
