Miss Xu.

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,919
The person who came just now

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,319
rescued Bai Shiwan

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
and left you here.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,040
What do you think of
the way he treats you?

26
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,680
Just kill me or do whatever you want,

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,879
but don't talk
all the pointless things to me.

28
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,519
Silly girl.

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,879
He used you as bait,

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,480
treating you as a substitute.

31
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:06,480
Your life means nothing to him.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,879
What do you view this?

33
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,160
I'll view it with my eyes.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,960
You can still joke around with me?

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,639
It's come to this point,

36
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,559
and you still want to protect him?

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,960
I mean

38
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,119
I'll keep my eyes wide open

39
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,479
and watch what happens to you.

40
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:33,880
Well.

41
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,440
What a stubborn lady.

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,279
Beat her hard.

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,520
Let's see how long she can keep this up.

44
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,759
General Zhou.

45
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Your arm is injured?

46
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,679
You are really as loyal as a dog.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,199
What happens?

48
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,880
Why didn't he send a doctor for you?

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,960
Shiwan.

50
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,279
This place looks a lot
like the Bai Mansion.

51
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,800
Is this

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,639
Miss Xu's room?

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,119
Yes.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,240
You

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,839
like that girl,

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,960
right?

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,240
Shiwan.

58
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,440
Can you help me to your study room
so I can sit for a while?

59
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,440
You should rest for now.

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,519
Muxuan.

61
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,519
It's been three years since we met.

62
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,880
Can you talk to me?

63
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,239
Don't you have anything
you want to ask me?

64
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:51,880
For these past three years,

65
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,119
what has happened?

66
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,359
When I fell into their hands,

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,040
I thought I would die for sure.

68
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,839
But unexpectedly, I survived.

69
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,239
Then, Zhou Jia took me
to meet Zuo Wenan.

70
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,920
To my surprise,

71
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
the one who truly wanted
the Bai family's Disguise Technique

72
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,920
was him.

73
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,640
Why does the Chancellor
want the Disguise Technique?

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,720
I don't know.

75
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,880
They imprisoned me in the mansion,

76
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,040
forcing me to teach him
the Bai family's secret skills.

77
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,679
Beyond that,

78
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,720
I know nothing.

79
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,119
Muxuan.

80
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,239
Muxuan.

81
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,679
These past three years

82
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,959
must have been hard for you.

83
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,320
Avenging the Bai family

84
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,559
is what I should do.

85
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,359
From now on,

86
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,880
you don't have to live for others.

87
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,640
You've already done enough
for the Bai family.

88
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,160
You don't owe the Bai family anything.

89
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,640
Don't you want me
to avenge the Bai family?

90
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,279
For me,

91
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,279
the people I care about
are alive and well

92
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,079
is what I matter the most.

93
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,839
Shiwan.

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,119
Shiwan.

95
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,920
Actually,

96
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,679
being able to see you again,

97
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,480
I have no regrets even if I die.

98
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,839
Let go of the hatred

99
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,920
and live well.

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,640
The Shadow Pavilion and Lin Fan

101
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,640
are all died because of me.

102
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,239
Zhaozhao is still in prison.

103
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,959
I can't afford to have
anything happen to you now.

104
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,559
I wish we could
go back to our childhood,

105
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,119
sitting together with you

106
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,519
on the stairs.

107
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,480
Shiwan!

108
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,279
How long do you want to stay here?

109
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,760
You're drunk badly,

110
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,959
and made everything a mess.

111
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,920
Aren't you afraid Zhaozhao
will come back and be mad at you?

112
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
She won't come back anymore.

113
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,040
I couldn't save her.

114
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,679
I couldn't save anyone.

115
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,679
I'm just useless.

116
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,880
I spent three years planning,

117
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,160
only to end up pushing them all,

118
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,480
one by one,

119
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,359
into an inescapable abyss.

120
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,320
I overestimated myself.

121
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,160
How you feel is your own business.

122
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,320
I'm here to tell you,

123
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
I'm going to save Zhaozhao.

124
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:23,480
No way!

125
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,160
I've already lost them.

126
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,920
I don't want to lose my last friend.

127
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,880
What about Zhaozhao?

128
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,239
What can we do for her?

129
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,119
Now...

130
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,239
There's only one last option.

131
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,960
