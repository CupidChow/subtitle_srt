21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,519
You...

22
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:49,879
are from the Bai family.

23
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,199
Lin Muxuan

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,319
planned all of this

25
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,599
just to save you.

26
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,120
He

27
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,319
doesn't know that I'm still alive.

28
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,279
On the day
the Bai family was annihilated,

29
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,320
he was the only one

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,960
who escaped.

31
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,479
He

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,320
was adopted by my father.

33
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,919
We grew up together,

34
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,880
like siblings.

35
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,679
He planned all of this for you.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,080
He deserves the title of a true sibling.

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,119
Is he

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,320
doing well?

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,679
He is

40
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:43,720
doing well.

41
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,320
He made a lot of money.

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,759
He established a secret organization,

43
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,679
and many people work for him.

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,679
He also opened

45
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,039
a beauty service shop.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,880
The business is very well.

47
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,479
That's good.

48
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,720
I knew

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
he would

50
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,279
live well.

51
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:27,720
Master,

52
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,479
you leave first.

53
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,399
Go to save Miss Xu.

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,759
Lin Muxuan.

55
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,440
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:58,679 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm late.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,960
You came to save me?

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Let's seize the time.

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,119
The others can't hold them
off for so long.

60
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:04,919
Alright.

61
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,720
Muxuan.

62
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:41,559
Shiwan.

63
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,920
You're still alive.

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
I'll get you out too.

65
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,799
Lin Muxuan, leave here quickly.

66
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:04,600
Just leave me here.

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,119
I won't leave you here.

68
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
There's no way

69
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,480
you can get both of us out
of this dungeon by yourself.

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,720
You need to go now.

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,279
Never try,

72
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,959
never know.

73
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:17,920
Be careful.

74
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,920
If you insist on staying here,
all three of us will die here.

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,000
Take her and leave.

76
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,320
Zhaozhao.

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,399
Hurry!

78
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,799
Leave now.

79
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,760
Go.

80
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,720
Leave here!

81
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:55,959
Lin Fan!

82
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,079
Master!

83
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,600
I can only accompany you this far.

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,359
Lin Fan!

85
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,279
Leave now!

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,519
Let me ask you,

87
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
do you

88
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,720
know about

89
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,480
the Color-Changing Flower?

90
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,399
Do you know the Color-Changing Flower?

91
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,200
Xu Zhaozhao.

92
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,720
If there's a lipstick

93
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,720
that could show different colors
on different people's lips,

94
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,920
that means each of us

95
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,559
has our own unique color.

96
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,359
This Blossom Contest requires
a most iconic makeup product.

97
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,600
If I can find this flower
and make a lipstick from it,

98
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,760
we will surely stand out.

99
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,279
Lin Muxuan!

100
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,480
Don't try to dampen my spirit.

101
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:49,839
I

102
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,079
will never give up.
