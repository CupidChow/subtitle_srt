Miss Zhaozhao,

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,839
why aren't you eating?

29
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,080
I'm not hungry. You guys eat.

30
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,639
Here you go.

00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,800
These are all your favorites.

00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,160
Miss Zhaozhao,

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,600
don't you already have a lot of money?

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,960
Why do you open a shop?

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
You're worn out
and become slimmer.

36
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,559
Let me tell you,

37
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,720
money will run out one day.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,639
If someday

39
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm no longer here,

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
at least you all

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
will have a skill to rely on

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,759
and a place to go.

43
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,960
What's wrong with you today?

44
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,240
Your words

45
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,960
sound as if you won't be
here anymore tomorrow.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,320
You're overthinking.

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,559
I'm just hoping

48
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,160
that even without me,
they all can live well.

49
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:44,639

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,800

Zhaozhao,

56
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,960
why do you look so pale?

57
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,360
I'm fine.

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,720
I might not

59
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,720
have slept well last night.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,639
There wasn't any business
a few days ago.

61
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,479
And, today,

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,919
we have so many customers showing up.

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,759
You don't know?

64
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,800
Recently, a famous painter came to town,

65
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,919
and he's been recommending
this place to every guest.

66
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,479
A painter?

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,919
Could it be...

68
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,919
Just ignore that.

69
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
We've got business now,

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
why not we just carry on?

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,919
Let's just do the work.

72
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,399
You're welcome.

73
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,160
Thanks.

74
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,520
Take care.

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,919
Miss,

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,960
what kind of makeup would you like?

77
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,600
I'd like the shopkeeper

78
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,199
to help me cover this injury on my face.

79
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,000
How did you hurt?

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,040
I...

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,600
I fell by accident.

82
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,959
Did you people hide my wife here?

83
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,000
Get her out!

84
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,160
You, come out!

85
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,640
Is he your husband?

86
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,839
You wench,

87
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,320
I've got you here.

88
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,959
Trying to have makeup like the others?

89
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,519
Look in the mirror yourself.

90
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,399
You disgrace!

91
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,640
Let's see how I deal with you
when we get home.

92
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,239
Come with me.

93
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,320
Hey!

94
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,720
You're not allowed to leave.

95
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,239
You cause trouble
in this Blooming Beauty Parlor.

96
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,399
I'll report you
to the government office.

97
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,559
What...

98
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:47,839
What's the matter with you?

99
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,519
This...

100
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,839
This is my family matter.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,640
You want to get my husband
locked up in prison?

102
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,959
How can you do that?

103
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:54,600
Wait...

104
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,320
But he's beaten you to this extent,
and you're still defending him?

105
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,559
Aren't you getting no enough of it?

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
And you,

107
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,640
if she leaves you one day,

108
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,160
won't you regret it?

109
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,440
Regret?

110
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,600
You can ask her.

111
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,760
She is just a woman with no strengths,

112
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,839
where can she go without me?

113
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,839
Either way, I'll just
apologize to her afterwards.

114
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,640
She'll still have to follow me.

115
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,839
You women

116
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,320
are all the same.

117
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,959
What you experienced today

118
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,160
is what you brought upon yourself.

119
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,399
You know if this man truly loved you,

120
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,959
he wouldn't let you suffer
even a little.

121
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:33,920
You cling

122
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,000
to the bit of sweetness.

123
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,959
Even though you're being
treated as just a plaything,

124
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,160
and being pushed around here and there,

125
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,559
you still obsess about it.

126
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,559
What did you say?

127
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,559
I said,

128
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,359
all this misery

129
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,959
is what you brought on yourself.

130
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,559
You!

131
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,519
What?

132
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:51,959
Both of you, get out of here.

133
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,399
Leave my Blooming Beauty Parlor now.

134
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,160
Let's go.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,799
Quickly!

136
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,640
You!

137
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Don't force me to hit you.

138
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,160
Faster!

139
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,959
How dare you run away!

140
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,040
Zhaozhao,

141
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,200
are you okay?

142
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,040
Did that scare you?

143
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,720
Let me call you a doctor here.

144
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm fine.

145
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,200
Look at you now,

146
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,040
since when did you become so fussy?

147
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,519
I care about you,

148
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,559
and you're teasing me!

149
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,359
How ungrateful you are!

150
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
I should ignore you now.

151
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm going to sleep.

152
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,200
Aren't you curious what this is?

153
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,959
Whether it's Intestine-Piercing Powder

154
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,880
or Puppet String Medicine,

155
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,760
it's just to make sure

156
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,200
I won't turn on you.

157
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,559
Xu Zhaozhao,

158
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:07,839
to Lin Muxuan, you're just a pawn.

159
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,000
Is it worth it for you

160
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
to do so much for him?

161
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:21,000
(Lin Muxuan,)

162
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,040
(for that jar of wine,)

163
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,040
(A toast to new beginnings.)
(I'm afraid I won't ever drink it.)

164
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,720
(The heavens and earth are too far apart.)

165
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,000
(Let our relationship)

166
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,519
(be buried along with that wine.)

167
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,519
When you

168
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,799
have the first sip of this wine,
it tastes strong.

169
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,600
But the more you drink,

170
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,200
the better it gets.

171
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,160
If you like it,

172
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,559
how about we find a day
to bury a jar of the wine together

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,720
and dig it up to drink

174
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,359
in coming year?

175
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,200
Why wait until another day?

176
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,760
Let's do it today.

177
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,359
Faster!

178
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,839
Keep crying.

179
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,760
You always cry.

180
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,799
Who are you?

181
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,519
Apologize to your wife!

182
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:20,959
Why...

183
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,359
Why should I apologize?

184
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,559
After all, she is my wife.

185
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:23,760
Why should I...

186
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,359
Apologize now.

187
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,399
She's been defending you

189
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
out of her love for you.

190
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,320
That's not an excuse
for you to mistreat her.

191
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,799
As a man, you can't uphold
the most basic principle of trust,

192
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,760
and you can't even
protect her wholeheartedly,

193
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,599
don't you feel ashamed?

194
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,359
And you!

195
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,359
Shopkeeper Xu has been defending you.

196
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,640
But, what you did today
has broken her heart.

197
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,000
The two of you go to the Blooming Beauty
Parlor and apologize to her tomorrow.

198
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,840
If she doesn't forgive you,

199
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
I won't either.

200
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,400
Understand?

201
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,159
- Understood.
- Understood.

202
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,039
- Understood.
- Understood.

203
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,119
Hubby.

204
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,760
Shopkeeper Xu,

205
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,520
it was my fault for yesterday.

206
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,200
I'm not even human.

207
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,159
I came today to apologize.

208
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,239
Shopkeeper Xu,

209
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,159
I'm sorry.

210
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,320
I didn't acknowledge
your good intentions.

211
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,400
Alright.

212
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,640
But

213
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,039
I don't have much to say.

214
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,000
Go back

215
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,520
and treat your wife nicely.

216
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:34,320
Shopkeeper Xu,

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440
if you don't forgive me,

218
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,320
that man won't let me off.

219
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
