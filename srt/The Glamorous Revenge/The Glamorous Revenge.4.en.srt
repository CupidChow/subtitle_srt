00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:38,360
Tell me about it.

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,760
How was your experience there?

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,120
The products they sell
in Grand Beauty Hall smell nice indeed.

24
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,120
But they're expensive.

25
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,120
I wonder what kind of people
can afford them.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,760
Previously, the Beauty Pavilion
wasn't opened to the public.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,440
You didn't leave
the residence much either.

28
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,800
How did you make all that money, then?

29
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,120
Didn't I tell you
to stop asking questions

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,839
when you're not supposed to?

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,959
The Grand Beauty Hall
has garnered a fine reputation.

32
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,320
If you intend to imitate them,

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,600
you'll only be imitating them blindly
without understanding the essence.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,199
If so, wouldn't it be better

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
for you to come up
with an ingenious strategy?

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,039
An ingenious strategy?

37
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,759
Isn't your makeup method
considered one of them?

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,000
Why don't I become
the spokesperson of our shop?

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,240
You intend to be both
the shopkeeper and spokesperson, huh?

40
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,399
The customers might not be convinced.

41
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,639
Look.

42
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,639
Miss, what do you need?

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,399
Someone told me
to inquire about this from you.

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,839
Is there a way

45
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,720
to cover the scar on my face?

46
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,559
Miss, please pardon me for being frank.

47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,399
We sell makeup products here.

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,919
We don't perform magic tricks.

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,399
I'm afraid it's literally impossible

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,839
to cover your scar.

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
I'll be back in a second.

52
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:12,639
I thought the Grand Beauty Hall
was a special shop.

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,360
Now, I think it's nothing special.

54
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,160
Miss, come to our Beauty Pavilion.

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
I know how to cover your scar.

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,919
- Really?
- You...

57
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,800
Come with me.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,960
We have a customer, huh?

59
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,559
Sorry for the trouble.

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
Actually, I understand this myself.

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,039
Even deities

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
can't cure my face.

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
But I'm getting married tomorrow.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,160
I don't want to embarrass my husband.

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,919
That's why I came here to try my luck.

66
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,839
If all women in the world
have lotus-like faces,

67
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,320
willow-leaf eyebrows, and cherry lips,

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,360
won't that make everyone look the same?

69
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,600
Miss, this scar of yours

70
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,919
looks quite unique.

71
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,119
Why are you bent on covering it?

72
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,759
Why don't we improve upon it instead?

73
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,279
Mister, do you truly think

74
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,240
that my scar isn't ugly?

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,440
Miss, I wonder
if you've heard of this saying before.

76
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,440
"Better a diamond with a flaw
than a pebble without."

77
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,000
As long as the artisan
puts in effort into his craft,

78
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,959
not only will the cracks
in the jade piece

79
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,839
not affect its price,

80
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,359
but it'll also make it

81
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,920
a one-of-a-kind accessory.

82
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,959
It's the same for people.

83
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,959
But...

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
But I'm still unconfident about it.

85
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,239
Miss Qiao'er,

86
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,799
I wish to show you something.

87
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,760
Miss, you...

88
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,040
Miss Qiao'er,

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,200
look. I'm the same as you.

90
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,640
I dare not reveal my true face
to the world due to my scar.

91
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,959
But luckily,

92
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,359
we have Young Master Lin with us.

93
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,720
Trust us.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,839
We'll definitely

95
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,160
help you to have a glorious wedding.

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,519
Lin Muxuan,

97
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,119
can you teach me how to put on makeup?

98
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,200
I wish to help Miss Qiao'er

99
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,839
put on makeup myself.

100
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,640
I heard

101
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,920
that today's bride

102
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,239
had a terrible scar on her face.

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
But a makeup helper
helped her to cover it up.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,519
Look.

105
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,440
Who is the lady
of the Zhang Family greeting to?

106
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,119
Thank you.

107
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,079
Aren't they from Beauty Pavilion?

108
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,000
(Beauty Pavilion)

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,799
I never expected

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,720
this relatively unknown shop

111
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,040
to be this good at cosmetics.

112
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,119
They're even better
than Grand Beauty Hall.

113
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,880
They're amazing indeed.

114
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,239
What do you think about my move?

115
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
You did think out of the box, huh?

116
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
You replaced the curtains
with gauze drapes.

117
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,679
It gives off a sense of fleetingness.

118
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,359
It does complement

119
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,799
the Golden Phoenix Makeup.

120
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,839
I never expected this many people
to observe the ceremony.

121
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,279
I thought that it wouldn't work as well

122
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,519
as everyone was already used
to observing such ceremonies.

123
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,600
Lin Muxuan,

124
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,839
regarding what you said
to Miss Qiao'er yesterday,

125
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,559
did you say it so that she would
employ our service?

126
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,959
Or were you sincere with your words?

127
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,799
What do you think
this jade pendant is worth?

128
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,679
It's crystal clear and translucent,

129
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,320
with a lustrous sheen
and a soft green color.

130
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:17,760
It's top-quality jade.

131
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,519
It should be worth 100 taels.

132
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,079
If so, could you tell
that the decoration on top of it

133
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,359
was originally a crack?

134
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,760
This jade was worth
less than ten taels initially.

135
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
But after some work has been done on it,

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
someone had already offered
300 taels for it.

137
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,399
300 taels?

138
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,119
You do have a pair of sharp eyes, huh?

139
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
If it were someone else,

140
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,519
they would probably lament
about the lost opportunity.

141
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,160
Just as jade cannot be flawless,
people are the same.

142
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,119
To me,

143
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,040
there are no flaws
that cannot be covered.

144
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,200
There are only people who cannot
appreciate beauty.

145
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,799
Just as jade cannot be flawless
without imperfections, huh?

146
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,519
Lin Muxuan, thank you.

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,679
I'll definitely do my best
to manage Beauty Pavilion.

148
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,760
I'll tend to my affairs first.

149
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,440
To me,

150
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,079
a golden phoenix is beautiful.

151
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,880
A scar is beautiful as well.

152
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,119
Beauty and ugliness

153
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,640
are just labels assigned by people.

154
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,600
True beauty

155
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,559
is not as it appears to the eyes.

156
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,519
He hasn't seen your entire self,

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
yet he's captivated by you.

158
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:23,119
That means he wasn't
captivated by your appearance.

159
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,799
He was captivated by your character.
