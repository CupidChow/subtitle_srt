(Chancellor Residence)

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,480
I knew

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,480
that sooner or later you would
come to your senses and come see me.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
The chancellor is truly
wise and strategic.

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,319
I'm here

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,959
to discuss a deal

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,199
with you.

28
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,120
A deal?

29
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:59,720
You're like fish on the chopping board,
and I'm the butcher.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you have to negotiate with?

31
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,879
I'm willing to hand over the Bai
family's Disguise Technique secret book.

32
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,519
But, I have one condition,

33
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,520
spare Xu Zhaozhao's life.

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,399
The Bai family's
Disguise Technique secret book

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,880
is in your hands indeed.

36
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,119
You're indeed greedy.

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,800
Sparing Bai Shiwan wasn't enough,

38
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,720
and now you want Xu Zhaozhao too.

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,880
She's just a substitute though.

40
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,919
Keeping her here
doesn't matter much to me.

41
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,839
I promise you,

42
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,320
I'll let her go.

43
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,399
But, what about your life?

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,919
It's all your disposal, Chancellor.

45
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,360
There's one more thing

46
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,279
I hope the Chancellor
will have some mercy.

47
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,080
Go ahead.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,720
Let me meet Xu Zhaozhao one last time.

49
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,720
Granted.

50
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,399
Lin Muxuan,

51
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,399
why have you come back?

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,960
Are you here alone?

53
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:21,839
Oh my goodness.

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,720
You have to leave now.

55
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,520
Leave here quickly.

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,919
No, what's wrong with you?

57
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,399
I told you leave here now.

58
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,479
I've discussed it with Shiwan.

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,600
The Chancellor's power is too great.

60
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,160
We won't meet a good end
if we offend him.

61
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,800
So, we've decided

62
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,520
to hand over the Disguise Technique

63
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,960
and formally join the Chancellor's side.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
But,

65
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,279
he is the true culprit
behind the Bai family massacre!

66
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,119
That's all in the past.

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,600
You may leave now.

68
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:55,720
From now on,

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,440
my matters

70
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,520
have nothing to do with you anymore.

71
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,600
What do you mean by
nothing to do with me?

72
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,160
You used me,

73
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,559
dragged me into your schemes,

74
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,080
and now you're telling me

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,919
it has nothing to do with me?

76
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry for what I've done to you.

77
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:15,399
You can take over

78
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,679
the Beauty Pavilion.

79
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,200
I don't care about that.

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,559
Tell me why.

81
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,279
Shiwan is still alive,

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,640
and you're useless to me now.

83
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,079
Please leave me.

84
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,559
Did you choose me

85
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,920
just to use me?

86
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,079
Yes, I did.

87
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,959
I chose you

88
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:45,000
because you're somewhat
similar to Shiwan.

89
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,959
Look at me.

90
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Look into my eyes

91
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,160
and tell me.

92
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,600
From the beginning until now,

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,320
you never have any other intention

94
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,320
while getting along with me.

95
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,119
Yes.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,720
From the beginning until now,

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,519
you were just a pawn.

98
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,679
An excellent pawn.

99
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,359
So, everything between us

100
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,679
was fake?

101
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,480
You taught me about business,

102
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,920
praised me for being smart,

103
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,399
and treated me well,

104
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,959
was all of that fake too?

105
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,279
Yes.

106
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,519
You are indeed very smart.

107
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,799
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

108
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,600
chosen you as a pawn.

109
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,200
Everything I did

110
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,880
was for my plan.

111
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,320
I know what you want to listen to,

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,200
but I'm sorry.

113
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,320
People don't develop feelings

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,519
for a pawn.

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,880
I don't believe you.

116
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,559
You're telling lies!

117
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,119
You're lying to me!

118
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,119
Xu Zhaozhao!

119
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,559
Stop deceiving yourself.

120
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
Shiwan is back,

121
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:23,760
and my unresolved feelings
are now settled.

122
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,119
Next month,

123
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,320
the Chancellor will
officiate our wedding.

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,600
Lin Muxuan.

125
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,880
I never want to see you again

126
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,760
for the rest of my life.

127
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,519
That's better.

128
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,519
Letting you hate me

129
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,000
