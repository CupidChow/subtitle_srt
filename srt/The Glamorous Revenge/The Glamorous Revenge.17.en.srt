00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:04,879
Zhaozhao,

22
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,440
this place may not be safe.

23
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,240
How about coming back with me first?

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,039
Bingxin,

25
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,039
I want to go save him.

26
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,000
What he owes me,

27
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,440
I want him alive

28
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,160
to repay me.

29
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,440
I congratulate the Chancellor
on getting what you desired.

30
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,119
Getting what I desired?

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,960
Chancellor,

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
please don't be annoyed.

33
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:47,960
Lin Muxuan

34
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,559
is already in our hands.

35
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:52,160
As long as we investigate his actions
over the past three years,

36
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,639
even if he remains silent,

37
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,080
we will definitely

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,759
uncover

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,199
the Disguise Technique secret book.

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,240
What makes you here

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,399
today?

42
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,960
Chancellor,

43
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,639
I mentioned

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,639
the military pay issue to you before.

45
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,000
You see

46
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:12,880
the Blossom Contest...

47
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,800
Regarding the Blossom Contest,

48
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,600
you did make a contribution there.

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,360
I've already prepared a gift for you.

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,759
Thank you, Chancellor,
for lending me a hand.

51
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,160
I will never forget your kindness.

52
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,759
This was crafted by skilled artisans

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,039
according to my prized steed.

54
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,320
Then...

55
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,160
It's...

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,000
It's indeed

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,759
a fine horse.

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,399
This horse can travel
a thousand miles a day.

59
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,520
Among its kind,

60
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,520
it stands out as the best.

61
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,919
I had hoped that someday

62
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:52,559
I could train it to be a lead horse.

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,960
But alas,

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,839
it lacks understanding of humanity.

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,160
After all, it's just an animal.

66
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,520
The Chancellor Residence
is heavily guarded.

67
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,639
Shadow Pavilion was
full of elite fighters,

68
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,039
but they all ended up being annihilated.

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,839
With just the two of us,

70
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,959
attacking head-on is not an option.

71
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,640
If we cannot attack directly,

72
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,320
we must resort to wise strategy.

73
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,920
However, Zuo Wenan
is a deeply suspicious man.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,760
Those who serve him closely

75
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,239
are all trusted confidants.

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,839
I think of one person.

77
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,720
If we can gain his help,

78
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,959
we might have a chance to succeed.

79
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:36,920
- Zhou Jia.
- Zhou Jia.

80
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,600
General!

81
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:57,839
General,

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,160
you must not do this.

83
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,160
This is a gift from the Chancellor.

84
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,359
If it's broken,

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,200
how are we going
to explain it to him?

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,160
Then, place it on the table,

87
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,119
so I can always remember
the Chancellor's favor.

88
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,959
Why did you play the wrong note?

89
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,519
There's a flaw in the melody,

90
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,559
and even Master Zhou could realize it.

91
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,839
Amazing.

92
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
How did you notice me?

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone, go out.

94
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,399
Leave her alone

95
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,160
to serve me tonight.

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
I heard the general was furious

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,519
outside the tent just now.

98
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,399
What makes you furious?

99
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,959
Let me guess.

100
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
I've long heard of
the general's bravery,

101
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,760
yet remain stationed here,

102
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,320
never gaining favor
at the Imperial Court.

103
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,839
I think

104
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,320
there must be someone holding you back.

105
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,119
If someone could help
the general rise to power,

106
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,600
would you be willing

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,119
to become your own master?

108
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:49,720
Who are you?

109
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,920
Who I am doesn't matter.

110
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,399
What matters is

111
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,519
how I can help you.

112
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,440
You're just a dancer.

113
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,239
How could you help me?

114
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,720
The general is in a bind now,

115
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,040
simply because you're doing it alone.

116
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,720
If the general is interested,

117
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:20,480
we can meet tomorrow

118
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,200
