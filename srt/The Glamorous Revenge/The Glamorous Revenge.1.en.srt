21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,540
(The Bai family, the Su family,
the Peng family)

22
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,000
(In the fifth year of Liming,)

23
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,760
(the world was in turmoil.)

24
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,599
(The Bai family's killed because
of their Disguise Technique.)

25
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,990
Hand over the Bai family's
Disguise Technique!

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,720
Get them!

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,680
(The only daughter
of the Bai family risked her life)

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,160
(and was not known to be alive,)

29
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:56,919
Shiwan!

30
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,559
(so that Lin Muxuan,
the adopted son of the Bai family,)

31
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,440
(could escape unharmed.)

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
(Since then,)

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,000
(the Bai family's Disguise Technique
has vanished)

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,080
(and a revenge plot)

35
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,880
(has quietly begun.)

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,000
(Three years later)

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,600
Chief, our secret agents reported

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,990
that they've found another person
who resembles Miss Bai.

39
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,479
Just a resemblance?

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,759
This woman has a veil
over her face all day long.

41
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,220
They've been following her for days,
but haven't been able to see her face.

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,559
Don't miss any chance.

43
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:58,600
Keep following her.

44
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,399
Chief, forgive me for asking.

45
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,490
Over the past three years,

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,039
why have you been looking for someone
who resembles Miss Bai?

47
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,639
Didn't Miss Bai already...

48
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,600
That's why

49
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,199
I have to find someone
who resembles her.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
(The only way to lure out the real
culprit of the Bai family's destruction)

51
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,960
(is to make people believe
that the Disguise Technique is back.)

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,660
(Buchuo Money Exchange)

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,639
(Buchuo Money Exchange)
News from the front line!

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,199
Zhou Jia's army retreated 50 miles.

55
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,639
Old notes are worthless.

56
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,800
Exchange them for silver ingots now!

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,720
The currency fluctuates sharply
in a short period of time.

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,800
There's no way it's unmanipulated.

59
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,240
They can't lie to us
when they've won a war.

60
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:45,559
Then let's get rid of the old notes.

61
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,260
If we don't change it,
it'll be worthless.

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,440
Wait!

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,119
Let's exchange it.

64
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:49,919
No!

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,400
You can't exchange it!

66
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,559
Isn't this the scar-faced girl
from Ciyou Hall on East Street.

67
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,160
You don't have to work odd jobs
to earn money for dinner today?

68
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,360
What are you doing here?

69
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,160
(Currency Exchange, Currency Ease)
Gosh, stop talking!

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,000
I've just done the math.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,440
According to the current situation,

72
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,559
if you sell your notes

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,399
and exchange them for silver ingots,
it'll be at least 20% shorter.

74
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,399
20%?

75
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,360
But it doesn't happen.

76
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,720
What does that mean?

77
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Just say what you have to say
and don't beat about the bush.

78
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,119
(Currency Exchange, Currency Ease)
It means someone's recalling notes.

79
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,119
The secret letter said that a force

80
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,160
is secretly manipulating
the currency to make a profit.

81
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,679
And she

82
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,760
has assembled a group of small investors
to fight this force.

83
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,559
She's something else.

84
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,926
I'm going to get her right now.

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,839
Wait.

86
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:43,480
(Looks like she's the one.)

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,040
(I want her at my disposal.)

88
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,119
On my command,

89
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,839
use all our financial resources

90
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,040
to disrupt the currency situation.

91
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,440
I want her

92
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,920
to have no way out.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,640
Don't run.

94
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:58,799
Give us our money back!

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,519
Listening to you

96
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,640
made us all lose money!

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,359
Don't run!

98
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,200
Stop there.

99
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,559
Stop!

100
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:05,480
Stop there.

101
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,119
I told you

102
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,079
not to listen to this girl.

103
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,959
She hasn't been to school a day.

104
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:11,799
She...

105
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,799
What does she know?

106
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,320
How could I have known
that guy was so crazy?

107
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,000
A lot of money down the drain.

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Guys,

109
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,839
please, I don't have any money.

110
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,200
You have to pay it back
even if you don't have the money.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,799
Give us back the money!

112
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,359
- Give us back the money!
- Give us back the money!

113
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,150
Give us back the money!

114
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,760
Give us back the money!

115
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
(I didn't expect her)

116
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,359
(to resemble Shiwan so much.)

117
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,160
(It saves me a lot of effort.)

118
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,600
Stop there!

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,040
What do you want?

120
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,119
If you move again,

121
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,440
I can't guarantee my hand won't shake

122
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,640
and add another scar to your face.

123
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:41,920
Close your eyes.

124
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,000
(How could there be such a resemblance
in the world?)

125
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,839
(It's God's way of helping me.)

126
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,239
(After three years of planning,)

127
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,399
(I've finally created the bait.)

128
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,399
(All I need to do now is)

129
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,079
(to get the real culprit
to take the bait.)

130
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,720
Stop there.

131
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,239
What?

132
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,640
You're not satisfied?

133
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,720
I dare not.

134
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,559
It's just

135
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,320
that after all you've done for me,

136
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,479
gosh,

137
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,440
are you interested in me?

138
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,840
It's kind of

139
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,400
a mutual will thing.

140
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,840
Don't move.

141
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:51,599
You...

142
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,840
What?

143
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,880
You still asked me if I'm satisfied?

144
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,719
My foot!

145
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,239
You went to all that trouble
to bring me here

146
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
to do my make-up?

147
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,799
You're a pervert, aren't you?

148
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:04,919
Young Master.

149
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,200
Young Master.

150
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,640
Don't come any close or I will kill him.

151
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,799
Miss, calm down.

152
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,840
You can go now.

153
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,880
Don't move.

154
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't move.

155
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,039
It's true that without the birthmark,

156
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,719
she and Shiwan look exactly alike.

157
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,239
Should we bring her back?

158
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,239
No.

159
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,799
I have a way of making her

160
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,599
