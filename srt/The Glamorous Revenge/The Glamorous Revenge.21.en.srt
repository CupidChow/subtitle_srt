seek sympathy,

00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,160
and be shameless.

What kind of idea is this from Bingxin?

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,720
Do people fall for this?

It's still not enough.

Before the children grow up,

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
I must ensure they are
well-fed and clothed,

Zhaozhao,

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
I...

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,919
What happened to you?

37
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,399
A few days ago,

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,720
there is someone
who caused trouble at your shop.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,399
I've taught him a lesson.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,679
But, who knows,

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,880
when I let my guard down,

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,919
he hurt me.

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,919
If you're injured,

44
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,320
go to the medical center.

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,360
Why come to me?

46
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,559
It's late now.

Zhaozhao,

49
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:07,759
could you

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,720
help bandage my injury?

51
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,119
Come in.

52
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,520
Now that you're bandaged,

53
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,199
you can leave now.

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,320
could you

56
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,720
let me stay for a few days?

58
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,000
don't push your luck!

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,320
I've been staying

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
at a nearby relay station,

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,679

00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
my hand is injured.

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,039

You...

68
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,000
Where's your money?

69
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,600
I left it all with you.

70
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,320
I'll return it to you.

71
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,000
Zhaozhao.

72
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,320
Did you stretch yourself again?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,519
Zhaozhao,

74
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,920
that guy struck me.

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,440
My injury

76
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,799
won't heal anytime soon.

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,720
Please let me stay for a while.

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,679
Soon after I get better,

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,799
I'll leave here.

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,679
Well.

81
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,519
If you don't want to take me in,

82
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll leave then.

83
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:47,880
Wait a moment.

84
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,519
You can stay until you're healed,

85
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,320
but not a moment longer.

86
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,000
What kind of makeup is this?

87
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,239
If you can't hold a brush properly,

88
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,559
you shouldn't be a makeup artist.

89
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,239
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I won't charge you
for today's makeup service.

91
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,880
Please give me another chance.

92
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Carry on.

93
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,600
(I didn't expect the condition to worsen
so quickly than I thought.)

94
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,399
(I don't know)

95
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,799
(how much longer I can hold on.)

96
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,600
(At this rate,)

97
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,959
(Lin Muxuan will soon figure it out.)

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,399
Has she left?

99
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,519
Don't take it to heart.

100
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,920
Even the best makeup artists
make mistakes.

101
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,720
Besides,

102
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,600
you've been exhausted lately.

103
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,720
You should take care of your health.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,600
And,

105
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,359
let me handle the upcoming one.

106
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,119
I saw that your hand was steady

107
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
during the last makeup session.

108
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,760
I think

109
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,920
you must have recovered
from your injury.

110
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,239
So,

111
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,359
you should immediately

112
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,040
pack your things and leave this place.

113
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,880
The longer you stay,

114
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,000
the more I'll have
to pay for your meals.

115
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,119
Zhaozhao,

116
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,959
I'm not fully recovered yet.

117
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,079
If you're worried about me freeloading.

118
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,760
Then,

119
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
I can eat only once a day.

120
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:52,920
How's that?

121
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,000
Are you satisfied?

122
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:55,760
Here you go.

123
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,519
This is our new product.

124
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,279
You may take a look.

125
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,920
Muxuan,

126
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,079
why does Miss Zhaozhao ignore me?

127
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,079
Miss Zhaozhao

128
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,160
is just too tired.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,799
During this time,

130
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,320
you all need to be well-behaved,

131
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,320
let her rest well

132
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,519
and not to worry too much.

133
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,239
Is that okay?

134
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,000
I will be well-behaved.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,720
- Sure.
- Sure.

136
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,320

00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,320
That young man

140
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,920
clearly likes you.

141
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,720
His eyes are always on you.

142
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,279
I heard

143
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,799
he scared off

144
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,359

145

Let's eat.

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
Alright.

148
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:20,640
Wait a minute.

149
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,160
What's wrong?

150
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,519
Lin Muxuan,

151
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,880
he doesn't want to eat?

152
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,840
He said

153
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,960
he's only eating one meal a day.

154
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,280
This guy

155
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,799
really plans to eat just one meal a day?

156
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,520
Yes.

157
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,840
In the afternoon, he mentioned

158
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,520
that his old injury had flared up again.

159
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,880
I'm not sure if he went to see a doctor.

160
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,479
Should we wait for him?

161
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,080
No, we won't.

162
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,520
Wait a moment.

163
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,119
You go ahead and eat.

164
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,960
This guy

165
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,359
has so many paintings.

166
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,799
(It's been nearly a month.)

167
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,320
(These medicines should be
almost used up by now.)

168
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,080
(Let me check what's lacking)

169
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,320
(so I can ask someone
to buy more tomorrow.)

170
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,359
Why are all the medicines still full?

171
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,119
He hasn't even used any of them.

172
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,320
What's going on with him?

173
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,479
He's doing it on purpose.

174
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,919
If his injury heals,

175
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,919
he'll have to leave,

176
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,960
so

177
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,520
he's not using the medicine.

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
You've acquired

all the tricks I haven't!

183
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,719

Lin Muxuan,

187
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,799
please come here for a while.

188
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,320
What happens?

189
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,919
I noticed your wound
hasn't healed for a long time.

190
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,520
I think it's because it's hard for you
to apply the medicine yourself.

191
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:11,880
Let me help you.

192
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:13,960
No need.

193
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,760
I'll do it myself.

194
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,719
Why?

195
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,960
What are you scared of?

196
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,840
Or

197
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,359
are you feeling guilty?

198
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,159
I'm not.

199
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:24,400
If you're not,

200
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,080
then let me help you.

201
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,320
Ouch, it hurts!

(Thirty-Six Stratagems
of Winning Hearts)

203
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,679
According to the thirty-six stratagems,

204
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,760
the twelfth strategy,

205
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
self-injury ruse,

206
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:42,919
which is using tears as a weapon
to create the scene of a tragic beauty.

207
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,039
Lin Muxuan,

208
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,919
are you too bored?

209
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,200
Zhaozhao,

210
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,479
I've never courted a girl before,

211
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,719
so I don't know what to do.

212
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,119
So, you resort to playing tricks on me?

213
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,679
I wasn't playing tricks.

214
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,520
You weren't?

215
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
You've been doing it all along,

216
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,919
even now.

217
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,359
Do you think it's fun to toy with me?

218
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,159
Lin Muxuan!

219
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,359
I didn't mean to.

220
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,200
Zhaozhao!

221
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,119
Zhaozhao!

222
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,159
