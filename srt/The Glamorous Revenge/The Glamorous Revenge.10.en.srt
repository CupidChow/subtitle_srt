You have to memorize

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,199
all the content of these books.

23
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:47,639
What?

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,279
The preliminary round
of the Blossom Contest

25
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,680
focused on theoretical knowledge.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,919
I've compiled the key points
of these books into exam questions

27
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,199
to help you remember.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,599
Am I studying beauty service
or preparing for the imperial exam?

29
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,080
If you find it too difficult,

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,599
you can give up.

31
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,480
I, Xu Zhaozhao,

32
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,919
will never back down.

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,039
I've done marking.

34
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:14,919
How did I do?

35
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,399
Your basic knowledge is decent.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,000
Of course!

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,919
After all, I learned from
the great Young Master Lin.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,199
But, for the color recognition,

39
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,279
it's a total failure.

40
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,639
I've never taught
such a slow student before.

41
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,440
How can that be?

42
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,839
It's not my fault.

43
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,000
Blame it on the fact that
these colors are too similar.

44
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,479
Aren't they all just red?

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,559
Why

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,880
is this one called "Crimson Lips"

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,039
and that one
called "Sweet Deep Dimples"?

48
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:48,279
Why can't they just be
called dark red, light red, or rose?

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,039
I'll explain one last time.

50
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,919
"Crimson Lips" mainly features
a rich deep red color.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,119
It is similar to the color of cherries.

52
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,320
And "Sweet Deep Dimples"...

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,240
I know all the theories,

54
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,119
but I just can't remember it.

55
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,240
Besides, we don't have much time left.

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,479
Do you

57
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,479
have any tricks

58
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,080
to help me memorize quickly?

59
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,199
I've calculated

60
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,039
that the profit of this month

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,880
still won't cover your debt to me.

62
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,440
How about

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we skip the pay for next month?

64
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,720
What did you mean?

65
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,880
How can you do that?

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,039
See?

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,639
Your face is turning red.

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,039
This is called "Sweet Deep Dimples".

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,839
You're messing with me!

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,479
And for "Crimson Lips"...

71
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,279
That's...

72
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,199
This.

73
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:07,639
Do you remember now?

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,679
Go ahead and review now.

75
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,020
♪Unable to bear the weight of longing,
thus I bid farewell to you♪

76

77
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,040
It's okay if you can't remember.

78
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,720
Just treat it like a game.

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Even if you get eliminated,
it’s no big deal.

80
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,000
I won't blame you.

81
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,079
Don't try to dampen my spirit.

82
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,399
I absolutely will not lose.

83
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,839
Bingxin, help me try...

84
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,119
Try...

85
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,679
Try this.

86
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,239
Zhaozhao,

87
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,079
it's so late now.

88
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,200
Let's get some rest, okay?

89
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,079
It's all because of
the Blossom Contest.

90
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,799
They let every participating shop

91
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,720
to present their
most iconic new products.

92
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,600
I combed through all
of Lin Muxuan's ancient books

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,519
just to come up with this one item.

94
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,920
Come on, let's try this.

95
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,640
The mastermind behind Zhou Jia
is truly cunning.

96
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,320
With just one move,

97
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,000
they've made every shop reveal
their family's most prized secrets.

98
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,040
If Xu Zhaozhao offers up
the Bai Family's makeup secrets,

99
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,640
it means that
she's exposing her true identity.

100
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,440
By doing so,

101
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,679
she'll be in real danger.

102
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,480
Why are you here?

103
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,079
It's so late now.

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,119
You should stop worrying about this.

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,839
You'll wear yourself out.

106
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm just trying to fulfill your wish.

107
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,640
Do you care about me?

108
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,559
Go to bed early. I'm leaving now.

109
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,920
I wanted to ask you,

110
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,200
do you know

111
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,799
about the "Color-Changing Flower"?

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,799
This flower is also known
as "The Beauty's Face".

113
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,079
It blooms at sunrise

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,119
and only lasts one day before withering.

115
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,920
It can change into
three different colors within a day.

116
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm thinking,

117
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,200
if we could grind the flower
into a paste and make it into lipstick,

118
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,000
will it have the
same color-changing effect?

119
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
Your idea

120
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,239
is quite peculiar.

121
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,640
If we have a lipstick

122
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,480
that changes color
depending on the person wearing it,

123
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,399
will that mean

124
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,399
everyone can have
their own unique color?

125
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,399
We need to have a most iconic product
for the Blossom Contest.

126
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,799
If I can find this flower
and make it into lipstick,

127
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,040
we could stand out.

128
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,760
This flower is rare.

129
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,399
I'm afraid I can't...

130
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,440
I'll go with you.

131
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,200
Really?

132
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,079
We've been walking
for a very long time here.

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,079
Why haven't we found it?

134
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,519
Could the book's record be wrong?

135
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,040
It seems this flower isn't meant for us.

136
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
Maybe we should head back.

137
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,720
No way.

138
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,880
We can't give up.

139
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,239
I must have missed something earlier.

140
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,600
I'll keep searching for it.

141
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,920
It grows with its back facing the sun,

142
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,399
and it changes the color
when exposed to light.

143
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,600
This seems like what the book described.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,239
Lin Muxuan, look! Is this the one?

145
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,600
I think I found it.

146
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,399

149
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,239
Lin Muxuan, where are you?

150
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,519
Come out! If you don't, I'll get angry.

151

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Where have you been?

154
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,840
I've been calling you so many times,
and you didn't answer at all.

155
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,719
I went over there to pick...

156
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,640
Pick what?

157
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,440
You scared me, do you know that?

158
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,880
I never expected that Shopkeeper Xu
would be so attached to me.

159
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,719
Nonsense!

160
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,479
Don't you have anything
you want to tell me?

I'm not around anymore,
