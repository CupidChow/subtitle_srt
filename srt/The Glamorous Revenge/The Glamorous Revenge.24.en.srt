21

Zhaozhao,

22
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:54,559
you're awake.

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,760
How long

24
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,279
was I asleep?

25
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,080
It's been some days.

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,759
Zhaozhao,

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,320
Zuo Wenan was dead,

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,520
and I've found the antidote.

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,199
Really?

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
You've already taken the antidote.

31
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,800
But, the physician said

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,880
the poison in you was too vicious.

33
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,759
It'll take some time
for you to recuperate.

00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,320
Zhaozhao,

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,559
before I met you,

36
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,320
I didn't know what I would do
after my revenge.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,679
But after meeting you,

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,320
I then understood.

39
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,479

Who

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,559
are you?

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,519
We've arrived.

54
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,760
Where is this?

55
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,480
This is the Lin Mansion,

56
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,279
the place we used to live.

57
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,480
Why

58
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,119
don't I remember?

59
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,359
It's alright.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
Be careful.

61
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,720
You only need to keep in mind

62
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,079
that Zhaozhao will always be
the most wonderful woman in my heart.

63
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,200
I

64
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,279
don't remember your name,

65
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,119
but

66
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:19,600
you seem to be

67
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,880
someone very important to me.

68
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,600
My name is Lin Muxuan.

69
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,559
"Mu" is the "Mu" derived from "Zhao Zhao Mu Mu"
[*Which means evening or dusk in Chinese]

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,679
Zhao Zhao

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,880
and Mu Mu,

72
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,519
our names are perfectly
complemented each other.

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,760
You and I must be destined

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,760
to be together in our previous life.

75
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,720
Then, in my past life,
I must have done many good deeds

76
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,359
to meet someone
as wonderful as you in this life.

77
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,679
Here.

78
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,600
Have some water.

79
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:15,799
Zhaozhao!

80
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,720
Zhaozhao!

81
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,079
I'll go get the physician for you.

82
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,880
Just sit here and
talk with me for a while.

83
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,519
Can you tell me again

84
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,519
how we meet each other?

85
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,559
Sure.

86
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,600
The first time we met

87
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,920
was at the trading post at the market.

88
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I found that this lady is
distinct from the others.

89
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,959
From the first meeting,

90
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,519
I'm determined

91
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,320
to cling to you for the rest of my life.

92
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,119
What's this?

93
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,160
A debt note.

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,799
A debt note?

95
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,799
Then,

96
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,679
are we getting along
with each other since that day?

97
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:32,160
The days after that moment

98
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,799
were the happiest time of my life.

99
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,600
Lin Muxuan,

100
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,959
you're lying.

101
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:42,920
You...

102
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,279
The first time you saw me,

103
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,399
you had ulterior motives.

104
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,279
You unveiled my face on stage

105
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,279
and embarrassed me.

106
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,959
You schemed to keep me by your side,

107
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,279
first making me a servant,

108
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,119
then a shopkeeper.

109
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,519
Zhaozhao,

110
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,320
you've remembered everything.

111
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,200
I wrote down everything about us,

113
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,720
but I forgot

114
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,559
where I put the paper.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,799
Zhaozhao,

116
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,920
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:30,000
I had hoped to take this opportunity

118
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,839
to let you forget everything,

119
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,159
especially the bad things I did to you.

120
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,000
But, unexpectedly,

121
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,799
you remembered it all.

122
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,760
From now on,

123
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,599
whether good or bad,

124
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,479
every memory will be

125
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,479
precious to me.

Zhaozhao,

127
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,320
please wait for me.

128
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,760
I'll go get the physician.

129
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,559
Can you

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,760
do one last thing for me?

131
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:14,919
Sure.

132
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,200
Just say it.

133
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,760
Please help me
