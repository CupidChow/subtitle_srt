Bingxin won the title
of the Queen of Flowers Makeup.

22
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,400
Our Beauty Pavilion has also
become famous.

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,919
Such a joyous occasion
must be celebrated properly.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,559
Since it's a celebration,

25
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,120
why not find a restaurant or tavern?

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,919
Good news should be shared with family,

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,879
but I've been an orphan since childhood.

28
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,279
Ciyou Hall is my home,

29
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,599
so I could only bring you here.

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,879
It seems

31
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,480
you have deep feelings

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,319
for Ciyou Hall.

33
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,760
My mother died after giving birth.

34
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,400
My father was gone as well.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,679
My uncle and aunt raised me
until I was seven.

36
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,119
They thought I was a burden,

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,800
so they tried to sell me to a brothel.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,440
But

39
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,679
I was lucky.

40
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:20,960
As soon as I entered,
I met a kind gentleman.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
He helped me escape.

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,880
If it weren't for him,

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,279
I'm afraid

44
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,759
I would have been trapped
in that wretched place.

45
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:34,960
Brother,

46
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,119
help me.

47
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:38,639
I don't want to be in this place.

48
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,039
Go ahead, run.

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,279
Stop!

50
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,080
Stop right there!

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,479
You brat, get out of my way.

52
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,279
Move aside.

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,080
This wine...

54
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,279
At first, it tasted strong.

55
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,279
But the more I drink it,

56
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,679
the better it tastes.

57
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,119
If you like it,

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,479
we can buy a jar of wine
and bury it someday.

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,399
Next year,

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,080
we can dig it up and drink it together.

61
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,559
Why wait until another day?

62
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,080
Let's do it today.

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,960
Lin Muxuan,

64
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,600
do you know when I feel the loneliest?

65
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,119
It's during moments of great joy
or deep sorrow,

66
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,720
and I have no family to share it with.

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,880
That's why I envy those

68
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,919
who still have their parents
by their side.

69
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:44,919
Lin Muxuan,

70
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,759
I have a question for you.

71
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,919
Where are your parents?

72
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,440
Why have I

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
never heard you mention them?

74
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,559
I've been without parents
since childhood.

75
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,320
Lin Muxuan,

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,320
if your parents could see you now,

77
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,720
they'd be so proud.

78
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,720
But,

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,679
more than whether you've succeeded,

80
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,520
they'd probably care more
about what's in here.

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,160
How do you feel?

82
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,020
♪A brilliant stroke caught
in a painting of smoky willows♪

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
(Ever since the Bai family massacre,)

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,000
(revenge has been
the sole purpose of my life.)

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,519
(The great joys and deep sorrows
you mentioned,)

86
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:42,279
(I haven't felt them in a long time.)

87
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,119
(Still, I am glad.)

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,799
(Xu Zhaozhao,)

89
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,079
(this is the first time someone
has cared about how I feel.)

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,959
So even Shopkeeper Xu
can make accounting errors.

91
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,959
What a rare sight.

92
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,320
Why is your face so hot?

93
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,119
Did you catch a cold
from last night's drinking?

94
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,559
Are you...

95
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,079
worried about me?

96
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,760
Beauty Pavilion's business
is just starting to pick up.

97
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,679
We need to strike while the iron is hot.

98
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,480
If you fall sick now,

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,799
it will only delay business.

100
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,200
I'll go buy you a bowl of ginger soup.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,320
Keep it for yourself.

102
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,320
That's it.

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,279
See,

104
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,880
he's nothing but a heartless businessman.

105
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,320
He's even more ruthless than me.

106
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,119
He only brought me back

107
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,519
because he's afraid no one
will help him if I get sick.

108
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,320
So,

109
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,200
you're angry because he treats you well,

110
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,760
but not out of concern.

111
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:32,920
Exactly.

112
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,519
You care so much
about his feelings towards you.

113
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,880
Could it be

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,359
that you like him?

115
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,480
Impossible.

116
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,959
How could I like him?

117
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,119
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

118
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,679
If you want to, I can teach you

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,119
how to probe his feelings.

120
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,279
Zhou Jia will return to the court soon,

121
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,799
much earlier than we planned.

122
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,920
Has his old lover been informed?

123
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,720
The message has been sent to her.

124
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,720
However, Shadow Pavilion
has been tracking her movements,

125
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
and they found that she's been
frequenting beauty shops lately,

126
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,119
leaving each time disappointed.

127
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,200
Seems like she's dissatisfied
with her appearance.

128
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,320
Then send someone

129
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,160
to tell her about Xu Zhaozhao.

130
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,480
Let her know

131
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,600
that Beauty Pavilion

132
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,799
can make her dream come true.

133
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,279
But what if

134
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,079
Zhou Jia doesn't remember her at all?

135
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,600
That doesn't matter.

136
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:31,519
What matters is that Zhou Jia
sees Xu Zhaozhao's face.

137
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:33,399
I see.

138
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,399
Be gentle,

139
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,320
Xu Zhaozhao.

140
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,679
Young Master Lin.

141
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,320
Young Master Lin.

142
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,320
What are they talking about?

143
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,079
Young Master Lin.

144
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,279
What's the matter?

145
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,519
I made some pastries for you,

146
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,160
in case you're hungry.

147
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,279
Lin Fan,

148
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,359
leave us for now.

149
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,320
You made these?

150
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,280
Looks like they're not poisoned.

151
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,400
Just leave them here.

152
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,159
Lin Muxuan.

153
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,159
I appreciate your kind gesture,

154
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,919
but I don't like sweets.

155
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,119
I have things to attend to,
so I'll be leaving.

156
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,119
Just now,

157
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,880
he ate what I ate.

158
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,119
Could it be that he really likes me?

159
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,880
Since when?

160
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,679
From the very beginning, or...

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,799
Gosh.

162
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:06,599
This guy

163
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,119
