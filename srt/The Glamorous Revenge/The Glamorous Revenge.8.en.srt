You heartless man.

How dare you say that you fancy me?

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,160
He didn't hear anything I said, huh?

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,680
By then, I'll leave
after collecting my money.

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,360
I won't ever see you again!

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,080
Let's ignore him, then.

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,239
Forget it.

28
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,480
Maybe

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,199
he

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,320
had some bitter reasons
behind his actions.

31
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,000
If so, what do you intend to do, then?

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,600
Maybe I can find out

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,479
what exactly is on his mind

34
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,080
after accomplishing this request.

35
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,720
All done.

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,800
What's wrong?
Are you unhappy with something?

37
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm satisfied with the makeup.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Although I look 17 now,

39
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,600
I don't feel like the same person.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,520
Time doesn't just
change one's appearance.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It also changes one's state of mind.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,639
Miss, you can tell us about your stories
of the past if you don't mind.

43
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,080
I'll see if we can find
some inspiration from this.

44
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:23,000
When I was young, I had a childhood friend
who was also my lover.

45
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,839
I call him

46
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,240
Jia.

47
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,279
Jia!

48
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,320
Jia, you must come back!

49
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,320
So,

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,080
did he die in the war?

51
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,479
My parents deceived me
by saying so as they were worried

52
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,119
that I might waste my time
waiting for him.

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,919
They made me marry another person.

54
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,039
After that, I only found out

55
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,000
that not only did he survive,

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,839
but he also rendered
numerous military merit.

57
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,080
He has become a general.

58
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,240
He'll make a glorious return soon.

59
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you referring to Zhou Jia,
also known as General Ningyuan?

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,200
Precisely. Mister, do you know him?

61
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,679
I've heard about him.

62
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,040
I have missed him for half a lifetime.

63
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,119
Now that he has returned,

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,839
I have to meet up with him.

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,839
But...

66
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,640
But what if he's married with children?

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,480
What if he has forgotten about you?

68
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,239
That's why I want to meet him
as I was back then.

69
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,119
He wouldn't forget about me
if he had feelings for me.

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,480
It doesn't matter how beautiful I look

71
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,720
if he has no feelings for me.

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
Miss Zhaozhao.

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,839
Mr. Lin.

74
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll leave this to you two, then.

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,000
She's casting away everything she has

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,880
for the past.

77
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,600
Is it worth it?

78
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,239
Of course.

79
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,279
So, you think I shouldn't

80
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,320
cast away my past either?

81
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,519
Wake up!

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,279
Wake up!

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
What's the matter?

84
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,079
Very soon,

85
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:56,799
Miss Qiluo will be meeting up
with General Zhou.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,600
I...

87
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:01,279
I really can't figure out
what's wrong with the makeup look.

88
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,679
I want you to join me there.

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,399
It's fine if you don't want

90
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,119
to join me.

91
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:20,440
I have no choice
but to head there myself, then.

92
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,480
I'll join you.

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,839
Who said I wasn't joining you?

94
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:28,920
Good.

95
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,320
Are you sure this is the right way?

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is the place.

97
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,000
To her,

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,679
this is the most beautiful place
in the world.

99
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,239
This is for you.

100
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,239
Don't mention it.

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,119
Emotions arise from the scenery,

102
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,399
and beauty comes from emotions.

103
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,239
It looks desolate to us

104
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,880
merely because we didn't have
the same experience as them here.

105
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,200
If so, do you think the current scene

106
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:31,920
is touching?

107
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,180
♪You shine like the moon
surrounded by myriads of stars♪

108
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
I got it!

109
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,839
We can try to relive
their stories of the past.

110
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,640
Maybe we'll get inspired.

111
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,040
Don't you agree?

112
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,079
Back then, Qiluo was
standing below the tree.

113
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,600
However, it seemed like
Zhou Jia wasn't coming.

114
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Just when she was about to leave
as she thought she was stood up,

115
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,440
Zhou Jia patted

116
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,200
her shoulder unexpectedly.

117
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,079
Qiluo turned around,

118
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,200
but she wasn't standing firm
on her feet.

119
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,079
Luckily, Zhou Jia was there to grab her.

120
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,200
Just as their emotions
reach their climax,

121
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:09,920
they...

122
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,200
All right.

123
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,119
We'll stop here.

124
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,000
I thought you were
going to relive their story.

125
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,239
What's the rest of the story?

126
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,679
Why didn't you continue reading it?

127
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,440
You shouldn't be too serious.

128
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
When it comes to this,

129
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,279
it's all about the atmosphere.

130
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:25,839
Don't you agree?

131
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,600
One must strive for perfection
in all aspects

132
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,000
to ensure a complete victory.

133
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,440
Since you agreed to her request,

134
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,919
you shouldn't just
brush it off like that.

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Give it to me.

136
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
It's nothing much.

137
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,200
Give it to me.

138
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,840
Why are you wiping your mouth?

139
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,119
I should be the one doing it!

140
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:00,520
I!

141
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,239
Bah!

142
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,719
That's not what I mean.

143
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,280
You misunderstood me.

144
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,880
So, this is the essence

145
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,799
of Qiluo's makeup.

146
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll look for Qiluo right now.

147
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,239
