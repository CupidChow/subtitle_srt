21
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,080
For this Blossom Contest,

22
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,599
there are a total of three rounds.

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,319
The contest

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,080
will begin

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,919
now.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,839
For each round,

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,919
the time limit

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,000
is one hourglass.

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,519
Begin!

30
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,620
(E'huang Makeup)

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,679
Zhou Jia.

32
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,600
You have potential indeed.

33
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:40,919
Thank you, Chancellor.

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,320
Master.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,160
Everything has been arranged for.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,919
I hope that it'll make the mastermind

37
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,759
give himself away.

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,080
The contest is almost over.

39
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,360
I'll think of a way to help her escape.

40
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,360
If she's in danger,

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,720
you have to ensure her safety.

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,520
The first round

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,839
is over.

44
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,800
Contestants, please wait for the result.

45
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,520
Let's look forward to it!

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,000
Lin Muxuan?

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,279
You did a great job just now.

48
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,279
I witnessed your effort.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
However,

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,399
there's an emergency.

51
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,000
I need you to retrieve something
for me at the residence.

52
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,240
But,

53
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,679
the contest result
will be announced soon.

54
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,720
This is vital.

55
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,360
I can't leave for now.

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,919
That's why I'm asking you
to do me this favor.

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,119
But...

58
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,919
Is it related to today's event?

59
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,199
All right.

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,199
I'll return

61
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,000
soon.

62
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,800
Zhaozhao.

63
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,000
Be careful.

64
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,600
Master,

65
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
everything is ready.

66
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,759
Now, we just need
to wait for that man to show up.

67
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
Follow my command.

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,039
Be on standby.

69
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,279
The winner

70
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,480
is...

71
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,000
Zhaozhao!

72
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,079
Master!

73
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:22,959
Let me go!

74
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,079
I'm sure it's a trap.

75
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,640
We mustn't be impatient.

76
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,239
They won't do anything to Miss Xu.

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,399
Xu Zhaozhao.

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
Don't force me!

79
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:29,959
Zhaozhao!

80
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:30,559
Master!

81
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Our efforts will go down the drain
if you show yourself now!

82
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,480
All of you, listen up!

83
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:37,839
Xu Zhaozhao

84
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,679
is a wanted criminal.

85
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,720
I know

86
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:45,119
I know that the surviving members
of the Bai Family are among you all.

87
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
You better show yourself

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,720
if you wish to rescue her.

89
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,959
Members of the Bai Family?

90
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,760
Hurry and show yourself.

91
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,119
That's right.

92
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,559
Show yourself.

93
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,359
Go and show yourself.

94
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,519
My goodness.

95
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,119
Seems like

96
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,160
that person doesn't care
about your safety at all.

97
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,959
It's pointless to keep you alive, then.

98
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,119
Zhaozhao!

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,519
Stop.

100
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,359
Keep her alive.
I still have a use for her.

101
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,880
Take her back for now.

102
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,079
Yes, Chancellor.

103
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,720
All right.

104
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,480
Tell me.

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,040
Who's the real shopkeeper

106
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,440
of Beauty Pavilion?

107
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,000
Xu Zhaozhao.

108
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,679
I'm referring to the mastermind
behind you.

109
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,119
Who is it?

110
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,559
There's no mastermind.

111
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,119
Beauty Pavilion

112
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
was my shop to begin with.

113
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
Although you're young,

114
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,720
you're quite stubborn.

115
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,359
Aren't you afraid
that I might kill you for real?

116
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,559
Are you still not willing to tell me?

117
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,959
What do you want me to say?

118
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm the real shopkeeper

119
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,320
of Beauty Pavilion.

120
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,880
You want me to list out
a person who doesn't exist.

121
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,920
How can I do so?

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,760
Seems like you won't speak

123
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,200
until you see her, huh?

124
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,399
Bring her in.

125
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,920
Now, do you know why

126
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,679
an incompetent orphan like you

127
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,799
was chosen by him
to become Beauty Pavilion's shopkeeper?

128
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,519
To him,

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,880
you're merely a replacement.

130
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,359
You're an insignificant bait.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,720
Tell me.

132
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,920
Who exactly is he?

133
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,559
Where can I find him?

134
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,760
I don't know.

135
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:26,920
Master.

136
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,760
Why did you stop me?

137
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:32,880
Why?

138
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,799
I can't just sit idly by
as you try to kill yourself!

139
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,799
I did tell you
to ensure her safety, didn't I?

140
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:38,799
Master, if you show yourself
just to rescue her,

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,720
you'll only die together with her.

142
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,119
Master!

143
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,519
Gather all of our men.

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
Rescue Xu Zhaozhao
