Welcome to "HYPER LINE"

00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,067
I'm sure

26
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:15,367
you are all curious
what "HYPER LINE" means

27
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:17,367
which is the theme of this concert

28
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:21,133

Hello, it's WINTER here

68
00:41:56,667 --> 00:42:01,934
Here we are today
on the second day of the concert

69
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:03,968
Sadly, you guys didn't get to see

70
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:08,100
how awkward and clumsy we were
on the first day

71
00:42:10,968 --> 00:42:13,701
Since it was our first concert,

72
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:17,434
there were so many
awkward moments yesterday

73
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,834
But we're a bit better today

74
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:21,167
You like it?

75
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:23,801
We cried yesterday

76
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:24,501
Right

77
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:27,033
- I really don't want to cry today
- Not today...

78
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:29,667
Let's finish in a happy vibe today

79
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:37,734
So now, I feel like you guys are curious about

80
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:39,400
the meaning of "HYPER LINE"

81
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,901
We'll decide who will explain
by playing rock, paper, scissors

82
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:46,334
Please look forward to it

83
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,567
I wish it's not me today

84
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,267
- Right, you did it yesterday
- KARINA did it yesterday

85
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,400
It makes me nervous

86
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,934
Do it or you explain
Rock, paper, scissors

87
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:52,834
Hold on

88
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:53,801
You were late

89
00:42:53,801 --> 00:42:55,267
Do it or you lose
Rock, paper, scissors

90
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:57,968
Is it me?

91
00:42:57,968 --> 00:42:59,200
- Yes
- Me?

92
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:01,434
It's you
You can do this, NINGNING

93
00:43:01,434 --> 00:43:02,434
Believe in yourself

94
00:43:08,968 --> 00:43:12,434
Online is the world
where aespa and æ meet

95
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:15,601
and offline is the world
where aespa and MY meet

96
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:18,968
No cheating

97
00:43:18,968 --> 00:43:19,968
No reading the script

98
00:43:19,968 --> 00:43:21,601
Which means

99
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:27,334
HYPER LINE is the world
where MY, aespa, and æ meet?

100
00:43:27,334 --> 00:43:28,234
Right

101
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:29,200
Is it?

102
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,234
Correct

103
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:31,567
Perfect?

104
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,701
Did you notice æ appearing
in the venue earlier?

105
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:39,133
æ, MY, and aespa meet

106
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:41,300
That's why it's called "HYPER LINE"

107
00:43:44,234 --> 00:43:47,100
And guys, when we were performing "Girls,"

108
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,367
were you able

109
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:52,234
to see WINTER?

110
00:43:53,267 --> 00:43:54,534
How was she?

111
00:43:55,868 --> 00:43:56,968
Did she do well?

112
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,501
WINTER practiced so hard
that her hands started to bleed

113
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:01,534
Right

114
00:44:01,534 --> 00:44:03,100
- All for you
- I did my best

115
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,267
It was blood, sweat, and tears

116
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,801
I mean, I decided to go sideways
at a certain point

117
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:10,601
and stand up at a certain point
I planned everything

118
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:13,133
But it's my first time
to go up on the lift

119
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:14,501
- So it was scary
- She got scared

120
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:15,334
It was super scary

121
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:17,133
So I was a little...

122
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:17,968
Thank you

123
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:18,901
Sorry?

124
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:19,901
You did well

125
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:22,067
Good job

126
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:24,267
Thank you for saying that

127
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,400
And for the guitar part

128
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,934
You guys are insane about playing guitar

129
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:31,000
Aren't you?

130
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,734
They love everything

131
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:36,567
I'll keep practicing
and show you different sides of myself

132
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:40,467
And

133
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:42,267
- must mention KARINA's solo performance
- Right

134
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:53,601
It's called "Menagerie"
I mentioned it briefly yesterday

135
00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:55,400
but I participated in writing the lyrics

136
00:44:57,834 --> 00:44:59,067
I love compliments

137
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:01,400
aespa loves what?

138
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,434
Compliments, of course

139
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,167
Right

140
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:05,167
Got it?

141
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:08,467
This is another word for "Zoo"

142
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:11,601
This song is about the hallucinatory quest

143
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:13,801
We tried to express the hallucinatory quest

144
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:16,701
through wild animals
in the zoo wriggling around

145
00:45:16,701 --> 00:45:19,033
We wrote the lyrics like this

146
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:23,767
We tried our best to suit you guys

147
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,701
Did you guys like it?

148
00:45:28,868 --> 00:45:31,133
What's obvious here is
that I've done a solo performance

149
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:32,634
but I won't be the only one doing this

150
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:36,000
Don't you think so?

151
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,467
Well...

152
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:39,234
You probably all know

153
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:41,367
Right? You know everything, don't you?

154
00:45:41,868 --> 00:45:45,100
- You must have seen it already
- Yeah, but think as this is your first time

155
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,300
Be excited for

156
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,267
the next solo performance as well

157
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:52,734
High quality performances for sure

158
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:57,868
Now, we should slowly
move on to the next song

159
00:45:58,434 --> 00:46:01,467
This next one is a song
that you can all follow along with

160
00:46:04,133 --> 00:46:07,033
Please stand up and dance with us

161
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:09,100
They didn't yesterday

162
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,601
- Right
- We were a little disappointed

163
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,434
We were a little sad

164
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:14,968
But today, you must dance with us

165
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:16,434
It's this one

166
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:17,834
- We'll be watching
- Just this one

167
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:20,434
Let's see who's having more fun today
compared to yesterday

168
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:26,133
Everyone watching Beyond LIVE
You have to follow along as well

169
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,200

170
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:29,601

171
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:56,567
Sing with us

[I'm Unhappy]

174
01:05:26,033 --> 01:05:28,801
Are you guys having fun?

175
01:05:31,834 --> 01:05:33,400
For this segment of the show

176
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,200
It's impossible for us
not to mention WINTER's solo performance

177
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,367
- It's called "Lips," right?
- Right

178
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:41,467
"Lips" is the title

179
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:43,534
Read my lips

180
01:05:43,534 --> 01:05:45,868
I'm confessing my love

181
01:05:45,868 --> 01:05:46,868
Right

182
01:05:46,868 --> 01:05:48,234
That's what the song is about

183
01:05:48,234 --> 01:05:50,834
This is a song where we confess our love

184
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:54,234
It's a bit embarrassing

185
01:05:54,234 --> 01:05:56,334
The lyrics are up

186
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:59,701
and we sang in front of
a beautiful star-like background

187
01:05:59,701 --> 01:06:00,968

02:07:13,834 --> 02:07:16,100
a song called "'Til We Meet Again"

374
02:07:16,100 --> 02:07:19,334
This was pre-released

375
02:07:19,334 --> 02:07:20,901
but it carries the meaning of
"Let's meet again"

376
02:07:20,901 --> 02:07:23,501
"We'll meet again"
and that is why

377
02:07:23,501 --> 02:07:26,267
we picked it as the finale

378
02:07:26,801 --> 02:07:32,000
There's another song with a similar vibe

379
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
But...

380
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:35,234
We're saving that song for now

381
02:07:35,234 --> 02:07:36,667
We're saving it for later

382
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,501
After we make a comeback

383
02:07:42,501 --> 02:07:44,400
and have another concert

384
02:07:47,033 --> 02:07:48,334
It seems way too early to say this

385
02:07:49,367 --> 02:07:51,601
Anyways, we'll perform it then

386
02:07:52,968 --> 02:07:54,501
Please look forward to it

387
02:07:54,934 --> 02:07:57,934
Before we share our thoughts
regarding this concert

388
02:07:57,934 --> 02:08:00,434
we would like to introduce
the director, Shim Jaewon

389
02:08:00,434 --> 02:08:03,868
- Please give him a round of applause
- Jaewon!

390
02:08:05,067 --> 02:08:06,834
Also known as BeatBurger

391
02:08:06,834 --> 02:08:07,834
He's so

392
02:08:09,701 --> 02:08:11,167
handsome

393
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:13,667
- Cool
- Good-looking

394
02:08:15,334 --> 02:08:17,501
Jaewon worked really hard for us

395
02:08:17,501 --> 02:08:22,200
We will be visiting his house
to see his cat soon

396
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:23,667
Keep your promise

397
02:08:23,667 --> 02:08:25,067
He said he will grill meat for us

398
02:08:25,067 --> 02:08:26,100
Right

399
02:08:26,834 --> 02:08:29,300
He did work so hard

400
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:33,133
I thought we were having
100 meetings a day, really

401
02:08:33,133 --> 02:08:35,267
Practice and then go to the meeting

402
02:08:35,267 --> 02:08:39,033
Come back and have another meeting
even late at night

403
02:08:39,033 --> 02:08:41,033
Not just Jaewon

404
02:08:41,033 --> 02:08:45,467
but there are so many staff
who put so much effort

405
02:08:45,467 --> 02:08:47,634
into our concert

406
02:08:47,634 --> 02:08:49,400
You know

407
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:53,234
how we tried a lot of new things
for this concert

408
02:08:53,234 --> 02:08:57,734
and we had to go through
a lot of trial and error

409
02:08:57,734 --> 02:09:01,334
but we're grateful for all the hard work

410
02:09:01,334 --> 02:09:03,868
- We appreciate it
- Thanks to all of them

411
02:09:03,868 --> 02:09:06,834
we were able to wrap up
our first concert with so many good memories

412
02:09:06,834 --> 02:09:09,100
- No one got hurt, too
- Of course

413
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:10,067
With that being said

414
02:09:10,067 --> 02:09:11,067
That's the best

415
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:13,133
With that being said?

416
02:09:13,133 --> 02:09:15,801
With that being said
let's quickly share our feelings

417
02:09:15,801 --> 02:09:18,000
one by one
and sing the ending song

418
02:09:21,467 --> 02:09:22,367
Okay

419
02:09:23,534 --> 02:09:27,300
To begin with
I think we had so much fun today

420
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:29,067
Which makes me grateful

421
02:09:29,067 --> 02:09:32,968
Today's atmosphere was
a little different from yesterday

422
02:09:32,968 --> 02:09:34,734
We felt a little more relaxed

423
02:09:34,734 --> 02:09:37,968
MY had...

424
02:09:37,968 --> 02:09:39,100
How should I put it?

425
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:42,133
A little bit of a YOLO vibe

426
02:09:42,133 --> 02:09:43,601
So I had a lot of fun

427
02:09:43,601 --> 02:09:45,767
Thank you
See you next time

428
02:09:49,067 --> 02:09:52,801
I was so happy
both yesterday and today

429
02:09:54,133 --> 02:09:55,200
How should I say?

430
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:58,367
I hope we're always together like this

431
02:09:58,367 --> 02:10:01,968
Thank you MY

432
02:10:01,968 --> 02:10:05,567
and thank you fellow artists
who came here tonight

433
02:10:05,567 --> 02:10:09,167
and to our staff
thank you for all your hard work

434
02:10:09,167 --> 02:10:13,100
We'll continue to do our best
for the rest of the tour

435
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:15,033
Love you, MY

436
02:10:16,234 --> 02:10:17,467
Love you

437
02:10:18,868 --> 02:10:19,868
Okay

438
02:10:22,167 --> 02:10:26,968
First of all, thank you for spending

439
02:10:26,968 --> 02:10:31,968
your precious time
to come to our concert

440
02:10:32,901 --> 02:10:36,434
Hope our performances

441
02:10:36,434 --> 02:10:38,801
worth your precious time, right?

442
02:10:41,167 --> 02:10:42,868
Thank you very much

443
02:10:42,868 --> 02:10:47,167
Now that our first two days of
the first concert are over

444
02:10:47,167 --> 02:10:50,067
we'll be having more concerts
in the future

445
02:10:50,067 --> 02:10:53,033
and showing you different sides of us

446
02:10:53,467 --> 02:10:57,567
Hope you guys are
surprised every time you come

447
02:10:59,234 --> 02:11:02,234
Thank you so much for today
I had so much fun

448
02:11:02,234 --> 02:11:04,133
Thank you

449
02:11:07,234 --> 02:11:12,801
It seems like
the girls basically said everything

450
02:11:12,801 --> 02:11:15,767
Thank you for taking your time
to come to the concert

451
02:11:15,767 --> 02:11:18,734
Thank you MY
who are watching Beyond LIVE

452
02:11:18,734 --> 02:11:21,868
Thank you for taking your time to watch us

453
02:11:21,868 --> 02:11:25,033
We were so happy, thanks to you

454
02:11:25,434 --> 02:11:28,367
As we've made our comeback

455
02:11:28,367 --> 02:11:32,601
we'll show you more special
and more interesting sides of us

456
02:11:32,601 --> 02:11:34,400
so please look forward to it

457
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:37,267
We'll never stop developing as an artist

458
02:11:37,267 --> 02:11:39,734
so hope you'll continue to
expect a lot from us

459
02:11:39,734 --> 02:11:43,567
For the things we've said
we've always failed to take...

460
02:11:43,567 --> 02:11:44,868
We've never failed to take responsibility

461
02:11:45,267 --> 02:11:46,133
Did we fail?

462
02:11:46,133 --> 02:11:47,767
- Sorry
- What were you trying to say?

463
02:11:47,767 --> 02:11:49,234
I guess I was nervous

464
02:11:49,434 --> 02:11:50,901
You almost made a huge mistake

465
02:11:50,901 --> 02:11:52,934
- It's okay
- I failed though

466
02:11:52,934 --> 02:11:53,968
Let me say it properly

467
02:11:53,968 --> 02:11:56,534
We've never failed to take responsibility
for what we've said

468
02:11:56,534 --> 02:11:58,801
So please look forward to

469
02:11:58,801 --> 02:12:02,400
our upcoming comeback
and all of aespa's future promotions

470
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:03,667
We'll work hard to be better

471
02:12:03,667 --> 02:12:06,567
aespa will work hard to be cooler

472
02:12:06,567 --> 02:12:08,634
Thank you and love you

473
02:12:10,634 --> 02:12:13,868
We'll sing "ICU" as the last song

474
02:12:14,434 --> 02:12:17,334
- Let's sing it all together
- Please sing with us

475
02:12:18,501 --> 02:12:23,501
[ICU]

476
02:15:56,467 --> 02:15:59,767
Thank you, guys

477
02:15:59,767 --> 02:16:04,200
- We're going down
- So cute, so lovely

478
02:16:07,167 --> 02:16:08,968
You might not want to hear this

479
02:16:08,968 --> 02:16:11,100
when you go down from a lift
you have to jump

480
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:12,667
We didn't know that

481
02:16:12,667 --> 02:16:14,400
If not, you have to come down
not looking quite pretty

482
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:17,434
This is a tip that might be useful
when you take the lift someday

483
02:16:17,434 --> 02:16:20,801
We gave shout-outs to

484
02:16:20,801 --> 02:16:23,767
many people earlier

485
02:16:23,767 --> 02:16:28,100
but let's not forget the amazing dancers
who performed so hard

486
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:29,501
- Right
- Please come to the stage

487
02:16:29,501 --> 02:16:31,868
with us, please come to the stage

488
02:16:33,667 --> 02:16:35,467
You guys are awesome

489
02:16:35,467 --> 02:16:38,334
Our fantastic dancers

490
02:16:39,033 --> 02:16:41,734
Why don't we bow
and take a picture together?

491
02:16:42,234 --> 02:16:43,400
Sounds good

492
02:16:43,534 --> 02:16:45,133
Three, two, one

493
02:16:45,133 --> 02:16:47,434
Thank you

494
02:16:48,634 --> 02:16:50,133
- Picture time
- Picture

495
02:16:51,501 --> 02:16:52,467
Come on

496
02:17:03,267 --> 02:17:04,667
I wasn't ready for this

497
02:17:04,667 --> 02:17:05,634
Shall we?

498
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:07,300
Three, two, one

499
02:17:08,968 --> 02:17:10,767
- Keep going
- Three, two, one

500
02:17:12,167 --> 02:17:13,567
Three, two, one

501
02:17:14,934 --> 02:17:16,300
Three, two, one

502
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:20,534
Thank you

503
02:17:20,534 --> 02:17:22,968
Thank you
See you later

504
02:17:23,501 --> 02:17:25,400
Let's take one with the four of us

505
02:17:25,701 --> 02:17:27,000
Let's go

506
02:17:27,567 --> 02:17:28,701
What pose?

507
02:17:28,701 --> 02:17:30,701
Pose?

508
02:17:30,701 --> 02:17:33,434
- Make a heart with the person next to you
- How's this?

509
02:17:34,033 --> 02:17:35,801
Guys, fighting

510
02:17:35,801 --> 02:17:37,000
Fighting, okay?

511
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,801
Put your light sticks up

512
02:17:38,801 --> 02:17:40,367
Three, two, one

513
02:17:40,367 --> 02:17:41,367
Fighting

514
02:17:42,033 --> 02:17:43,234
Three, two, one

515
02:17:44,601 --> 02:17:45,734
Three, two, one

516
02:17:46,501 --> 02:17:49,667
Make a heart
with the person next to you

517
02:17:50,234 --> 02:17:52,067
Even if you don't know that person

518
02:17:52,067 --> 02:17:54,834
If you feel awkward
make one yourself

519
02:17:54,834 --> 02:17:55,667
Okay

520
02:17:55,667 --> 02:17:57,734
No, please do it
with the person next to you

521
02:17:58,100 --> 02:17:59,200
Okay, great

522
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:00,801
Awesome

523
02:18:00,801 --> 02:18:02,567
Three, two, one

524
02:18:04,634 --> 02:18:06,234
Still taking it

525
02:18:11,167 --> 02:18:12,767
Okay

526
02:18:14,767 --> 02:18:16,100
That was nice

527
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:17,534
I loved it

528
02:18:17,534 --> 02:18:21,234
Now's the time for us
to go here and there

529
02:18:21,234 --> 02:18:23,667
and say thank you

530
02:18:23,667 --> 02:18:25,033
- From here
- Yeah

531
02:18:26,567 --> 02:18:27,701
Come on

532
02:18:27,701 --> 02:18:28,701
Come here

533
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,801
Hello

534
02:18:31,167 --> 02:18:32,667
Three, two, one

535
02:18:32,667 --> 02:18:36,501
Thank you

536
02:18:36,501 --> 02:18:37,601
Thank you for today

537
02:18:37,601 --> 02:18:39,567
Thank you

538
02:18:40,334 --> 02:18:41,100
Over there

539
02:18:41,801 --> 02:18:42,701
Bye-bye

540
02:18:42,701 --> 02:18:43,901
Thank you

541
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:51,567
It's far

542
02:18:52,601 --> 02:18:53,701
Come closer

543
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:56,667
Three, two, one

544
02:18:56,667 --> 02:18:59,100
Thank you

545
02:18:59,734 --> 02:19:01,033
Thank you

546
02:19:02,968 --> 02:19:05,801
- I told you not to throw this at us
- It's dangerous

547
02:19:06,234 --> 02:19:07,300
Thank you

548
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:08,501
You deserve a warning

549
02:19:08,501 --> 02:19:10,400
Thank you, guys

550
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:11,834
- Let's leave it here
- Hi

551
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:14,167
- Thank you
- Wait

552
02:19:14,167 --> 02:19:15,334
Next

553
02:19:17,534 --> 02:19:19,801
- To where?
- Let's go here

554
02:19:19,801 --> 02:19:21,100
- and here
- Then to the center

555
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:22,934
Here and there

556
02:19:22,934 --> 02:19:23,934
What?

557
02:19:25,801 --> 02:19:27,434
