1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,213
You came all this way because you cut your finger?

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,633
The bandage you bought last time

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm calling because I can't remember where it is

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,226
Weren't you with Minji?

5
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,145
That's right

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,522
Go quickly

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,482
I'll wait

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,116
Be careful not to touch it

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,244
What?

10
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,081
Water

11
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,756
Daeyoung

12
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,263
I don't know how you're feeling right now, but

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,185
Don't hurt Minji

14
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,405
That's the same as hurting our friendship

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,908
Our friendship?

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,787
You, me, Minji...

17
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,581
We can't live without seeing each other for life

18
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,169
That's always your problem

19
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,588
What?

20
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,052
You say "we" as if you're talking about all of us

21
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,179
But actually, you're worried

22
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,305
About getting hurt yourself

23
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,727
It seems like you're thinking about everyone

24
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,437
But I know you're actually worried

25
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,688
About your own heart getting hurt

26
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,231
But Jungha

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,445
In this world, there's nothing you can get

28
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,030
Without getting hurt

29
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,659
Someday you'll understand

30
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,554
What's the occasion? You said you wanted to meet

31
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,850
I have something to talk to you about

32
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,478
What is it?

33
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,815
Do you want me to set you up with a girl?

34
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,650
Huh?

35
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:32,903
Ah, why...

36
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,071
You said a while ago

37
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,281
That my friend Hyemi was pretty

38
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,241
She recently broke up with her boyfriend

39
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,035
Want me to introduce you?

40
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,162
She's really great personality-wise too

41
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,791
So suddenly?

42
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,089
Since I'm dating Daeyoung

43
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,549
I thought if you had a girlfriend too

44
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,343
We could double date and it would be nice

45
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,054
I don't want you to feel left out

46
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,307
Because I'm dating Daeyoung

47
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,687
No, it's okay

48
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,566
I have a competition to prepare for anyway

49
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,610
So I don't have time for dating

50
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,779
Oh... really?

51
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,532
Thanks for thinking of me

52
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,699
But I'm really okay

53
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,703
Okay, I understand

54
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,922
Is something wrong?

55
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,299
Huh?

56
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,096
No

57
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,641
I knew what I was getting into

58
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,976
Huh?

59
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,813
Daeyoung...

60
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,026
It might take a bit more time

61
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,287
He's always been

62
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,664
A bit awkward with women

63
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,416
And we've been

64
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,376
Friends for quite a long time

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,961
Daeyoung

66
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,884
While kissing me

67
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,013
Thought of someone else

68
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,360
It's okay...

69
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,031
Like you said, we've been friends for a long time

70
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,158
So I think it's natural

71
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,076
It was my greed too

72
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,662
But still...

73
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,415
I'm going to try

74
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,461
I'll try not to break our relationship

75
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,923
As much as I've been greedy

76
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,178
The three of us

77
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,847
I'll make sure to keep us all together

78
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,448
Jung Daeyoung...

79
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,616
You

80
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,037
I have something to tell you

81
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,080
That's good timing

82
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,790
I was about to call you anyway

83
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,042
Huh?

84
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:35,710
Come in first

85
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,558
What, what are you doing?

86
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,229
I really needed you right now

87
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,445
I tried to solve it on my own

88
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,739
But I just couldn't

89
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,577
What... what is it?

90
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,498
Other than you...

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,459
I couldn't think of any other way

92
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,670
Why... why are you like this?

93
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,854
(Pain relief patch)

94
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,862
If you need to put on a patch

95
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,530
You should say you need to put on a patch

96
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,950
Why are you taking off your shirt like that

97
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,371
Does it hurt a lot?

98
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,960
If you're seeing double

99
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,671
Is it a concussion?

100
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,256
Huh?

101
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,842
How many of me do you see?

102
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,136
How many of these?

103
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,221
This? This?

104
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,016
How many of these?

105
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,146
What's this, are you really okay?

106
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,439
I'm fine

107
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,403
But what did you want to say?

108
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,823
What important thing did you have to say

109
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,533
That you came with such fire in your eyes?

110
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,701
You could have said it over the phone

111
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,870
Ah...

112
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,581
Never mind, next time

113
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,709
I'll take a break today

114
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,003
Ah, you're doing it again

115
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,131
Thinking, acting, and deciding all on your own

116
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,717
Ah, just tell me what it is

117
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,469
I can't sleep because I'm curious

118
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,474
It's nothing

119
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,603
Do you want to stay over?

120
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,271
Huh?

121
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,150
I said, do you want to stay over

122
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,403
You used to stay over sometimes in the past

123
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,864
How can you say that

124
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,533
In this situation?

125
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,535
What situation?

126
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,834
Well, whatever

127
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,544
I don't really know

128
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,170
How you're feeling right now

129
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,633
Anyway, you confessed

130
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,801
That you liked me before

131
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,468
But a few days later

132
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,719
You said you were dating Minji

133
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,012
And now you're telling me

134
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,639
To stay over?

135
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,558
Didn't you say there's no problem between us?

136
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,518
What does it matter?

137
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,231
Do you even like Minji?

138
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,491
Don't tell me you're dating her without even liking her?

139
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,244
Were you that much of a trash?

140
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,127
Whether I like Minji or not

141
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,712
Is that what you came to ask?

142
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,338
Huh?

143
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,883
Whether I like you now

144
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,468
Or whether I like Minji

145
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,554
Is that what you came to ask?

146
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,767
Answer me

147
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,437
Then I'll answer too

148
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,316
No, I...

149
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,650
I just don't want any of us three

150
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,485
To get hurt

151
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,527
That's all

152
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,280
That's not an answer

153
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,664
If you don't answer...

154
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,960
I'm going to kiss you

155
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:51,799
No, right now that...

156
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,349
(Minji)
