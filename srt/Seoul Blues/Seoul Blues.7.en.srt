1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,755
Jung-ha, wait a moment

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,633
Please listen to me

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,593
I have nothing to say to you

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,595
I'll explain everything

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,307
Go ahead

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,314
Say something, anything!

7
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,153
It's someone I met two years ago

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,655
Shin Do-jin

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,161
At that time, he disappeared without a word,

10
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,789
and I thought I had just been abandoned

11
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,459
So it took me a while to forget

12
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,835
and I resented him a lot

13
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:44,962
Ah...

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,464
Didn't you miss him?

15
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,008
No, it's not like that...

16
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,884
I just...

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:51,718
Hey!

18
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,682
Speak clearly

19
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,142
I just caught you kissing your ex-boyfriend

20
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,061
as soon as you saw him

21
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,398
Why?

22
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,692
Are you feeling confused because

23
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,859
the person who abandoned you came back?

24
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,695
Am I just a substitute

25
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,904
because you feel empty?

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,991
Don't talk like that

27
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,373
You know it's not like that

28
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,582
Really?

29
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,628
I don't know what kind of person you are anymore

30
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,179
You told me...

31
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,056
that you'd be fine less than a week ago

32
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,266
Did you know that?

33
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,313
I'm sorry

34
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,279
Don't contact me again

35
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,995
We won't see each other again

36
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,161
(Director Shin Do-jin - I want to have a meeting about the publishing contract, could you come to the office?)

37
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,643
Is Jung-ha very angry?

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,978
You call that talking?

39
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,314
Ah...

40
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,274
Yeah?

41
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,862
What do you mean?

42
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,782
My lunch break is about to end, I have to go back

43
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,494
I'm curious about something

44
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,121
What?

45
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,498
You and Jung-ha...

46
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,376
Is it over or what happened?

47
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,049
I'm going to sign a publishing contract with Jung-ha

48
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,175
But...

49
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,177
If you're in the middle,

50
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,720
I feel a bit uncomfortable

51
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,935
Publishing Jung-ha's writing as a book

52
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,062
is good for all of us

53
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,482
I don't want to ruin the work

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,152
because of personal feelings

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,159
Really, you too...

56
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,745
You're incredible

57
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,297
I want to ask one thing too

58
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,596
Why did you do that to me?

59
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,390
Why did you disappear at your whim,

60
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,184
without any contact,

61
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,188
and then appear again when you want?

62
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,319
Why do you do that?

63
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,740
I wanted to check

64
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,703
What kind of person...

65
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,458
I was to you

66
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:53,793
What?

67
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,591
You know, right?

68
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,635
That I only care about myself

69
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,814
Thanks

70
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,110
For making me completely lose my affection

71
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,447
to the point of forgetting

72
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,325
even the small memories that remained

73
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,135
Honestly, seeing that you were doing well...

74
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,847
I was glad

75
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,479
Although you're someone who hurt me,

76
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,983
I wondered if I could nicely package

77
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,277
our memories

78
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,741
But you're right

79
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,831
Memories are useless

80
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,258
Keep living well like now

81
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,719
Selfishly

82
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,445
(A few years ago)

83
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,740
What are you doing? Not eating?

84
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,742
What is this?

85
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,785
Instant ramen for our first anniversary?

86
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,537
Oh, what does it matter?

87
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,417
Is the first anniversary such a big deal?

88
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,545
For me, every day with you

89
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,755
is an anniversary

90
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,424
It annoys me

91
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,175
What?

92
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,886
That I make you feel...

93
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:08,887
insignificant

94
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,515
Ah, please don't say that

95
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,351
I'm telling you I'm really fine

96
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,189
You said you liked sushi, right?

97
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,065
Sushi?

98
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,108
Yes, I like it

99
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,902
I'll go out and buy some sushi

100
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:24,903
Ah! Honey

101
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,654
It's okay

102
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,781
I prefer this,

103
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,408
being with you now, than sushi

104
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm sorry

105
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,747
Are you doing that again?

106
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,666
I...

107
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,293
I'll really be successful

108
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,754
I'll succeed and give you everything

109
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,840
Sushi and luxury hotels...

110
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,716
No!

111
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,385
Even trips abroad!

112
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,096
Does it sound good just hearing about it?

113
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,724
Don't abandon me because I'm troublesome

114
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,476
Huh?

115
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,853
Why would I abandon you?

116
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,901
Because you're a person with big dreams

117
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,282
Someday you might feel my dreams are insignificant

118
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,202
and abandon me, right?

119
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,205
Sometimes I think that when I'm alone

120
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,677
How can you have such bad thoughts

121
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,638
with such a handsome face?

122
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,432
Huh?

123
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,437
Don't worry

124
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,521
I

125
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,481
Will never abandon you
