00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:11,553
Hi

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,180
Hi

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,522
Did you wait long?

4
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,984
No, about 20 minutes?

5
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:26,526
Hey

6
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,277
I'm really sorry

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,321
I could have actually arrived first

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,697
But this guy insisted

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,033
on me giving him a ride, so

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,159
I had to wait too

11
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:36,662
Hey..

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,413
From your house anyway

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,331
you pass by my place on the way

14
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,832
It makes sense to give me a ride too, right?

15
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,542
Don't you think?

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,711
Yeah, you did well

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,421
Me waiting for you guys

18
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,589
It's not like it's the first time

19
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,215
Hey

20
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,424
That's why I told you to prepare

21
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,550
in advance, didn't I?

22
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,013
Now that I see him, he's bragging

23
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:55,931
about getting a job on his own

24
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,892
You're right..

25
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,144
If you're upset, get a job yourself

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,479
What?

27
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,192
I'm really feeling to the bone

28
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,860
how boring life is

29
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,906
Come to think of it, even back in school

30
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,574
because of him, the days I wasn't late

31
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,660
were far fewer

32
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:17,703
Remember?

33
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:18,996
People don't change

34
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,331
If people change, they die

35
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:22,749
Die

36
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,583
How sad

37
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,501
Hey, hey, don't fight

38
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,419
Cheers

39
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,922
To our friendship

40
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,090
What's this?

41
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:31,967
What, what is it?

42
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,760
It's too old-fashioned

43
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,302
Huh?

44
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,555
You've already become an old man

45
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,764
You've become a total ajussi

46
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,392
I can't believe this

47
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,894
Want me to show you what a real ajussi is like?

48
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,479
Don't do it

49
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,440
Soda!

50
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,441
Soda?

51
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,191
What's that?

52
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,486
Filling this glass with love

53
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,280
All together, bottoms up

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,823
Ah! Please..

55
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,701
Or else, or else..

56
00:01:59,036 --> 00:01:59,536
Blue jeans!

57
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,289
Youth is

58
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,958
Right now!

59
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,588
Huh? Oh wow..

60
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,591
Smells like an old man

61
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,801
Ah..

62
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,393
Do I smell?

63
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,228
No, you don't

64
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:25,979
You do

65
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,734
Let's see how young you smell

66
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,985
Smell me, smell me

67
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,828
Wow..

68
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,163
Hey..

69
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,331
What perfume is this?

70
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,250
Ah, the one you gave me last year

71
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,128
Wow..

72
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,005
Was this scent this good?

73
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,302
As I thought, you just picked it randomly

74
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,347
As expected, even if I pick randomly

75
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,890
I have good taste, right?

76
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,268
Hey, let's smell it again

77
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,478
Hey, smell it, smell it

78
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,647
It's really good

79
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,901
But..

80
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,530
Why don't you guys date?

81
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,242
Even in high school

82
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,493
you received so many confessions from girls

83
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,787
Why did you never date anyone?

84
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,373
Jeong-ha dated someone

85
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,499
Oh really?

86
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,377
Ah, with that obsessed noona, right?

87
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,503
No, it's not

88
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,129
No?

89
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,839
There's someone else

90
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,589
You don't know

91
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,133
Someone else?

92
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,717
She was really pretty

93
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,012
Really? Wow..

94
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,347
Did you date?

95
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,140
For how long?

96
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,142
Well, we didn't exactly date..

97
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,476
We met for about two weeks?

98
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,561
Two weeks?

99
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,854
Why did you break up?

100
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,273
Why do you think we broke up?

101
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,732
Because this guy acted so timidly

102
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,276
that she got bored and they broke up

103
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,237
I bet he hasn't even kissed

104
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,992
You.. Have you done it?

105
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,536
Are you kidding?

106
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,871
How old do you think we are?

107
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,040
What about you? Have you done it too?

108
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,458
Me?

109
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,169
Well, I..

110
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,087
Hey, we're twenty-six now..

111
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,047
Not having kissed at this age

112
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,841
Jeong-ha, isn't that too much?

113
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,176
Right

114
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,096
So, do you really use your tongue like this?

115
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,514
Like this, like this?

116
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,808
Ah, really.. Stop it

117
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,226
I'll teach you, you know?

118
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,060
How?

119
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,271
Hyung, can you teach me once?

120
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,022
Huh?

121
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:32,647
Come here

122
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,567
Ah, get away! Why are you acting so gross?

123
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,776
Stay still

124
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,829
First, you bring your face close like this

125
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,041
Then tilt your head slightly

126
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,053
Hey, this guy really has a hard head

127
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,555
Ah, seriously, the jokes..

128
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,098
I'm going to the bathroom

129
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,142
I think I'm bleeding

130
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,228
It hurts so much..

131
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,840
Have you really never kissed?

132
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,177
Are you making fun of me?

133
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,262
I'm telling you I haven't

134
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,518
You really don't remember

135
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,687
What?

136
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,651
Last year, after the alumni reunion

137
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,695
Don't you remember?

138
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,405
Kiss me

139
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,117
What?

140
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,204
I'm asking you to kiss me

141
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:14,100
Why are you telling me this now?

142
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,855
Well..

143
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,568
Since you didn't remember

144
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,531
I was going to let it go too

145
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,663
Then let's just forget about it

146
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,375
Why are you mentioning it now?

147
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,714
But I couldn't

148
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,136
So I decided to confess

149
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:52,764
Huh?

150
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,393
That I like you

151
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,022
Are you serious?

152
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,610
Yes, I'm serious

153
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,577
I thought about it for a long time before saying it

154
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,545
I thought you had noticed to some extent

155
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,382
So I..

156
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,097
You know, the three of us

157
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,605
I want to see us for a long time

158
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,860
So now..

159
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,613
Dating, breaking up, and then becoming awkward

160
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,783
I don't want to do that

161
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,248
Is that your answer?

162
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,543
Yes

163
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,232
Dae-young

164
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,031
Are we..

165
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,241
okay?

166
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,954
Yeah..

167
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,942
Why did you come out?

168
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,318
Are you leaving already?

169
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,781
Dae-young

170
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,408
Yeah?

171
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,038
Do you want to date?

172
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,334
I

173
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,255
I like you
