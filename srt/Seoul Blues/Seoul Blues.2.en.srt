1
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,844
So I decided to confess

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:12,930
That I like you

3
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:34,660
What?

4
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,042
I'll go order some coffee

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,043
You explain it well

6
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:43,752
Okay

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,510
Were you surprised?

8
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,641
What's going on?

9
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,685
Did you two lose a bet or something?

10
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,316
Or is this some kind of hidden camera prank?

11
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,611
It's nothing like that

12
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,072
We...

13
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,449
Decided to date

14
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,451
Huh?

15
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,290
I confessed

16
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,459
And that's how it happened

17
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,048
Oh...

18
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:33,760
Coffee

19
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:34,636
Thanks

20
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,645
Jeong-ha seems completely shocked

21
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,858
Seems so

22
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,032
So what about you two?

23
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,867
How, I mean...

24
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,786
In the future, what kind of...?

25
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,748
Dae-young, this one's worrying unnecessarily again

26
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,916
You say something

27
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,294
What's there to explain?

28
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,628
If we enjoy being friends

29
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,671
We can date too

30
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,714
Is that so?

31
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,720
Were you surprised?

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,097
Yes

33
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,851
I didn't know you two...

34
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,104
liked each other that much

35
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,276
It's disconcerting

36
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,696
I'm still a bit dazed too

37
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,032
Yeah?

38
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,827
Just a moment

39
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,832
Thanks

40
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,378
You said you were cold inside because of the air conditioning

41
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,214
Why did you come out dressed so lightly?

42
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,094
What if you catch a cold?

43
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,345
Being so sensitive to cold

44
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,554
I'm fine

45
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,099
It's not that cold...

46
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,811
Want me to hug you?

47
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,270
Here?

48
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,188
Hey...

49
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,314
What's wrong with that?

50
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,732
We're the only ones here

51
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:11,733
Still

52
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,276
Honey, I'm worried

53
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,528
you might catch a cold

54
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,321
Honey?

55
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,201
Wait a minute!

56
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,247
Uh...

57
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:29,876
Have you two already...?

58
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,090
Ah... better not think about it

59
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,760
What are you thinking?

60
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,179
Congratulations

61
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,850
Congratulations, and now I'll go to the bathroom for a bit

62
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:46,768
Jeong-ha

63
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:50,981
Yes?

64
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,567
Our relationship...

65
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,362
It's okay, right?

66
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:02,868
Yes

67
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,578
Of course

68
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,341
Huh?

69
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,135
Excuse me, I need to make a call

70
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:20,844
Okay

71
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,062
I'm sorry

72
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,648
Huh?

73
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,235
It's just...

74
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,197
After all these years together

75
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,781
For it to suddenly be like this, as if

76
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,617
we had conspired behind your back

77
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,952
Ah...

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,829
No, it's okay

79
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,499
Actually, I kind of suspected it

80
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:53,501
What?

81
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,671
That you liked Dae-young

82
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,175
Ah...

83
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,429
I think I noticed that the way

84
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,432
you looked at Dae-young was different

85
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,020
I see

86
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,983
After knowing each other for so long

87
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,401
Everything shows

88
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,195
That's true

89
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,658
Then, do you know that too?

90
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:26,826
What?

91
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,247
That Dae-young...

92
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,375
Doesn't see me as a woman

93
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,259
But don't worry

94
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,261
We won't break up or anything

95
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,762
I'll work hard at it

96
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,265
Will you support me?

97
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,398
What are you two talking about?

98
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,357
Huh? You're back

99
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,944
Can I charge my phone at your place before I go?

100
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,237
Sure

101
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,698
What about you, Jeong-ha?

102
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,449
Yes?

103
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,035
Want to have dinner with us?

104
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,914
Uh...

105
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,874
No, I have something to do

106
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,042
I think I'll have to go

107
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,168
Something to do?

108
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,379
What do you have to do?

109
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,048
Hey

110
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,676
I'm a very busy person too

111
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,679
That's too bad

112
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,848
Let's eat together next time

113
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:32,809
Okay

114
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:33,727
Go...

115
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:35,854
Go

116
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:36,688
I'll be going

117
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,042
What are you doing?

118
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,586
I'm looking up recipes

119
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,879
Shall we make pasta?

120
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,005
Yes

121
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,298
I have ingredients at home

122
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,133
I'll make you cream pasta

123
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,343
Great

124
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,476
Jeong-ha...

125
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,439
She seemed very surprised

126
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:22,859
Yeah

127
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,323
Were you teasing Jeong-ha earlier?

128
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,284
Huh?

129
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,289
When you said you'd take care of me and hug me

130
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,506
Whatever it is, I like it

131
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,093
Being alone with you like this

132
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,220
It feels like a dream

133
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,341
Dae-young

134
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,261
Yes?

135
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,055
Actually, it's my first time

136
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,809
But...

137
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,688
I want to do it with you

138
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:06,880
Kiss me

139
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,344
What's wrong?

140
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,394
Who is it?

141
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,855
Jeong-ha

142
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,357
If you call back in a little while...

143
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,734
Hello

144
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:29,736
Yes

145
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,535
I understand, I'll go

146
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,334
I...

147
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,047
I'll go out for a moment
