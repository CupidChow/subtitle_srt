1
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,057
Oh my!

2
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:18,435
How long have you been watching me like that?

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,603
You're making a "baddeuk baddeuk" sound with your teeth.

4
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,896
Since you started grinding your teeth.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,565
Was I grinding my teeth?

6
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:24,983
Yeah.

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,903
But you were grinding them cutely.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,739
What's grinding them cutely?

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,075
Like...

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,327
"Poddeuk poddeuk"?

11
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,245
What's that?

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,040
I'm going to wash up a bit.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,666
Okay.

14
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,168
Let's make pasta later.

15
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,646
As much as I'm greedy,

16
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,481
I won't let our relationship

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,524
break apart.

18
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,401
The three of us...

19
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,237
I'll protect us all no matter what.

20
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,600
Hello?

21
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,440
Hello, Minji?

22
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,317
It's Jeongha.

23
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,236
What's wrong with you?

24
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:51,987
Did something happen?

25
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,489
Daeyoung

26
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,909
hasn't been answering my calls since yesterday.

27
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,537
No contact this morning either.

28
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,125
Maybe he's busy?

29
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,128
What should I do?

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,757
Daeyoung... I think he's going to break up with me.

31
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,137
Where are you?

32
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,265
I'm in front of Daeyoung's house right now.

33
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,308
Huh?

34
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:24,978
Why?

35
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,939
I was going to visit and ask him.

36
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,943
I think he might have been with someone else yesterday.

37
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,864
If you go there suddenly like that,

38
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,115
He might not like it.

39
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,366
Minji, calm down a bit...

40
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,836
Why are you here?

41
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,756
Huh?

42
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,218
Ah... well...

43
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,054
Were you with Daeyoung yesterday?

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,433
Ah... yeah.

45
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,064
But why didn't both of you answer my calls?

46
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,315
What were you doing?

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,778
Uh... Drinking! We were drinking!

48
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,781
But we got so drunk we slept here.

49
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:21,993
I was just about to leave.

50
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,038
But why did you pretend not to know earlier?

51
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,540
Huh?

52
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,542
On the phone earlier, you talked

53
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,086
as if you didn't know what Daeyoung did yesterday.

54
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,506
Ah...

55
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,676
Well...

56
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,762
Minji, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,600
The reason I couldn't answer your calls yesterday

58
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,686
was because I was with Jeongha.

59
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,733
Is you two meeting

60
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,902
such a big deal that you have to hide it from me?

61
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,239
Because we didn't meet just as friends.

62
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,491
Hey! Jung Daeyoung

63
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,413
I didn't want to tell you like this.

65
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,291
No...

66
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,750
What are you saying?

67
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,590
So...

68
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,844
Are you two...

69
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,513
in a relationship?

70
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,473
Yeah.

71
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,363
When... Since when?

72
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,574
Since when have you been making a fool out of me?

73
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,117
Minji, it's...

74
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,827
Hey, Park Jeongha, be quiet.

75
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:46,953
Jung Daeyoung,

76
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,497
you talk.

77
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,126
Last week when we were drinking,

78
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,296
I confessed to Jeongha.

79
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,218
Jeongha rejected me,

80
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,596
and I...

81
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,140
The day you confessed to me?

82
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,352
Yeah.

83
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,696
Was it a waste to be with me after getting rejected?

84
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,823
So you tried again?

85
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,659
This is between us two, talk to me.

86
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,495
Ah...

87
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,288
I see.

88
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,958
In your great love game,

89
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,627
I was the clueless supporting character who got in the way?

90
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,047
I'm sorry about that.

91
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,387
You two...

92
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,057
You two are really something.

93
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,772
You know what?

94
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,566
In just a few minutes,

95
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,235
The 10-plus years we've known each other

96
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,820
have turned into trash.

97
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,409
Thank you.

98
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,912
Minji.

99
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,254
Don't apologize to me.

100
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,674
I'll never forgive either of you.

101
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,241
What are you thinking about?

102
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,998
Just...

103
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,753
When we were young,

104
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,380
in front of the arcade machine at the neighborhood store,

105
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,882
playing games.

106
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,806
At that time...

107
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,852
The machine ate my 500 won,

108
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,313
and I was standing there not knowing what to do,

109
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,566
when some girl appeared

110
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,443
and offered her 500 won.

111
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,074
So I was wondering whether to take it or not,

112
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,909
and while I was pondering,

113
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,372
some big guy showed up

114
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,583
and started kicking the machine hard.

115
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,045
Saying this is how you make it work.

116
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,634
At that time, really...

117
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,470
You guys seemed crazy.

118
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,890
You remember all that?

119
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,683
Yeah.

120
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,522
That really gave me strength, you know.

121
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,776
When things feel really hopeless

122
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,694
or difficult, you know,

123
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,616
thinking about how pure we were back then,

124
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,662
nothing seems that scary anymore.

125
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,430
Do you regret it?

126
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,865
Then you'd be sad, right?

127
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,457
I shouldn't let you think at all.

128
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,542
Huh?
