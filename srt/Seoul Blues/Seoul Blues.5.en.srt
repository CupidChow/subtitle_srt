1
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,435
Are you awake?

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,395
When did you wake up?

3
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:22,856
About an hour ago?

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,484
Ah..

5
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,782
But why do you look like that?

6
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:34,993
Huh?

7
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,079
It's nothing

8
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:39,706
Hmm?

9
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,758
I don't want to go to work

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,678
Why?

11
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,099
Because I'm afraid you'll disappear while I'm at work

12
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,355
Shouldn't you wash up and get going?

13
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,898
It's already 8 o'clock

14
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,111
Let's cuddle a bit more

15
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,447
I was making a sandwich

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,367
For you to eat when you go to work

17
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,288
I'm not going anywhere

18
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,332
Hurry up, get up, wash, and get ready

19
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,168
I'll give you 10 minutes

20
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,642
(Are you working well? I came to a cafe to work too)

21
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,523
(Yeah, thanks to you haha. Don't overdo it and make sure to eat lunch properly)

22
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,774
(Yes! You too!)

23
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,569
(Love..)

24
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,703
(See you in the evening!)

25
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,486
Mr. Kim has gone out for an external meeting

26
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,362
so he'll be a bit late

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,076
I see

28
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,455
So until he arrives

29
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,373
he asked me to give a briefing

30
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,002
about this project, if that's okay?

31
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,505
Hmm..

32
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,183
It's been a while

33
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,688
Ah, don't tell me..

34
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,609
It's not that.. you don't recognize me, right?

35
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,279
I know

36
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,282
Director Shin Dojin of Dodam Publishing

37
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,618
You're famous, aren't you?

38
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:23,954
Ah..

39
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,668
I feel sad without the right to be

40
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,299
Then, should I match your expectations?

41
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,717
Well, how..

42
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,553
Are you doing well?

43
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,389
Are you still new?

44
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,433
Well, yeah..

45
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,773
Good school and good specs, so..

46
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,359
I guess you'll do well, right?

47
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,200
But it's really surprising

48
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,829
I was just curious

49
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,546
Did you come knowing I was here?

50
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,012
Would you believe me if I said no?

51
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,602
Your trust in me..

52
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,229
It's not much, is it?

53
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,649
If not, I'm glad

54
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,703
Then I'll start the briefing

55
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,625
Our project is, through a publication collaboration

56
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,628
with the publishing house you run

57
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,296
to naturally expose online

58
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,548
the product we want to market

59
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,425
and the goal is to maximize

60
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,178
the synergy between the companies

61
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,555
For that..

62
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,479
Are there no questions?

63
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,242
Do you have a partner?

64
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,786
What?

65
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,248
Partner..

66
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,333
I'm asking if you have one

67
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,341
Is that also a question related to this project?

68
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,469
Yes

69
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,179
Is there going to be a problem?

70
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,935
I have a partner

71
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,689
Ah..

72
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,023
Is that so?

73
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,777
How long has it been?

74
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,572
I don't really want to answer that

75
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,245
Ah..

76
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,980
It's strange

77
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,193
Unlike your way of speaking..

78
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,738
Your eyes are still the same

79
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,623
What are you doing now!

80
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,800
Are you crazy?

81
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,186
Your eyes are not saying the same thing now

82
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,525
What are you talking about?

83
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,870
You're feeling the same thing as me right now

84
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,464
Don't hide it
