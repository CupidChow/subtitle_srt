1
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,932
The CEO of the publishing company I work for

2
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,184
brought in a new writer

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,103
But when I saw that person's writing

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,022
it turns out the writer is homosexual

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:23,899
The problem is that

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,109
the CEO started insisting on publishing

7
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,527
that writer's nonsensical writing as a book

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,529
and as the CEO kept pushing for it

9
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,324
rumors began to spread among people

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,160
That they are definitely dating

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,454
It was so ridiculous that

12
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,373
I decided I needed to make it public

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,540
and posted about it

14
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,021
(The call cannot be received)

15
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,491
Jeong-ha

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,538
It's Dae-young

17
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,710
Why are you here like this?

18
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,794
Let's go inside first

19
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,464
I'm so, so upset...

20
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,261
I have nowhere to talk about it

21
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,055
and no friends

22
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,060
After wandering around, I found myself in front of your house

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,233
My pride is hurt

24
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,534
Did something happen?

25
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,663
What happened?

26
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,250
Dae-young, what should I do?

27
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,633
I've been outed

28
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:16,595
What?

29
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,768
An employee of CEO Shin Do-jin's publishing company posted

30
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,980
saying that I'm dating the CEO

31
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,650
and that I'm using it to try to get a publishing contract

32
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,864
I never asked for anything like that

33
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,576
but the rumor has already spread like that

34
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,330
Have you tried contacting Shin Do-jin?

35
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,249
He's not answering

36
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,507
For now, your name hasn't been mentioned

37
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,716
or anything like that, right?

38
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,719
But still...

39
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,139
Now the rumor will spread throughout the publishing industry

40
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,892
I don't know what I should do

41
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,148
It's okay

42
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,567
Don't worry too much

43
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,195
Nothing has happened yet, right?

44
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,238
Huh?

45
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,241
Dae-young

46
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,413
I'm so scared

47
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,258
Didn't you say you'd never treat me like a person again?

48
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,889
There's a rumor that you're dating Jeong-ha

49
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,974
Is it true?

50
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,476
Ah...

51
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,813
Is that why you called me?

52
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,900
But even if it were true...

53
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,069
What does it have to do with you?

54
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,323
Exactly

55
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,117
I wonder what it has to do with me

56
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,414
that I'm so concerned

57
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,470
Do you like Jeong-ha?

58
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,974
How could that be?

59
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,979
From the beginning, I only approached to meet you

60
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,815
Really?

61
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,652
Then...

62
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,989
Why did that rumor start?

63
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,741
I started it

64
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,459
After what happened...

65
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,543
Jeong-ha also seemed uncomfortable

66
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,170
and canceled the contract

67
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,132
You probably don't know this, but

68
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,677
before a publishing contract is signed

69
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,803
not everything is planned

70
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,680
just with the author's ideas

71
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,558
They took all our good ideas to the company

72
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,269
and then canceled the contract...

73
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,563
I felt indignant

74
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,986
So?

75
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,990
I just wanted to give them a bit of a hit

76
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,741
So that at any other company...

77
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,785
they couldn't even knock on the door

78
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,594
You

79
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,099
If you post this, now no other author

80
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,310
will be able to knock on your company's door, right?

81
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,649
You're not thinking of posting this, are you?

82
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,275
The moment you post this

83
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,234
you'll be outed too

84
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,277
I don't care

85
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,489
It's more important for me to protect my people

86
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,035
Unlike some

87
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,912
I

88
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,461
I made a mistake

89
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,921
I'll fix everything, so...

90
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,802
Don't post it

91
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,929
Please

92
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,437
Fix it as soon as possible

93
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,939
This is my last consideration

94
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,514
You're already off work?

95
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,891
Yeah

96
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,188
You took a half day off because you were worried about me, didn't you?

97
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,110
Yeah...

98
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,245
Sleep a bit more

99
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,292
No, I've slept a lot

100
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,004
Jeong-ha

101
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,632
It's okay now

102
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,135
You don't have to worry

103
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,805
About what?

104
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,436
I met with CEO Shin Do-jin

105
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,355
and resolved it well

106
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,986
Really?

107
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,283
You don't have to worry

108
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,417
I know that doing this doesn't erase

109
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,961
what I did wrong

110
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,797
I'm not asking you to forgive me

111
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,303
Thank you

112
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,263
For coming back to me

113
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,480
Until you need me...

114
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,733
I'll be by your side

115
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,366
You must be hungry

116
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,951
I'll go buy something to eat

117
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,334
I need you

118
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,549
What did you say?

119
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,761
I didn't hear you

120
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,767
I need you

121
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,145
You
