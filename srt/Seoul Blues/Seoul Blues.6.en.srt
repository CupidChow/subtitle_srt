1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:01,501
Yeah, where are you?

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,377
Here

3
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,475
I think it would be good to do it like this

4
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,395
Definitely, putting the incident at the front

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,272
It seems to make the characters come more alive

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,361
Since Jeong-ha's writing flow is so good

7
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,739
For now, just keep writing

8
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,700
Things like editing or adaptation

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,910
Can be done later

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:35,535
Yes

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:38,956
Ah

12
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,124
This is CEO Shin Do-jin

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,418
I remember someone in the writers' community

14
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,253
Said they had their work corrected

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,672
But it turned out

16
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,715
It was a publishing company CEO

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,010
Nice to meet you

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,682
I'm Shin Do-jin

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,434
Yes

20
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,561
I'm Jung Dae-young

21
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,608
Actually, writing one's own story

22
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,485
Isn't easy for a writer

23
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,199
After all, you have to keep digging up

24
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,118
Your own wounds

25
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,248
But Jeong-ha expresses that very well

26
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,713
So I became interested

27
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,716
And I'm helping out, though it might seem presumptuous

28
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,095
What kind of story is it?

29
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,515
You never told me about it

30
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,268
Ah

31
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:42,936
Well...

32
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,398
When it's published

33
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,692
You can read it then

34
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,989
Even between close friends

35
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,533
Showing your unpolished writing

36
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,870
Isn't easy

37
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,789
We're not friends

38
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,006
If we're not friends...

39
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,843
Then what are we?

40
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,598
We are...

41
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,182
Ack!

42
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,477
We-we think of each other like brothers

43
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,187
More than family

44
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,814
Since we've known each other since we were very young

45
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,524
Our families all know each other

46
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,526
More than friends

47
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,032
That's nice

48
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,867
Friends like brothers

49
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,410
Ah...

50
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,206
I wish I had a friend like that

51
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,349
Are you angry?

52
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,897
Dae-young

53
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,611
That CEO's publishing company

54
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,863
Says they might publish my writing as a book

55
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,701
But there's no need to create misunderstandings

56
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,370
Or ruin chances for the book

57
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,166
Don't meet with that person

58
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:30,794
Huh?

59
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,215
I'd like you not to see that person again

60
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,927
What are you saying?

61
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,722
I'm telling you they might offer a publishing contract

62
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,099
There are plenty of publishing companies

63
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,809
It doesn't have to be that one

64
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,478
Don't you understand how important

65
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,938
This is to me?

66
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,528
Or are you...

67
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,573
Are you upset because I didn't tell you

68
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,448
I was dating someone?

69
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,620
Or are you misunderstanding something?

70
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,374
I don't have any relationship with that CEO

71
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,333
It's just strictly business

72
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,752
They always approach like that

73
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,379
What do you mean?

74
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,091
Ah...

75
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,135
I mean...

76
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,055
Those kinds of people

77
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,390
Tend to approach that way

78
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,726
I've seen a lot of cases like that around me

79
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,106
That man doesn't give me a good impression either

80
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,482
It would be better to work

81
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,817
With a better company

82
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:36,985
Huh?

83
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,240
You really don't understand anything about my work

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,492
What?

85
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,497
It's the first publishing company that said my writing is good

86
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,751
Do you know how excited I was about that?

87
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,504
And for you to so easily tell me not to meet with him

88
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,592
Isn't that like belittling my work?

89
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,260
No, it's not that I'm belittling it

90
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,346
Enough! I'll handle my own affairs

91
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,933
I'm leaving

92
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,227
Jeong-ha, Jeong-ha...

93
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,766
Hello?

94
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,309
Hello?

95
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,686
Dae-young?

96
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,729
Who is this?

97
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,357
Shin Do-jin?

98
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,234
Why are you calling?

99
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,486
Jeong-ha has had a lot to drink

100
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,655
I think you should come pick 그 up

101
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,534
Oh, you're here?

102
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,453
Jeong-ha, are you okay?

103
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,500
How much alcohol did you give 그 to drink?

104
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,879
It was Jeong-ha who called me saying 그 had concerns

105
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,841
Am I the one who should be scolded?

106
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,802
Do it like this

107
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,304
Can you stand up?

108
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,180
I'm going to the bathroom...

109
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,599
Don't anyone follow me

110
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,076
Did you approach 그 on purpose?

111
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,456
I'm not...

112
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,167
I'm not that idle of a person

113
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,544
Then are you saying this is a coincidence?

114
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,882
Ah...

115
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,467
The truth is...

116
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,179
I felt you

117
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:10,972
What?

118
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,143
The story that came out in Jeong-ha's writing

119
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,437
Wasn't unfamiliar to me

120
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:20,732
It was as if...

121
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,859
Someone's behavior and way of speaking

122
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,611
Were being imitated

123
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,990
So I became interested and read the writing

124
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,577
And I met with Jeong-ha to hear the story

125
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,245
The more I listened

126
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,457
The more I was reminded of you

127
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,796
But

128
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,256
I never dreamed it would actually be you

129
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,426
If this is a coincidence...

130
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,180
Is it a terrible fate?

131
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,891
Don't talk nonsense

132
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,769
You and I ended a year ago

133
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,063
Does Jeong-ha know too?

134
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,189
What?

135
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:04,984
What happened...

136
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,445
At the company

137
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,094
Just say you wanted to see me

138
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,640
That's enough for me

139
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,812
Don't talk nonsense

140
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,730
I didn't want to see you!

141
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,315
And I don't want to run into you again!

142
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,820
And what happened that day

143
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,866
Don't give it any meaning

144
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,912
Please

145
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,957
Don't appear in front of Jeong-ha

146
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,712
Ah...

147
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,508
That might be a bit difficult

148
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:12,927
What?

149
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,140
Lately, things have been quite boring and tedious

150
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,600
But

151
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,352
Since meeting you again

152
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,106
Things have started to get very interesting

153
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,246
Meeting you...

154
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,291
Makes me feel alive

155
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,965
Do you know how long I waited back then?

156
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,426
And now you come...

157
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,140
Tell me you're sorry

158
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,142
At least apologize to me properly

159
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,519
I'm sorry

160
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,818
I'm sorry
