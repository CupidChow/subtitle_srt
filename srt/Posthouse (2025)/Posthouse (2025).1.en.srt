00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>Our guest is also the co-chair</i>
<i>of Gumamela Pictures.</i>

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,612
<i>Friends, let's give it up for</i>

3
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,952
<i>a fourth generation filmmaker</i>
<i>of the Anderson family.</i>

4
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,335
<i>I heard you are in custody</i>
<i>of a very special film.</i>

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,060
<i>That's the one they say vanished</i>
<i>after the war, right?</i>

6
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,970
<i>Of all the films to make,</i>
<i>he decided on making horror.</i>

7
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>I just need to ask.</i>

8
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:56,741
<i>Your grandfather was involved in a case</i>

9
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,244
<i>regarding Stella Estuar.</i>

10
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,084
<i>And then days after,</i>
<i>she committed suicide.</i>

11
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,525
<i>You really are an Anderson!</i>

12
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,911
<i>- It's great-great-granddaughter.</i>
<i>- The H.N. Anderson, right?</i>

13
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,374
<i>Your dad is also</i>
<i>a production designer, right?</i>

14
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,501
<i>Yeah.</i>

15
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,127
<i>Cyril Anderson?</i>

16
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,758
<i>He's focusing on doing commercials,</i>

17
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,510
<i>and not much on film work.</i>

18
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,136
<i>Can we do this</i>
<i>some other time?</i>

19
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,304
<i>I need to finish this.</i>

20
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,388
<i>Right. Sorry, sorry.</i>

21
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,598
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Sorry.</i>

22
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,229
Move it eight frames. Let's try that.

23
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,445
Just a little bit.

24
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,739
Let's just try it out.
I'm not really sure.

25
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,950
Cut! That's it.

26
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,035
That's good, Cy. Looks great!

27
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:55,373
But try adjusting a bit more, maybe…

28
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,211
Just the tail of the clip.

29
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,505
Yes, move it just a bit more.

30
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,348
Maybe we should adjust…

31
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,891
Let's adjust the vibrance.

32
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,102
Because…

33
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,854
If you look at her skin tone,

34
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,397
it needs to pop out more.

35
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,536
Looks good, right? I told you.

36
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,752
What was that?

37
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,962
What's that?

38
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,051
Hold on, sir.

39
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,595
This really happens.

40
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,264
Cy, please clean it up.

41
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,390
Yes, sir.

42
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,273
What happened, Cy?

43
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,610
Sorry, sir.

44
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,278
Did you clean up the timeline?

45
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,114
Which one?

46
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,210
Project Silky, please fix it.

47
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,630
Sir Bobby was very stressed earlier.

48
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,303
I mean, the Holy Week is approaching.

49
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,180
If you don't get it
done before then,

50
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,225
you'd have to come in during the break.
Are you all right?

51
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,101
Yeah.

52
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,854
- Yeah.
- We'll meet the deadline?

53
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,939
Of course.

54
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,774
Jeff just messed up earlier.

55
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,859
Don't blame the kid.

56
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,945
Aren't you his supervisor?

57
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,947
Aren't you keeping an eye on him?

58
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,993
He lacks experience.

59
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,745
What is he even doing here?

60
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,707
Which big shot uncle pulled strings
for you to hire him?

61
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,128
Don't get me started on nepotism, Cy.
We all know you're only here because…

62
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,591
Just let him do this project.

63
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,802
You keep on requesting
for an assistant,

64
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,887
but you won't give him a chance.

65
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,389
Why not get Rea again?

66
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,807
I'll give him this project.

67
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,767
If Jeff screws up again,

68
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,811
I'll find a replacement myself.

69
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,772
Fine, sounds good to me.

70
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,359
Project Silky, tomorrow. Okay?

71
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,236
I won't ask Sir Bobby
to review here.

72
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,071
Do remote viewing instead.

73
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,019
<i>There. And line!</i>

74
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,483
<i>Here.</i>

75
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,526
<i>It's so hot here.</i>

76
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,487
<i>- Blowers, please.</i>
<i>- Okay, coming.</i>

77
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,865
<i>Let's retouch our talent</i>
<i>while we're doing playback.</i>

78
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,265
<i>And three, two, one…</i>

79
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,809
<i>Action! Eyes on the camera.</i>

80
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,019
<i>There…</i>

81
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,263
Boo!

82
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,562
Why are you sleeping, Cyril?

83
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,356
You have so much work to do.

84
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,399
I'm not sleeping, boss.

85
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,277
I'm pressing buttons, see?

86
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,446
It's important for the company.

87
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,241
Can't I visit?

88
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,993
Seriously, what are you doing here?

89
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,580
Nothing. I just wanted
to check on you.

90
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,624
We thought you'd take a leave.

91
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,673
I'm sure Ma'am Jen
will understand. I mean…

92
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,593
Grandpa just died, right?

93
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,601
I need more internship hours.

94
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,269
That's why I'm here.

95
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,230
I think they require more of me

96
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,649
because they know I'm an Anderson.

97
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,733
There.

98
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,361
Split the workload with Jeff.

99
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,655
Really?

100
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,915
Thank you, Dad, you
really are a lifesaver.

101
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:55,014
Those are boxes from Grandpa Edd.

102
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,100
That has your name on it.
Mom almost threw it out.

103
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,269
Good thing I was able to bring those here.

104
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,907
Isn't that…

105
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,535
35mm?

106
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,538
Hold on.

107
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,415
Is that…

108
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,169
the film Grandpa was trying
to restore before he died?

109
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,675
But it has your name on it.
"For Cyril," it says.

110
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,728
Isn't that the first horror film
in the Philippines?

111
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,065
- Don't you want to see it?
- He never finished assembling it.

112
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,817
I'm not even sure if he finished
restoring it.

113
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,363
Let's finish the commercial.

114
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,325
- I can upload this to my channel.
- Rea.

115
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,040
If you don't want it, I'll take it.

116
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,577
<i>Are you on your way home?</i>

117
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,914
Not yet, I'll probably stay the night
here at the post house.

118
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,250
I'll just help Dad out.

119
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,793
<i>How are things over there?</i>

120
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,462
<i>How's your dad doing with</i>
<i>everything that happened?</i>

121
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,556
<i>Did you notice if he's drinking?</i>

122
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,476
Ma, he's sober.

123
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,436
It's been ages.

124
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,856
He's just focused on work.

125
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:15,863
<i>But it would be nice if he could</i>
<i>chip in for your tuition again.</i>

126
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>He keeps telling me</i>
<i>he has no projects lately.</i>

127
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,785
Come on, Ma, you
know how post life is.

128
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,537
He just doesn't get paid on time.

129
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,498
<i>And yet, you still want to pursue film.</i>

130
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,001
<i>I'm telling you, Rea.</i>

131
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,377
<i>You have to reconsider.</i>

132
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,130
Ma, we've talked about this.
Why bring it up now?

133
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,298
Seriously?

134
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,517
<i>I just feel like I neglect you sometimes.</i>

135
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,979
<i>And I appreciate that you get</i>
<i>to bond with your dad, but…</i>

136
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,241
I'm just keeping him company.

137
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,704
<i>But please take care</i>
<i>of yourself, okay?</i>

138
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,164
<i>And keep an eye on your dad.</i>

139
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,306
Why are you still here, Rod?
It's almost Holy Week.

140
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,975
It's because of your dad, ma'am.

141
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,060
Looks like he'll be here until morning.

142
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,562
Ma'am Jen left him a ton of work.
Poor thing.

143
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,106
That's why I'm here to help.

144
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,315
Okay, ma'am.

145
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,570
Ma'am!

146
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,780
You forgot to log in!

147
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,237
Are you okay?

148
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,449
Jeff.

149
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,662
You want some?
To take the edge off.

150
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,539
Looks like you need it.

151
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,250
It's fine, I've quit
for some time now.

152
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,627
You better stop, too.

153
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,882
Really, an editor who doesn't smoke?

154
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,009
Okay.

155
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,970
You look annoyed
with your dad.

156
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,015
I just don't want drama.

157
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,644
We're good, right?

158
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,729
What?

159
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,275
It's fine, don't worry about it.

160
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,819
Dad has been saying that

161
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,905
he needs an assistant that's…

162
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,531
not his kid.

163
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,786
And they said you're doing great!

164
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,788
That you have so much potential.

165
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,498
Really?

166
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,249
Not really.

167
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,834
I'm just joking.

168
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,415
Dad?

169
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,376
We'll just get the hard drives.

170
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,014
We'll use the other room
to sync.

171
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:39,519
Rea, can you ask Rod where
he kept the keys for the studio?

172
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,771
Why?

173
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,858
I think the old moviola is in there.

174
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,070
Really?

175
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,998
You handle this.

176
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,891
We'll be working here.

177
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,111
Rea!

178
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,654
In here.

179
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,738
Yeah.

180
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,373
Are all these posters
of Grandpa's films?

181
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,125
Can I use them for my thesis?

182
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,918
- No!
- What?

183
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,670
- Why not?
- I already told you.

184
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,921
- Dad!
- No.

185
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,280
This looks like a museum!

186
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,323
Yup.

187
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,338
Dad, can I vlog this?

188
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,341
My subscribers are mostly horror fans.
They'll love this shit.

189
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,843
You want to get your hours in right?
Do that later.

190
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,927
What?

191
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,392
How did you know this was here?

192
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:34,402
Because from what I know, the studio
was upgraded to Steenbeck that time.

193
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,112
Do you know how to use this, Dad?

194
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,659
- Got it?
- Yes.

195
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,827
- All set?
- Yeah.

196
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,330
Go on.

197
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,375
Turn it. There you go.

198
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,337
Hold this so it doesn't flap around.

199
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,875
Rea, can you turn on the light?
That one.

200
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,478
Grandpa taught you?

201
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,981
Do you want me to teach you?

202
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,925
Dad, how come
after all these years,

203
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,302
that film's still not done?

204
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,308
Okay, when your grandma…

205
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,745
So your grandma, when…

206
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,291
I was very young then
so I can't totally remember,

207
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,680
I just need you to promise me
that we will finish this together.

208
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,146
For sure, Dad.

209
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,005
Dad, do you need help?

210
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,429
I just have to get something.

211
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,628
And then the tape.

212
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,020
- I'll have to--
- This one, yeah.

213
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,044
- And then?
- Then, the tape.

214
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,302
Their acting is so exaggerated!

215
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,724
Yeah.

216
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,601
Let's take a break.

217
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,772
Are you hungry? I can order food.

218
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,857
Actually, grab your phone
and take a video…

219
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,692
just pick one of
the clips, and then…

220
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,031
- Why?
- I'll send it to Uncle Ruel.

221
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,454
Why don't we just take
a video of the whole film?

222
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:45,750
- It's easier to compile on the computer.
- No, we're going to do this manually.

223
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,672
- You're making things harder for yourself.
- Rea! Just do as I say.

224
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,635
Damn it.

225
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,264
It's all about timing.

226
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,891
Do you know the Kuleshov effect?
That's all it is.

227
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,977
What's that?

228
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,525
First, a man screaming.

229
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,485
Second, a gun that went off.

230
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,862
Third, a man running.

231
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,405
What do you think happened?

232
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,658
The man was shot at
so he ran?

233
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,451
Could be.

234
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,536
But what if…

235
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,330
we put the image of the gun first.

236
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,124
Then the man running.

237
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,042
Then the man screaming.

238
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,211
It's a different story, right?

239
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,759
Okay.

240
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,219
That's smart.

241
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,389
Mind you, this isn't
even my best film yet.

242
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,225
But seriously.

243
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,812
It seems like film making
comes naturally to you.

244
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,441
Not really.

245
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,236
It's like I'm left with no choice.

246
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,530
For one, my dad is an editor.

247
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,948
My grandfather is, too.

248
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,452
At least you know
what you want to do.

249
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,704
I mean, I am not even sure…

250
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,915
if I really want this.

251
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,417
Much like my dad.

252
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,419
He's also not sure.

253
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,007
Because of your grandfather?

254
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,052
He wanted to outdo my
grandfather for so long.

255
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,346
So when Grandpa passed away,

256
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,394
He can't outrun his fears anymore.

257
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,230
He has no choice.

258
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,566
And it robbed him of confidence.

259
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,446
how can he be proud of others?

260
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,742
He might not say it but…

261
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,827
I know he's proud of you.

262
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,665
I hope so.

263
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:07,952
Rea…

264
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,951
You've gone viral again.

265
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,747
How are you guys
doing downstairs?

266
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,458
Will your dad be able to
work on the commercial already?

267
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,252
We have a deadline.

268
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,839
I'll remind him later.

269
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,515
Dad?

270
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,320
Are you done? I need you.

271
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,031
Yeah.

272
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,492
I'll go ahead.

273
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,290
Are you done syncing the files?

274
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,210
Almost done, chief.

275
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,477
Did we unbox everything?

276
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,439
It's incomplete.

277
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,316
- Incomplete?
- It's missing.

278
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,907
Wasn't Grandpa also
looking for a missing clip?

279
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,076
I thought he was able to find it but…

280
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,887
There's another one there. Just…

281
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,232
Rea.

282
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,527
What's taking you so long?
I've been waiting.

283
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,195
Dad.

284
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,866
Isn't that the same
creature in the silent film?

285
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,871
What is that doing here?

286
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,581
That film has
been around for ages.

287
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,834
Shouldn't that be destroyed by now?

288
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,342
What's it doing here though?
I've never seen this before.

289
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,387
Who put that here?

290
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,230
Is that it?

291
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,607
Okay, good. Let's go.

292
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,836
Make sure that that's
the right frame.

293
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,922
Mess up once, and you ruin everything.

294
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,762
- I'll just turn this on?
- Go.

295
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,311
I know she has talked to me about it.
I really want to help.

296
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,571
- No, really--
- It's fine.

297
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,502
- What's this?
- Jeff.

298
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,046
Sir, I'm sorry.
But I'm getting worried.

299
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,091
This is not what Ms. Jen told us to do.

300
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,884
She's following up already.

301
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,011
Jeff.

302
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,929
Jeff. It's a side project, okay?

303
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,348
If you have a problem with Jen,
I'll talk to her.

304
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,475
I can ask for an extension
on the deadline.

305
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,811
Right? No problem.
If you're not going to help,

306
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:18,812
- just leave.
- Sir.

307
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,067
Okay, what? Go on, you have my attention.
What's the problem?

308
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,737
Sir, sorry but I need
to report this to Ms. Jen.

309
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,364
Go ahead and try, you bastard!

310
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:30,866
Just try.

311
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,910
Good luck finding another job
somewhere else. Do it.

312
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,704
- Dad.
- Asshole!

313
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,081
Dad, that's enough.
He's just doing his job.

314
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,917
He's done nothing
but cause trouble.

315
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,420
We're all trying to work.

316
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,799
Okay.

317
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,937
We're so close to finishing this film.
It's so…

318
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,651
It's almost done, and with or without
that missing scene,

319
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,372
Rea.

320
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,848
This is my first time watching
a silent film like this.

321
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,226
Ready?

322
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,530
The intensity, the power?
That's the real deal!

323
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,285
We need that missing scene.

324
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,864
Uncle Ruel!

325
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,449
Have you been waiting long?

326
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,867
I'm sorry.

327
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,079
Where's the film?

328
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,085
- Follow me.
- This way, sir.

329
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,591
Here, Uncle. Come in.

330
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,760
Take a seat here.

331
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,853
Actually, to tell you the truth,
I didn't expect Dad to send me this.

332
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,235
Are you done editing it?

333
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,320
Yeah.

334
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,781
Almost, but I think…

335
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,783
It's missing something.
It's incomplete.

336
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,870
In fact, do you have any idea
where Dad hides his reels?

337
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,581
Because I'm not sure if
the box he sent was--

338
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,463
- Please! What are you--
- Stop this, Cy!

339
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,256
Just…What are you doing?

340
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,106
that night I tried to stop him.

341
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,317
Dad!

342
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,835
You need to burn it.

343
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,754
Where's the studio?

344
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:29,886
Uncle…

345
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,471
Stay here.

346
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,431
- Dad…
- I said stay here!

347
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,399
The Manananggal costume,
have you seen it?

348
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:44,711
Where did it go?

349
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,715
So?

350
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,092
- Have you found it?
- I swear it was right here.

351
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,644
Uncle?

352
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:43,853
Cy!

353
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,108
Cy?

354
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,321
It might be the breaker.
This always happens.

355
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,784
Don't worry, Uncle.

356
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,079
Cy?

357
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:09,963
Cy!

358
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:20,974
Cy?

359
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,819
<i>- He ruined me…</i>
<i>- Stella?</i>

360
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,989
<i>Do you still plan to self-harm?</i>

361
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,908
<i>I curse his bloodline!</i>

362
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,786
<i>- Stella…</i>
<i>- I curse them all!</i>

363
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,040
<i>For everything</i>
<i>that he did to me!</i>

364
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,667
<i>I will hunt them down…</i>

365
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,461
<i>one by one!</i>

366
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,588
<i>Stella! Calm down.</i>

367
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,049
<i>- They cannot escape me.</i>
<i>- Stella!</i>

368
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,343
<i>Hold her down.</i>

369
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,345
<i>- You can't stop me!</i>
<i>- We need help here!</i>

370
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,512
<i>You will pay!</i>

371
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,014
Jeff.

372
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,394
Where's Cyril?

373
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,229
I'm done syncing.

374
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,525
Looks like you're not yet done
with your side project.

375
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,489
Yes, not yet.

376
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,079
I'm sorry but we really need
to finish the commercial.

377
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,288
What are you doing?

378
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,539
I'm sorry, Rea.

379
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,249
Dad will be furious!

380
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:14,045
Please tell Cy
to finish our work first.

381
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,421
Don't do this, I'll do it…

382
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,174
I'll finish the commercial.
I will make sure it's done!

383
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,092
Jeff, please!

384
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,469
Get these back once
the commercial's done. Sorry.

385
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:22,428
Jeff!

386
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,475
Oh fuck.

387
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,395
Fuck.

388
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,165
Uncle.

389
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,920
Uncle?

390
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,452
Rea!

391
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:55,873
Dad?

392
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,554
Where's…

393
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,264
Where's Ruel?

394
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,706
The one there.

395
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:39,625
Dad, Jeff took them.

396
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,253
He said we should finish
the commercial first and then

397
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,964
he'll give back the reels
once we're done with editing.

398
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:55,766
We're almost done, Rea!
Why would you do that?

399
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,106
he took them. I'm sorry.
I tried everything!

400
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:05,776
Fuck!

401
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,362
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

402
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,497
I got this. I'll handle it. Just…

403
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,594
<i>Rea?</i>

404
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:00,975
Ma?

405
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,686
<i>Rea, what happened?</i>

406
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,271
<i>Are you all right?</i>

407
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,065
Ma, it's…it's Dad.

408
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,234
<i>Why?</i>

409
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:11,610
<i>Did he hurt you?</i>

410
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,863
<i>I knew it.</i>

411
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:16,115
<i>I told you not to go there anymore.</i>

412
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,783
<i>I should have brought you home.</i>

413
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:18,868
<i>Stay there.</i>

414
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,619
<i>Don't go near your dad.</i>

415
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,079
<i>I'll be there.</i>

416
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,164
<i>Rea.</i>

417
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,791
<i>Hello? Rea, can you hear me?</i>

418
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:27,877
<i>Rea!</i>

419
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,715
Cy.

420
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,721
Rod…

421
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,683
I'll go home for now. Looks like
Dad will be here until tomorrow.

422
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:45,272
Rod…

423
01:15:58,428 --> 01:15:59,680
Rea?

424
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,190
Rea?

425
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:25,497
Rea?

426
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,813
Rea?

427
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,152
Rea?

428
01:17:55,879 --> 01:18:00,342
Ma!

429
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:15,440
I'm here. It's okay. I got you.

430
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,401
It's okay, baby. I know.

431
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,152
I know.

432
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,153
Dad?

433
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,238
It's me.

434
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,656
Dad, Ma's dead.

435
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:23,699
Dad!

436
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,800
Our editor's awake now.

437
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,451
My God, it's so beautiful.

438
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:10,996
The very first Filipino horror film…

439
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:31,349
Rea?

440
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:39,107
What else can we do
to make this film better?

441
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,657
Dad…

442
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,077
Dad, I don't know.

443
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:54,748
Dad, I don't know.

444
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:57,459
- You don't know.
- I don't know anymore.

445
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:00,212
Screw that answer!

446
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:04,299
We spend thousands each year
for that school tuition,

447
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,885
and that's all you have to say?

448
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:40,502
Whatever you need,
I hand it to you.

449
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,587
When you have a problem,
I fix it for you.

450
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,173
Even your internship hours

451
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,758
become my concern.

452
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:29,634
Rea?

453
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:58,955
So. This is what we call
the Kuleshov effect.

454
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,874
You should know this by now, right?

455
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,044
What's the correct order for this?

456
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,971
Tell me what else we need to do

457
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:22,354
What should go first,

458
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:25,482
the kid, the tragedy,
or the monster?

459
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:27,525
The kid, the tragedy, the monster!

460
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,779
Enough!

461
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:34,699
Stop!

462
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:48,129
Enough.

463
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:07,962
Dad, can I vlog this?

464
01:31:08,045 --> 01:31:11,382
All my subscribers are horror fans,
they'll love this shit.

465
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:14,051
You wanted to work right?
Can you help me out instead?

466
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,136
Do it later.

467
01:31:17,763 --> 01:31:19,974
How did you know this was in here?

468
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:25,688
He donated this to the studio
before he left which up to now I don't…

469
01:31:29,775 --> 01:31:31,777
Something fell. That was scary.

470
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,279
I was shocked.
