12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,800
Grandfather.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,100
Your Highness.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,280
 Your Highness? 

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,620
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

16
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,910
How hard must it have been for you?

17
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,130
You came to the right place.

18
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,690
I am glad you are here.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,320
Your grandson greets you.

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Please do not.

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,780
This is my childhood friend, Gab Seok.

22
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,390
Allow me to greet you.

23
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,720
My name is Lee Gab Seok.

24
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,620
She is a physician who came with us because of my wound.

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,740
Have you been injured?

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,060
I got better thanks to this girl, so please do not worry.

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,810
What a relief.

28
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,250
Thank you for your work.

29
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,620
The day is cold. Please come inside.

30
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,380
Take her to the annex

31
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,140
and tell the butler His Highness has arrived.

32
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,860
Yes.

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,810
Please come inside.

34
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,310
 Are you asking because you really do not know? 

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,600
 The moment he runs his mouth, let alone the crown princess selection— 

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,860
 I will not try out for the crown princess selection. 

37
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,480
 - Hurry up and go to a clinic-
- I cannot go to the clinic. 

38
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,680
 That man does not even know it was you who kidnapped him. 

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,450
 So why are you doing this? 

40
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,530
 I just cannot understand why you are trying to kill that man. 

41
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,590
 I never asked for your understanding. 

42
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,860
 So, the lady you serve is ... 

43
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,770
 Does this mean you were a servant of the royal physician's household? 

44
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,530
 Answer me. 

45
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,390
 Are you truly the Royal Physician's servant? 

46
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,500
 So, that is what happened. 

47
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,340
I knew there had to be a reason.

48
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,700
But it was the traitors slandering Your Highness.

49
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,630
I apologize for putting you and Uncle in danger as well.

50
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,320
How could you say that?

51
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,920
Please do not ever say that again.

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,550
Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,780
Father and I will make sure you are safe, no matter what happens.

54
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,830
No.

55
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,970
It is true I need Grandather's help, but I do not plan on staying long.

56
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,290
I am sure Mungyeong also received a messenger by now.

57
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,650
If they find out I am here, they will come arrest me right away.

58
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,370
Do not worry about the governor of Mungyeong.

59
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,390
I will take care of things.

60
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,600
 Traitor Yi Geon, you are under arrest! 

61
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,500
 We know Traitor Yi Geon is hiding here! 

62
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,660
If you do not hand over Yi Geon right now,

63
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,990
everyone who lives in this house will be considered a traitor!

64
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,060
What is there to wait for?

65
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,900
Let us storm in now.

66
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,850
Must we shed blood?

67
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,310
We have surrounded him, so he will come out eventually.

68
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,750
If he still does not come out,

69
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,760
we can do as you wish, Chief Guard.

70
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,330
Traitor Yi Geon, you are under arrest!

71
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,150
Watch your mouth!

72
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,350
Whom are you calling a traitor?

73
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,410
Your Excellency!

74
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,160
This is Her Highness Queen Dowager's letter.

75
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,930
There is no need to read that.

76
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,010
Please hand it to me.

77
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,880
How dare you? You dare toss a letter containing the royal decree—

78
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,130
This letter is a fake!

79
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,120
- Gab Seok!
 - Yes, Your Highness!

80
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,470
Do you know what this is?

81
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,770
This is the royal seal His Majesty the King ordered me to take care of!

82
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,890
His Majesty's will lies in my hand.

83
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,300
Who dares to impersonate His Majesty?

84
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,370
Arrest those traitors who dared to fabricate the royal seal

85
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,070
and write a fake royal decree!

86
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,280
Yes, Your Excellency!

87
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,550
Arrest those traitors right now!

88
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,540
 Yes, sir! 

89
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,760
Her Highness the queen sends you this.

90
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,080
She said they were jewelry and clothing.

91
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,560
Your Highness, I think you have to look at this.

92
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,610
Is it not the royal seal?

93
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,060
I am ...

94
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,730
a bad son who causes her to worry till the end.

95
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,510
I am sure my Royal Mother will be put through

96
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,470
great troubles because of this royal seal.

97
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,380
How will I ever

98
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,600
repay her for this?

99
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,200
His Majesty must have known a situation like this would arise.

100
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,420
Yes.

101
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,090
He predicted I would be put in this situation

102
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,730
and gave me a way to survive.

103
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,860
I can only be thankful for Father's endless grace.

104
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,870
Even if we lock up the Chief of the Patrol Guards and his men,

105
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,460
the palace will be waiting to hear from them.

106
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,990
So we must prepare a plan quickly.

107
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,820
I have thought of what to do regarding that matter.

108
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,680
Please tell the governor to prepare a messenger to be sent to the palace.

109
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,080
People would think you are spying.

110
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,970
That is not it ...

111
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,040
Follow me.

112
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,790
Even if you are only a servant, you work for the royal physician.

113
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,290
Refrain from arousing suspicion.

114
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,450
I shall call you if I need you,

115
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,050
so do not enter the men's quarters without permission again.

116
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,850
All right.

117
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,910
By the way, why did His Highness become deposed?

118
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,420
Could it be related to why he was taken to the Royal Investigation Bureau last time?

119
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,610
Why do you have so many questions when you're just a servant girl?

120
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,300
If you're so curious, you can ask your lady later.

121
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,020
My lady does not know the answer, either.

122
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,430
You can ask your master, then.

123
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,280
They want to see you at the men's quarters.

124
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,470
- It is seolyamyeok*.
- It is not a snowy night today.
  (Cooked meat grilled again after cooling with ice) 

125
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,780
But I prepared it because I heard you like it.

126
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,750
How did you know I like seolyamyeok?

127
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,820
After I left the capital, His Majesty sent me letters every year.

128
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,910
He mostly talked about you besides the greeting.

129
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:38,320
I found out you like seolyamyeok thanks to His Majesty's letter as well.

130
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,450
Father.

131
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,920
All right.

132
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,730
All right. Please help yourself now.

133
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,810
These are special cows that were fed ground medicinal stones.

134
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,590
Sorry? You made a cow eat stones?

135
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,280
Have you heard of zeolites?

136
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,290
I have never heard of such a thing.

137
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,340
Have you heard of it?

138
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,930
Yes, geolites contain a lot of beneficial energies for the body

139
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,820
and it is called a medicinal stone because it cleanses the body.

140
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,340
You are right.

141
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,170
But it is still a stone, so we cannot eat it as it is.

142
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,300
We first feed it to animals such as cows and pigs.

143
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,090
And we eat those animals.

144
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:39,560
Cows that were fed medicinal stones lost the stench and became tender.

145
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,030
Go on. Please take a bite.

146
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,210
It is melting in my mouth! Is that not right, Your Highness?

147
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,960
You are right. It is truly tender and delicious.

148
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,110
It does not have any odor whatsoever.

149
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,690
You can only enjoy this in Mungyeong.

150
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,040
All right, now. Please eat to your heart's content.

151
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,320
Yes. You should have some as well, Grandfather.

152
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,750
I am fine.

153
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,820
It really melts in your mouth!

154
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,630
It has such a pretty color.

155
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,880
You are right.

156
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,700
Where does this get its color from?

157
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,290
It is fruit syrup made with five-flavor fruits.

158
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,290
Five-flavor fruits?

159
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,200
Do you also know a bit about five-flavor fruits?

160
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,810
The fruit is sweet and sour, but the seed is spicy and bitter.

161
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,350
Altogether, it tastes sour, which is why it is called a five-flavor fruit.

162
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,190
Do you also know its benefits?

163
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,160
According to "Great Pharmacopoeia" and "Dongui Bogam,"

164
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,690
it is said to enhance a man's stamina.

165
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,800
A man's stamina.

166
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,320
It has many other benefits besides that.

167
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,940
But I also know it is good for digestion.

168
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,830
She is better than most physicians, Your Highness.

169
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,770
I would not keep just anybody in my company.

170
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,710
Are you inside, Oh Wol?

171
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,590
Please go inside, Your Highness.

172
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,380
These are new cotton cloths.

173
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,180
Give him treatment and replace the old ones.

174
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,860
Did his wound get infected again?

175
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,500
No way.

176
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,980
Everyone knows you as a physician.

177
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,980
If he comes to see you again when he is not even in pain,

178
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,230
would they not be suspicious?

179
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,690
It looks like you were quite shocked.

180
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,160
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

181
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,900
Forgive you for what?

182
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,360
I have committed a crime I should not have against you.

183
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,540
I mean, you threw medicinal herbs at me

184
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,880
and plastered charcoal soot all over me.

185
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,290
You were quite rude and impolite, Baek Gu.

186
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,470
However, you did those things without knowing who I am.

187
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,040
I lied about my identity, so I should be the one apologizing.

188
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,100
Not at all, Your Highness.

189
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,220
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

190
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,360
Whether I am a scholar or a crown prince,

191
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,280
you are my lifesaver, and you have saved me from death many times.

192
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,710
And the fact I made it this far safely, all thanks to you, does not change.

193
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,610
So, you can stop doing that now.

194
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,100
Your Highness ...

195
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,970
What is the matter?

196
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,410
Are you worried about the future since you found out who I am?

197
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,160
You are a bright child,

198
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,440
so you must be worried about what will happen to your master

199
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,810
who tried to kill a nation's crown prince.

200
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,610
You must be worried about your lady as well.

201
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,340
You are right.

202
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,020
I do not have the slightest intent to forgive your master.

203
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,780
No matter what happens,

204
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,310
I will make your master pay for his crimes without fail

205
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,230
and your lady...

206
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,580
cannot stay out of harm's way when that happens.

207
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,420
However,

208
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,080
I am going to protect you.

209
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,900
I am going to protect you, no matter what.

210
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,270
So stay with me.

211
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,750
Your Highness.

212
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,940
I am ...

213
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,090
I am not lying.

214
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,000
I sincerely ...

215
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,760
do not want to harm you.

216
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,090
Your Highness ...

217
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,470
in fact ...

218
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,030
I am ...

219
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,770
 Your Highness, the master is asking for you. 

220
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,750
I must get going.

221
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,210
Let us talk about this again at a later time.

222
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,390
It looks like you are a crybaby, Baek Gu.

223
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,950
Do not cry.

224
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,360
I said it is all right.

225
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,740
Your Highness!

226
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,870
Nothing will happen to you if you are with me.

227
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,500
So do not worry and relax.

228
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,830
Isn't Baek Gu acting strange?

229
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,240
What do you mean?

230
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,280
Never mind.

231
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,840
What does he want to see me for?

232
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,670
He said he sent a messenger to Hanyang.

233
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,280
 Deposed Crown Prince Yi Geon was arrested and sent over right away. 

234
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,280
A messenger came from Mungyeong.

235
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,180
The deposed crown prince was arrested.

236
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,080
What brings you here, Head Eunuch?

237
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,950
His Majesty is in a critical state.

238
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,030
What is the matter?

239
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,550
Her Majesty said absolutely not to let the inspector general in.

240
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,030
Hurry up and announce me!

241
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,810
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Do Seong has arrived!

242
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,690
Your Majesty!

243
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,320
The Grand Prince has not even become the crown prince yet.

244
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,560
If His Majesty passes away like that,

245
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,140
will Queen Dowager and Choi Sang Rok not have second thoughts?

246
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,540
What did the physician the queen brought last time say?

247
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,150
You met him separately, did you not?

248
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:40,870
If you answer my questions with complete honesty right now,

249
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,680
I will let you go.

250
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:50,100
Is there a chance His Majesty will get better?

251
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,990
Zhen poison?

252
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,230
I heard it is a legendary poison 
  (Zhen: a poison-feathered mythical bird) 

253
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,510
passed down among physicians by word of mouth

254
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,770
because it has been lost over the years.

255
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,470
Anyway, how can he be sure it is Zhen poison?

256
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,440
The symptoms are similar to what his teacher told him

257
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,220
and there is no way the Royal Clinic would be

258
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,280
so clueless if it were any other poison besides Zhen poison.

259
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,580
In that case, His Majesty has to be ...

260
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,600
Choi Sang Rok is the only one who can cure him.

261
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,380
Why are you outside?

262
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,410
My chest feels heavy for some reason.

263
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,770
Does it feel like indigestion?

264
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,650
Should I bring you five-flavor fruit syrup?

265
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,380
Let me have a word with you.

266
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,750
I cannot leave right now. Let us have the talk another time.

267
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,500
I must have a word with you right now.

268
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,190
I will do everything you tell me to do.

269
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,450
If you tell me to become the crown prince, I will.

270
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,490
If you tell me to marry your daughter, I will.

271
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,050
I will also take responsibility to fend off Grandfather. Instead,

272
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,000
cure my father and ...

273
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,420
let Hyeong-nim be free.

274
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,580
You are demanding too much.

275
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,760
If the deposed crown prince is set free, it will surely bring us harm.

276
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,330
I will convince Hyeong-nim myself.

277
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,970
I will make him live in hiding where no one can find him.

278
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,730
If that is still not enough, I will make him leave this country

279
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,050
and make sure he never comes back to the palace.

280
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,200
You can do that.

281
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,970
Your Highness!

282
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,340
Instead,

283
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,060
don't forget your promise that you will take responsibility for everything from now on.

284
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,730
Do not ever forget that.

285
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,740
Do you understand?

286
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,630
Yes ...

287
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,770
Your Highness.

288
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,990
Open the doors.

289
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,870
Escort  the queen to her palace.

290
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,480
I am not going.

291
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,260
You can have me killed instead!

292
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,260
It looks like the queen was severely shocked.

293
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,740
Go to the Queen's Palace and look after yourself first.

294
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,650
- I refuse.
 - What are you all doing?

295
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,710
Escort her to the Queen's Palace right now!

296
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,140
Let go. Let go of me!

297
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,350
Grand Prince, you must stop them.

298
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,760
You cannot trust them, Grand Prince!

299
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,170
Escort her.

300
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,670
Please come with us, Your Highness.

301
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,260
You cannot do this, Grand Prince!

302
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,920
What is that there?

303
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:17,920
It is a medical device used to remove the poison around the facial area.

304
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,570
He will soon breathe normally and stop vomiting blood as well.

305
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,810
Are you still in discomfort?

306
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,860
No.

307
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,740
I am fine now. You can rest easy.

308
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,330
Father has shown signs of recovery.

309
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,820
Is that true?

310
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,200
Yes.

311
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,940
I must go to his bedchambers.

312
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,130
I have ...

313
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,300
something to tell you.

314
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,050
Please calm down

315
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,120
and take a seat.

316
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,450
I have ...

317
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,640
decided to become the crown prince as they wanted.

318
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,120
- You cannot!
- Mother!

319
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,870
You cannot become the crown prince!

320
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,890
I also know you and Father intend to make Hyeong-nim the king.

321
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,540
That is why

322
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,160
you also gave Hyeong-nim the royal seal.

323
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,500
You knew all along?

324
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,630
I had assumed so.

325
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,560
Were you ...

326
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,740
upset about it, by any chance?

327
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,440
I was not upset at all that you gave Hyeong-nim the royal seal!

328
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,300
However,

329
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,840
I was upset you had hidden that fact

330
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,190
even from me.

331
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,500
 - My queen...
- Yes, Your Majesty, I am here. 

332
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,730
 The royal seal ... 

333
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,350
 Give the royal seal ... 

334
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,940
 to the crown prince without fail. Make sure ... 

335
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,910
 no one knows. 

336
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,720
 Your Majesty. Your Majesty! 

337
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,290
 Your Majesty! 

338
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,010
 Your Majesty! 

339
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,120
You don't need to feel bad about it.

340
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,790
It is all my fault, my own lacking,

341
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,780
for I failed to be a trustworthy son!

342
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,420
That must also be why you are against me becoming the crown prince.

343
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,670
That is not it!

344
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,230
What is your reason for opposing, then?

345
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,350
I am too foolish

346
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,370
to understand what you are thinking, Mother.

347
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,000
There is no other way to save Father.

348
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,650
I must become

349
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,480
the crown prince.

350
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,210
Grand Prince!

351
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,920
I will be taking my leave now.

352
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,860
 If I die as you order, Left State Councillor, 

353
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,990
 Father will be the next in line. 

354
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,190
 Because as long as Father is alive, 

355
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,250
 Do Seong cannot become the king. 

356
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,020
Your Highness, should you not tell Grand Prince the truth instead?

357
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,000
The truth?

358
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,370
You want me to tell Grand Prince my father

359
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:46,310
will kill his father the king, once he becomes the crown prince?

360
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,870
Is something wrong?

361
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:04,210
 Did I not tell you to fix that fiery temper of yours? 

362
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,880
You are right.

363
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,410
- Pardon?
- Forget it.

364
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,570
 Your Highness ... 

365
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,100
 in fact ... 

366
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,910
 I am ... 

367
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,600
You cannot.

368
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,230
You will not.

369
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,540
Where do you think I am going?

370
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,570
You are going to Oh Wol again.

371
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,810
If someone sees you going in and out of the annex this late at night—

372
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,280
I am going to the outhouse.

373
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,090
You can go ahead.

374
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,500
Go on and tell me.

375
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,960
What you were trying to tell me earlier in the day.

376
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,100
I am sure you had something to tell me.

377
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,470
Just what is it, for you to hesitate this much to say it?

378
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,980
It is fine. You can take your time to tell me later.

379
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,670
No, Your Highness.

380
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,480
I will tell you now.

381
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,500
Your Highness.

382
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,170
Yes.

383
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,630
In fact ...

384
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,410
In fact?

385
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,950
In fact,

386
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,720
I am not Oh Wol, the servant girl.

387
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
What do you mean by that?

388
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,500
You are not Oh Wol?

389
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,300
Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok is my father.

390
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,800
What did you ...

391
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,020
say just now?

392
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,500
I am Myeong Yun,

393
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,550
the royal physician's daughter, who was the cause

394
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,410
of your kidnapping.

395
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,870
The crime of having deceived Your Highness—

396
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,390
You can rest now.

397
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,990
You were kidnapped because of me.

398
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,980
You almost died and ended up getting chased because of me.

399
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,010
So, I wanted to do all I could to help.

400
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:57,570
I wanted to do all I could to protect you from my father.

401
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:03,250
However, for me to do that, I had to remain as Oh Wol the servant.

402
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,210
Since I cannot be by your side as the royal physician's daughter,

403
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:12,280
I wanted to be by your side, even if it meant becoming Oh Wol or Baek Gu.

404
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,390
So I deceived Your Highness.

405
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,690
I can understand

406
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,150
why you would pretend to be Oh Wol, given your circumstances.

407
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,860
Because I also hid my true identity.

408
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,440
However,

409
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:41,300
the reason I cannot say or listen to anything right now is

410
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,920
because you just have to be the royal physician's daughter, Maiden!

411
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,190
Of course, I cannot hold you guilty of your father's crimes.

412
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:58,030
I also know it's not your fault that you were born as his daughter. However ...

413
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,810
I can only think that with my head, and I just cannot take it to heart!

414
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,940
- The things your father did—
 - My father was not

415
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,490
trying to harm you intentionally, either.

416
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,550
He could not help but kidnap you, hearing his daughter would become a widow otherwise.

417
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,380
But he just happened to kidnap the crown prince.

418
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,920
What he did after was out of fear for what would happen.

419
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,130
So, feel pity for my father, whose judgment was clouded briefly because of his child —

420
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,260
I do not want to hear it!

421
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,690
Feel pity?

422
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:32,350
Can you say the same thing even if your father has committed murder?

423
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,460
Do not ever

424
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,070
mention your father again in front of me.

425
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,160
I will bring you to Hanyang, at least.

426
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,530
So do not tell anyone

427
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,480
you are ...

428
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,590
the royal physician's daughter until then.

429
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,590
Do you understand?

430
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,840
Yes.

431
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:11,070
♫  How much longer must I live until I can forget?  ♫

432
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,810
♫  Will you be there after the years pass?  ♫

433
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,310
 Please forgive me, Your Highness. 

434
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,370
♫  I am looking only at you with a blank stare.  ♫

435
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:26,460
 They said I delivered the poisoned croaker the crown prince gave me. 

436
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,160
 to Her Highness the Queen. 

437
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,540
 But it is the queen dowager's doing, not the queen's. 

438
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:39,340
 I will make sure to at least protect His Majesty's life. 

439
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:46,720
♫  Because it feels like the wind is brushing by  ♫

440
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,710
♫  it hurts like my breath was taken away and the tears flow  ♫

441
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,970
 Your Highness... I am... 

442
00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:01,700
♫  I want to look at and embrace you  ♫

443
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:09,650
♫  I am destroying the longing which comes to me  ♫

444
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,920
♫  If I wait, how much longer until I can see you?  ♫

445
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:40,260
♫  Will you be there after this night?  ♫

446
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:47,500
♫  Will I be able to see you again someday?  ♫

447
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:54,820
♫  Like the faint moonlight there which waxes before you know it  ♫

448
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:01,260
♫  don't leave.  ♫

449
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:08,500
♫  Because it feels like the wind is brushing by  ♫

450
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:15,910
♫  it hurts like my breath was taken away and the tears flow  ♫

451
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,600
♫  I want to look at and embrace you  ♫

452
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:30,400
♫  Destroy the longing which comes to me/i&gt; ♫ 

453
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:39,970
♫  You are just moving farther away as if you were flying  ♫

454
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,950
♫  I want to hold onto you even if I live only tearfully  ♫

455
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:49,390
I have something to tell you, so come outside for a moment. 
 ♫  When the sun sets the longing to do it again   ♫

456
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:57,450
♫  spreads uncontrollably  ♫

457
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,760
♫  Like the moon waning over there  ♫

458
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,600
♫  Because it hurts to hear you say you love me  ♫

459
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:15,380
♫  The tears flow and I cry as though my breath were taken away  ♫

460
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,460
Did you leave?

461
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,740
 I cannot be that shameless and travel with you to Hanyang. 

462
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,880
 So I am leaving first. 

463
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,380
 Please forgive me for leaving without a word. 

464
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,710
My Lady!

465
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,310
You were still chasing me?

466
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,480
Are you all right?

467
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,800
Are you hurt or unwell anywhere?

468
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,390
- I am not.
 - We will escort you home right away, then.

469
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,740
I still have an unfinished task from the master.

470
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,650
These men will escort you.

471
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,210
You two go to Hanyang with her ladyship.

472
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,670
 Yes! 

473
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,980
Let me have a word with you.

474
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,040
What are you so surprised about?

475
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,260
It has been quite a while since I traveled with him.

476
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,630
Did you think I still would not know he is the crown prince?

477
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,460
Hurry up and answer me.

478
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,940
Will you take me home or

479
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,360
will you keep pursuing the crown prince?

480
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,150
- My Lady—
 - If you give up on pursuing the crown prince

481
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,360
and go back with me,

482
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,630
I will go home willingly, without causing trouble.

483
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,560
However, if that is not the case,

484
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,930
I will beat up those men and run away.

485
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,120
Is it because you are scared to defy Father's order?

486
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,650
I will make sure Father will not harm—

487
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,590
I don't care what happens to me.

488
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,310
You come first for me, My Lady.

489
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,780
I will escort you home.

490
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,710
He seems to have stabilized a lot.

491
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,970
I am glad.

492
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,420
However, leaving Grand Prince Do Seong aside,

493
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,060
can we really trust the left state councillor?

494
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,990
Won't he change his mind?

495
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,760
I found a way to put the reins on the left state councillor.

496
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,670
So you don't need to worry.

497
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:13,470
Recently, Jangyewon* had received an accusation.
 (Government office in charge of all matters regarding slaves.) 

498
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,320
 Jangyewon received an accusation, 

499
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,670
 saying there is a bastard child among the officials, who hid his identity. 

500
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,460
 Then, you just need to impeach him if he turns out to be a bastard child, right? 

501
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,710
 The accused is ... 

502
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,390
 His Excellency the Left State Councillor. 

503
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:49,590
Left State Councillor Yun Yi Gyeom's grandmother was originally a slave?

504
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,150
Yes, she was originally a servant girl's child.

505
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,700
But after the household she worked for was destroyed during the Japanese invasion,

506
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,290
it seems she pretended to be the madam's child,

507
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,070
and married Yun Yi Gyeom's grandfather.

508
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,710
That means Yun Yi Gyeom is also ...

509
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:09,370
Yes, according to the Maternal Hereditary Slavery Law,

510
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:14,790
descendants of Yun Yi Gyeom's grandmother, Bok Sun, all become slaves.

511
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:18,200
So, Yun Yi Gyeom is also a slave.

512
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,350
It seems that one of the master's descendants who were believed to be dead

513
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:24,600
still had Yun Yi Gyeom's grandmother's slave document.

514
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,160
They filed a report with Jangyewon, asking for the truth on this matter.

515
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,020
Was it confirmed? Is he really a bastard child?

516
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,890
Most slave documents stored in Jangyewon were burned during the Japanese invasion,

517
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,410
so it will take some time to confirm. However ...

518
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,900
once the slave document is proven authentic,

519
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,890
we will have Yun Yi Gyeom in our hands.

520
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,760
So we can get rid of him whenever we want.

521
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,590
You might not be able to confirm its authenticity, though.

522
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,840
That is why I am also interrogating people

523
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,400
about the left state councillor's family, to secure witnesses.

524
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,450
Does the left state councillor also know about his grandmother's status?

525
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,280
What did you say?

526
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,810
The inspector general's office is interrogating people about my family?

527
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:15,170
Yes. They are asking people about your grandmother.

528
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,950
Well, do you have an idea why?

529
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,280
Not at all.

530
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,390
I need to go home now.

531
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:32,660
You go and find out exactly what it is that Choi Sang Rok learned.

532
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:39,680
No. Find out Choi Sang Rok's weakness, too.

533
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,070
His weakness?

534
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:46,550
I doubt he has any weaknesses I can find.

535
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,020
If he has none, make one up and bring it to me!

536
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,460
Do not sit and wait for Choi Sang Rok to bring us down.

537
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,930
Find out anything you can!

538
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,020
Do you understand?

539
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,110
I wonder if the kindling I sent to Jangyewon is burning well.

540
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,720
Please do not be concerned.

541
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,210
We used bait that they just could not refuse.

542
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,010
So I am sure it has become a big fire by now.

543
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,660
I hope that is the case.

544
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,710
They could not trust each other from the beginning.

545
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:33,550
The queen dowager will need Yun Yi Gyeom's weaknesses

546
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,310
and Yun Yi Gyeom will end up a slave, from being

547
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:40,080
one of the most powerful people in this country,

548
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,720
if his grandmother's matter is revealed.

549
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,700
So they won't be able to avoid fighting each other.

550
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,680
How did you know to keep such proof with you?

551
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,900
I had prepared it just in case

552
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,760
Yun Yi Gyeom would get a different idea

553
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,360
when it is time for you to take the throne.

554
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,420
Grandfather.

555
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:08,140
I only did what I was supposed to do.

556
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:18,290
Now, then. I will see you in Hanyang.

557
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:21,170
Please take care until then.

558
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,160
Please take care as well, Your Highness.

559
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,630
Please stay strong as well, Uncle.

560
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,210
Please take care, Your Highness.

561
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,560
Did you deliver the petition?

562
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,050
I sent people to Sosu Academy, Dosan Academy, and Byeongsan Academy.

563
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,260
Good job.

564
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,660
Dear kings of all ages,

565
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,880
please protect His Highness.

566
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,220
Why are you holding onto it so dearly?

567
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,240
It is the good stuff for men.

568
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,010
Five-flavored fruit?

569
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:26,610
Sure. You can have all you want.

570
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:30,200
Uncle prepared it especially for you.

571
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,270
It is a royal descendant's duty to have many children.

572
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,550
I have more than enough stamina without it.

573
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,530
Did you send away Oh Wol because you have so much stamina?

574
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,110
What I meant was ...

575
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,240
Oh Wol suddenly disappeared,

576
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,920
but you did not say anything about it.

577
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,830
Did something really happen?

578
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,780
Your Highness!

579
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,470
What about Myeong Yun? Was she all right?

580
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:12,290
Yes. However ...

581
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:18,750
she already knew the kidnapped scholar is the deposed crown prince.

582
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,000
You should have asked for

583
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,890
His Highness' forgiveness when you realized he was the crown prince.

584
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:37,070
Did you so badly want to make me the crown princess?

585
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,800
Did you so badly want to become the king's father-in-law?

586
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,640
Sure. I wanted to make you the crown princess

587
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,920
and I also wanted to become the king's father-in-law.

588
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,660
Is that so wrong of a thing?

589
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,500
Yes, it is wrong.

590
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,800
Because I do not have the right to become the crown princess.

591
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,690
If you are talking about the kidnapping, there is nothing more to talk about.

592
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:05,710
The deposed crown prince has been arrested.

593
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,730
He will not survive it this time, for sure.

594
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:13,110
So, the kidnapping and all relevant happenings

595
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:17,540
will be buried along with the deposed crown prince.

596
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:22,250
If you understand, just prepare to become the crown princess.

597
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,580
The crown prince is not here,

598
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:28,330
so how can I become the crown princess?

599
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:34,460
The one who was arrested is the deposed crown prince, not the crown prince.

600
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,960
I have no idea what you are talking about.

601
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,430
Grand Prince Do Seong will soon become the crown prince

602
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:43,250
and he will take your hand in marriage soon after. So ...

603
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,330
you will become the crown princess. Do you understand now?

604
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,110
That is an absolute nonsense.

605
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,350
After doing an unforgivable thing to his hyeong,

606
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,580
how can I marry his younger brother?

607
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,940
We committed such an act, so you must marry Grand Prince Do Seong

608
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,700
in order for you and our household to survive. How can you not see this?

609
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,170
The deposed crown prince has become enemies with our family now.

610
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:14,830
So Grand Prince Do Seong is the only one who can protect you—

611
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:20,010
Do you think Grand Prince Do Seong will marry me, knowing these facts?

612
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,710
He will marry you.

613
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,280
Because he already has feelings for you deep in his heart.

614
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:41,630
 Maiden, why did you have to be born as the royal  physician's daughter? 

615
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,060
My Lady, why the long face?

616
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,270
Was the master seriously angry with you?

617
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,290
What are you so upset about?

618
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,470
You ran away from home and got caught.

619
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:17,070
Did you think he would just say "you did well" and forget about it?

620
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:21,180
Oh Wol, I need to get some rest.

621
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,170
Yes.

622
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,300
My Lady, are you unwell?

623
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:36,460
No. I am just exhausted. So I am going to go to sleep early.

624
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,630
Yes.

625
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,280
I am sure something is wrong.

626
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,860
I cannot tell what it is.

627
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,730
 He will not survive it this time for sure. 

628
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:12,000
 So kidnapping and all relevant happenings 

629
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,220
 will be buried along with the deposed crown prince. 

630
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,450
 Grand Prince Do Seong will soon become the crown prince 

631
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,030
 and he will take your hand in marriage soon after. 

632
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:27,230
 So you will become the crown princess. 

633
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,380
 You were kidnapped because of me. 

634
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,270
 You almost died and ended up getting chased because of me. 

635
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,320
 So I wanted to do all I could to help. 

636
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,440
 I wanted to do all I could to protect you from my father. 

637
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,120
Nothing good will come out of provoking them right now.

638
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,580
For now, refrain from visiting the Main Hall for a while—

639
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,620
I will not do that!

640
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,200
No matter what they say, I am going to stay by His Majesty's side.

641
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,280
Do you really not know what is going on?

642
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:24,340
You already know very well that ultimately, Choi Sang Rok

643
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,470
is the only one who can save Father.

644
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,130
Please trust your son and do as I say.

645
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:45,280
Your Highness. I also believe you should do as Grand Prince Do Seong says for now.

646
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,330
Mother.

647
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,890
I understand.

648
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,250
What is the matter?

649
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:15,920
Her Highness the Queen Dowager just cannot bring herself to eat.

650
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:20,270
She had many things happen to her lately.

651
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,620
I believe it is because she is heartbroken,

652
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:28,720
so, should we take her outside the palace for some fresh air?

653
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:36,950
Court Lady Kim, you have only been worrying about Her Highness all your life.

654
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:41,940
What else could I possibly wish for?

655
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:48,420
I only want ... Her Highness to find true inner peace.

656
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:57,830
If you keep skipping your meals, you will harm your health.

657
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:01,030
I just do not have much appetite,

658
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,330
so don't let it bother you.

659
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:08,270
What do you say we go to Bota Temple for a trip?

660
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,550
If we say we will leave the palace to make an offering to Buddha,

661
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,290
there will be a lot of opposition.

662
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,780
The queen dowager wishes to do so. Who would dare oppose it?

663
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:28,920
I will have such traitors killed for their crimes right away.

664
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,900
In that case, could I leave it to you, Inspector General?

665
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:39,160
Yes, please have faith in this humble one.

666
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,260
I do not want a showy procession.

667
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,880
Please make it a quiet trip.

668
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,210
I understand.

669
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,840
I will discuss this with the left state councillor and prepare.

670
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,410
So eat your meals for now.

671
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:55,300
You need energy to go on a trip, right?

672
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,350
Yes, Orabeoni.

673
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,260
 The inspector general's office is interrogating people about my family? 

674
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:24,090
This is the new wall gun* developed by the Firearms Agency. 
 (a type of smoothbore firearm used in the 16th-18th centuries) 

675
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,590
I heard your daughter is about to be sold off

676
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,520
because you could not pay back the money you borrowed.

677
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:48,360
You need to save your daughter, don't you?

678
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:42,890
When will the external palace at Anju be completed?

679
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:45,270
They said it would take all spring, at least.

680
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,050
I want to put down everything

681
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:52,610
and leave the palace to be with Grand Prince Gwang Chang as soon as I can.

682
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,210
Is it not possible for them to hurry up?

683
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:00,500
I will tell the Royal Treasury to hurry up.

684
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:10,110
Spring is soon to be here, so please stay strong, Your Highness.

685
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,770
Please take cover!

686
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,020
Your Highness!

687
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:11,040
Inspector General  ...

688
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,120
Please wake up.

689
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,760
- Hurry up. Please.
 - Your Highness.

690
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,990
You have to escape, Your Highness!

691
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:22,970
Physician ... Where is the physician?

692
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:24,940
Hurry up and bring me the physician!

693
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,360
What are you all doing?

694
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,770
Take Her Highness to safety right now!

695
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:34,010
Yun Yi Gyeom... How dare you, you rascal, Yun Yi Gyeom!

696
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:46,420


697
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:06,510
♫  If I wait, how much longer until I can see you?  ♫

698
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:13,810
♫  Will you be there after this night?  ♫

699
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,960
 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview 

700
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,600
 Did you find a way to clear your name? 

701
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,850
 I do have an idea. 

702
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:25,360
 Why isn't he waking up? 

703
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,890
 Tell me how I can ease the queen dowager's anger even a bit. 

704
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,760
 Tomorrow is the investiture. What do we do? 

705
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,480
 The crown prince investiture and the wedding are to be done together. 

706
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,460
 What am I supposed to do now? 

707
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,290
 I will become the crown prince and protect everyone I cherish! 

708
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:45,080
 I hope you will remember me as a man who held you in his heart.
