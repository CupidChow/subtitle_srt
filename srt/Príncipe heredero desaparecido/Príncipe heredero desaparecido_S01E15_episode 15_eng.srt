 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts.

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,990
 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines. 

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,610
Did you get injured?

12
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,220
It is all right. I am fine.

 Episode 15 

14
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,020
- Do Seong!
 - I will protect the ones I care for!

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,000
- Why are you doing this?
 - To protect her,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,840
I must become the crown prince.

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,970
Please let go.

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,700
Let us go.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,690
Let go of her hand.

20
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,110
I said I will protect her.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,520
Do you not see the blood?

22
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,290
Taking care of her wound comes first, so step back.

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,430
I will not do that.

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,590
Oh Wol!

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,810
- My Lady.
 - Are you all right?

26
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,680
My Lady.

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,160
I am sorry ...

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,240
Lie down here.

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,120
My Lady, there is blood! What shall we do?

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,220
Is it a serious injury?

31
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,420
It is nothing.

32
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,850
Hurry up and lie down.

33
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,000
Who do you think did that to her?

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,580
Lower your voice.

35
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,600
You will only put Maiden Myeong Yun in more danger if someone hears you.

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,140
Her wound might be deep, so let us treat it first.

37
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,020
I will take care of treating her wound.

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,290
You should go stop your grandfather, Hyeong-nim.

39
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,620
What do you mean by that?

40
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,270
They are killers your grandfather sent to kill Maiden Myeong Yun, Hyeong-nim.

41
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,860
The chief royal guard already told me everything.

42
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,330
So you can go confirm it yourself.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,410
Your method is wrong, Hyeong-nim.

44
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,880
You could not protect anyone in the end.

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,620
Neither Father, nor Mother, nor Maiden Myeong Yun.

46
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,490
However, I will become the crown prince and protect everyone I cherish.

47
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,920
Did you not say you do not care whether you are the crown prince or not?

48
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,570
If you meant what you said, please give up now.

49
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,120
In this world, there are things you must do even though you do not want to.

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,140
Are you saying you must become the crown prince

51
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,450
even if everyone around you will get hurt?

52
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,560
Please just tell me honestly!

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
Is it to punish Choi Sang Rok

54
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,660
or could it be because you cannot give up Maiden Myeong Yun?

55
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,860
Are you all right?

56
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,920
Yes, it is only a light scratch.

57
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,230
Let us go.

58
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,320
Get treated in my room first and then goâ€”

59
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,220
I am not going anywhere.

60
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,150
Since I came here to treat His Majesty,

61
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,440
I will never leave the palace

62
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,230
until His Majesty recovers completely.

63
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,610
You cannot. That is too dangerous.

64
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,380
Do you truly not know even your father or the queen dowager will be able

65
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,140
to protect you if you get found out?

66
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,520
If it just means His Majesty will recover, none of that matters to me.

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,450
How can you be so reckless?

68
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,200
You are just the same, Hyeong-nim.

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,860
Why are you making her risk her life for something she will fail at anyway?

70
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,280
Why do you say it will fail without even trying?

71
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,150
Even the royal physicians could not do it.

72
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,670
I will not let Maiden sacrifice herself

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,560
over something so obviously impossible to do.

74
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:56,010
Do you think I care less about Maiden Myeong Yun than you do?

75
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,700
As long as I am alive, Maiden will never be sacrificed.

76
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,800
That will be final. You can go back now.

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,130
I refuse.

78
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,270
Please give me some time.

79
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,780
I will try all that I can and ...

80
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,340
if that still does not work, I will give up and leave.

81
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,540
Leave the palace before dawn breaks.

82
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,660
If you do not leave the palace by the morning,

83
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,300
I will notify your father myself.

84
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,170
It is fortunate the wound is not any worse.

85
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,170
I apologize for making you worry.

86
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,300
I am sorry for putting you through this.

87
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,080
Not at all.

88
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,850
I must have become quite slow because I did not train for a while.

89
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,330
They were sent by my grandfatherâ€”

90
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,300
I heard.

91
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,040
For your grandfather, the fact Choi Sang Rok's daughter is by your side

92
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,820
must have been absolutely unacceptable.

93
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,580
I can understand, so we can stop talking about that.

94
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,180
Do Seong said he would forgive your father once he became the crown prince.

95
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,780
Were you not upset with me when I opposed it?

96
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,120
Yes, I am upset.

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,800
I can guess you must have your reasons,

98
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,770
but I find it upsetting how you are not telling me anything.

99
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,630
Once Do Seong becomes the crown prince,

100
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,300
the left state councillor will murder my father.

101
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,490
Because that is the only way to make Do Seong the king.

102
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,780
Is that the case?

103
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,180
He can ally with the queen dowager and make Do Seong the crown prince.

104
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,660
But he cannot inherit the throne until out royal father passes away.

105
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,930
You said you told this

106
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,090
even to my father and the queen dowager.

107
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,400
How come you just did not tell  Grand Prince Do Seong?

108
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,020
I could not bring myself to tell him.

109
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:03,600
How can I tell him his grandfather will kill our father

110
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,800
to make him the king?

111
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,360
I understand what you mean.

112
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,840
But the more you try to hide this, he will only misunderstand you more, won't he?

113
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,870
What can I do?

114
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,790
Rather than scarring Do Seong for life,

115
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:25,120
I feel more comfortable with him considering me a bad brother.

116
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,770
It seems you really cherish the grand prince a lot.

117
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,080
He is my only younger brother in this world.

118
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,890
I envy the grand prince for having a brother like you.

119
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,450
I never told you to kill her.

120
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,150
You just had to carry her out of the palace.

121
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,080
So, why did you carry swords and cause this problem?

122
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,800
- What a frustrating bunch you are!
 - I apologize, Your Excellency.

123
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,180
 This is Gab Seok. 

124
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,860
You can take your leave.

125
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,780
Come in!

126
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,350
His Highness wants to see you.

127
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,720
Not at all, Your Highness.

128
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,050
I did not even fathom killing her.

129
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,890
Since Choi Sang Rok's daughter absolutely cannot be near Your Highness,

130
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,580
I wanted to send her out of the palaceâ€”

131
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,040
Whether you tried to kill her or send her out,

132
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,700
you had promised not to go against my will behind my back,

133
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,850
but you broke that promise.

134
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,860
I apologize, Your Highness.

135
00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:01,720
However, please understand I cannot forsake my duty as your subject.

136
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,980
How can you say killing an innocent woman is your duty as a subject?

137
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,950
Your Highness, Choi Sang Rok's daughter is not an innocent woman.

138
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,860
Did you not hear why Maiden Myeong Yun entered the palace?

139
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,800
Do you believe her when she says she wants to cure His Majesty?

140
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,700
Do you truly believe Choi Sang Rok's daughter will go against her father's will?

141
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,520
Yes, I believe in her!

142
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,960
That woman is the daughter of your mortal enemy,

143
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,930
the one who attempted to murder His Majesty

144
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,900
and had you deposed by falsely accusing you.

145
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,300
You cannot be seduced.

146
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Please do not forget that to have feelings

147
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,120
for such a woman is disloyalty and lack of filial piety!

148
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,980
Enough!

149
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,930
That is enough.

150
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,690
You are an heir to the throne, who must govern and lead this country of Joseon in the future.

151
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,080
Because of a mere womanâ€”

152
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,040
That mere woman will cure Father.

153
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,460
I am sure that is what you want to believe.

154
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,070
However, that will never happen.

155
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:16,060
I will never overlook the traitor's daughter who is seducing you, Crown Prince.

156
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,570
What will you do if I insist on having her by my side?

157
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,340
- Your Highnessâ€”
 - Answer me!

158
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,300
I am asking what you would do.

159
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,840
If it means I can protect Your Highness,

160
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,800
I will remove her as many times as necessary.

161
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,390
Even if you have to kill her?

162
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,770
If getting blood on this old man's hands

163
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,370
will direct Your Highness to the right path,

164
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,740
yes, I will gladly do so.

165
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,210
I did not know you were no different from the left state councillor, Grandfather.

166
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,010
- Your Highness!
 - What is the difference between you wanting to kill

167
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,780
Maiden Myeong Yun, for my sake, and the left state councillor

168
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,440
murdering Father for Do Seong's sake?

169
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,610
Your Highness, how could you say such devastating things?

170
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,820
- This humble one isâ€”
 - Please go back to Mungyeong now.

171
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,780
- Your Highness.
 - I will take care of my own matters from now on.

172
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,640
So, do not do anything for my sake.

173
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,790
Not a thing at all.

174
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,120
 So, do not ever tell me to forgive my father again. 

175
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:50,330
 No child in this world would be able to forgive a father who killed her mother. 

176
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,210
When did you arrive?

177
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,320
I heard Myeong Yun stopped by.

178
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,110
It is all my fault.

179
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,150
I should have endured it, no matter how much I missed you.

180
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:19,930
All of this happened because I met you here, Orabeoni.

181
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,710
Do not blame yourself.

182
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,760
Even if it was not for that day, it would have happened eventually.

183
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,620
I also came running because I missed you, did I not?

184
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,180
Orabeoni.

185
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,800
I am sure it is very hard on you ...

186
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,640
but it will not last much longer.

187
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,340
Please bear it a little longer.

188
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,440
â™«  You keep growing larger  â™«

189
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,800
 - Please let go of me.
 - Let us go. 

190
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,950
 Let go of her hand. 

191
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,680
 And I would like you to 

192
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,140
 stop this marriage, Grand Prince. 

193
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,070
â™«  What should I do with this love?  â™«

194
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,200
 And if his name is cleared and reinstated as the crown prince, you do not ... 

195
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,980
 have to marry me, either, Maiden. 

196
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,220
 Do you think I care less about Maiden Myeong Yun than you do? 

197
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,470
 As long as I am alive, Maiden will never be sacrificed. 

198
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,190
 That will be final. You can go back now. 

199
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:17,100
â™«  Look at me, can you feel my heart?  â™«

200
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:23,760
â™«  I live in endless longing  â™«

201
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,390
â™«  I love you, I love you. When can I reach you?  â™«

202
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,770
â™«  When will I be able to reach you?  â™«

203
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:38,380
â™«  Stay here at my side.  â™«

204
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,130
 They are transcriptions of the most recent clinical logs and the ledger. 

205
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,680
 I read all of them, but the information about the antidote is missing. 

206
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,590
 It seems the book I saw at the queen dowager's palace is the one. 

207
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,180
Was everything all right with Myeong Yun?

208
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,240
She went to the temple.

209
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,520
This is the letter she wanted me to give you once you came home.

210
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,440
It seems she is not as angry now.

211
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,030
Since she left me a letter.

212
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,290
It seems she will be there for a few more days.

213
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,860
You can also go stay with Myeong Yun.

214
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,240
If I am not home, would you not be inconvenienced?

215
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,190
I will have to reside at the Royal Clinic for a while.

216
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,990
So, do not worry about me and go.

217
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,990
What brings you here at this hour?

218
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,770
I came to say my morning greetings.

219
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,150
A greeting, huh?

220
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,040
What is with the sudden change?

221
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,320
A few days ago, I saw Grand Prince Gwang Chang in my dream.

222
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,770
It bothered me, so I looked into it

223
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,000
and I learned a cheondojae* was not held properly.
 (A Buddhist ritual for the deceased) 

224
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,580
Though it is late, I thought a cheondojae for him should be held.

225
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,550
So, I told Jeongeopwon* to make the preparations.
 (A Buddhist temple where the royal women reside after conversion.) 

226
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,350
Would you please attend?

227
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,510
It is a bit sudden for me.

228
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,550
I am sure it is.

229
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:08,090
However, Grand Prince Gwang Chang's matters concern the royal family,

230
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,840
regardless of other matters, doesn't it?

231
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,940
I should have done this sooner.

232
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,720
I apologize for the delay.

233
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,000
Please carefully consider it and let me know if you will attend.

234
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,960
Then, I will take my leave now.

235
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,740
Prepare a trip to Jeongeopwon.

236
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,120
Please consult the inspector general first and then decide.

237
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,970
Did you forget what happened at the Bota Temple last time?

238
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,630
This is Gwang Chang's cheondojae. Do not stop me.

239
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,480
What do you think you are doing?

240
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,990
Where is Maiden Myeong Yun?

241
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,080
Rather, where did you hide her?

242
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,330
She is doing fine at a safe place, so do not worry.

243
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,630
They set out to kill her.

244
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,190
As long as she is inside the palace, they will find and kill her without fail.

245
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,570
They did not intend to kill her.

246
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,970
They were going to sendâ€”

247
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,440
Then, why would they use a sword on a woman?

248
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,800
It makes no sense!

249
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,990
If you truly worry for Maiden Myeong Yun's safety,

250
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,820
tell me where you hid her right now.

251
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,240
Forget it. I will find her.

252
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,860
Even if I have to search the entire palace, I will find her.

253
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,960
Just wait and see.

254
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,850
Do Seong!

255
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,060
Your Highness, I searched everywhere, but she is not there.

256
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,270
You must find her even if you have to search the entire palace!

257
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,840
Yes!

258
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,220
The grand prince Do Seong ordered Cheol Du to find Maiden Myeong Yun.

259
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,360
What do we do?

260
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,290
Your Highness.

261
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,710
Bring me Cheol Du.

262
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,340
Hey! What is this?

263
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,080
What do you want?

264
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,760
Want me to tell you where Maiden Myeong Yun is?

265
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,100
- Really?
 - Yes.

266
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,030
Where is she?

267
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,710
Hey, Gab Seok, you are reallyâ€”

268
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,910
I brought him with us because there was nowhere to put him.

269
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,040
I will take care of him.

270
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,020
If he wakes up, he might fight back.

271
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,730
So, I should stay with herâ€”

272
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,050
Where am I? Aigoo!

273
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,770
Quite the surprise, right?

274
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,100
My lady is sometimes a bit violent.

275
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,010
But she does not do that to just anyone, so do not be concerned.

276
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,140
- I see.
 - Please skip the honorifics.

277
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,320
We will see each other from time to time now.

278
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,340
Why would you see Sang Su?

279
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,590
My lady and His Highness are in love with each other, so we will meet, obviously.

280
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,270
This is where my lady will be residing in the future.

281
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,530
That will never happen, so wake up now.

282
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,560
Why?

283
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,070
It is none of your business.

284
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,270
I heard this is where Her Highness the Queen resides.

285
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,770
Are we allowed to be here?

286
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,200
All the people of the queen's palace were confined with her,

287
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,890
so it will be safe with no one coming around for a while.

288
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,320
You just need to be careful when the royal guards are on patrol.

289
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
I see.

290
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,870
Gosh, one person explains things like this so nicely.

291
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,030
But the other one only scolds me.

292
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,560
They are so different. So much.

293
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,720
D-Different?

294
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,820
The queen dowager sent word, saying she will attend the cheondojae.

295
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,310
How fortunate.

296
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,220
I will steal the book without fail.

297
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,420
Must you go in person, Maiden?

298
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,500
You should send Gab Seok instead ...

299
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,040
Royal Officer Lee is a man, so he cannot go inside the queen dowager's palace.

300
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,370
Above all, I should go since I know where the book is and can find it right away.

301
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,900
Thank you for worrying about me,

302
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,950
but please have faith in me, Your Highness.

303
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,070
You have to be careful. Do you understand?

304
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,270
I understand.

305
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,730
Cheol Du!

306
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,420
Cheol Du!

307
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,450
Cheol Du is under my care.

308
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,420
 Between these books, there was a letter. 

309
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,950
It is the letter Father exchanged with a spy.

310
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,330
Do you know who it was?

311
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:03,000
I do not know the details because I only got to read the front part before Father came back.

312
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,880
But he seemed to be Grand Prince Do Seong's close aide.

313
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,150
Are you saying Cheol Du is Choi Sang Rok's spy?

314
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:14,320
Just be honest and say you want to cut off my people from me.

315
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,520
It might not be Cheol Du. However ...

316
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,970
if one of your close aides is a spy, as suggested by the letter

317
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,650
the maiden saw, then Cheol Du would beâ€”

318
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,250
I know Cheol Du the best.

319
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,630
He might be ignorant, but he would never betray.

320
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,700
I could not even fathom Sang Su would stab me, either.

321
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,760
I also never imagined you would do this to me, Hyeong-nim.

322
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,900
Even when my grandfather was attacked

323
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,310
and when Mother was confined,

324
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,070
I still trusted you, Hyeong-nim!

325
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:55,090
Because I felt I must not push you aside and become the crown prince!

326
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,610
I tried with all my might not to become the crown prince, but you

327
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,140
opposed me becoming the crown prince even when I said

328
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,260
I would protect Mother and save Maiden Myeong Yun.

329
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,040
Just ... Just say you want to be the crown prince instead!

330
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,780
Just say you must have her even if she is your younger brother's woman!

331
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,180
Shut your mouth!

332
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,230
You do not know anything, and you speak so carelessly.

333
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,020
What are you saying that I do not know?

334
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,700
Just tell me if there is something I do not know!

335
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,230
Forget it. I do not even want to know it.

336
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,950
Just hand over Cheol Du right now.

337
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,700
Once Father wakes up

338
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,050
and after punishing the queen dowager and Choi Sang Rok,

339
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,070
I will be the first one to ask Royal Father

340
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,910
to have me step down from being the crown prince.

341
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,580
You think Royal Father will accept your request?

342
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,800
I will accept any criticisms from you for now.

343
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,790
However, I am ...

344
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,770
going to make Father recover

345
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:11,290
even if I have to get help from Maiden Myeong Yun.

346
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:16,310
And anyone who interferes with this, even if it is you,

347
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,330
I will never forgive.

348
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,650
I will release Cheol Du as soon as this is over.

349
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,250
You will not have your way this time!

350
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,080
Do you think I will give up?

351
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,360
 Just wait and see. 

352
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,740
I will have Maiden Myeong Yun as the crown princess without fail!

353
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,680
 Grand Prince Gwang Chang] 

354
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,740
Is anyone at the queen dowager's palace?

355
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,260
These are flower pots His Highness sent Her Highness the Queen Dowager.

356
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,460
Wipe them until they're spotless.

357
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,590
 Five 

358
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,490
 Five 

359
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,790
 Five 

360
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,580
You succeeded. Great job.

361
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,370
Do not even mention it.

362
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,210
Senior Court Lady Kim came while my lady was still inside, and I almost passed out.

363
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,650
I was so startled.

364
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,980
You must have gone through a lot, Oh Wol.

365
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,860
I spewed lies sometimes because of my lady,

366
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,200
but I have never stolen before.

367
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,880
So, I was scared out of my witsâ€”

368
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,240
Steal, you say? How dare youâ€”

369
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,440
Gab Seok, go take a look at Cheol Du to see if he is alive.

370
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,620
You must hurry, before she realizes the book was switched.

371
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,080
Does this book actually contain what you need?

372
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,680
Yes, including the ingredients for the antidote,

373
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,190
it also tells you how to make Zhen poison.

374
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:05,330
However, it does not say how much of each ingredient must go in.

375
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,870
So, I cannot figure out the mixing ratio for the antidote.

376
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,580
If you try out every single possible ratio you can think of ...

377
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,930
Why? Do you think it is too reckless?

378
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,800
That is not it.

379
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,620
To check if the ratio is correct and if it works as an antidote,

380
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,770
I will have to test each combination first.

381
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,330
But I cannot do those tests on His Majesty.

382
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:39,490
Gab Seok, go and bring Court Lady Oh.

383
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,660
Go inside.

384
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,510
I must borrow your rat.

385
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,280
I heard of the situation on the way.

386
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,110
I can provide you with all the rats you need, so please do not worry.

387
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,970
Thank you.

388
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,860
â™«  Like a perenially blooming flower also newly bloomsr  â™«

389
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,240
â™«  the flowers that bloom again eventually wither and bloom again  â™«

390
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,990
â™«   What is at the place where the bent branch is above fate?  â™«

391
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,870
â™«  I want to dive into the water  â™«

392
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,040
 Two 
â™«  where the bright light above is intensifying. As for me now  â™«

393
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,050
 One 

394
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,780
 Two  
 â™«  although I am about  â™«

395
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,370
 One 

396
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:00,400
â™«  to go somewhere   â™«

397
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,020
â™«  Our fate flows like running water  â™«

398
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,320
 Three 

399
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:12,240
â™«  You must follow the fate given to you  â™«

400
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,560
All the rats she brought died.

401
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,120
I will go outside and catch more rats.

402
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,100
No need.

403
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,580
You go and catch them.

404
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,290
Pardon?

405
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,070
By myself?

406
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,300
- I am going to go on a secret mission.
 - Pardon?

407
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,110
I already talked with the chief royal guard.

408
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,780
But for the maiden to go in and out of the Main Hall,

409
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,300
I need the head eunuch on our side as well.

410
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,660
 Jaseondang (Living Quarters of the Crown Prince) 

411
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,460
Perhaps you should have accompanied him.

412
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,420
What if he runs into trouble, being by himself?

413
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,950
He said that if I leave the crown prince's palace as well,

414
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:32,000
his absence would be too obvious. So what can I do?

415
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,230
I do not know about other people ...

416
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,410
but what if Grand Prince Do Seong comes?

417
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,610
That is why you need to do a good impression of His Highness!

418
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,430
Repeat after me.

419
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,540
"I would like to be alone, so leave."

420
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,600
- I would like to be alone, so leaveâ€”
 - Hey!

421
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,290
"I would like to be alone, so leave."

422
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,310
I would like to be alone, so leave.

423
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,770
Yes, Your Highness.

424
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,920
Please make everyone leave except you, Court Lady Kim.

425
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,560
I will become the crown prince and

426
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,170
marry Maiden Myeong Yun as well.

427
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,580
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

428
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,940
Does that matter?

429
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,790
I've made up my mind, isn't that all that matters?

430
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:20,250
I am asking because your mind changes easily, like fl your hand.

431
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,070
Are you saying you cannot trust me?

432
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:25,410
Yes, I cannot trust you.

433
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:31,020
I also cannot trust you until you prove

434
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,540
you will not betray us again.

435
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,650
Grand Prince Su Seong has already

436
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:44,620
prepared to mobilize the military for the unforeseen case.

437
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,280
The moment he sends word,

438
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,090
the chief military officer and the captain of the royal guard will mobilize their soldiers.

439
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,980
Is this still not enough?

440
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,690
Court Lady Seon Ok of the queen dowager's palace

441
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,570
is Grand Prince Su Seong's spy.

442
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,510
Have I proven myself now?

443
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,210
If that was enough,

444
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:26,720
please revoke Mother's confinement first.

445
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,310
Please go back.

446
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:51,210
You know you cannot meet anyone under confinement.

447
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,220
Move aside right now.

448
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,130
- Grand Prince!
 - Royal Mother.

449
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,620
Your Highness, please go inside.

450
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,480
I am afraid someone will see you!

451
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,250
Please wait just a bit.

452
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,330
Your confinement will be revoked soon.

453
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,250
I know you are saying it to console me,

454
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,730
but I am thankful and assured to hear you say that.

455
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,020
I did not say it just to console you.

456
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,360
I already got the promiseâ€”

457
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,820
What promise?

458
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,440
Grand Prince, did you make a deal with them or something?

459
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,170
I will ...

460
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,470
become the crown prince.

461
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,940
You cannot. That is one thing you cannot do!

462
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,050
Royal Mother, how can you do this to me?

463
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:53,040
Why are you saying I absolutely cannot be crown prince?

464
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,800
I am against it.

465
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,050
I have to see you become the crown prince against your will because of me.

466
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:04,980
I also hate to see the brothers fight for the position. I hate it all.

467
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,820
It is not because of you, Royal Mother.

468
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,630
I want to become the crown prince.

469
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,790
You also know His Majesty has chosen your older brother.

470
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,570
It does not matter.

471
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,360
I must become the crown prince

472
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,960
to rescue and protect you, Royal Mother.

473
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,740
Grand Prince.

474
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,160
 If you can make Do Seong the kingâ€” Or rather ... 

475
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,760
 If it means you can become the king's grandfather to grasp the power and control this nation, 

476
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,120
 you will harm my father without an ounce of guilt 

477
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,040
 whether your daughter becomes a widow or not. 

478
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,000
You cannot.

479
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,670
You cannot, Geonâ€”

480
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,360
Your Highness.

481
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,350
Your Highness, please calm down.

482
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,470
I must stop him.

483
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,620
The grand prince cannot become the crown prince.

484
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,360
You cannot do this.

485
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,970
Please calm down, Your Highness.

486
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,440
Where is Father?

487
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,160
You have made the right decision.

488
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,560
By the way, are you bothered by something?

489
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:01,950
In fact, Mother was vehemently opposed to the idea of me ever becoming the crown prince.

490
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,030
Could there be a reason I do not know about?

491
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,420
Just thinking about the queen dowager or Choi Sang Rok would make Her Highness furious.

492
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:20,130
She would not be happy to see you ally with them

493
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,460
and become the crown prince, would she?

494
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,630
It is quite likely as a reason, since those two have caused us a lot of suffering all this time.

495
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:32,570
Also, she could have said so because she was worried for Grand Prince Su Seong's safety.

496
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,600
I am also worried for Hyeong-nim's safety.

497
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:44,360
So, promise me you will not harm Hyeong-nim, even if I become the crown prince.

498
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,330
Of course, I promise you.

499
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:53,680
I will not lay a finger on Grand Prince Su Seong.

500
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,760
Do you truly ...

501
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,410
intend to keep Grand Prince Su Seong alive?

502
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:11,290
What kind of absurd question is that?

503
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,040
Of course, he will be killed.

504
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,090
Are you certain the head eunuch's family is held here?

505
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,130
Yes.

506
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:39,260
My master asked the grand merchant to confine them in his house and in return

507
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,360
granted him a monopoly on the cargo ships.

508
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,110
By the way, why did you come here yourself?

509
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,770
If they find out about who you are, my lady would be in danger, too.

510
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,910
If we move them without a plan and your master hears about it,

511
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,140
I need to be here to take care of the aftermath.

512
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,070
Anyhow, thank you for telling me.

513
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,260
Just be good to my lady.

514
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,830
If you ever betray and abandon my lady,

515
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,370
- I willâ€”
 - What?

516
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:14,020
Will you come to me wielding a sword or something?

517
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:19,260
I will have to treat your lady well, since you are so scary.

518
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,390
How are you doing, Grand Merchant?

519
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,740
He came out.

520
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,830
I think I found it.

521
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,310
They are all ledgers of accounts.

522
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,310
What is that?

523
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,280
It is a stylus.

524
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,380
Who goes there?

525
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,210
Get them.

526
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,370
Who are you rascals?

527
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,750
You would be shocked if I told you.

528
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,150
Y-Your Highness!

529
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:34,210
I heard the head eunuch's family is in your care.

530
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,780
Why are you not answering me?

531
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,590
You used a stylus to write all the details of your smuggling activity.

532
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,770
Do you want to deal with the Criminal Arresting Agency or the Royal Investigation Bureau?

533
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:57,050
Right. Since it is a smuggling activity, the Royal Investigation Bureau would be the most suitable.

534
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,580
I-I will go bring them right now.

535
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,500
What are you waiting for? Bring them here right now!

536
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,110
 Y-Yes! 

537
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,550
You just need to keep your mouth shut.

538
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:37,350
If you do, I will also overlook your years

539
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,920
of smuggling activity and tax evasion.

540
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:45,840
Thank you for your grace, Your Highness.

541
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,780
If you are so thankful, could I ask you for a favor?

542
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:57,910
Do you happen to deal in medicinal ingredients, too?

543
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:22,140
Everyone except Seon Ok may leave.

544
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,420
Make sure no one comes near.

545
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,840
Yes, Senior Court Lady.

546
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,420
It seems His Majesty will wake up soon.

547
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,530
Is that not a serious problem?

548
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,630
You just need to poison him again.

549
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:23,790
If you use more poison, he will never wake up again.

550
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:27,960
Are you saying he will not wake up or ...

551
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,280
that he may pass away?

552
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,540
He will pass away.

553
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,890
Let us use poison!

554
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,660
Are you mad? What if someone sees you in this broad daylight?

555
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,180
I must see His Highness right now. Hurry!

556
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,220
D-Did something happen?

557
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,060
Go back to the queen dowager's palace right now.

558
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,900
When do you think His Highness will return?

559
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,280
He said he will come back as soon as possible.

560
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,730
But I am not sure when he will be back.

561
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:25,550
We should wait for His Highnessâ€”

562
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:30,450
No, if something were to happen to His Majesty in the meantime,

563
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,490
it will remain a grave regret for us.

564
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:35,610
I must act by myself.

565
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:36,970
We will accompany you.

566
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:40,090
You two cannot leave the palace as well.

567
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,550
Until His Highness comes back,

568
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:48,230
the two of you keep a close eye on what those people do.

569
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,750
All the soldiers are on standby.

570
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,150
Once the chief military officer takes over the royal guard command and border defense council,

571
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,880
I will take over the three palace guards and open the palace gates.

572
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,920
You must strike all at once, so that

573
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,640
they don't have time to do anything.

574
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,470
Please do not worry, Your Excellency.

575
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:13,800
Remember that His Majesty's safety,

576
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,160
the royal family and the nation itself are in your hands.

577
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,090
 Yes! 

578
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,920
Dear heavens!

579
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,080
It was to cause a false alarm.

580
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,480
They are traitors who plotted rebellion!

581
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,590
Arrest them right away!

582
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,490
 Yes! 

583
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,850
Search.

584
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,570
 Yes! 

585
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,370
I found the proof of the treason,

586
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:56,250
Sabaltongmun.

587
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:01,500
 (Sabaltongmun:  A round robin - names were written in a circle to hide who signed first) 

588
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,520
Take these traitors and lock them up at the Royal Investigation Bureau right now!

589
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,300
 Yes! 

590
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,180
What will happen to His Excellency Munhyeong now?

591
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,400
Why are you asking me that?

592
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,280
He would not have him killed or something, right?

593
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,330
How would I know that?

594
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,220
 Your Highness. 

595
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,940
What is going on this late at night?

596
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,880
Your Highness, something terrible has happened.

597
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,530
Since we found the Sabaltongmun,

598
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:56,000
even Munhyeong will not be able to get out of it.

599
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,750
I am sure that is the case.

600
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:02,110
However, will Grand Prince Su Seong just sit back?

601
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,720
When his grandfather might die?

602
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:08,060
He cannot do much about it.

603
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,120
Seon Ok ...

604
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,750
That girl was found out.

605
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,110
Pardon? What are you saying out of nowhere?

606
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:21,990
They used Seon Ok to lay a trap.

607
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:29,830
How is the antidote coming along?

608
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:38,120
Why doesn't it even budge?

609
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,720
My Lady, this one must be dead too.

610
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,770
Is there some progress?

611
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,900
Welcome back.

612
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,500
It seems we need the correct mixing ratio.

613
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,790
Could you let me see the book?

614
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,720
Bring over the light.

615
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,910
 What is that? 

616
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,940
 It is a stylus. 

617
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,320
 1,000 pils* of silk from Ming Dynasty. 
(1 pil=12.255 square meters)

618
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,530
 Order first and pay later. 

619
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,380
Come closer.

620
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,630
Can you see it?

621
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:50,840
Pardon?

622
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,140
Look carefully.

623
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,650
 Three hobs* of kudzu powder and three cups of water 
 (1 hob=180.391 mL)  

624
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:10,630
Your Highness, I can see it!

625
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,560
My Lady!

626
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,550
This is a letter from your father.

627
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,450
You can read it.

628
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,710
I moved your family to a safe place.

629
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:24,430
Your Highness.

630
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:14,520
The grand prince Su Seong is inside.

631
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,620
 Shall I announce your arrival? 

632
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:26,970
Grand Prince Do Seong has arrived!

633
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,200
Tell him to come in.

634
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,790
Please enter.

635
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:57,750
Tell him to come in!

636
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,090
He went back.

637
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:07,580
Your Highness! Y-Your Highness, His Majesty hasâ€”

638
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,740
Father.

639
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,980
Can you see me?

640
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,970
Father.

641
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:19,850
I am Geon.

642
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:24,520
Can you recognize me?

643
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,650
Royal Father.

 Missing Crown Prince
 Preview  

651
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,160
 The inspector general has arrived at the Main Hall. 

652
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,860
 My father will realize right away that His Majesty is recovering, just by checking his pulse. 

653
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,750
 Please save my grandfather. 

654
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:40,120
 You know better than anyone that my grandfather is innocent. 

655
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,680
 Grand Prince Do Seong is more suitable to be the heir of this nation's throne 

656
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,930
 than Grand Prince Su Seong, who is involved in a sordid matter. 

657
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,920
 I shall appoint Grand Prince Do Seong as the crown prince. 

658
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,150
 Hence,  Grand Prince Su Seong is to leave the palace. 

659
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:53,960
 They are not traitors! 

660
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,860
â™«  I'm going to walk toward you  â™«
