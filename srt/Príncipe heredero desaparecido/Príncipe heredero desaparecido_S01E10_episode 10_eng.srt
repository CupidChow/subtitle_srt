00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,260
Please wake up.

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,870
Hurry. Please.

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,970
You have to escape, Your Highness!

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,200
The physician... Where is the physician?

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,170
Hurry up and bring me the physician!

16
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,480
What are you all doing?

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,960
Take Her Highness to safety right now!

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,610
Yun Yi Gyeom...

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,320
How dare you, you rascal, Yun Yi Gyeom!

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:31,040
Your Highness, it is all my fault for failing to check security.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,900
Please punish me.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Get him.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,430
Get him right now and—

24
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,470
Are you awake?

25
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,360
Physician! Physician!

26
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,220
Hurry up and tend to his wound first. Hurry!

27
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,910
 Episode 10 

28
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,160
Your Highness! Your Highness!

29
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,970
Do not mind me, and treat the wound first. Hurry.

30
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,900
Your Highness, you cannot be here. Please go to your palace.

31
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,590
What are you all doing? I told you to treat him first!

32
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,480
Your Highness.

33
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,930
Your Highness, please go to your palace.

34
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,980
You will hinder the treatment if you stay here.

35
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,360
Why is he not waking up?

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,900
He lost a lot of blood and passed out momentarily.

37
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,030
The wound is not deep, so please do not worry.

38
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,800
Your Highness, please put these on.

39
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,840
Yun Yi Gyeom.

40
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,590
What a rotten bastard.

41
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,770
Your Highness!

42
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,510
I will pay him back for sure.

43
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,960
Without fail.

44
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,240
I have never seen the queen dowager raise her voice like that.

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,110
Her eyes were so fierce as well!

46
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,100
She even made me scared.

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,260
That is why this is nonsense!

48
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,130
She needs to catch the culprit.

49
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,600
Why would she vent it out at me, who did nothing wrong?

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,910
That is because...

51
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,460
we all know you are the only one who would go after the queen dowager.

52
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,780
Oho! You better watch what you say here!

53
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,870
I said I do not know about this matter!

54
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,300
I mean, I am saying the queen dowager could think that way.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,660
Anyhow, since the queen dowager is furious now,

56
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,990
if things go wrong,

57
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:21,160
there might be a bloodbath before the crown prince investiture.

58
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,770
It really has nothing to do with you, right?

59
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,200
Oho! Why, you!

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,460
I will rest easy and tell the Criminal Arresting Agency to catch the culprit quickly.

61
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,040
W-Why, you—

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,660
He seems to be afraid after he went ahead and did it.

63
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,900
He should have done the job properly if he was going to do it.

64
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,370
- Your Excellency. 
 - Yes.

65
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,120
The grand prince wants to see you.

66
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,310
Whose doing is it?

67
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,170
It must be the remnants of the rebels—

68
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,700
Was it Grandfather?

69
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,110
I am asking you right now!

70
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,420
Was it Grandfather?

71
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,180
Has the Royal Clinic still not sent any word?

72
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,430
Yes, Your Highness.

73
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,880
- I must go to the Royal Clinic. 
 - Your Highness.

74
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,240
People are already talking about it.

75
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,010
Please consider waiting a bit more.

76
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,650
 Your Highness, Grand Prince Do Seong has arrived! 

77
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,800
Tell him to leave.

78
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,240
I told you to leave, did I not?

79
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,790
It is all my fault!

80
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,950
Please forgive me.

81
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,890
Do you think my wrath will be resolved just because you do this now?

82
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,000
Go back.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
I will make sure this never happens again!

84
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,740
It is too late.

85
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,610
The promise you made to me was already broken.

86
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,870
You can never perfectly restore an object that has been broken once.

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,320
I am sure you know better than anyone

88
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,840
the things I did to protect that one man.

89
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,760
However, I almost lost that man in front of my eyes.

90
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,430
How do you think I feel right now?

91
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,840
I am already holding myself back with all my strength...

92
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,450
not to drag Yun Yi Gyeom here and beat him to death!

93
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,150
If you understand, leave now.

94
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,960
What do I need to do?

95
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,340
Just pray the inspector general will survive.

96
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,960
I do not know what I will do if he does not make it.

97
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,230
Please help.

98
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,500
Her Highness' wrath has reached the heavens.

99
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,900
Nothing you say will be of use now—

100
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,860
The queen dowager does not want total destruction, either, does she?

101
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,560
Please help.

102
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,640
No one knows the queen dowager better than you do, Court Lady Kim.

103
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,310
Tell me how I can ease the queen dowager's anger even a bit.

104
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,960
In that case, why don't you go and bring...

105
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,610
the royal seal Her Majesty hid away?

106
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,050
You need to show at least that much effort

107
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:48,210
for me to even try talking to Her Highness.

108
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,250
 Curfew! 

109
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,200
 Curfew! 

110
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,050
 Curfew! 

111
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,690
 Curfew! 

112
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,210
 Curfew! 

113
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,950
 Curfew! 

114
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,770
 Curfew! 

115
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,650
Let's go.

116
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,390
Your Highness, please come this way.

117
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,430
I heard you two are Grandfather's students.

118
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,500
How did you meet him, when you belong to a different party?

119
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,960
I learned from him when he was at Sungkyunkwan.

120
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,620
Though we belong to different parties,

121
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,710
I served him as my teacher, for I had fallen for his noble character and academic discipline.

122
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,710
Though we do not make it obvious,

123
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,890
there are many others who follow him besides us.

124
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,320
There is a reason he is called His Excellency Munhyeong.

125
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,470
Excuse me. What does Munhyeong mean?

126
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,470
It's a scale that righteously measures a nation's academic disciplines.

127
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,400
It is a respectful nickname given to a person who has served in the highest positions

128
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,290
in Hongmunkwan, Yemunkwan, and Sunkyunkwan,

129
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,730
the three academic bodies of this country.

130
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,330
In one word, he is the best, huh?

131
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,770
Your Highness, did you know the crown prince investiture date has been set?

132
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,870
Even if you have the royal seal,

133
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,670
they cannot be stopped if you cannot clear your name.

134
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,960
Did you find a way to clear your name?

135
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,970
I do have an idea.

136
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,530
 I apologize for having you in such a lowly place, Your Highness. 

137
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,150
Not at all.

138
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,430
It is a great house, considering you got it secretly.

139
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,740
It is perfect for hiding.

140
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,890
More importantly, how is your health?

141
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,310
I am a lot better now, thanks to you.

142
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,600
All right.

143
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,080
Let's drink.

144
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,430
This is a rare five-flavor fruit syrup from Mungyeong.

145
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,300
I poured generously for your sake.

146
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,560
So do not waste even one drop.

147
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,960
Wouldn't it be of no use to you anyway?

148
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,860
There you go again.

149
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,850
It is good for your health, so drink it.

150
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,030
Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,390
Have you heard what is going on inside the palace?

152
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,600
I have been looking into the food taster,

153
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,150
but I have not found anything certain yet.

154
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,850
I apologize.

155
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,980
Not at all. Thank you for your work.

156
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,500
We were counting on you. What do we do now?

157
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,720
What do you mean? We just need to find a different way.

158
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,400
Well, the physician who treated me had gone to treat His Majesty.

159
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,820
Would you like to meet that physician and ask him about His Majesty's condition?

160
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,200
It seems you are planning to leave the capital.

161
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Since he found out what he should not,

162
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,590
running away is the way to a long life.

163
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,340
You are smarter than you look.

164
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,760
Do not be too afraid.

165
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,960
I will let you go if you answer a few questions.

166
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,610
Is it bothering you too much?

167
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,260
Her Highness the Queen Dowager must have been extremely shocked.

168
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,720
Have you sent her a word saying I am all right?

169
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,410
Yes.

170
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,670
You can take your leave now.

171
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,230
Yes.

172
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,620
Did you come to check if I lived or died?

173
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,290
I came because you seem to be the only one who can stop the queen dowager.

174
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,340
Why would I have to stop the queen dowager?

175
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,300
I can understand your anger, since you almost lost your life, but‍—

176
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,490
That is not it!

177
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,120
Physical wounds heal after some time.

178
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,390
I can easily forgive this, since I survived. However...

179
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,620
I can never forgive him for trying to kill the queen dowager.

180
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,550
If you want to save your grandfather's life,

181
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,440
make him resign from his position and leave the capital tomorrow.

182
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,520
How am I going to make Grandfather leave the capital?

183
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,310
Grandfather wouldn't obediently do as I say.

184
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,210
If you tell him what I am to tell you, word for word,

185
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,260
he will behave obediently as you say, Grand Prince.

186
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,790
Tell him I found the left state councillor's...

187
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:11,100
grandmother's slave documents.

188
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,530
Slave documents?

189
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,190
What are you talking about?

190
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:10,040
 Brother, what would you do at a time like this? 

191
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,410
 No physician ever uses poison without having the antidote. 

192
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,690
 If the culprit is a physician, I am sure he has the antidote. 

193
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,540
 I heard Choi Sang Rok has not left the palace and is being treated 

194
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,720
 at the Royal Clinic, because the queen dowager insisted. 

195
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:22,920
♫  The day we loved, the day we ached  ♫

196
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:30,580
♫  Even the day we exchanged harsh words  ♫

197
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:38,240
♫  The day the things got cloudy in the fog  ♫

198
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
 Your Highness... 

199
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,600
 in fact... I am... 

200
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,170
 Myeong Yun, the royal physician's daughter, 

201
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,050
 who was the cause of your kidnapping. 

202
00:18:54,050 --> 00:19:01,500
♫  I close my eyes again and take a deep breath  ♫

203
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:13,700
♫  Suddenly thinking of you your breath makes me relax  ♫

204
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,040
♫  so that I can fly away anywhere  ♫

205
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,300
♫  Into my frozen heart  ♫

206
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:33,720
♫  breathe life with your breath and mine  ♫

207
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,000
Orabeoni.

208
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,440
Why did you come here? I told you not to.

209
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,920
Did I make you worry a lot?

210
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,170
I thought I had lost you.

211
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,440
I was so scared.

212
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,760
Just consider you had a nightmare.

213
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,800
Where would I go without you?

214
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,000
Does it hurt a lot?

215
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,900
I was just exaggerating since you are here.

216
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,760
I am never...

217
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,410
going to let anyone harm you, Orabeoni.

218
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,440
You have been protecting me so far.

219
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,830
But from now on,

220
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,100
I am going to protect you.

221
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,150
The inspector general was injured.

222
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,780
So I will have to lead the meeting today.

223
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,210
First, I must restructure the cabinet.

224
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,100
Since the right state councilor resigned due to old age,

225
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
I will have the minister of defense, Lee Seung Jo, take his place

226
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,080
and the Deputy Minister of Justice will be the new Minister of Defense.

227
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,710
- Your Highness. 
 - I haven't finished talking yet.

228
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,700
The Chief Military Officer Jo Chang Eui is now the Inspector of Hamgyeong-do,

229
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,000
the Garrison Commander Park Han Yong is now the Envoy of Jeolla-do,

230
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,310
and the Chief Royal Guard Commander Kim Seok Cheol is now the Envoy of Gyeongsang-do.

231
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,380
The officials are to discuss their successors as soon as possible

232
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,680
and find the appropriate persons. Do you understand?

233
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,700
 Yes, Your Highness! 

234
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,900
Your Highness.

235
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,990
You may speak.

236
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:30,870
The positions mentioned today are all important offices related to this country's military power.

237
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:35,240
So, I deem it proper to decide gradually

238
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,450
after finding the successors first.

239
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,100
You may continue.

240
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,800
If the nation is to face a crisis,

241
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,300
it will be hard to defend if those positions are vacant.

242
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,620
- Please reconsider your decision. 
 -  Please reconsider your decision!

243
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,200
We already had a crisis, hadn't we?

244
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,520
Did you already forget I was ambushed and the inspector general was shot because of those officials' incompetence?

245
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,830
They should be thoroughly investigated to find whether they colluded with the traitors!

246
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,820
 Yes, Your Highness! 

247
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,480
When appointing their successors,

248
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,050
if anyone nominates because of personal relationships or for your party's interests,

249
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,780
I absolutely will not condone it. Do you understand?

250
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,770
 Yes, Your Highness! 

251
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,320
After going through the recent ordeal,

252
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,530
I could not sleep because I was worried about the royal family's lineage.

253
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,800
Hence, during the Grand Prince Do Seong's crown prince investiture,

254
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,180
the inspector general's daughter is to be made the crown princess.

255
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,900
Please prepare accordingly.

256
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,700
Your Highness.

257
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,000
The crown prince investiture and crown princess selection have never been done together.

258
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,120
True, it has never been done before.

259
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,900
But it does not mean it cannot be done.

260
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,850
Selecting the crown princess who will become this nation's mother in the future

261
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,300
should be decided with caution upon caution.

262
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,200
I also agree with the Censor Kim Dae Seung.

263
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,480
We have not even finished collecting the names of all marriageable women.

264
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,570
So I deem it proper to postpone the wedding.

265
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,410
Please reconsider your decision.

266
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,260
 Please reconsider your decision! 

267
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,800
She is the daughter of the

268
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,400
inspector general who saved His Majesty's life and mine.

269
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,600
Who could be more appropriate as the crown princess than her?

270
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,300
This is the royal family's marriage, so I will do as I wish.

271
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,310
- Your Highness! 
 - Enough!

272
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,550
I will not...

273
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,050
listen to any opposition.

274
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,450
Are your lips sealed?

275
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,370
I am asking why you did not side with me!

276
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,200
I told him to do that!

277
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,730
- Grand Prince! 
 - I must have a word with the left state councilor.

278
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:28,510
- Why did you tell the mayor— 
 - Because we have to save at least one man.

279
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,300
Had the mayor sided with you, even he would have been demoted.

280
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,940
I am sorry, but...

281
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,290
please resign and leave the capital.

282
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,590
What kind of...

283
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,400
Did Choi Sang Rok order you to do this?

284
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,280
- So, why did you pull something like that? 
 - Please wake up.

285
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,060
After you kick me out, you will be left all alone.

286
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:04,730
Do you think you will still have people to guard you after I leave?

287
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,100
No. No one will be on your side.

288
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,140
Are you on my side, Grandfather?

289
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,860
What kind of absurd question is that?

290
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,450
If I am not on your side, would I be on the queen dowager's or the inspector general's side?

291
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,310
In that case,

292
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,920
please step out for your grandson's sake.

293
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,560
Did they threaten you or something?

294
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,590
Yes!

295
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,500
Now, then.

296
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,580
I will assume that you will do as I said.

297
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,500
What do you think you could do alone?

298
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,900
I saved Her Highness the Queen from deposition when His Majesty collapsed.

299
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,500
I also made you the crown prince!

300
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,000
How can you not know you are nothing without me, Grand Prince?

301
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,220
Yes.

302
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,830
Everything you said might be right. However...

303
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,490
Still...

304
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,370
this is better than having the world know our family stems from a bastard child!

305
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,800
After I become the king,

306
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,730
I will call you back again.

307
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,710
So please wait until then.

308
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,220
The proof that I am a bastard child!

309
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,850
We just need to find and get rid of that proof.

310
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,460
After all he has done to you,

311
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,800
do you still think Choi Sang Rok is easy prey?

312
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,800
Your Highness, after I resign,

313
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,620
you have to know the grand prince's crown prince investiture can be voided as well.

314
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,950
Please keep in mind your father is the only one who can make

315
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,430
the grand prince the crown prince and eventually the king.

316
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,730
I have never once wanted the Grand Prince Do Seong

317
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,850
-  to become the crown prince or the king. 
 - Your Highness.

318
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,220
The grand prince must become the crown prince and take the throne

319
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,680
in order for you to survive.

320
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,370
I know what you mean.

321
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:54,110
However, I do not have the power to convince the grand prince.

322
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,330
Please do as the grand prince says.

323
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,690
At least, let me stay until the crown prince investiture, then—

324
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,920
That matter is not up to me to decide, either.

325
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,290
Please leave now.

326
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,290
 Yun Yi Gyeom has resigned and left the palace. 

327
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,060
It seems that Grand Prince Do Seong convinced him.

328
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,150
Did you notify Myeong Yun?

329
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,020
Yes.

330
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,090
She should have entered the palace by now.

331
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,420
Mother, now is the time to avoid the rain.

332
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,940
Once this rain stops,

333
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,290
I will bring Grandfather back to the palace,

334
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,980
so please do not be worried.

335
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,950
Do not worry about me, Grand Prince.

336
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,630
I am actually relieved now.

337
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,120
I have a heavy heart as his daughter,

338
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,130
but on the other hand, I feel fortunate that I won't have to worry

339
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,510
about His Majesty, even if you become the crown prince,

340
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,900
once Father leaves the capital.

341
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,830
What do you mean by that?

342
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,870
It is nothing.

343
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,930
It is just— Father has been on their side all of this time

344
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,210
and gave you and me a hard time.

345
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,200
So, I am saying things will become a bit easier if Father is not here.

346
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,630
That is what I meant to say.

347
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,350
 Your Majesty, this is Court Lady Jo. 

348
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,270
Come in.

349
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,620
The inspector general's daughter has entered the palace.

350
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,180
Maiden Myeong Yun?

351
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,650
Yes.

352
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,690
I personally saw her arrive at the Royal Clinic.

353
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,770
I am not sure whether that girl entered the palace knowing everything already.

354
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,850
That the wedding was moved up and will take place during the crown prince's investiture.

355
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,310
Did Oh Wol come with you?

356
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,740
Yes, she is waiting outside.

357
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,440
But why did you ask Oh Wol to come with me as well?

358
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:42,190
Because I figured you would need Oh Wol by your side to feel at ease.

359
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,840
On the day of the crown prince's investiture,

360
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,400
you will be wedded to the crown prince as well.

361
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,340
Keep that in mind and start preparing while residing at the Royal Clinic.

362
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,360
- Father. 
 - This is the queen dowager's order.

363
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,370
I guess this is the place.

364
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,230
All right, then.

365
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,620
Was it an unused room?

366
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,010
It smells musty.

367
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,510
Let me see.

368
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,180
You should have said you would go back and forth from home, even if it is troublesome.

369
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,690
This room is a bit...

370
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,960
It is better than a prison cell, right?

371
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,510
Pardon? A prison cell?

372
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,850
So, you are not here to take care of the master, but he locked you up?

373
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,400
Why?

374
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,680
Because I might run away.

375
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:36,510
My Lady, what did you do wrong this time?

376
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,720
The left state councillor resigned?

377
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,200
Yes, Your Highness.

378
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,900
It's even rumored that he will leave the capital soon.

379
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,270
And that is not all.

380
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,360
The left state councillor's men who had the military power were all let go.

381
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,670
They were all demoted to powerless positions or sent to the countryside.

382
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:05,830
On top of that, she said the crown prince's investiture and the wedding are to be held together.

383
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,250
- Oh my! 
 - I don't understand the rush.

384
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,210
Who is he going to marry?

385
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:14,000
It is Inspector General Choi Sang Rok's daughter.

386
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,110
After all they have done,

387
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,800
they will even bind the grand prince with a marriage?

388
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,100
Geez, such rotten bastards!

389
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,410
I wonder what His Highness the Grand Prince was thinking when he accepted the marriage.

390
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:41,070
I am sure Do Seong did not want this marriage, either.

391
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,610
We might even see Baek Gu in the palace later.

392
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,230
We have to stop it somehow.

393
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,990
What is Sang Su even doing?

394
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,860
 Your Highness, this is Sang Su! 

395
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,120
My goodness!

396
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,080
Come inside.

397
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,480
Greet His Highness first.

398
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,060
You may sit.

399
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:32,820
Your Highness, this is Court Lady Seon Ok of the queen dowager's palace.

400
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,770
You are the one who notified me about Buyong Pavilion, huh?

401
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,190
Yes, Your Highness.

402
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,180
 Buyong Pavilion. Between 9:00 and 11:00 at night. 

403
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,850
You mustered great courage.

404
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:56,420
I just felt terrible about Jong Geum's death.

405
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,180
Anyhow, what brings you all the way here?

406
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,890
I was eavesdropping on the queen dowager's palace

407
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,710
and I heard the Main Hall's food taster was alive.

408
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,260
Are you certain?

409
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,810
Yes.

410
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,990
I don't know where she is, but she is certainly alive.

411
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,420
- Let us go. 
 - Go where?

412
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,060
We need to meet the food taster.

413
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,000
 Court Lady Yun 

414
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,710
Shovel.

415
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,870
This late at night? The frozen soil?

416
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,660
Would you rather shovel a grave during the day?

417
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,480
What about you?

418
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,750
I will hold the light so you can shovel.

419
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,900
You can be the crown prince if you think it unfair.

420
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,050
Please put your back into it.

421
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,970
The dawn will break at this rate.

422
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,500
Shut your mouth and keep quiet.

423
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,940
The food taster is alive, for sure.

424
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,070
How did they make it past the palace gates with an empty coffin?

425
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,900
How much does a coffin like this one cost?

426
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,110
Well, it depends on the type of coffin.

427
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,280
If you need a coffin, you can ask my superintendent—

428
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,690
He is a captain of the Criminal Arresting Agency.

429
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,470
Have you worked at the Gwihuseo   (Coffin Section of the Ministry of Rites)  for a long time?

430
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,570
Oh, yes. I worked at the Gwihuseo my whole life.

431
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,870
You must know everything about coffins, then. 
  (Gwihuseo: an agency that made coffins and funeral goods under the Ministry of Rites) 

432
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,950
Yes, that is surely true.

433
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:30,130
If you were to disguise a living person as dead and sneak them out of the palace,

434
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,680
how would you do it?

435
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,000
Why are you suddenly asking me such a question?

436
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,930
Oho! He has his reasons, so hurry up and answer him!

437
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,920
Oh, y-yes.

438
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,770
I do not think it would be that hard.

439
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,510
 Your Majesty! Is anyone out there? Your Majesty! 

440
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,410
 - Court Lady! Court Lady! 
 - Court Lady! 

441
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,560
After moving the person pretending to be dead,

442
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,170
you would first lay the live person inside the empty coffin.

443
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,990
And then place a wooden board over that person.

444
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,690
Then, you could place a corpse on top of the board.

445
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,830
 Halt! 

446
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,900
No one cares about the size or the weight of coffins.

447
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:23,780
So, they would not catch it even if the coffin had two compartments.

448
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,230
   

449
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,630
Father.

450
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,750
Please wake up.

451
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:33,540
We need you to wake up to resolve everything.

452
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,780
How can you be lying in bed like this?

453
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,640
Father.

454
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,730
Are you listening to me?

455
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:48,280
Brother, whom you cherish dearly, was arrested again.

456
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,380
And they are telling me...

457
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,180
to become the crown prince in Brother's place.

458
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,940
I...

459
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,860
cannot do anything about this anymore.

460
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,100
Please help me.

461
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:31,490
Father, please stop sleeping and open your eyes now! Father...

462
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,410
Please...

463
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,320
Father.

464
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,930
Father, please.

465
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,410
Please open your eyes.

466
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,840
Father.

467
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,240
- You must go to the Royal Clinic. 
 - Yes.

468
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,590
If Choi Sang Rok's daughter is there,

469
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,080
deliver my words secretly.

470
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,480
I heard the food taster was born in Hanyang and was an orphan.

471
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,370
So, even if she left her home, she must still be hiding inside the capital.

472
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:23,250
I agree with you.

473
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,090
But we cannot look everywhere in our situation.

474
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,770
The investiture is tomorrow. What do we do?

475
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,500
We wouldn't be able to find the food taster in hiding even if we had people out looking for her.

476
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:42,250
If we look for her while hiding ourselves like this, one year might not be enough, let alone a day.

477
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,050
It cannot be helped.

478
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:47,930
I will have to ask the one who can look for her openly.

479
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:51,230
The one who can look for her openly?

480
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,000
Who is that?

481
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:10,400
I know it is not proper to see you this late at night,

482
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,700
but thank you for coming out.

483
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,380
Not at all.

484
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,540
I also came because I have something to tell you.

485
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,700
You can go ahead.

486
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,960
Grand Prince,

487
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,300
I cannot marry you.

488
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,780
I assume you already know what happened between

489
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,220
the crown prince and me due to the kidnapping.

490
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,500
You are right.

491
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,430
So, how are you trying to make me the crown princess?

492
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,140
Do you really not know?

493
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,350
The reason why I accepted this marriage?

494
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,420
I know.

495
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,720
However, I am a criminal.

496
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,160
The crown prince ended up that way because of me.

497
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,440
How can I become the crown princess?

498
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,290
 Fortunately, she does not know about her father and the queen dowager. 

499
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:04,030
It is shameless of me, but please understand my reason for this

500
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:10,070
and I would like you to stop this marriage, Grand Prince.

501
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:14,470
I do not intend to marry you, either, Maiden.

502
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,370
Of course, it is not because I do not like you.

503
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:25,360
I had feelings for you long before you were chosen as the crown princess.

504
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,900
And those feelings have not changed to this day.

505
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:37,220
However, I do not have the slightest wish to force you to be mine.

506
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:42,030
If I am to marry you, I want to proudly greet you as my wife

507
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:46,090
after I have gained your heart.

508
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,040
In that case, why did you want to see me?

509
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,380
I don't know when Father can be in a critical condition again.

510
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,310
So I wanted to ask for your help.

511
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,630
Is His Majesty fighting an illness?

512
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,440
Did you not know?

513
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,690
Did the royal physician not tell you anything?

514
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,560
He does not speak of any palace-related matters at home.

515
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,230
Please go ahead.

516
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:18,270
I will do my best to help if it is something I can do.

517
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,510
To be honest,

518
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,270
Father has been poisoned.

519
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,600
And Brother was falsely accused of it.

520
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:46,790
Maiden.

521
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,980
- Yes. 
 - I want to find out what poison was used on Father.

522
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,440
For such a matter, there is the Royal Clinic

523
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,610
and my father. So why are you asking me?

524
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,050
No one...

525
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:03,310
wants Father to wake up.

526
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,550
Your father is not proactive, since he wants me

527
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,560
to become the crown prince,  after what happened between him and Brother.

528
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,560
Other royal physicians are also laying low because of what is going on inside the palace.

529
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:21,950
Maiden, please help.

530
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,270
It is killing me every day to think of Father.

531
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,640
I apologize, but I am not a physician.

532
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,330
This seems to be beyond my ability.

533
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:46,000
Brother told me that you are better than most physicians.

534
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,500
I only helped his wound recover well.

535
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,870
I know it was not a light wound.

536
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,720
Brother also said he might have died if it was not for you.

537
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,070
And I agree with him.

538
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,560
Thank you for your compliment.

539
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,750
But my medical skills are the small things I learned from watching my father.

540
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,100
Is there anything you know about poison?

541
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,140
I learned a bit about a few of the poisons my father uses.

542
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,790
It might be one of those few, right?

543
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,730
- However— 
 - Brother was arrested in Mungyeong

544
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,280
and is being transferred right now.

545
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:27,720
Father must wake up in order for Brother to live.

546
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,830
If Father wakes up, Brother's name will be cleared.

547
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:37,520
And if his name is cleared and reinstated as the crown prince, you do not...

548
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,720
have to marry me, either, Maiden.

549
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,240
W-Who are you?

550
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,220
It's been a long time, Your Excellency.

551
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:28,120
Did you... come to kill me?

552
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,950
I came because I have a request.

553
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,340
 Slave Documents 

554
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,710
 Slave Documents 

555
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,310
This is my bribe.

556
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:57,830
I am sure you will be satisfied.

557
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,400
 Brother was arrested in Mungyeong and is being transferred right now. 

558
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,130
 Father must wake up in order for Brother to live. 

559
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,810
Can we trust her?

560
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,190
Her father is the one who poisoned His Majesty.

561
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,960
It bothers me how she willingly agreed to help.

562
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,160
She did not seem to know it was her father's doing.

563
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,830
So, I did not tell her, either.

564
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,500
You did well.

565
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,890
However, she is not even an official physician.

566
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,920
Will she be of any help?

567
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,330
If they find out about this, you might be in trouble, too.

568
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,600
She said she learned about poisons from her father.

569
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,480
She might recognize the poison her father used.

570
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,960
If she finds out anything, even if it may be a small thing,

571
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,030
it would be of some help.

572
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,030
I understand.

573
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:12,210
By the way, I can stop other people from entering.

574
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,310
But the head eunuch is...

575
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:27,900
Head Eunuch, I have a favor to ask of you.

576
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,930
I am undeserving of such words.

577
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,310
Please give the order.

578
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:14,430
Where are you going this late at night?

579
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,240
I must make a visit to the Main Hall.

580
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:22,570
Due to my condition, I could not check on His Majesty for a few days.

581
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:26,110
I replaced the moxibustion at the right times.

582
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:29,400
Please resume your work tomorrow.

583
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,660
It is fine.

584
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,760
I will be back.

585
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:40,670
 Your Majesty, the inspector general has arrived! 

586
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,490
Why are you...

587
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,430
trying to deceive me?

588
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,650
Please open your eyes, Your Majesty.

589
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,160
You woke up too early.

590
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,950
You will have to sleep a bit longer, Your Majesty.

 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview 

596
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:57,020
 Was my father the one who poisoned His Majesty? 

597
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,900
 I am trying to press on this marriage because of the grand prince's character. 

598
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,410
 - Why isn't he here yet?  
  - He will come for sure. 

599
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,150
 If Your Highness is gone, 

600
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:08,980
 Grand Prince Do Seong will become the king, whether he wants to or not. 

601
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:12,060
 She is proclaimed as crown princess! 

602
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,940
 Stop! 

603
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,970
 Brother is back!

01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:19,560
 These are all fake!
