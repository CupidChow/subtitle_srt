 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts.  

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,130
 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines.

 Episode 12 

12
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:10,840
Wait, why... did you come alone?

13
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,110
What about Her Highness?

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,640
I just escorted Her Highness to the queen dowager's palace.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,860
The queen dowager's palace?

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,200
Did I not tell you to at least take Her Highness there if I do not make it?

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,710
She said she will never leave without you, Master.

18
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,380
What kind of rude act is this?

19
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,970
I am still this country's queen dowager!

20
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,950
Mind your manners!

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,020
You should have left with Her Highness.

22
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,280
I could not find Myeong Yun.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,980
Nothing will happen to Her Ladyship right now.

24
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,970
I was staying in the palace, so you should have

25
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,140
trusted me and taken Her Highness away first.

26
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,760
I apologize.

27
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,700
I understand how you cannot just leave without your child,

28
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,090
but I am thinking about Her Highness, who returned to her death voluntarily...

29
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,880
I am sorry.

30
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:21,020
Her Highness wishes to spend just tonight with you, Inspector General.

31
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,310
Please head to the queen dowager's palace.

32
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,880
It is not the time yet. I have to stop by somewhere.

33
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,760
Are you saying there is still a way?

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,040
I did not even fathom that I could go this far just moments ago.

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,100
If I succeed, Su Ryeon will be safe.

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,170
Please tell her I am leaving Myeong Yun in her care.

37
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,170
She is not here? What do you mean by that?

38
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:09,690
She disappeared in the short time I was gone to the latrine.

39
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,220
Are you sure your master did not take her secretly?

40
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,300
That might also be the case.

41
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,880
Oho! You'd better speak the truth.

42
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,670
T-That seems to be the case.

43
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,860
 If you will only let Myeong Yun escape the palace safely— 

44
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,510
 If I do, will you hand over the antidote? 

45
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,840
 After Myeong Yun leaves the palace safely, 

46
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,430
 yes, I will give it to you. 

47
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,290
It is a bit chaotic inside the palace right now.

48
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,140
Let us have you hide here just until things settle down.

49
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,350
- Your Highness. 
 - Right now,

50
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,920
I have too many things to think about and my head is about to explode.

51
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,780
Please help me out, Maiden.

52
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,480
 Your Highness. 

53
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,590
Come in.

54
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,980
Get changed first.

55
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,790
What on earth are you planning to do?

56
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,790
That woman is Choi Sang Rok's daughter.

57
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,010
I plan to hide her tonight for now

58
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,250
and find a way to send her out of the palace tomorrow.

59
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,190
Go tell Sang Su to prepare bedding for one person.

60
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,360
Yes.

61
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,800
 The fates have become twisted. 

62
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,930
 If the crown prince lives, your daughter dies. 

63
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,680
 If your daughter lives, the crown prince dies. 

64
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,090
 What brings you here, Inspector General? 

65
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,510
Outside. Let us go outside and talk.

66
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,300
Do you think this matter will be forgotten with my death?

67
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,430
It does not matter.

68
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,650
I will take the blame for everything.

69
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,730
I will not ask for your forgiveness.

70
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,020
Father.

71
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,220
- Maiden. 
 - Stab me instead. Father, please.

72
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,570
Kill me instead.

73
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,420
Maiden.

74
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,630
- Step aside. 
 - Move aside.

75
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,350
Stab me first.

76
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,190
You will not lay a finger on His Highness before you stab me first.

77
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,290
Nothing will change with my death.

78
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,040
Even if I die, Do Seong will not forgive you two.

79
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,390
If Your Highness is gone,

80
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,200
Grand Prince Do Seong will become the king whether he wants to or not.

81
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,920
And my Myeong Yun will be safe.

82
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,400
 Your Highness, this is Gab Seok. 

83
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,360
 Your Highness. 

84
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,290
 Your Highness. 

85
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,790
Come in.

86
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,160
If you have nothing more to say, go back now.

87
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,110
What is going on?

88
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,230
It is nothing serious.

89
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,190
Did you tell him to prepare the bedding?

90
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,870
Y-Yes, I told Sang Su, so it will be ready soon.

91
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:52,100
Please... wait for a moment.

92
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,330
 Do you think this matter will be forgotten with my death? 

93
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:39,380
 Grand Prince Do Seong will become the king whether he wants to or not. 

94
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,340
 And my Myeong Yun will be safe. 

95
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,070
The crown prince almost died trying to save Her Ladyship.

96
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,590
But he still nursed her all night by her side.

97
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,520
Did you not say he thought you were Myeong Yun at that time?

98
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,400
Yes, that is why I also thought it was a bit weird.

99
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,700
It should not matter to him what happens to a mere servant girl.

100
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,820
But he always took good care of Her Ladyship.

101
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,420
 He did not take her hostage. 

102
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,580
 The crown prince also had feelings for Myeong Yun. 

103
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,340
By the way, what about My Lady?

104
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,580
Go tell Mu Baek I need him urgently.

105
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,120
Ajae Mu Baek!

106
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,950
M-Master needs you urgently.

107
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,720
The palace is so big.

108
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,460
It took such a long time trying to find you.

109
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,300
Are you not even worried about Her Ladyship?

110
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,750
We don't even know where she is right now.

111
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,760
I was told she is at the crown prince's palace.

112
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,220
The crown prince's palace?

113
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,940
Please send me back to Yanghwadang.

114
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,450
If Your Highness gets harmed again because of me—

115
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,150
Your father came without knowing you were here.

116
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,640
So, what happened earlier has no connection to you being here.

117
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,010
Even if it is not about my father,

118
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,660
you are hiding me here because others should not know I am here.

119
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,500
I am a traitor's daughter.

120
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,580
I am not worthy to be protected at the risk of danger for you.

121
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,930
Please let me go.

122
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:10,460
I meant it when I said I do not wish harm on you.

123
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,770
So, unless you want to make me waver and suffer,

124
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,780
please stop it now.

125
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,570
How can I dare? Please do not.

126
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,420
At this rate, I feel like I will commit a bigger crime against you.

127
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,350
I am requesting this out of fear.

128
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,750
Please understand me.

129
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:36,520
It will be harder for me to handle if you leave here and are harmed.

130
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,660
So, could you be the one to understand me, please?

131
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,740
Do not think about a thing today, and just rest.

132
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,720
 Brother, I am here. 

133
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,230
Your Highness, please do not say anything to the grand prince.

134
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,290
 Brother, this is Do Seong! 

135
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,310
Come in.

136
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,810
You did not forget, right?

137
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,840
I do not even know when we last had a drink together like this.

138
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,420
Yes, our last time was when we went to that courtesan house together.

139
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,170
Yes, it has been ages.

140
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,910
I already let the kitchen know.

141
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,440
 So, they will send in the food and drinks soon. 

142
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,670
I think people will be coming in and out of this room all night.

143
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,650
Let us drink in your room.

144
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,560
 Sure. We can do that. 

145
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,380
This is a food taster sent by His Excellency Munhyeong.

146
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,380
She used to work as a tea server, so she is familiar with poison.

147
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,280
I am Court Lady Oh.

148
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,260
I was ordered by His Excellency Munhyeong—

149
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,780
We understand, so hurry up and inspect.

150
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,620
What is that?

151
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,220
It's a rat.

152
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,160
- A rat? 
 - Yes.

153
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,480
Get it away from me right now!

154
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,070
Do not be scared. You can raise your head.

155
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,030
A rat once got in his pants while playing when he was young.

156
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,590
So, he is afraid of rats.

157
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,470
That was all because of you, Brother!

158
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,020
Are you feeding the rat to be wary of poison that builds in your body?

159
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,890
Yes, Your Highness.

160
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,710
It is quickly noticeable because they are such small animals.

161
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,770
I understand, so hurry up and finish.

162
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,680
The sun will rise before I can even smell some alcohol at this rate.

163
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,720
The Grand Prince seems to be quite thirsty for alcohol, so hurry it up.

164
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,910
- We must kill her. 
 - Father!

165
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,550
For you and Grand Prince Do Seong to live, the food taster must be killed.

166
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,380
If the food taster opens her mouth,

167
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,230
both you and Grand Prince Do Seong will die.

168
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,580
No one can defend the two of you.

169
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,330
The crown prince will defend us.

170
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,600
- I trust the crown prince. 
 - In your dreams!

171
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,820
Munhyeong is intently watching everything,

172
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,650
so how will the crown prince defend you?

173
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,770
I am well aware of His Excellency Munhyeong's character.

174
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,970
I am sure he will bring everything to light in a righteous way.

175
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,320
You are being so foolish.

176
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,100
Do you think Munhyeong will be any different from this old man?

177
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,500
In the same way as I am ready to do anything for the grand prince, who is my grandson,

178
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,310
Munhyeong will also try to get rid

179
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:34,970
of Grand Prince Do Seong for his grandson, the crown prince.

180
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,060
 No matter what you say, 

181
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,980
I do not have the power to silence the food taster.

182
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,520
The chief royal guard will surely listen to you.

183
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,600
Hence, convince the chief royal guard to open up the way to the prison cells.

184
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,810
How can you ask your child to help you with murder?

185
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,240
- I cannot do that. 
 - If you just open up the way,

186
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,830
I will take care of everything else—

187
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,320
Please stop! I do not want to hear any more of it.

188
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,510
Your Royal Highness, do you truly want to lose Grand Prince Do Seong?

189
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,980
I said I trust the crown prince!

190
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,400
- Your Highness! 
 - It is late into the night.

191
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,640
Please leave.

192
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,420
You heard it all, right?

193
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,660
Follow me.

194
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:05,250
Even if the crown prince were to protect Her Highness and Grand Prince Do Seong,

195
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,670
I am sure you know better that he cannot protect you also.

196
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,170
I only did... as I was ordered by Your Excellency.

197
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,040
How foolish.

198
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,860
Don't you realize you will be the one to be sacrificed

199
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,780
the moment you run your mouth the wrong way?

200
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,450
For the crown prince to save Her Highness the Queen or the grand prince,

201
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,270
he will need a scapegoat who will die in their place.

202
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,020
Who would be better suited for this role than you?

203
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,710
I am saying you will eventually die

204
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:48,580
after a long torture, no matter what you claim.

205
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,980
Your Excellency!

206
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,000
What are you still doing here at this late hour?

207
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,920
How can I leave the palace in this situation?

208
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,310
His Excellency Munhyeong's men seem ready to stay up all night at the Conference Hall!

209
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,510
How did things go with Her Royal Highness?

210
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,860
Don't you know if the sun rises like this, everything will be over?

211
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,470
Just wait.

212
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,990
I cast my final hand already.

213
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,950
There.

214
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,900
Are you that happy?

215
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,870
Of course, I am.

216
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,160
I thought you were arrested,

217
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,380
so when I saw you entering the courtyard, I thought I was dreaming.

218
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,240
If it was not for me, you could have become the crown prince.

219
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,970
Did that not upset you?

220
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,610
Not at all.

221
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,310
I felt so relieved, as if I had lost a bad tooth.

222
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,820
As if that could be.

223
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,260
Do you know how far I went to avoid—

224
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,710
becoming the crown prince?

225
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,960
I heard you even did a sword dance.

226
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,880
You can't even make your shoulders dance.

227
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,440
How comical it must have been to see you jump up and down.

228
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,780
I regret missing such a rare sight.

229
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,360
Well, then.

230
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,910
Should I show you right now?

231
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,520
Do you mean it?

232
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,140
- Let me see it, then. 
 - Yes!

233
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,420
Look closely.

234
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,370
You will be witnessing Joseon's best sword dance.

235
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,700
It is coming!

236
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,870
Yes, it is coming! It is almost here.

237
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
There it comes!

238
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,600
Forget it.

239
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,270
- I am losing my appetite. 
 - No, just watch a bit longer.

240
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,870
Relax your wrists a bit.

241
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,050
My wrists?

242
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,000
Like this.

243
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,150
Your wrists are too stiff.

244
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,640
If the food taster opens her mouth,

245
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,580
even the grand prince will not be safe.

246
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,590
For the grand prince's sake, you must silence the food taster somehow.

247
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,250
Father already spent two hours talking to me about the same thing.

248
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,610
Leave now.

249
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,490
Your Highness,

250
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,430
why was the grand prince Gwang Chang put to death?

251
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,990
I heard the ousted king opposed it to the end as well.

252
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,800
However, in the end, he died vomiting blood at such a young age.

253
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,140
Your Highness, you must remember Grand Prince Gwang Chang

254
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,360
was just as innocent as Grand Prince Do Seong.

255
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,920
Just as those trying to take down the queen dowager killed the grand prince Gwang Chang,

256
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,030
Grand Prince Do Seong can also—

257
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,030
- I do not want to hear it! 
 - Your Highness.

258
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:03,570
If the food taster opens her mouth, the grand prince will die for sure.

259
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,500
Grand Prince Do Seong must die

260
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,130
for the deposed crown prince to be reinstated and ascend to the throne.

261
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,420
Do you truly wish to die?

262
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,230
I said I did not want to hear it!

263
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,730
If it means I can protect you and Grand Prince Do Seong,

264
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,520
I am willing to die a thousand times over.

265
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,020
Please reconsider.

266
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,280
Leave me alone, please.

267
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,250
Is it really right to do this?

268
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,730
Of course, it is not right.

269
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,550
It isn't right, but what can we do?

270
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,670
They really are the best brothers in the whole of Joseon.

271
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,810
Right, regarding Maiden Myeong Yun,

272
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,830
I think her father already got her out.

273
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,980
Oh, really?

274
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:09,520
Yes, so I think you can rest assured about Maiden Myeong Yun.

275
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,070
He got her out of Yanghwadang, which is so closely guarded.

276
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,180
I am sure he will get her out of the palace somehow.

277
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,740
I am glad.

278
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,870
 Your Highness, please do not say anything to the grand prince. 

279
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,040
Pour me one more drink.

280
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,030
Oh, yes.

281
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,610
You have become a better drinker.

282
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,820
I should be saying that, right?

283
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,360
Have you been drinking all the time you were gone?

284
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,890
I was always a good drinker. I just did not drink.

285
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,140
- You could not drink. 
 - I said I chose not to drink.

286
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,490
Sure thing. I will let you be the winner just for tonight.

287
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,100
You will let me?

288
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,150
Fine. I will let you get a beating from me today.

289
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,810
With your skills?

290
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,220
Let me see you take a strike.

291
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,670
Why you little...!

292
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,500
Here I go.

293
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,760
Seriously?

294
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,620
- Barley. 
 - B-Barley? 
  (A children's game called Rice-Barley-Rice.) 

295
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,880
Barley. Rice! Rice!

296
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,740
Barley, Barley, Barley, Rice—

297
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,380
I got you! I got it.

298
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,220
It is my turn now.

299
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,160
Prepare yourself.

300
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,610
- Here I go. 
 - Calm down.

301
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,530
Calm down for what? Hurry up and prepare yourself.

302
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,070
I think I am a bit drunk.

303
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,900
I am actually a light drinker.

304
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,920
There is nothing like barley for when you are drunk, Brother.

305
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,720
I will give you some barley.

306
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,700
Wait.

307
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,510
Barley! Barley! Barley, Barley, Barley!

308
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,110
 Rice! Rice! Barley. 

309
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,930
 Please excuse me. 

310
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,150
If you will step out for a second, I will lay your bedding for you.

311
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,590
How can you show your dislike for her so noticeably?

312
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,150
Just do your job right.

313
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,480
Make sure no one can come in.

314
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,550
Especially people from Choi Sang Rok's household.

315
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,270
The guy who follows around like a bodyguard and the servant girl—

316
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,140
Gosh! She was only a servant girl but acted like the lady.

317
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,860
How dare she forget her place?

318
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,730
Wait until I see her.

319
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,040
I will make sure to beat some sense—

320
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,050
Please lower your voice. She will hear you.

321
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,080
 Did I say something I cannot say? 

322
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,490
 Anyhow, if anyone finds out she is hiding here, 

323
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,360
 His Highness will be in big trouble. 

324
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,500
 Make sure no one comes near the crown prince's palace. Understand? 

325
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,270
 Yes. 

326
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,780
 I will take the blame for all crimes. 

327
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,720
 Hence, just let the queen dowager... 

328
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,160
 Once I confirm the queen dowager's safety, 

329
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,340
 the antidote will be delivered to you, Your Highness. 

330
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,580
- This is Mu Baek. 
  - Come in. 

331
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,850
Deliver this to the crown prince first thing in the morning.

332
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,280
And leave the palace with Oh Wol right after.

333
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,510
Pardon? What about Her Ladyship?

334
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,390
Wait outside the palace and

335
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,050
the moment Myeong Yun gets out of the palace,

336
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,400
go far away with her as well.

337
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,330
When you find a place to settle down,

338
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,570
use this as a foundation to do anything you want.

339
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:42,500
You will still have enough for that after finding a place to live.

340
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,610
What if Her Ladyship fails to get out of the palace?

341
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,830
Her Ladyship cannot escape on her own. I will—

342
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,030
Just deliver the letter making no mistakes.

343
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,500
Please forgive me for failing...

344
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,630
to serve you to the end.

345
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,470
Not at all.

346
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,920
Without you, Court Lady Kim,

347
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,720
Su Ryeon and I would not have been able to make it this far.

348
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,690
Thank you.

349
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:20,020
I will repay you in my next life if I can.

350
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,740
It was a great honor...

351
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,430
to have served you...

352
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,960
Young Master.

353
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,280
Even if it is only one night,

354
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,580
I want to live as your wife and die, Orabeoni.

355
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,770
Please allow it, Orabeoni.

356
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,110
Su Ryeon.

357
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:43,550
Please... call me your wife just once.

358
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,810
Dear Wife.

359
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,970
Yes, Dear Husband.

360
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,870
I can die without any regrets now.

361
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,390
In our next life,

362
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:13,100
let us be born as ordinary people and live happily ever after together.

363
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,280
Yes, Dear Husband.

364
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,610
I am reminded of the day I met you again after ten years, when I became a royal physician.

365
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:37,130
It was the happiest and saddest day of my life, like today.

366
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,950
It was the day I lost Grand Prince Gwang Chang.

367
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,320
 Your Highness! 

368
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,820
 Your Highness! You cannot! 

369
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,180
 Su Ryeon! 

370
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,990
 Court Lady Kim! 

371
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,760
 Court Lady Kim! 

372
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,070
 Please just stay alive. 

373
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,070
 I will never... 

374
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,390
 I will never let go of you again. 

375
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,540
 I promise you. 

376
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,870
 No matter what happens, 

377
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:44,390
 I am going to take you out of this palace 

378
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,140
 and be with you until death do us part. 

379
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:57,100
 Please just stay alive until then, Su Ryeon. 

380
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,600
I endured twenty long years

381
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,100
just to keep my promise from that day.

382
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,130
Had I known it would end up like this,

383
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,500
I would have run away with you sooner.

384
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,700
I know you did not do that for my sake because I might be put in danger.

385
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,580
- Su Ryeon. 
 - You do not need to say more.

386
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:31,540
I have... endured all this time only thinking of this moment...

387
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,750
of becoming your wife.

388
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,250
The moment you waited for so eagerly...

389
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,560
The first night...

390
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,850
ended up being the last night.

391
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,330
I am sorry.

392
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,440
I do not care.

393
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,060
Just one night is enough for me.

394
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,160
I mean it.

395
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,610
 If the food taster opens her mouth, the grand prince will die for sure. 

396
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,850
 - Grand Prince! 
 - Mother! 

397
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,320
 - Grand Prince Gwang Chang! 
 - Mother! 

398
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,480
 You cannot! Do not do this! My Gwang Chang... 

399
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,010
 Why was Grand Prince Gwang Chang put to death? 

400
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,650
 He died vomiting blood at such a young age. 

401
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,480
 Do you truly want to lose Grand Prince Do Seong? 

402
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,840
 If the food inspector opens her mouth... 

403
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,610
 both you and Grand Prince Do Seong will die. 

404
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,240
 Grand Prince will die for sure. 

405
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,170
 Do you truly want to lose Grand Prince Do Seong? 

406
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,280
Your Highness.

407
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,890
 - Choi Sang Rok did? 
 - Yes. 

408
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,380
 He treated him with that device when his life was in peril. 

409
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:05,020
 That is when he started getting better, so we could not remove it. 

410
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,990
 I also know it was my father's doing. 

411
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:17,650
 I meant it when I said I do not wish harm on you. 

412
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,160
 Nothing will change just because I die. 

413
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,790
 If Your Highness is gone, 

414
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,480
 Grand Prince Do Seong will become the king whether he wants to or not. 

415
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,330
 And my Myeong Yun will be safe. 

416
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,910
Grand Prince, where are you going this late at night?

417
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,220
I cannot sleep.

418
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,800
I will go see Father.

419
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,690
I will escort you.

420
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,570
It is fine.

421
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,850
I will be at the Main Hall.

422
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,610
Go and check that nothing is wrong at the prison cells.

423
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,420
Yes.

424
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,340
As long as you look the other way, no one will know.

425
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,900
I will make sure you will not be in trouble for this.

426
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,380
She tried to kill His Majesty with poison.

427
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,180
I am afraid she will try to slander the grand prince at the Capital Interrogations.

428
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,030
I cannot sleep because I am too worried.

429
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:35,160
Her Highness the Queen bestowed this upon you out of pity.

430
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:52,730
If you try anything foolish, you will lose your head immediately.

431
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,240
I will be at the entrance.

432
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,340
Please call me if you need me.

433
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,210
Thank you.

434
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,570
Please spare me, Your Royal Highness.

435
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:34,650
I will do anything you tell me to do, so please just spare me.

436
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,170
P-Please spare me, Your Royal Highness!

437
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,680
You will die anyway.

438
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,450
How can a traitor who tried to poison His Majesty wish to live?

439
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,950
Rather than dying in pain during torture,

440
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,730
would it not be better to take your own life instead?

441
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,310
Why do I need to die?

442
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,990
I-I only did as the queen dowager's palace ordered!

443
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,360
This is not fair!

444
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,770
Shut your mouth!

445
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,120
How dare you say this is not fair?

446
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:22,270
When I think of what you did, I would not be satisfied to tear you apart.

447
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:26,490
If you want your corpse to be in one piece, take this dagger right now.

448
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,270
I-I refuse!

449
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:34,020
If I am going to die one way or another,

450
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,320
I will fight back before I die.

451
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,750
What did you say?

452
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:45,970
You are telling me to die because you are afraid of what I would say, right?

453
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,350
If you fail to save me,

454
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:53,690
I will say Your Highness ordered everything!

455
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,850
Do you think anyone would believe you?

456
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,110
Do as you please.

457
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:11,100
In that case, instead of Your Highness,

458
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,240
I will say Grand Prince Do Seong ordered me to do so.

459
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,150
What do you think will happen, then?

460
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:21,800
Those who serve the crown prince will lunge at him.

461
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,720
Then, Grand Prince Do Seong will not be safe, either.

462
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:36,040
If you want to save Grand Prince Do Seong, please save me now!

463
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,830
Please tell the chief royal guard to release me now.

464
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,090
- Right now! 
 - Shut up!

465
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:47,800
If Grand Prince Do Seong dies, it will be all Your Highness's fault.

466
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,590
You will be killing Grand Prince Do Seong!

467
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:56,450
Do you want to become a mother who killed her own son?

468
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,370
I told you to shut your mouth!

469
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,460
P-Please save me, Your Royal Highness.

470
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,410
I thought Brother was weaker than me with alcohol,

471
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,620
but I noticed today that he is better than me at drinking as well.

472
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:56,570
All right. Your hands are all clean.

473
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,350
Brother's and my feet look just like yours.

474
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,440
Anyone can tell we are your sons.

475
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,980
We take after you.

476
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,360
Why are your feet so cold?

477
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,070
 This is Jung Yeong! 

478
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,920
Come in.

479
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,510
You must come with me for a moment.

480
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,430
Whose doing is it?

481
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,020
I did not tell you because it would only

482
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,380
trouble your mind while not changing anything.

483
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,610
Now that the food taster ended up that way,

484
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:04,170
I believe it is time for you to know.

485
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,070
You are aware His Excellency Munhyeong and his men

486
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,750
gathered today to discuss future matters, right?

487
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,870
Yes. So what about their meeting?

488
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,720
 Of course, we will have to do away with Left State Councillor Yun Yi Gyeom. 

489
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,420
 He falsely accused the crown prince. 

490
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,070
 The problem is Her Majesty the Queen. 

491
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,440
 I am sure that will be an issue. 

492
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,970
 One should be punished for his crimes, irrespective of rank. 

493
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:32,180
 No matter who it is, even Her Highness the Queen, 

494
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,110
 must be punished if they committed a crime. 

495
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,990
I apologize, but even if I keep quiet,

496
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:43,790
it will be eventually revealed that Her Royal Highness was here.

497
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,930
Then, the situation will spiral into an unstoppable chaos.

498
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:50,700
You must make any preparations necessary.

499
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,300
Your Highness!

500
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,090
This is terrible.

501
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,570
Lower your voice.

502
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:11,520
The food taster was murdered.

503
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,570
 What do we do now? 

504
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,490
We cannot bring the dead back to life.

505
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,420
What should we do?

506
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,810
Bring me my official attire.

507
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,370
Grand Prince!

508
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:37,800
Who was it? Who is pushing Royal Mother to the edge of the cliff?

509
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,590
Was it you?

510
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,890
Or was it Grandfather?

511
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,100
Yes. It must be both of you.

512
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,750
Should you disturb Royal Mother's mind one more time,

513
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,130
I will kill you with my own hands.

514
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,260
Do you understand?

515
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,480
Do Seong.

516
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,190
I killed her.

517
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,260
Stay outside.

518
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,950
You promised me...

519
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:37,740
that we will be born as ordinary people in our next lives

520
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,500
and live happily ever after.

521
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,400
Yes.

522
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:46,460
Let us do that.

523
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:56,200
♫  I am looking only at you with a blank stare  ♫

524
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:03,490
♫  Like the moonlight there   ♫

525
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:09,950
♫  which waxes before you know it don't leave  ♫

526
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:17,270
♫  Because it feels like the wind is brushing by  ♫

527
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:24,570
♫  t hurts like my breath was taken away and the tears flow  ♫

528
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:32,350
♫  I want to look at and embrace you  ♫

529
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,580
♫  Destroy the longing coming to me  ♫

530
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,510
Your Highness.

531
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:47,300
Your Highness. Your Highness! Your Highness, you cannot!

532
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,040
Your Highness! Your Highness, please open your eyes.

533
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,460
Your Highness!

534
00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:03,560
♫  How much longer must I wait to be able to meet you?  ♫

535
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,410
I said I killed the food taster.

536
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,890
Why aren't you asking me anything?

537
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,420
Take a seat.

538
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:21,160
You lost the only way to clear your name because of me.

539
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,930
And you cannot cure Father or get rid of those people anymore!

540
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:30,400
Why, then? Why aren't you saying anything?

541
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,050
Yell at me and ask me why I did such a thing or whether I have gone mad!

542
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:39,630
Your younger brother is causing your death so he can live!

543
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,290
Why...

544
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:48,080
W-Why aren't you saying anything? Why?

545
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:51,310
Let go of me!

546
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,690
I said let go of me.

547
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:57,110
Let go of me. Let go!

548
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:00,110
Let go— Let go.

549
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,970
It's all right.

550
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,090
Do Seong.

551
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,780
It's all right.

552
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,910
It's all right.

553
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:20,040
♫   When the sun sets the longing to do it again
   ♫

554
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:27,890
♫   spreads out of control again   ♫

555
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,830
♫  Like the moon waning there  ♫

556
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,940
Brother.

557
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,430
Please forgive me, Brother.

558
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:44,680
♫  the tears flow and I cry as if my breath were taken away  ♫

559
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:52,340
♫  I want to look at and embrace you  ♫

560
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:58,210
♫  Destroy it.  Because I think it's a wind filled with longing coming to me  ♫

561
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,440
Please forgive me.

562
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,980
Stop.

563
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,440
Please forgive me, Brother.

564
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,350
That's enough. You can stop.

565
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,100
 His Excellency Munhyeong is here. 

566
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,360
Let him enter.

567
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,870
You were here as well, Grand Prince.

568
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,870
Go to your room.

569
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:53,720
It's all right. The grand prince must know about this matter, too.

570
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,090
- The food taster was... 
 - As for the food taster...

571
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,430
I was the one who killed her.

572
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:10,490


573
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:16,740
♫  In a long memory  ♫a ♫

574
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:22,030
♫  I'm searching for you, blurry in the distance  ♫

575
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:28,380
♫  Where is all the longing,   ♫

576
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:35,300
 deeply etched in my heart and lingering in the time past,  ♫

577
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,340
♫  where could it be?  ♫

578
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:46,930
♫  I am wandering like a lost child.  ♫

579
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,380
♫  You are too far away for me to get closer  ♫

580
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,170
 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview  

581
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,410
 How am I to pay for all these sins? 

582
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:59,740
 I wish you were Baek Gu. 

583
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,040
 Tell the crown prince to hand over Myeong Yun. 

584
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,490
 I will escort her there. 

585
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:05,680
 She almost became my wife. 

586
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,690
 Deposed Crown Prince Yi Geon will be exonerated and become Grand Prince Su Seong. 

587
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,890
 I laid a trap to catch Grand Prince Su Seong. 

588
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:17,590
 Grand Prince Su Seong will not be able to speak of our matter now. 

589
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,540
 Will you keep Grand Prince Su Seong alive? 

590
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,340
 Of course, he must be killed.
