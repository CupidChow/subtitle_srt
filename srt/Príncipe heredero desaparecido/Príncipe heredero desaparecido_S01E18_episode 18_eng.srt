 Episode 18 

12
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,380
If you do not wish to have the queen dowager killed as well,

13
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,240
kneel down right now.

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,380
Head Eunuch, are you there?

15
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

16
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,190
The queen dowager seems to be in great shock.

17
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,920
Escort her to the queen dowager's palace.

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

19
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,590
Chief Royal Guard, arrest the chief patrol guard and his men.

20
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,460
Guard the palace gates so not a single person can get out

21
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,980
until there is an order from me. Do you understand?

22
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,300
Yes, Your Majesty!

23
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,720
I am going to hold an assembly.

24
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,110
Everyone is to attend.

25
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,260
While I was bedridden, I know a lot of things happened.

26
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,990
This nation's heir, the crown prince, was falsely accused and deposed.

27
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:36,330
Furthermore, the crown prince's maternal grandfather, Munhyeong, was murdered.

28
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,900
What have you been doing while such atrocities were taking place?

29
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,240
If you have a mouth, try giving an excuse.

30
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,250
Do you still call yourselves loyal subjects?

31
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,060
 Please put us to death, Your Majesty! 

32
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,610
All of you are to submit resignation letters.

33
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,240
Those who are found guilty even in the slightest will be dismissed.

34
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,940
Know that all actions whether planned or implemented

35
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,520
which were against my will are  declared void immediately

36
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,600
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

37
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,520
Grand Prince Do Seong's crown prince investiture will also be voided,

38
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:22,590
so Grand Prince Do Seong is to leave the palace after the assembly.

39
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,160
Mayor of Hanyang, step forward.

41
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,890
Bring in the criminals!

42
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,360
Yes, Your Majesty!

43
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,890
These men murdered Munhyeong while he was being transferred.

44
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,670
Confess who instigated you two.

45
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,950
It was the Mayor of Hanyang, Your Majesty.

46
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,030
Mayor of Hanyang, do you wish to say anything?

47
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,110
Please put me to death, Your Majesty.

48
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,970
Lock up the Mayor of Hanyang who instigated Munhyeong's murder, right now!

49
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,090
 Yes! 

50
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,170
Left State Councillor, step forward.

51
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,600
The crime of falsely accusing and slandering the crown prince is extremely grave.

52
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,010
Lock up the left state councillor Yun Yi Gyeom as well.

53
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,860
 Yes! 

54
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,830
The queen cannot be unrelated to this matter,

55
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,200
so she will be under probation inside the queen's palace!

56
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,070
Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok, step forward.

57
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,280
Royal Clinic's Physician, Kim Dal Saeng

58
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,470
fabricated the autopsy of the Main Hall's food taster

59
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,970
and falsely accused the Crown Prince. Is that correct?

60
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,450
Also, the poison ingested by the food taster of the queen's palace and physician Kim Dal Saeng

62
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,880
is suspected to have come from the Royal Clinic.

63
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,430
- Do you admit that as well? 
 - Yes... Your Majesty.

64
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,380
The Royal Clinic is related to every single incident in the palace.

65
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,140
Choi Sang Rok is dismissed from all government posts for his mis-management of the Royal Clinic

66
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,120
and be under probation at his residence.

67
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:19,230
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,090
Censor and Deputy Chief  Scholar, step forward.

69
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,100
You stayed loyal to your lord and should be praised for serving the crown prince.

70
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,560
Censor Kim Dae Seung, will become Chief Censor.

71
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,740
The Deputy Chief Scholar Lee Guk Ju will become Chief Scholar.

72
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,480
 Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty! 

73
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,290
If you hear your name now, step forward.

74
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,190
Kim Seong Hyeon will be the left state councilor.

75
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,070
Jeong Ho Yeong, the inspector general.

76
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,280
Choi Jong Yun, the mayor of Hanyang. Seo Jae Wu, the chief military officer.

77
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,010
And Park Gi Deok, the chief royal secretary. These are your new posts.

78
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,810
 Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty! 

79
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,390
Reinvestigate the deaths of the former chief royal secretary,

80
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,950
the Royal Clinic's physician Heo Jin Su as well as that of the physician Kim Dal Saeng.

81
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,300
You are to dedicate yourselves to this task.

82
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,700
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

83
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,650
As soon as the truth behind their deaths are revealed,

84
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,260
Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok, Left State Councillor Yun Yi Gyeom,

85
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,120
and Mayor of Hanyang Yun Jeong Dae will be interrogated together.

86
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,520
So, prepare to open up the capital interrogations.

87
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,010
I will be interrogating them in person.

88
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,370
Your Highness, the inspector general was dismissed, denounced,

89
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,080
and put under probation.

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,850
Your Highness, are you all right?

91
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,290
 Your Highness, the left state councillor was imprisoned at the Royal Investigation 

92
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,850
Your Highness, why aren't you saying anything?

93
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,750
At this rate, things might not end with just probation.

94
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,730
The food taster's matter will be brought up again for sure.

95
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,510
You must come up with a plan to prepare for such a time.

96
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,330
 Queen. 

97
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,460
 Your Majesty! 

98
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,230
 Why are you so surprised? 

99
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,500
 Queen. 

100
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,410
 I missed you, my queen. 

101
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,670
 Your Majesty, this cannot be a dream. Right? 

102
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,450
 Enough. 

103
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,280
 You will collapse again since you are so fragile. 

104
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,080
 Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty. 

105
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,320
 Queen, do you trust me? 

106
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,140
 Yes, I do. 

107
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,260
 Even if the world is to end, I will trust you, Your Majesty. 

108
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,330
 If you trust me, 

109
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,070
 no matter what happens from now on, 

110
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,140
 do not waver and wait for me. 

111
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,740
 - Can you do that? 
 - Yes, Your Majesty! 

112
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,180
 I will wait. 

113
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:22,070
 I will wait for Your Majesty until the day I die. 

114
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,770
Your Highness.

115
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,900
Your Highness, please pull yourself together!

116
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,950
What are you fussing about?

117
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,180
Did you forget His Majesty ordered me to be under probation in the queen's palace?

118
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,850
Your Majesty.

119
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,950
You may leave now.

120
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,910
You have gone through a lot.

121
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,140
Not at all.

122
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,600
Please forgive me for failing to protect you, Father.

123
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,450
Since everything has gone back to its place now,

124
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,780
you should also go back to where you were

125
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,090
and help your brother properly like before.

126
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,690
Yes, Father.

127
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,020
Do you have something to tell me?

128
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,000
Are you upset it came to this, when you could have become the crown prince tomorrow?

129
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Not at all. How could I ever?

130
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Why do you look so full of concerns on this joyful day, then?

131
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,450
I do not even qualify to become the crown prince

132
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,830
nor am I confident I can shoulder the weight of the position.

133
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,830
Hence, I prefer to live as a grand prince.

134
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,910
I do not care about myself.

135
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,010
What is it you want to tell me?

136
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,070
Maiden Myeong Yun isâ€”

137
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,150
That girl is not your concern.

138
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,070
Father, Maiden Myeong Yun isâ€”

139
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,610
She is a traitor's daughter!

140
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,150
How could you mention her in front of me?

141
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,020
I apologize.

142
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,340
However, for everything Maiden Myeong Yun has done all this time, please have mercyâ€”

143
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,440
Shut your mouth!

144
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,690
Whether she lives or dies, I said it is not your concern!

145
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,950
Do not ever bring her up with me again.

146
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,920
You may take your leave and get ready to leave the palace.

147
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,590
Yes.

148
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,660
I will tell the Royal Clinic to send in a royal physician, Father.

149
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,390
You cannot. Did you forget the Royal Clinic is in Choi Sang Rok's hands?

150
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,300
Call for that girl.

151
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,040
Are you talking about Maiden Myeong Yun?

152
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,830
She knows my current condition the best.

153
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,850
Yes.

154
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,710
I will have her come to the palace quickly.

155
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,050
The queen dowager's people might still be inside the palace.

156
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,250
So, move discreetly.

157
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:34,030
 Your Majesty, I gathered all the eunuchs and court ladies of the Main Hall! 

158
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,640
You may take your leave.

159
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,250
Yes.

160
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,280
Why did they have to fall for the same woman?

161
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,170
On top of that, she had to be...

162
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,460
Send every single one of them out of the palace right now.

163
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,870
Yes!

164
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,180
Take them away!

165
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,040
Yes!

166
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,480
Where is the royal cook?

167
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:26,790
Crown Prince, investigate every person involved in that day's incident

168
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,090
and have the royal cook decapitated.

169
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

170
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,780
All hail His Majesty!

171
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,290
Have you been well all this time?

172
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,790
You seem to be in a worse state than me for some reason.

173
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,070
Could it be you have fallen ill?

174
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,100
If you have something to say, hurry up and say it.

175
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,790
Well, I reckon I have been courteous enough.

176
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,760
So, let me tell you.

177
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,420
Give up the inspector general.

178
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,110
If you do, I will let you keep the queen dowager's palace, at least.

179
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,710
You know better than I do what the inspector general has done.

180
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,430
Just do as I say.

181
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,860
Your Majesty, I am this country'sâ€”

182
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,240
Yes, you are Her Highness the Queen Dowager, the highest-ranked elder in the nation.

183
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,770
- I am the one whoâ€” 
 - You clearly showed me you can

184
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,790
take me down from the throne since you were the one who sat me there.

185
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,140
Do you know what I was thinking, lying there so miserably?

186
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,390
"I will get up and return the favor exactly the same way you did."

187
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,880
I promised myself over and over again.

188
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,590
Is Seungjeonsaek out there? 
  (A eunuch who delivers the king's orders verbally) 

189
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,090
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

190
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,630
Is the head court lady there?

191
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,840
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

192
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,380
Are the food taster and the royal cook there as well?

193
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,080
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

194
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,250
They will be taking care of the queen dowager's palace starting today.

195
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,270
From now on, report to me everything the queen dowager does and says.

196
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,790
Do you understand?

197
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,540
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

198
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,680
You may all leave.

199
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,400
Make your decision.

200
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,330
Do you want to be confined to the back garden residence

201
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:10,020
or do you want to keep this queen dowager's palace, even if you are but a puppet?

202
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,820
Of course, regardless of your choice,

203
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,810
you will have to do whatever I say from this moment on.

204
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,260
Must you go this far?

205
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,830
This is just the beginning.

206
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,540
Those hellish times when I was bedridden as a living corpse.

207
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,100
The blood and tears the crown prince had to shed.

208
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,690
The humiliation Grand Prince Do Seong had to experience.

209
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,820
The threats that made the queen tremble in despair.

210
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,900
The wicked scheme you devised with the left state councilor and the mayor of Hanyang!

211
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,580
There is still so much more to do to punish you...

212
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,310
for all those grave crimes.

213
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:55,010
In that case, punish me!

214
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,130
You just have to punish me, then!

215
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,570
My guts still churn when I think of your face, Your Highness.

216
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,250
So, do not provoke me.

217
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,960
Do not even breathe out loud, but live as if you are dead.

218
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,640
Do not do anything at all.

219
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,580
If you so much as lift a finger without my permission,

220
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,280
you will see the blood of the one you cherish the most.

221
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,970
I will let you keep your beloved Court Lady Kim as my last act of mercy.

222
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,760
Your Highness.

223
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,500
Please do not lose hope.

224
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,100
There will surely come a day when you will get to pay them back.

225
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,220
Not at all.

226
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,850
It is said that you reap what you sow.

227
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,410
I know the things I have done.

228
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,930
I would be foolish if I still hoped...

229
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,400
- to come out unscathed. 
 - Your Highness.

230
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,220
How can you say such devastating words?

231
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,620
Even if you are upset and angry, you cannot lose your spirit.

232
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,780
There is nothing to be upset or angry about.

233
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:09,120
If you commit a crime, it is only right to bear the consequences.

234
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,740
It is just...

235
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,580
all of this started because of me...

236
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,990
and I am the cause of everything.

237
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,410
Orabeoni just...

238
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,130
could not bear to abandon a poor woman.

239
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,980
I am just devastated that I cannot take...

240
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,970
the blame all by myself.

241
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,390
Your Highness...

242
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,720
 It is me. 

243
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,550
Come in.

244
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,920
Since Father woke up as you said, Hyeong-

245
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,260
you were right and I was wrong.

246
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,250
Isn't that what you came to hear?

247
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,010
Sit down.

248
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,090
I have nothing more to discuss with you, Brother.

249
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,650
Now that Father has woken up, everything has changed.

250
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,050
Things did not change. They found their rightful place.

251
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,070
I am also preparing to leave the palace like this.

252
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,380
It seems you are still upset.

253
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,140
Let's save the talk for another time.

254
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,050
Take care for now.

255
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,450
What do you plan to do with Maiden Myeong Yun now?

256
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,550
Do you think Choi Sang Rok's punishment will end with confinement?

257
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,720
That cannot be the case.

258
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,220
Since he committed more crimes than what was revealed,

259
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,040
he will be punished severely as evidence is found.

260
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,350
If you know so well, you should worry about Maiden Myeong Yun's safety first.

261
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,250
You let her risk her life to save Father,

262
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,010
and you will look the other way now?

263
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,770
I told you I will protect Maiden Myeong Yun, no matter what.

264
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,570
What if Father doesn't let you do that?

265
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,320
Why would Father harm Maiden Myeong Yun?

266
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,740
That will never happen, so don't worry.

267
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,820
Father even confined Mother for your sake.

268
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,110
Do you think he would forgive Maiden Myeong Yun, Choi Sang Rok's daughter?

269
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,170
You do not know Father at all.

270
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,630
Perhaps you are the one who has no idea.

271
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,010
Do Seong.

272
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,370
Your pulse improved a bit.

273
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,780
But you still need absolute bed rest.

274
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,610
I have mountains of delayed work.

275
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,120
I need to do what I need to do.

276
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,790
You know better than anyone that you do not have the energy right now.

277
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,110
Then, I will have to create some if I have to.

278
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,170
Your Majesty, I am regretful to be reminding you of this,

279
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,510
but the day we met again outside the palace,

280
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:29,460
you said you would never take that medicine again.

281
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,510
You promised you would not talk about that medicine.

282
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,130
Your Majesty, this sort of drug...

283
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,510
heightens your energy only briefly.

284
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,000
- It will ultimately harm your bodyâ€” 
 - I understand.

285
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,300
I will do as you say. You can leave now.

286
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,200
 His Majesty woke up. 

287
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,570
I was confined to my house.

288
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,670
So, restrict the household from going outside

289
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,440
and send home the remaining patients in the clinic as well.

290
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,980
Yes.

291
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,930
Tell Myeong Yun that I would like to see her.

292
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,080
My Lady went to visit Madam's grave with Oh Wol.

293
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,730
She went to her mother's grave?

294
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,710
Yes, she did not know when she would get to visit again once she weds tomorrow.

295
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,300
She said she was going to say her last farewell.

296
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,950
She did an unnecessary thing.

297
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,730
Does that mean the wedding ceremony was canceled?

298
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,900
Of course, it was.

299
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,390
The king woke up.

300
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,980
 Master, a messenger came from the palace! 

301
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,850
 Did you meet Father? 

302
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,080
 Yes, he does need rest. 

303
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,020
Thank you.

304
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,640
It is all thanks to you.

305
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,710
Thank you.

306
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,030
Not at all, Your Highness.

307
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,740
Let's go in.

308
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,180
What is this?

309
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,830
It is a hairpin.

310
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,170
I thought it would look good on you.

311
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,650
Where did you get something like this?

312
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,480
I picked it up on the way.

313
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,550
I swear.

314
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,030
I do not know who it was, but this person lost a valuable thing.

315
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,830
What does it look like?

316
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,480
Didn't you say it was a hairpin?

317
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,700
Not that.

318
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,720
I am asking what these shapes look like.

319
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,330
They look like flower petals.

320
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,440
You are right. They are apricot flower petals.

321
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,230
The apricot flower you like, Maiden.

322
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,040
Apricot flower.

323
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,550
You don't like it?

324
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,770
No, I like it.

325
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,150
It is very pretty.

326
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,390
Thank you, Your Highness.

327
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,400
I will cherish it.

328
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:32,370
It looks like apricot flower petals fell on a heavenly fairy's hair.

329
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,380
Do not cry, even if you are that happy.

330
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:44,030
You look prettiest when you smile, Maiden.

331
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:01,520
 Regardless of where I am and what I am doing, 

332
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,570
 I will live as Your Highness' woman until the day I die. 

333
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,810
I can tell what you are thinking.

334
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,860
But it is foolish to worry about the tomorrow that has not even come yet.

335
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,350
So, let's forget it for a while.

336
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,720
Forget it all and just focus on this moment.

337
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:32,980
I am content... with looking at you.

338
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,930
I am happy.

339
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,200
I hope that...

340
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,930
you feel the same way I do.

341
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,110
Your Highness...

342
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:56,510
â™«  The day we loved, the day we hurt,  â™«

343
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:00,560
â™«  Even the day we sometimes exchanged harsh words,  â™«

344
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,340
 Your Highness... 

345
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:11,960
â™«  The day that became cloudy in the fog  â™«

346
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,940
â™«  caress my heart like a spring breeze  â™«

347
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:26,820
â™«  In the breath which only I hear,  â™«

348
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:35,200
â™«  I close my eyes again and take a deep breath  â™«

349
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,080
â™«  Suddenly thinking of you  â™«

350
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,350
â™«  your breath makes me relax  â™«

351
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:50,790
â™«  so that I can fly anywhere  â™«

352
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:56,930
â™«  Into my frozen heart  â™«

353
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:05,100
â™«  breathe life with your breath and mine  â™«

354
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,280
â™«  You don't have to be afraid anymore  â™«

355
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,480
â™«  When we release a sign while our eyes meet  â™«

356
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Please get going now.

357
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,160
They will be looking for you at the Main Hall.

358
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:28,680
â™«  I fill this breath with my love for you  â™«

359
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:37,170
â™«  and send if off on a gentle breeze  â™«

360
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:43,210
â™«  Breathing life into me with all your might  â™«

361
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,260
â™«  your breath gives me life  â™«

362
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,630
â™«  allowing me to stand no matter what  â™«

363
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:58,910
â™«  Into my parched heart  â™«

364
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:06,860
â™«   breathe your warm breath  â™«

365
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,510
Orabeoni.

366
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,520
I saw them on the way.

367
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,900
From watching those two people...

368
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,490
I saw you and me.

369
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:45,030
Of the old days when we were happy...

370
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,890
just looking at each other.

371
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:53,270
Who do you think is to blame for what happened to us, Orabeoni?

372
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,890
The previous king's filthy greed?

373
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,690
Laws? Customs?

374
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:06,270
Yes, it is true that those things oppressed and trampled us down.

375
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,570
However, I think... it was because no one in this world...

376
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:22,320
acknowledged our love and extended a helping hand.

377
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,800
We cannot let those two walk the same thorny path we walked.

378
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,430
I understand what you mean.

379
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,720
But there is nothing we can do.

380
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,490
No.

381
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:45,240
Orabeoni, we should...

382
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,400
give up. Orabeoni.

383
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,120
Choi Sang Rok came back to the palace?

384
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:18,350
I will arrest him immediately for defying the order of confinement.

385
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,230
No, just let him be.

386
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,990
I need to let him put up his last fight

387
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,060
to eradicate the rats that still remain inside the palace.

388
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

389
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,970
More importantly, did the crown prince get the appeal letters from the Royal Secretariat?

390
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,020
When will you finish reading all of them?

392
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,000
I need to lessen Royal Father's workload as much as possible.

393
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,680
Only if you could help at times like this...

394
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,300
Never mind. I asked the wrong person.

395
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,140
Just wait a bit longer.

396
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,110
I am diligently studying the books right now, soâ€”

397
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,620
 Your Highness, Choi Sang Rok is asking to see you. 

398
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,290
Let him in.

399
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,590
I have something to tell Your Highness in private.

400
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,040
You can stay outside.

401
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,650
Yes.

402
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,380
I don't know what he came for.

403
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,920
Regardless of the reason, you should have kicked him out right away.

404
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,110
Why does His Highness deal with a man like him?

405
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:07,170
That is because he is Maiden Myeong Yun's father.

406
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,190
If you have something to say, hurry.

407
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,270
I am a bit busy.

408
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,190
Do you think you will be...

409
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,590
able to protect Myeong Yun?

410
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:31,420
Don't tell me that you came thinking you can hear the answer from me.

411
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,130
What is your motive for mentioning Maiden Myeong Yun's safety to me?

412
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,810
There is no motive.

413
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:44,370
I am asking whether you can protect Myeong Yun, plain and simple.

414
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:48,190
Even if I give you the answer out of generosity,

415
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:55,230
I regard you as the enemy who caused my grandfather's death and cannot live under the same sky as me.

416
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,980
How would you trust my words?

417
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,900
I would not have came to you like this if I could not trust you.

418
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:09,680
I am sure you only see me as a filthy man who had an affair with the queen dowager.

419
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,010
But I am also a father.

420
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,670
Despite how terrible a father may be,

421
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:21,010
no father in this world wishes an unfortunate end for his child.

422
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,870
Take care of my Myeong Yun, I beseech you.

423
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,750
How strange.

424
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,620
What are you talking about now?

425
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,140
I am talking about Choi Sang Rok.

426
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,450
They say people change when they are about to die.

427
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,780
Do you think he has decided to die?

428
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,760
Otherwiseâ€”

429
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,310
N-Never mind.

430
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,900
I would be thankful if he would die on his own.

431
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,580
Quit the nonsense. What happened to what I ordered you to do?

432
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,970
Pardon?

433
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,240
Oh, yes.

434
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,060
I told Seon Ok to prepare everything.

435
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,250
You just need to go there.

436
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,810
Let us go.

437
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,220
The girl named Oh Wol is in the grand prince's custody.

438
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,850
Why is Oh Wol with the grand prince?

439
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,880
You can ask him yourself.

440
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,390
Let me escort you.

441
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,870
Where is Oh Wol?

442
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,080
Why are you doing this?

443
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,420
Please open the door, Grand Prince.

444
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,760
Please open the door, Grand Prince! Grand Prince!

445
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,310
I treated you more coldly on purpose.

446
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,240
I thought that was the least I could do for you, Grand Prince.

447
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,800
It was not because I disliked you.

448
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,920
At first, I had an arranged marriage.

449
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,820
After that,

450
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:51,350
I already had started growing feelings for the crown prince.

451
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,510
So, how could I have accepted your feelings?

452
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,260
I already made up my mind.

453
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,740
Do not try to convince me.

454
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,450
I do not intend to.

455
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:09,200
I just want to show you my heart,

456
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,090
so you can see things clearly.

457
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,810
It is all pointless.

458
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,580
Whatever you say,

459
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,980
I am going to take you and escape the capital tomorrow, Maiden.

460
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,740
Are you saying you will take me by force?

461
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,660
I do not care...

462
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:31,690
even if... you do not become my woman in this life.

463
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,040
I am fine with that.

464
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,830
So, I will do anything if I can save you, Maiden.

465
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,420
Grand Prince...

466
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,370
will you... choose to have your life spared,

467
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:06,000
even if it means being miserable until the day you die?

468
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,310
I would not.

469
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,830
Instead of living like that, I would rather...

470
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,970
take my own life.

471
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,490
Hoping I will be able

472
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:30,330
to be happy even for a moment in my next life,

473
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,460
I would take that path willingly.

474
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,150
I believe you are not any different from me, Grand Prince.

475
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,620
You will say I am wrong,

476
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,260
but I know you would choose the same path as me.

477
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,540
I do not want you to...

478
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,920
to become miserable because of me.

479
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,560
I hope you will quit obsessing over me...

480
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,590
and follow the path that will bring you happiness.

481
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,370
I truly mean that.

482
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,320
â™«  Closing my eyes and thinking of you  â™«

483
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:52,400
â™«  Unknown to me also, the tears flow  â™«

484
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:00,630
â™«  At the end of this  day which has stopped  â™«

485
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:06,240
â™«  are you there?  â™«

486
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:15,100
â™«  Look at me, can you feel my heart?  â™«

487
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,850
My Lady!

488
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,650
â™«  I Iive in endless longing  â™«

489
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:29,690
â™«  I love you, I love you.  When can I reach you?  â™«

490
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:36,650
â™«  Stay here at my side. Don't let go of me  â™«

491
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:43,370
â™«  Because of you, I live each day  â™«

492
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,550
 Why do you tell me to quit what I cannot quit? 

493
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:52,550
 However, I will quit it if you want me to. 

494
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,540
 Or rather... 

495
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,460
 I have already quit. 

496
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,610
 So, please be safe. 

497
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:10,250
â™«  You are right here, at my side  â™«

498
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,950
Did you not find her?

499
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,400
I looked everywhere the lady could have gone.

500
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,090
My goodness.

501
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,470
My Lady!

502
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,290
What happened?

503
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,760
I waited for a long time.

504
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,400
There was an urgent patient I had to attend to.

505
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,880
- What is the matter?
 - His Highness wants to see you.

506
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,500
- Please come.
 - Where?

507
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,880
Oh, yes. We might need you, too. Come with us.

508
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,750
- What about me?
 - We must return before Master comes home.

509
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,490
Oh come on!

510
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,370
His Highness will take care of it.

511
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:55,070
He must be waiting, so let's hurry.

512
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,630
Come and get free rice!

513
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,250
I have starved for five days!

514
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,280
- Goodness, please wait. 
 - Please wait in line.

515
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,650
Gosh, look at this rice.

516
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:20,980
Great job.

517
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,670
Not at all.

518
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,360
What is all this?

519
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:29,500
It's food and medicine for the poor in the slums.

520
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,480
Please help us out.

521
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,770
All right. Let us go!

522
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:37,130
Gosh, come on. Everyone has work to do.

523
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,130
All right.

524
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,570
Goodness, thank you so much!

525
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,810
I am sure you still have tons of work to do.

526
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:47,250
When did you think of doing this?

527
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,380
It was not difficult.

528
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,890
I had to reward you, since credit is due.

529
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,940
When I thought about what would make you happy,

530
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,450
I got the answer right away.

531
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,750
Thank you.

532
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,320
If you are really thankful,

533
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,450
say, "Dear Husband," just once.

534
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,250
Dear Husband.

535
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,820
 Dear Husband. 

536
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,690
 Dear Husband. 

537
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,550
What did she tell you?

538
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,200
Your Highness?

539
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,060
Your Highness?

540
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,420
Do we just need to watch from here?

541
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,980
Of course not.

542
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:04,820
Let us go and use our strength.

543
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,030
Please give me a lot.

544
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,080
Yes, here you go.

545
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,810
- Thank you. Thank you. 
 - Gosh, please give me a lot.

546
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:39,200
- It looks so delicious. 
 - Goodness, thank you.

547
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,850
All right. It is right here.

548
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,040
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes, come this way.

549
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,510
What is that?

550
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,340
What are you doing?

551
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,980
Huh?

552
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,990
I-I did not do anything.

553
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:29,310
Exactly. Why are you not doing anything and standing around?

554
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,910
Push.

555
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,130
Where is His Highness?

556
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,290
Why is he nowhere to be seen?

557
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,450
I am ready here.

558
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:46,490
Here we go!

559
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,510
The grandmother who lives here probably could not come since her legs are unwell.

560
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,530
How did you know her legs were unwell?

561
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:13,100
I did my research in advance.

562
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,300
You said I have a knack for surprising people,

563
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,910
but I think you are much better at it.

564
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,950
Let's go inside.

565
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,780
His face is handsome,

566
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,900
and even his heart is so kind.

567
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,300
Young Master, you will be blessed.

568
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,710
Thank you.

569
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:53,270
Grandmother, let me take a look at your legs.

570
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,210
Y-Yes.

571
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,160
Be careful.

572
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:05,090
It went away entirely.

573
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,920
I said it went away entirely.

574
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:14,260
The wretched widow's fate...

575
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,570
has disappeared without a trace.

576
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,030
You can read faces?

577
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:27,120
She is famous for her skills around here.

578
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,270
Oh, I see.

579
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,360
Please take a look at me as well.

580
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,470
I do not even need to look at you.

581
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:37,220
Your fate could not be any better!

582
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,960
Is that so?

583
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,220
The wicked fate went out the door

584
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,860
and a lover came in.

585
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:54,420
Since the good lived and the evil died,

586
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,580
you only have good fortune to look forward to in your future.

587
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,960
Grandmother, my fate is...

588
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,280
She said it changed.

589
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,430
Do you think Grandmother would lie about it?

590
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:18,540
Yes, I feel much better just from hearing you say that.

591
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,790
Thank you, Grandmother.

592
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,190
I forgot a rice sack.

593
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,340
Please wait just one moment.

594
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,060
My Lady!

595
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,820
We looked for you everywhere!

596
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,910
Where is His Highness?

597
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,390
This is ginseng.

598
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,950
If you brew it, it will give you strength.

599
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:07,380
Oh, filling up my rice pot was enough.

600
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,110
I cannot accept such precious ginseng as well.

601
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:14,730
It is because I am sorry I made you give a false face-reading.

602
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,460
- I was not lying. 
 - What did you say?

603
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,720
You begged so sincerely, so although I was hesitant...

604
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,350
I was going to just accept your request.

605
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,420
But after seeing the lady's face,

606
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:37,260
it truly... had changed.

607
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:41,020
I have never seen this before in my life, either.

608
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,720
May you have long and healthy life, Grandmother.

609
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,280
You are here?

610
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,420
Grandmother, please take a look at me, too.

611
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,050
You were born with a good fortune regarding your husband.

612
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:09,210
Your future husband is very strong.

613
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:15,220
He is nearby, so do not waste your time elsewhere.

614
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:20,120
You are fated to have five sons and live a happy life.

615
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:24,090
Just hold onto him tight, no matter what.

616
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,660
Tight.

617
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,270
Hold tightâ€”

618
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,310
What's this expression? Do you need to poop?

619
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,610
Gosh!

620
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:53,260
Grandmother, what about me?

621
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,490
Where is my other half?

622
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,890
Huh?

623
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,600
Where?

624
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,690
What are you thinking about?

625
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,390
I feel like the reward I got was too much,

626
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,480
so I was thinking about how to repay all of this.

627
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,670
What is there to think about?

628
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,560
You just need to call me "Dear Husband" one more time.

629
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,910
I am also good at cursing. Do you want to hear it?

630
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:51,280
I have never seen you smile brightly as often as you do today.

631
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,930
That is enough for me.

632
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:32,980
You should also get ready.

633
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,580
If you leave with the inspector general first, I will follow you right after.

634
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,410
Do you think you can fool me again?

635
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:47,090
If you do not come with me, I will not move a foot, either.

636
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,480
Your Highness.

637
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,940
Come with me.

638
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:56,450
What am I going to do without you?

639
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,340
Thank you for your grace.

640
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:02,180
Hurry up now. Orabeoni must be waiting.

641
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,060
Orabeoni!

642
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,850
We might be headed to our deaths, not survival.

643
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,810
Are you fine with that?

644
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:37,520
I am only thankful I was allowed to serve you two.

645
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,450
Let us leave it to the heavens and go.

646
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,130
Yes.

647
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,830
All right.

648
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,420
I am sorry I had to put you in danger as well.

649
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,820
Not at all. I have been greatly indebted to you.

650
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:03,850
Please do not worry and get going now.

651
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,350
- Get on my back. 
 - I am fine.

652
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,040
I can endure it.

653
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,250
We are getting delayed because of you.

654
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,430
Hurry up and get on my back.

655
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,450
Just hang in there for a bit.

656
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:10,950
We are almost there.

657
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,540
Yes.

658
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:38,160
Will we be able to leave the city gates safely?

659
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:42,030
I made all the preparations, so don't worry.

660
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:46,850
Are you feeling unwell?

661
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:50,030
She didn't even eat much.

662
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:51,480
Let me check your pulse first.

663
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,060
I will go get some water.

664
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,810
Why are you doing this?

665
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,950
Am I gravely ill?

666
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:14,290
T-That is not it.

667
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,200
One moment.

668
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:47,870
Could it be...

669
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:02,360
You are...

670
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,980
You are surely pregnant.

671
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:18,980

 If we give them time, we don't know what they will do. So please hurry. 

677
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,510
 His pulse is so unstable that I can barely sense it. 

678
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:57,360
 Is there any way for Your Excellencies and me to survive besides a rebellion? 

679
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,000
 This might be our last chance to sort out the traitors. 

680
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,240
 There must not be any mistakes. 

681
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:07,130
 Crown Prince Geon is worthy of the crown. 

682
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:09,240
 He is given the crown and made the king. 

683
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,460
 We stand before you, Your Majesty!
