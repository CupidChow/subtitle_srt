 Missing Crown Prince

00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,780
 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts. 

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,950
 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines. 

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,400
 Final episode  
 The queen has committed the grave crime of murdering the food taster

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,150
who attempted to murder His Majesty the Grand King.

13
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,580
So according to royal family custom,

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,480
the Queen from the Yun clan will be deposed

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,530
and confined in a residence outside the palace.

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,740
Your Highness, in this situation you must stay strong—

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,750
I understand, so go prepare to leave the palace now.

18
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,280
 This is the head eunuch. 

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,890
Come in.

20
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,290
Drag this woman out.

21
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,810
Yes.

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,770
- Your Highness. 
 - This is His Majesty's order.

23
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,550
This girl will serve you at the residence outside the palace.

24
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,890
My name is Seon Ok.

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,490
- What are you waiting for? 
 - Yes.

26
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,220
Your Highness, you must let the grand prince know!

27
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,780
Your Highness! Your Highness!

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,270
Your Highness!

29
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,100
Your Highness!

30
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,300
- Your Highness! 
 - What is the fuss?

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,130
They sent someone from the palace, and he said you were imp—

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,700
Imp-Impeach—

33
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,530
Impeached!

34
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,700
- Yes. 
 - Impeached and denounced?

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,660
Y-Yes! Impeached and denounced.

36
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,110
Yes, and you were ex—

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,230
You know, telling you to leave the capital—

38
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,370
- Expelled from the capital? 
 - That's right!

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,820
Achoo!

40
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,450
 I heard there was that royal decree. 

41
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,310
Announce me.

42
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,690
He said absolutely not to let anyone in.

43
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,470
What are you doing?

44
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,390
How can you do this? How can you do that to Mother—

45
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,640
It was a well-thought-out decision.

46
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,030
That is final, so leave now.

47
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,910
What kind of thinking have you done to come up with such a decision?

48
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,170
Is this why you took the throne?

49
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,130
To get rid of your mother, your brother, and everyone else!

50
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,160
Shut your mouth!

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,020
How dare you raise your voice?

52
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,170
Do you really wish to die?

53
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,670
I must say what I must, even if I die.

54
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,970
Do I still look like your brother who pampers you?

55
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,450
Did you say "pamper"?

56
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,400
Can you say that after stabbing me in the back?

57
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,360
Do you truly not feel sorry at all?

58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,490
 I told you already. 

59
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,100
 It was a well-thought-out decision! 

60
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,310
 Are you saying I should prostrate myself in thanks? 

61
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,700
 You better be thankful you were not ordered to die by poison! 

62
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,030
 Just order death by poison instead! 

63
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,410
 I would rather die by poison than watch my mother become a commoner. 

64
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,140
 Are you daring to defy the Royal Decree? 

65
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,310
 Leave the capital at once and behave yourself! 

66
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,240
Your Majesty, why did you do that?

67
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,110
You should have been gentle and made him understand.

68
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,720
If he strays away in that state...

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,760
Would being gentle with him ever work?

70
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,180
Grand Prince.

71
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,870
A jailbreaker dares to roam the capital with no fear?

72
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,990
You must have lost your sense of fear.

73
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,180
I took this risk because I had to see you, Grand Prince.

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,770
No need to look at me like that.

75
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,010
What did I tell you?

76
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,870
I told you that the first thing the crown prince will do after becoming king

77
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,390
would be to try to get rid of you and the queen!

78
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,960
Will you obey your grandfather's will now?

79
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
What is it you want from me?

80
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,840
Just do as your grandfather tells you to.

81
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,920
That is all I need.

82
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,180
Can you really trust me?

83
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,590
You are my only grandson.

84
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,360
So, who could I trust if not you?

85
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,220
I do not need those sugar-coated words.

86
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:03,450
Tell me the real reason you think I will do as you say, Grandfather.

87
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,160
Come in.

88
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,880
Are you all right?

89
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,030
What on earth have you done to her?

90
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,960
We had no choice, because she fought back so hard.

91
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,240
You can have your talk.

92
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,250
Where are you injured?

93
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,550
Did you get seriously hurt?

94
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,750
No.

95
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,790
I just got some scratches while fighting those who tried to capture me.

96
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,620
You bled so much.

97
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,750
We must let the crown prince know right away.

98
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,000
If they are holding me hostage to threaten you, Grand Prince—

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,030
It does not matter.

100
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,290
I will become the king.

101
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,450
How can you utter such terrifying words?

102
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,740
Will you bring forth a rebellion or something?

103
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,010
To become the king, I would need to lead a rebellion.

104
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,440
Do you think I will believe you?

105
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,480
That would never happen.

106
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,380
The grand prince I know would never bring down his royal father to become the king.

107
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,180
I will take down Brother, not Father.

108
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,610
- What do you mean— 
 - Father has passed on the crown

109
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,390
and Brother took the throne.

110
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,900
However, Brother's world will end soon.

111
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,910
Because I will become the king

112
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:29,030
and you will become the queen, Maiden.

113
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,280
Don't you think it was too easy, to believe he is sincere?

114
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,740
Whether he is sincere or not, what does it matter?

115
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,680
As long as we have that girl,

116
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,000
the grand prince can never betray us.

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,450
So, just keep a close watch on her.

118
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,120
You still have not given up on me?

119
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,720
If you bring down the crown prince— I mean,

120
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,520
His Majesty, and take his seat,

121
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,110
do you really think you can have me?

122
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,640
You should get treated first.

123
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,210
I will bring the people, so wait for me.

124
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,680
Do you know why His Majesty

125
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,090
was against you becoming the king to the end?

126
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,120
Because he knew that your grandfather,

127
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,010
the left state councilor, would murder your father if you became the king, Grand Prince.

128
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,920
I heard Her Highness the Queen had opposed the idea for the same reason.

129
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,060
 You cannot. That is one thing you cannot do! 

130
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,210
 Royal Mother, how can you do this to me? 

131
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,220
 Why are you saying I absolutely cannot be crown prince? 

132
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,930
 I am against it. 

133
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,190
 I have to see you become the crown prince against your will because of me. 

134
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,520
 I also hate seeing brothers fight for the position. I hate it all. 

135
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,520
 Just say you want to be the crown prince instead! 

136
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,030
 Just say you must have her 

137
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,890
 even if she is your younger brother's woman! 

138
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,110
 Shut your mouth! 

139
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,670
 You do not know anything, and you speak so carelessly. 

140
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,530
 What are you saying that I do not know? 

141
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,080
 Just tell me if there is something I do not know! 

142
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,410
 I understood how he could not 

143
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,590
 tell you your grandfather will kill your father 

144
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,640
 to make you the king. 

145
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,970
Rather than scarring you for life,

146
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:06,060
he said he would feel better becoming a terrible older brother.

147
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,410
And he meant it.

148
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,340
 Hyeongnim 

149
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,100
Where have you been?

150
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,760
I have been looking for you everywhere.

151
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,520
Just go bring me some ink and paper.

152
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,210
Y-Yes.

153
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,810
 Goyukgye 

154
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,990
 (Goyukgye: A strategy where you hurt yourself to gain the enemy's trust.) 

155
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,650
 I told you already. 

156
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,520
 It was a well-thought-out decision! 

157
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,910
 Are you saying I should prostrate myself in thanks? 

158
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,090
 You'd better be thankful you were not ordered to die by poison! 

159
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,840
 Just order death by poison instead! 

160
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,760
 I would rather die by poison than watch my mother become a commoner. 

161
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,150
 Are you daring to defy the royal decree? 

162
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,980
 Leave the capital at once and behave yourself! 

163
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,930
 Do not leave the capital and wait around. 

164
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,540
 So, Choi Sang Rok or the left state councilor can come and find you. 

165
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,520
It is as if he were a fortune teller.

166
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,330
Hyeongnim is really amazing.

167
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,610
Sorry? W-What did you say?

168
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,700
It is nothing.

169
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,710
I will write a letter.

170
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,460
So, deliver it to Hyeongnim without anyone knowing.

171
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,220
 They have Maiden Myeong Yun. 

172
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,920
 I met Maiden Myeong Yun at their hideout in the mountains. 

173
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,380
 But I am sure they relocated her after I left. 

174
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,250
I must meet the chief scholar and the chief censor in private.

175
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,990
Commoner Yun conspired with her father to entrap the king.

176
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,120
And to hide her crime, she murdered the Main Hall's food taster, which is a capital crime in itself.

177
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,010
It is only right to order her death by poison.

178
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,460
Please consider accordingly.

179
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,330
 Please consider accordingly! 

180
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,350
Are there any other opinions?

181
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,640
Your Majesty, Yun's son, Yi Yeong, also defied the royal decree

182
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,780
and entered the capital instead of leaving!

183
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,400
You must also order Yi Yeong's death by poison, to show the authority of the royal decree!

184
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,060
Please consider accordingly!

185
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,420
 Please consider accordingly! 

186
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,430
I will consider it.

187
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,760
Your Majesty!

188
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,100
Let us end today's assembly here.

189
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,530
You all can leave now.

190
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,770
We must prevent death by poison, must we not?

191
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,060
Can we prevent it by trying?

192
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,140
We will only get on His Majesty's bad side for nothing.

193
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,170
Do you not know you are already on his bad side?

194
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,320
Wait, Mayor of Hanyang, how did you—

195
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,090
Did you call him over, Your Excellency?

196
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,800
Does it matter who invited me over?

197
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,830
Resolving this situation is what matters.

198
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,640
I am going to take my leave.

199
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,300
When the king was still the crown prince,

200
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,060
we all framed him as a traitor. Did you forget?

201
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,330
At that time, all of us Westerners were branded already.

202
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:20,740
On top of that, His Excellency Munhyeong, his grandfather, was murdered, too.

203
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,510
Don't you understand the king's intentions?

204
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,560
Isn't it his intention to join forces with the Southerners

205
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,380
to kill all of us Westerners?

206
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:40,450
If you want to live, follow me and the left state councilor.

207
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,800
If Her Highness the Queen and Grand Prince Do Seong are killed,

208
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,750
even my lady is not guaranteed to be safe.

209
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,480
Please bring back my lady from the palace now.

210
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,620
She could get hurt if she gets mixed up in the rebellion or can become a hostage.

211
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,250
Do you still not know the king?

212
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,480
As long as the king is in the palace, Myeong Yun will not get hurt.

213
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,580
If the rebellion succeeds, we will meet again safely.

214
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,040
Even if it fails, for the king to justify sparing Myeong Yun,

215
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,380
it is better for her to distance herself from me.

216
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,870
It is better to leave Myeong Yun as is.

217
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,720
However, if the rebellion...

218
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,490
happens to fail,

219
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,790
you should be the one to kill me.

220
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,960
What are you saying?

221
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,120
Even if she thinks of me as her enemy, I am her father.

222
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,500
Could Myeong Yun possibly live happily with the king who killed her father?

223
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,730
She will probably live in agonizing guilt

224
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:03,090
for the rest of her life, just as I did.

225
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:08,090
Rather than that, wouldn't it be better for Myeong Yun

226
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,610
if you take my life instead?

227
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,500
Are the preparations done?

228
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,960
Yes.

229
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,750
Let's go.

230
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,810
We will succeed, no matter what.

231
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,300
So that we can drive out the reckless king and the Southerners

232
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,830
and rescue Her Highness the Queen, who is confined under probation.

233
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,320
What are you all so anxious about?

234
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,900
We already succeeded once, did we not?

235
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,310
We even received the grand queen dowager's permission in advance

236
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,670
and Grand Prince Do Seong, the grand king's son, is on our side.

237
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,120
Please have faith in me and follow me.

238
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,510
I will make sure to repay you.

239
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,480
I will write my name first.

240
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,040
  Yi Yeong 

241
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,140
All right, now. As we promised,

242
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,400
- we must succeed. 
 - Yes, I understand.

243
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,790
All right. Let's go, then.

244
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,610
On which day should we start the rebellion?

245
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,560
They say you must strike while the iron is hot.

246
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,270
What about the night of the day

247
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,900
the grand king leaves for Onyang?

248
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:26,150
The soldiers will be split in half to escort the grand king's journey.

249
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,380
So that would be the best.

250
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,780
What is your opinion?

251
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,140
I will do as you say, Grandfather.

252
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,270
This is my earnest plea.

253
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:59,600
Please forget about court matters and focus on resting.

254
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,500
I am leaving with my mind free of worries because you are king.

255
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,450
Yes.

256
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,360
I will wait and firmly believe that you will return in good health.

257
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,200
 Geon. 

258
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,570
 Yes, Father. 

259
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,290
 Can you promise me 

260
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,920
 that you will protect your mother and your brother, no matter 

261
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,510
 what may happen in the future, without wavering? 

262
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,290
 Please do not worry, Father. 

263
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,010
 I will protect Mother and my brother without fail. 

264
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,180
 Please have trust in me. 

265
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,060
When the drum announces the Fifth Hours, 
  (3:00 a.m. - 5:00 a.m.) 

266
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,760
our men will open up the palace gates.

267
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,450
The royal guards went with the previous king,

268
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,440
but how will we take on the Loyal Justice Army?

269
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,020
We will poison their food.

270
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,960
- This is the best! 
 - Gosh, thank you!

271
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,480
Gosh, thank you!

272
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,680
 The poison is not strong enough to cause death. 

273
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,110
 But it will cause vomiting and diarrhea, so they will be weakened. 

274
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,770
If we leave at the Fourth Hour, we can arrive at the Fifth Hour.

275
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,060
So, make sure to count your soldiers one more time before then.

276
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:51,250
You do not even have soldiers to count. Where are you going, Grand Prince?

277
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,700
I have to use the outhouse.

278
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,600
Please wait for me!

279
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,960
I also suddenly have to pee.

280
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,850
I do not see the chief of the patrol guard.

281
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,590
You do not see him? What do you mean?

282
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,360
I think he disappeared with his men.

283
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,790
Something does not seem right.

284
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,420
Bring me the mayor.

285
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,170
- Cheol Du! 
 - Yes.

286
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,900
Alcohol! Bring me more alcohol!

287
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
Yes, Your Highness.

288
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
You should stop drinking now.

289
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,530
If you get drunk on a day like this, it will be troublesome!

290
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,240
I need to get drunk because it is a day like today.

291
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,220
Even if I have the most vicious resolve,

292
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,650
do you think I can kill my brother with a sober mind?

293
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,630
Your Excellency, my master would like to see you briefly.

294
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,520
Me?

295
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,060
This is chrysanthemum tea.

296
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,790
It eases nervousness and reduces anxiety.

297
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,850
I prepared it since drinking it on a day like today will help you.

298
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,630
You suddenly asked for me, so I thought you had something to tell me.

299
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,980
I suddenly thought of you when I was about to drink alone,

300
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,820
so I asked him to bring you here.

301
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,150
I apologize if I inconvenienced you.

302
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,560
No need.

303
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,850
You called me over as a kind gesture. I will drink with gratitude.

304
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:27,630
Does this really help ease anxiety?

305
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,740
The taste is quite...

306
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,480
What did you put in the tea?

307
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,070
I mixed in some poison.

308
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,480
This is the antidote.

309
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,840
Where did the chief of the patrol guard go with his men?

310
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,270
There are less than two hours left until the rebellion.

311
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,420
Confess why he left the hideout without anyone knowing.

312
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,670
Do you wish to die?

313
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,730
In that case, you can die.

314
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,340
He went to kill the queen dowager.

315
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,570
I-I will tell you everything, so give me the antidote—

316
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,300
You sent the chief of the patrol guard to the queen dowager's palace?

317
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,600
How many did you send?

318
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,780
Speak the truth right now if you want to live! Now!

319
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,240
The antidote—

320
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,610
Your Highness, the grand king left the capital.

321
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,160
We should also start moving, then.

322
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,780
- Did you take care of things outside? 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

323
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,220
I have made it so we will not be watched until the shift changes.

324
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,470
Everything will work out well.

325
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,300
You must trust the inspector general.

326
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:05,310
All right. Everyone, raise your glasses!

327
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,290
Let us drive out the tyrant, Yi Geon, who does not hesitate to commit

328
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,760
the unfilial crime of expelling his own mother!

329
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,460
- Drive him out! 
  - Drive him out! 

330
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,670
Traitors, you are under arrest!

331
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,960
H-How is this possible?

332
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,650
Stop them!

333
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,120
Gosh, my stomach!

334
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,470
My stomach!

335
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,230
Gosh, my stomach!

336
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,030
 You can get a taste of this. 

337
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,880
Yes, I have drugged the alcohol.

338
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:11,690
I have done so much for you and our clan.

339
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,460
Hand over the antidote right now!

340
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,490
If you do not, I will kill Myeong Yun.

341
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,250
Here comes Maiden Myeong Yun!

342
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,530
Did you think a rebellion joined with a filthy greed for power would succeed?

343
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:51,550
I am only ashamed to be called your grandson.

344
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,720
Everyone, drop your weapons and surrender.

345
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,980
Those who surrender will face a lesser punishment!

346
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,960
Arrest them all!

347
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,760
Your Majesty.

348
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,390
Choi Sang Rok is not here.

349
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,680
I will come with you.

350
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,660
What will happen to the things here if you come with me?

351
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,450
The chief royal guard is here.

352
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,540
Do you think the chief royal guard can replace me?

353
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,730
You are the only one who can replace me.

354
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,920
I understand.

355
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,210
I am counting on you.

356
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,620
What are you all doing? Protect Her Highness!

357
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,150
Court Lady Kim!

358
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,190
- Orabeoni! 
 - Hurry up and escort her to safety.

359
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,230
O-Orabeoni!

360
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,690
Orabeoni!

361
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,300
- Orabeoni! 
 - You cannot!

362
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,470
Orabeoni!

363
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,340
Orabeoni! Orabeoni.

364
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,840
You cannot. Please. Orabeoni!

365
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,400
Orabeoni! You cannot, Orabeoni!

366
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,210
Please... Please!

367
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,270
The king has?

368
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,390
Let us retreat.

369
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,890
Take Her Highness with you and leave.

370
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,130
I refuse.

371
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,950
If you are not coming with me, I will die here with you.

372
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,470
This is the end for me.

373
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,330
Go on now.

374
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,360
I am not leaving alone.

375
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,520
I will not go!

376
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,250
I devoted my entire life to save you.

377
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,790
Please do not make my death go to waste.

378
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,880
Orabeoni!

379
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,020
Your Highness, you must think of the child in your womb.

380
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,150
Su Ryeon.

381
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,450
You must save our baby.

382
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,530
Are you telling me to give birth to a fatherless child?

383
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,890
Please do not do this.

384
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,830
You know I cannot live without you.

385
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,660
So how can you do this?

386
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,340
Please, Orabeoni. Please come with me.

387
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,780
Orabeoni, you cannot. Come with me, Orabeoni.

388
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,530
- Stop right there! 
 - Please.

389
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,850
Mu Baek!

390
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,000
You must go.

391
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:49,010
♫  How much longer must I live until I can forget?  ♫

392
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,940
Go.

393
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:03,060
♫  I am looking only at you with a blank stare  ♫

394
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,420
Orabeoni!

♫  Like the faint moonlight there   ♫

396

398
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,430
Please spare the queen dowager's life.

399
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,790
Please spare...

400
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,060
Su Ryeon has not done anything wrong.

401
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,840
It was all my doing.

402
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:48,680
That woman's only crime is having loved a man.

403
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,450
Your Majesty!

404
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,400
Please have mercy.

405

00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,620
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

423
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,390
Her Highness Queen Dowager...

424
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,570
♫  the tears flow ...  ♫

425
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:53,720
was murdered tonight by the traitors...

426
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,170
who infiltrated the palace.

427
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,940
Do you understand?

428
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,690
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

429
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,070
 They ended up that way for plotting treason. 

430
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,940
 Gosh, just look at that bastard. 

431
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,190
 What did the country do so wrong that you would revolt? 

432
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,350
 - They deserve to die. 
 - They are evil beings! 

433
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:36,160
 Please order the commoner Yun and Yi Yeong, her son, to die as well! 

434
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,170
- I do not want to hear it. 
 - Your Majesty!

435
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,910
Enough!

436
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,820
Bring me the royal axe.

437
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,270
From now on, if you wish to speak of harming someone,

438
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:27,690
you will have to put your neck on the line first!

439
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,490
Your Majesty, why are you trying to rule the Royal Court with fear?

440
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,580
Please be generous and wise.

441
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,150
 Please be generous and wise! 

442
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:45,540
How can you ask that only I be generous and wise?

443
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,320
Reflect on yourselves!

444
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,500
He is going too far! An axe inside the Royal Court?

445
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,430
He is telling us to shut up and do as he says!

446
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,750
He must have his reasons for doing so.

447
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,190
You should be more prudent, Inspector General.

448
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,020
Still, Choi Sang Rok's daughter should die. Don't you think so?

449
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,790
She is a traitor's daughter!

450
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,470
Are you out of your mind?

451
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:16,870
Don't you know that woman is His Majesty's trigger for fury?

452
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,680
T-Trigger for fury?

453
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,520
If you are dense, you should at least be informed.

454
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,220
This man is bound to get into deep trouble.

455
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,070
Let's go.

456
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,180
Hey, there.

457
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,230
- M-Me? 
 - Gosh!

458
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:56,230
You are to come into my room tonight.

459
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,280
Why are you not answering?

460
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,190
I am not an gwangi.

461
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,460
Please excuse me now. 
   Gwangi: enslaved courtesan owned by the government) 

462
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,080
Now, now! You are quite the difficult one.

463
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,450
You look prettier the more I look. You are—

464
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,000
Blood?

465
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,700
- Has this wench gone mad— 
 - Gone mad?

466
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,200
You have gone mad.

467
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,380
- Come with me, you lunatic. 
 - M-My ear—

468
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,720
Geez!

469
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,220
My Lady, are you all right?

470
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,950
This happens all the time. Let's go.

471
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,050
The king is so harsh.

472
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,070
Did he forget about my lady now?

473
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,520
 This is a letter from the grand queen dowager. 

474
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,880
Choi Sang Rok left behind the cure for Father.

475
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,550
Pardon?

476
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:08,660
I must get the cure made and send it to Onyang right now.

477
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,250
Tell His Majesty this.

478
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:32,090
If he does not order selections and accept a queen right now,

479
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,250
I will not take the cure.

480
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,320
Do you understand?

481
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

482
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,650
Your Majesty, you must quickly accept a queen and make your heirs prosperous.

483
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,020
Please consider accordingly.

484
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:54,010
 Please consider accordingly! 

485
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:59,240
Your Majesty, if there is anything you want, please give the word.

486
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,090
We will listen carefully.

487
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,420
Regarding marriage prohibition.

488
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,840
Is it necessary to order a marriage prohibition at the time of a queen selection?

489
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,090
This custom seems to be full of flaws.

490
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:18,270
Then, if we abolish marriage prohibition,

491
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,830
would you be interested in taking a queen?

492
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:25,920
Well, I cannot postpone marriage forever.

493
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,410
You may all leave.

494
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,060
The one on the left looks too grim, so I do not like her.

495
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,230
Too grim?

496
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,980
The one in the middle has a square face, so I do not like her.

497
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,450
A square face, huh.

498
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:15,210
The one on the right looks too innocent, without any resolve.

499
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,160
Next.

500
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,970
You may all leave.

501
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,650
- Next. 
 - Y-You may all leave.

502
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,030
Next!

503
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,030
Next!

504
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,130
You may all leave.

505
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,680
- Next. 
 - You may all leave.

506
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,940
Next.

507
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,300
They were the last group of ladies.

508
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,960
- Already? 
 - With marriage prohibition abolished,

509
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,240
the number of families who sent their sajudanja has decreased. 
  (Marriage proposal letter) 

510
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,410
Not a single lady in the entire Joseon is to my liking.

511
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:20,700
And I cannot just marry anyone, either.

512
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,740
It is such a shame.

513
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,950
Head Eunuch, tell the chief royal secretary to close down the Royal Wedding Agency.

514
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

515
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:37,560
Therefore, find out other such evil practices,

516
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,740
so people's lives can improve quickly.

517
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:46,290
 Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty! 

518
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,640
Also, to celebrate His Majesty Grand King's recovery,

519
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,190
Commoner Yun will be reinstated as queen dowager

520
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,540
and Grand Prince Do Seong is reinstated as well.

521
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,030
Your Majesty, you cannot—

522
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,790
After much careful thinking,

523
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,380
I believe it is right to abolish guilt by association.

524
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,030
If we leave guilt by association as is,

525
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:19,040
Grand Prince Do Seong, the grandson of the traitor Yun Yi Gyeom, would also be a criminal.

526
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,290
If Grand Prince Do Seong is a criminal, I would also be a criminal.

527
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,150
That is a completely absurd statement.

528
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,990
A criminal? How can you say such a terrible thing?

529
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:32,750
That is why I am saying we should abolish guilt by association.

530
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,250
What do you all think?

531
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:40,170
 Please abolish guilt by association! 

532
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,040
- Congrat— 
 - Congratulations!

533
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,020
Congratulations!

534
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,340
Guilt by association was abolished,

535
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,680
so you were reinstated, Maiden!

536
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,810
My Lady!

537
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,710
Congratulations!

538
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:24,610
I will give you the reward I promised.

539
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,200
What is it you want?

540
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,160
My only wish is to be able to treat patients my whole life.

541

Is Gab Seok out there?

544
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,890
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

545
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,020
Summon Do Seong.

546
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,410
Your Majesty.

547
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,330
Your Majesty!

548
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:12,850
 From now on, you are the king of this country, Joseon. 

549
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:15,500
I already told the chief scholar and the chief censor.

550
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,160
They will take care of the transfer.

551
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:26,250
Right. I am taking a few mapaes with me, just so you know.

I am leaving Joseon in your hands.

560

The guilty shall step forward and be arrested!

561
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,340
I do not know what you heard from where,

562
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,820
but I have never deceived my patients or extorted their money.

563
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,750
Come on! How dare you give excuses?

564
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,880
If you do not want to die, serve me tonight in bed.

I said serve me tonight in bed.

567
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:45,120
If you do so, I will let you off the hook.

568
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,200
What will you do?

569

Father.

589
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:44,140
Have you been well?

Yes.

Did you visit your father?

Yes.

593
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,510
There is someone who wishes to see you.

594
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,580
Would you like to?

595
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,240
Is she here?

596
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,000
Are you feeling all right?

00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,450
I am fine.

How have you been doing so far?

599
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,320
I have been doing well.

600
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:38,400
Yes, that is good.

601
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,750
So your father can also—

602
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,020
I am sorry.

603
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,370
You do not look too well.

604
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,910
Will you allow me to check your pulse, please?

605
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,000
Do you think...

606
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,610
you can forgive me?

607
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,080
I should not have said that.

608
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:31,440
Myeong Yun, I am...

609

I did not know before.

But now that I think about it,

611
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:44,200
I realized the two of you were...

612
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:49,790

forgive you someday...

00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,940
somehow.

617
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,200

It is fine.

♫  Like the moon waning there  ♫

648
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:06,700
♫  because it hurts to hear you saying you love me  ♫

649
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:14,160
♫  the tears flow and I cry as if my breath were taken awaye  ♫

650
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,170
♫  I want to look at you  ♫

651
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:21,840
♫  I want to embrace  you  ♫

652
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:29,160
♫  Destroy it.  Because I think it's a wind filled with longing coming to me  ♫

653
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:35,890
Your Majesty, this woman has decided to follow the Buddhist path.

654
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:38,370
Please have mercy on me

655
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:41,310
and allow me to serve the two of them from here

656
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,840
while repenting the sins of my previous days.

657
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,830
You may do so.

658
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:49,680
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

659
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,450
We should also get going.

660
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:23,230
Is he coming with us, too?

661
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,880
Of course, he will go where my lady goes.

662
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,250
I do not understand how he stayed apart for so long.

663
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,150
My Lady!

664
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:38,840
Hurray, hurray. What a great life.

665
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,910
Hurray, how great.

666
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:57,410
Golden cups full of blood

667
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,600
and jade trays full of sweat!

668
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,000
The alcohol in your golden cups is the people's blood.

669
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,310
The meat in your jade trays is the people's sweat.

670
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,420
Candles cry the people's tears

671
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,750
and there is loud singing over the resentment.

672
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,840
When your candles melt down, people's tears fall.

673
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,540
Wherever there is loud singing, there is also just as much...

674
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,450
resentment.

675
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:23,590
J-Just look at those lunatics!

676
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:28,040
Hear ye! Take those rascals away right now!

677
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,900
The secret royal inspector has—

678
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,220
Oh, my. O-Oh, my!

679
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,770
My Lady!

680
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,990
My Lady!

681
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,760
It has not been that long since the last one.

682
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,550
Please go easy on them!

683
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,870
Did Brother beat up the governors again?

684
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:38,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

685
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:44,630
Urgent requests for governors are raining down.

686
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,120
There are two requests from Jeolla-do alone.

687
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,650
Three from Gyeongsang-do, and Chungcheong-do is a bit...

688
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,650
Enough. Enough!

689
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,410
I cannot do this anymore.

690
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:08,560
He's dead.

691
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:11,750

693

694
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:41,170
Please come out and help!

695
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,910
My sister-in-law has peed.

696
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:49,350
 Get her changed quickly and come out to help. 

697
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:59,240
Please go back to sleep. All right?

698
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,940
All right.

699
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,520
Where did Gab Seok and Mu Baek go?

700
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,900
They went to buy medicinal herbs.

701
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,900
All right. What do you need help with?

702
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:35,180
Please take a look at us, too.

703
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,120
F-Father! M-Mother!

704

705
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:57,290
It is fine. Be at ease.

706
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,700
Grandpa is here!

707
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:07,310
Have you been well?

708
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:11,860
Yes. Have you also been well, Mother and Father?

709
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:15,500
Yes. You must be having a tough time.

710
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,650
Peekaboo.

711

His Majesty is coming to get you, Your Majesty Grand King.

Your Majesty, stop right there!
