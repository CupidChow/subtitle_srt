00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,410
 Missing Crown Prince

 Suho

 Hong Ye Ji

00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,120
 Myung Se Bin 

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,160
 Kim Joo Heon 

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,080
 Kim Min Kyu 

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:36,070

 Missing Crown Prince 

9
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,820
 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts. 

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,060
 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines. 

11
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,490
Why are you trying to deceive me?

12
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,100
You woke up too early.

13
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,460
Sang Rok.

14
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,160
You will have to sleep a bit longer, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,820
 Hearing his daughter would become a widow otherwise. 

16
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,770
 So, feel pity for my father, whose judgment was clouded briefly because of his child 

17
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,710
 Feel pity? 

18
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,170
 Can you say the same thing even if your father has committed murder? 

19
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,790
 Episode 11 

20
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,450
Was my father the one who poisoned His Majesty?

21
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,080
I heard the Inspector General entered the bedchambers—

22
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,360
Please tell me honestly, without hiding anything.

23
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,200
Did my father poison ...

24
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,040
Did he really...

25
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,400
do that to His Majesty?

26
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,140
That is correct.

27
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,120
It was all your father's doing, Maiden.

28
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,070
My Lady, where have you been?

29
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,070
I thought something happened to you. Do you know how worried I was?

30
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,690
My Lady, are you all right?

31
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,610
Her Highness the Queen Dowager wants to see you.

32
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,120
Please come with me.

33
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,260
I will escort you.

34
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,630
You really grew up fine.

35
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,690
We met once when you were young. Do you remember?

36
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,580
I apologize.

37
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,500
Not at all.

38
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,060
You were young, and we only brushed past each other.

39
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,900
It is natural for you not to remember.

40
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,040
I will be by your side all the time.

41
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,590
So, consider me your birth mother

42
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,750
and come running to me whenever you are having a hard time.

43
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,190
Thank you for your grace, Your Highness.

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,470
I am going to take care of the preparations for your wedding myself.

45
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,610
So, do not worry about a thing and get some rest now.

46
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,000
The queen and the grand prince are both good people.

47
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,950
So, do not be too concerned and have faith

48
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,490
in your father's decision.

49
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,130
Stop crying now.

50
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,190
You have a joyful event coming up.

51
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,050
Come closer.

52
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,240
 You woke up too early. 

53
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,170
 You will have to sleep a bit longer, Your Majesty. 

54
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,270
Do you fear your own father?

55
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,280
I understand how you feel.

56
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,310
But today is the last day I can treat you as my daughter.

57
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,720
So, please stop crying now

58
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,190
and look at your father.

59
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,840
There are many reasons

60
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,650
why I am forcing you to marry Grand Prince Do Seong even when you refused.

61
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,070
But I cannot explain them all to you right now.

62
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,800
However, if I had not trusted Grand Prince Do Seong's character,

63
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,910
I would not have forced you to marry him.

64
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,910
His feelings toward  you are one thing.

65
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,960
But, judging from the Grand Prince's character as a man,

66
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,650
I am sure he will not make you miserable, at the very least.

67
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,820
So, I am trying to press on this marriage.

68
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,970
I will not ask you to understand me.

69
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:24,480
However, no parent in this world would wish for their child to end up miserable.

70
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,950
 Victory of Virtue Gate 

71
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,990
 Gwanghamun (South Gate, Main Gate of Gongbuk Palace) 

72
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,980
Kneel down.

73
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,400
Lower your heads.

74
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,760
Stand up!

75
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,500
There is an order from the king.

76
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,720
Kneel down.

77
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,280
Why is he not here?

78
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,370
He will be here.

79
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,970
He will come for sure.

80
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,870
Her Highness the Queen Dowager has spoken.

81
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,990
Strengthening a country truly depends on its crown prince.

82
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,670
And no one is better suited to be the king than the prince.

83
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:05,120
Hence, he is finally placed in the crown prince's palace, and proclaimed worthy.

84
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,670
You, Prince Yi Yeong, inherited your ancestor's excellent essence.

85
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:17,280
So, you were born with many blessings and good qualities.

86
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,900
Your character is gentle and refined.

87
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:28,340
Your innate filial piety for your parents and affection for siblings has been shown since you were young.

88
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,980
Therefore, based on your qualifications and according to the customs,

89
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,600
it is ordered  that you be made the crown prince.

90
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,630
You shall listen, Choi.

91
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,610
You, Choi, have been raised well by a generationally loyal family,

92
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,560
granting you a kind and dignified character.

93
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,130
You cannot go inside.

94
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,160
Open the door.

95
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,200
You cannot go inside.

96
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,800
- Let's all go in!
 -  Yes! 

97
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,550
Hence, with the wedding ritual

98
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,740
you will be invested

99
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,720
the crown princess.

100
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,700
Once they receive the appointment letter, it cannot be undone.

101
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,420
Why is he still not here?

102
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,660
Stop!

103
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,800
I, the crown prince of this country, am alive and well.

104
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,490
And His Majesty's will is with me here.

105
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,450
Who dares to steal His Majesty's name to appoint a crown prince?

106
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,490
It is all over now.

107
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,440
Hyeong-nim is back.

108
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,400
Stand up.

109
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,160
These are all fake!

110
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,720
Is that not true?

111
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,400
Why are you not answering me?

112
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,520
Is that royal seal truly the royal seal?

113
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,450
That means the royal seal has been fake-

114
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,770
Who fabricated the royal seal, then?

115
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,660
Come to your senses!

116
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,880
Whether the royal seal is real or fake,

117
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:03,330
that man is not the crown prince, but a traitor who attempted to murder His Majesty!

118
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,720
The Mayor of Hanyang is right.

119
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,240
He must be taken away right now!

120
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,100
Hear ye! Take that traitor away immediately—

121
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,420
Shut your mouth!

122
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,850
G-Grand Prince.

123
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,780
Stay silent and wait for His Highness' words. Do you understand?

124
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,520
Yes.

125
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,840
Bring in the criminal!

126
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,110
I-Is that not the Main Hall's food taster who was known to be dead?

127
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,470
The fact the Main Hall's food taster is alive

128
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,680
proves His Highness was falsely accused.

129
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,220
A capital interrogation must be opened to clearly determine

130
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,570
who falsely claimed the food taster's death and hid her away,

131
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,170
the reason the traitor attempted

132
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,230
to poison His Majesty to death, and the reason

133
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,470
he falsely accused the crown prince!

134
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,630
His Excellency Munhyeong is correct.

135
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,810
The fact that the criminal is alive

136
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:59,080
proves the crown prince has nothing to do with the poisoning of His Majesty.

137
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,430
He is right! The Crown Prince was falsely accused!

138
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,910
We must immediately discuss the crown prince's reinstatement.

139
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,500
Your Highness!

140
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,740
Nothing has been revealed yet.

141
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,660
Isn't it too soon to discuss his reinstatement?

142
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,850
We must first torture that wench to lay out the course of events!

143
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,580
I agree with you.

144
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,800
It seems Her Highness was greatly shocked by this sudden happening.

145
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,700
Let's first go discuss the matter at the Conference Hall.

146
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,040
Let's all head there!

147
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,750
- All right.
 - Let's go!

148
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,130
Hyeong-nim!

149
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,260
I am so glad you came back safely.

150
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,920
I am sorry you had to protect Father and Mother alone.

151
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,290
So why did you come so late?

152
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,150
It felt like an eternity waiting for you.

153
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,190
I am sorry.

154
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,900
I must let Mother know you came back as well.

155
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,270
I will escort her here, so please wait a moment.

156
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,860
It's been a while.

157
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,040
Have you been well?

158
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,980
Yes, Your Highness.

159
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,160
You must get going now.

160
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,910
Your Highness, did you see her?

161
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,450
Baek Gu- I-I mean, Oh Wol is not the servant.

162
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,350
I know.

163
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,690
Pardon?

164
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,760
S-Since when?

165
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,130
Crown Prince!

166
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,160
Crown Prince!

167
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,930
Mother.

168
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,430
Thank you so much, dear heavens.

169
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,340
Thank you so much for safely sending the Crown Prince back.

170
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,190
Mother.

171
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,530
Are you not injured anywhere?

172
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:04,080
I am fine. It is thanks to your concern.

173
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,430
How hard must it have been for you

174
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,420
because of this terrible son of yours?

175
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,590
Not at all.

176
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,870
I am more than thankful enough to have you back safely.

177
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,060
Mother.

178
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,380
Why are you both crying on such a joyous day?

179
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,820
We should laugh.

180
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,590
How did the left state councillor join the crown prince's side?

181
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,670
I am sure he knows

182
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:58,680
the queen will also be in trouble if the food taster confesses the truth.

183
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,970
I am sure the crown prince has Yun Yi Gyeom's grandmother's slave documents.

184
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:10,610
There is no other reason for the left state councillor to side with them.

185
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,800
How much does the food taster know?

186
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,040
She knows everything.

187
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,780
Your Highness.

188
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,910
I heard Father has been safe thanks to you, Chief Royal Guard.

189
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,770
Thank you.

190
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,370
I am undeserving of such praise, Your Highness.

191
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,230
Please go inside.

192
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,180
Why is there such a thing covering Father's face?

193
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:24,530
It is a device the inspector general made for treatment.

194
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,650
- Choi Sang Rok did?
 - Yes.

195
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,220
He treated him with that device when his life was in peril.

196
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,850
That is when he started getting better, so we could not remove it.

197
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,650
Please remove it for a moment.

198
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,110
I must see Father's face.

199
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,350
Yes, Your Highness.

200
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,310
Father.

201
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,080
Your unworthy son,

202
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,540
Geon is here.

203
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,880
You ... can hear me, right?

204
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,720
If yes, you should reprimand me.

205
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:47,800
You should reprimand me for coming so late

206
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,070
and for coming only now, Father.

207
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,590
There is not much time left now.

208
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,640
Please ...

209
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,700
Please endure a bit longer, Father.

210
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,170
Reinstate the deposed crown prince?

211
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,270
The crown prince Her Highness appointed was Grand Prince Do Seong.

212
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,270
The investiture ceremony was halted.

213
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:40,400
The crown prince appointed by His Majesty clearly exists.

214
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,660
He was deposed for the capital crime of attempting to poison His Majesty.

215
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,930
So what use is that?

216
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,060
It was already revealed that he was falsely accused.

217
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,380
We did not even start the interrogations! What are you saying was revealed?

218
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,700
Stop trying to hide the obvious!

219
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,550
What did you say?

220
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,540
Your Excellency!

221
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,610
Let us stop now.

222
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,380
What would be the use of us talking here all day?

223
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,910
Let us ask Her Highness the Queen Dowager

224
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:17,740
to start the capital interrogations on the food taster as soon as dawn breaks tomorrow.

225
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,920
That would be the best idea.

226
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,570
Let us get going now.

227
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,950
You should pull yourselves together.

228
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:41,170
We deposed the crown prince with our hands.

229
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,690
If the deposed crown prince takes the throne,

230
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:48,200
do you think our heads would still remain attached to our necks?

231
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,830
The only way for us to survive is to make sure Grand Prince Do Seong

232
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,190
becomes the crown prince, whatever it takes.

233
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,260
Do you understand?

234
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,300
I do not want to hear about doing something to the food taster.

235
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,860
So, do not even mention it.

236
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,630
Do you trust the crown prince that much?

237
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:40,700
Yes, Hyeong-nim will protect my mother and me, no matter what.

238
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,260
In that case, what about your grandfather?

239
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,050
When you entered the palace with Hyeong-nim,

240
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,160
did he not make a promise to you?

241
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,890
Do you know why I entered the palace with the crown prince?

242
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:08,560
The crown prince threatened me last night with your maternal great-great grandmother's

243
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,910
slave documents, telling me to find the food taster.

244
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,370
How does he know about that matter?

245
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,310
Do you think the slave documents that no one knew about fell out of the sky?

246
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:25,720
I am sure Lord Munhyeong is the one who gave the crown prince the slave documents

247
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,830
and made him submit the accusation to the Jangyewon*.
 (Government office in charge of all matters regarding slaves.) 

248
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,880
Do you understand what I mean?

249
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,770
The crown prince you trust so firmly, knew it would be problematic

250
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:42,960
for you and Her Highness, if our family is known to be descended from a slave,

251
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,910
however he still brought on about this scheme.

252
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,700
I am sure it was not Hyeong-nim's intention.

253
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,340
Also, I am sure he knew it would get silenced like this.

254
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,790
- Grand Prince—
 - I trust Hyeong-nim!

255
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:03,400
So, please stop trying to shake up my relationship with him!

256
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,500
I am not telling you to stop trusting the crown prince.

257
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,730
Do you think I wouldn't know what kind of a person the crown prince is?

258
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,950
Just as I am trying to get rid of the crown prince for your sake,

259
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:22,760
Lord Munhyeong, that man, can also do worse things than slave documents,

260
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,080
if it means he can get rid of you for his grandson's sake.

261
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,040
Regardless of what you say, I trust Hyeong-nim.

262
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,230
Please excuse me.

263
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,210
Did you finish talking to Father?

264
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,770
- Yes.
- We should go and have a drink, then.

265
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,520
Let us stop by just one more place.

266
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,840
We still have faces we must see.

267
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,760
What are you doing? Announce His Highness' arrival right now!

268
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,100
I meant to come to see you,

269
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,610
but the two of you happened to be together.

270
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,100
You will not even stand up now?

271
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:49,390
The two of you did not pay your respects to Her Highness, either.

272
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,930
- What did you say?
 - Let us sit.

273
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,780
I will have the criminal interrogated first thing tomorrow through Capital Interrogations.

274
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,660
I believe you will allow it.

275
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,840
Once the interrogations are over,

276
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:18,340
I will identify every single traitor who tried to poison His Majesty at the assembly,

277
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,570
in front of every official.

278
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:37,640
You can still regret your crimes sincerely and restore Father back to his healthy self.

279
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,560
I will then protect your honor and dignity as the Queen Dowager.

280
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,500
If you refuse,

281
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,730
your adultery and affairs with this man will be exposed to the entire world

282
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:58,830
and you will remain as the most shameful and evil woman in this country's history.

283
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,160
Do not be so quick

284
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,690
to measure us and our long years with your yardstick.

285
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,420
Even if you denounce it as adultery and an affair,

286
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,320
the fact our love was sincere does not change.

287
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,460
This man will not admit it!

288
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:23,370
Let's see if you can still say that when your neck is hanging above the streets.

289
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,420
It is not over yet.

290
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,320
Just because you got hold of the food taster,

291
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,540
don't be mistaken and think the deposed crown prince's name will be cleared.

292
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,450
Can you guarantee the food taster will open her mouth?

293
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,490
Even if she does open her mouth,

294
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,830
are you certain she will not

295
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:50,870
take the crown prince, Grand Prince Do Seong, or Her Highness the Queen with her?

296
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,260
It seems you want to give your final struggle.

297
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,070
But the end of this fight has already been decided.

298
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,970
So go ahead and try everything you can.

299
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:10,620
I will do everything within my power to face you.

300
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,690
I clearly understand what you two intend.

301
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,230
- Hyeong-nim!
 - Instead ...

302
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,630
I will promise you this one thing.

303
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:28,330
You will pay for this. Not more or less than what you did to us,

304
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:32,980
just as much as the suffering Do Seong and I endured,

305
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,260
only as much as the miserable times Father and Mother spent.

306
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,570
I will make sure to pay you back.

307
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,790
 Crown Prince's Palace 

308
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,220
His Excellency Munhyeong, the censor, and the deputy chief scholar are waiting inside.

309
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,880
The chief royal guard came as well.

310
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,470
All right.

311
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,620
- Let us go inside.
 - I will not.

312
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,810
They must be waiting to discuss matters with you. So you can go inside.

313
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,980
There is nothing to hide from you. We will go in together.

314
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,440
You know I hate sitting down for a long time.

315
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,160
I will spend the night at the palace today and leave tomorrow.

316
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,710
So let's have a drink together later tonight.

317
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,920
I understand. I will see you later, then.

318
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,630
Yes, Hyeong-nim.

319
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,830
Regarding Maiden Myeong Yun ...

320
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,970
I was too busy to take care of her.

321
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,590
You do not need to say more.

322
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,430
I think the same way you do about protecting her, Hyeong-nim.

323
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,190
All right. I see.

324
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,290
I don't know what you will think about it—

325
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,690
Do not worry and go on inside.

326
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,770
I will make sure to take good care of Maiden Myeong Yun.

327
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,720
Yes. I will leave it to you.

328
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,300
Cheol Du!

329
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,710
Yes.

330
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,190
Find out Maiden Myeong Yun's whereabouts.

331
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,720
It is such a relief, though.

332
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,760
Since the wedding was halted, your marriage is more or less called off.

333
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,090
My Lady?

334
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,570
Huh? Yes.

335
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,550
You were also thinking about the scholar—

336
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,270
I mean, the crown prince, right?

337
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,980
Seriously, even I am in disbelief, so you must have it worse.

338
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,210
My goodness.

339
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:02,280
To think the scholar was the crown prince ...

340
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,170
How could such a thing happen?

341
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:10,280
I was told the messenger said that the prince was arrested and getting transferred.

342
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,640
It was a fake message.

343
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,730
He was safe.

344
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:21,440
By the way, what will happen to the master now?

345
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,230
It was also found out the master is the one who kidnapped the crown prince.

346
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,050
It is all my fault.

347
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:42,760
When you said the food taster must be gotten rid of altogether,

348
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,650
I should not have stopped you.

349
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,760
How can you say such things?

350
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,320
I am the one who decided to spare the food taster.

351
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,350
Not at all.

352
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,960
I know you decided so for my sake

353
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,730
because I implored you too persistently.

354
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,120
Because of me, even you, Orabeoni—

355
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,990
Your Highness, you must stay strong.

356
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:14,310
Nothing has happened yet.

357
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:19,810
Yes. Please endure a bit longer.

358
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,930
I will find a way to stop them by any means.

359
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:41,000
Getting rid of the food taster is the only way out of this now, is it not?

360
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,070
That will not be so easy anymore, either.

361
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:47,970
Would they not know that is our only option?

362
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:52,400
I am sure getting prepared for that is the first thing they are doing.

363
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,870
You are the only one I can trust, Chief Royal Guard.

364
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,770
We do not know what queen dowager may do,

365
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,710
so please protect the food taster.

366
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,030
Yes, Your Highness!

367
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,340
However, Teacher, if the food taster confesses,

368
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,710
the crown prince's false accusation will be cleared for sure.

369
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,580
But the queen's palace is also—

370
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,460
I mean, Left State Councillor Yun Yi Gyeom was also involved in this matter.

371
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,370
Of course, we will have to do away with Left State Councillor Yyn Yi Gyeom.

372
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,170
He falsely accused the crown prince.

373
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,470
The problem is Her Highness the Queen.

374
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,510
I am sure that  it will be disputed.

375
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:38,460
One should be punished for his crimes, irrespective of rank.

376
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,090
No matter who it is, even Her Highness the Queen,

377
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,860
must be punished if they committed a crime.

378
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,820
That cannot be.

379
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,140
- Your Highness!
 - I will never allow it.

380
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,650
Please do not mention it ever again.

381
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,120
Royal Mother did not know anything.

382
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,260
She was deceived by the queen dowager's blackmailing.

383
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:04,230
However, the queen's palace also assisted in falsely accusing you.

384
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:08,380
It was not the queen's palace. It was the left state councillor's sole doing.

385
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,750
However, Your Highness—

386
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,930
I said I will not allow it!

387
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,240
Our goal is the queen dowager and Choi Sang Rok.

388
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,470
It is not the queen's palace.

389
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,820
I will end this discussion with the left state councillor's dismissal.

390
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,210
Do you understand?

391
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,950
- Yes, Your Highness.
 - Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,850
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

393
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,720
You two can go ahead.

394
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,370
His Highness did not let me utter a word, so I could not ask.

395
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:58,430
If we just reveal the queen dowager's adultery with Choi Sang Rok,

396
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:02,020
there would be no need for these headaches, right?

397
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:13,220
It was the queen dowager who made His Majesty the king through a rebellion.

398
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,800
What do you think will happen if that queen dowager

399
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,770
is found to be a lewd woman who committed an immoral act?

400
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,850
I think the throne's authority will be shaken.

401
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,830
Correct.

402
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:44,090
His Majesty's legitimacy will be questioned.

403
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,080
The traitors are still waiting eagerly for an opportunity.

404
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,450
So, we can never let the throne's authority be called into question.

405
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,960
Yes.

406
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,850
Royal Father.

407
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:09,550
You are happy that Hyeong-nim came back safely, right?

408
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,870
Now ...

409
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,690
everything will find its rightful place.

410
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,460
Since Hyeong-nim came back, I will now

411
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,880
go back to being the playful Do Seong

412
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,510
and live freely.

413
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,030
Since I have had my share of hardship so far,

414
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,170
you will at least allow that much, right?

415
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,400
 No matter who it is, even Her Highness, 

416
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,720
 must be punished if they committed a crime. 

417
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,970
Is the meeting over?

418
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,510
Yes.

419
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,260
Why? Is there something you need to tell me?

420
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,050
I do not.

421
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:17,770
I have to be at the prison cell, so please excuse me.

422
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,490
It has been a long time.

423
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:06,140
I did not think I would be seeing you over a matter of this nature.

424
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,710
I will keep it short and cut to the chase.

425
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,460
If you wish His Majesty to be restored to health,

426
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,410
please overlook the matter regarding the food taster.

427
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,270
Do you even hear yourself?

428
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,830
How can you dare speak of His Majesty's health in this manner?

429
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:34,390
I am sure you know the extent of things I have done

430
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,390
to protect the queen dowager's well-being.

431
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,780
Please give this careful thought.

432
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,250
Should the queen dowager be harmed in the slightest way,

433
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:52,010
His Majesty will also pass away.

434
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:58,330
I will now take my leave.

435
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,220
Look here.

436
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,530
No matter what you say, my decision remains the same.

437
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,250
So do not try to convince me.

438
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,540
I am not going to convince you.

439
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:35,380
I came to correct you because you seem to be mistaken about something.

440
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,100
You can do as you please.

441
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,780
From what I know, His Majesty

442
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,320
would be willing to sacrifice his life for the crown prince.

443
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:54,840
He would never wish to be taken hostage by you and save his life by these pathetic means.

444
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:59,550
However, if His Majesty passes away,

445
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,950
you will have to meet your consequences.

446
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,450
Not just you and the queen dowager.

447
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,130
It will be everyone, including your daughter.

448
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,160
Do you understand?

449
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,780
If you want to at least save the queen dowager's life,

450
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,050
hand over the antidote.

451
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,810
Right now.

452
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,630
I do not think ...

453
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,630
there is any other way.

454
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,580
You still have the antidote.

455
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,920
With that, at least the queen dowager can—

456
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,000
Even if I hand over the antidote, he will kill us all.

457
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,710
Even if His Majesty dies without the antidote,

458
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:06,570
he made it clear he would never forgive us.

459
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:10,080
Did the crown prince really say so?

460
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,460
It was His Excellency Munhyeong.

461
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,270
You know what kind of man Munhyeong is.

462
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:20,510
Even if the skies were to split, he would never change his conviction.

463
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,700
There is only one option left now.

464
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,120
Taking Su Ryeon and escaping the palace.

465
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,660
Will you help?

466
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,970
Do you have a way to make it safely out of the palace?

467
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,840
I could not execute it because I could not guarantee success.

468
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:49,320
I have been thinking about this countless times over the years.

469
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:53,360
Yes. I understand.

470
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,060
Su Ryeon may not want to escape

471
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,740
in case something might happen to me.

472
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:04,040
I will do whatever it takes to convince Her Highness.

473
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:09,470
I will also make sure to stall them, to give you the time to escape the palace.

474
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:12,230
What are you saying? If you stay behind alone—

475
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,100
You cannot be concerned with my life right now.

476
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:19,480
Her Highness' safety is in peril.

477
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:26,650
I will trust you and make the preparations, then.

478
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,600
Yes, I will also prepare and wait for you.

479
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,750
Please send me word.

480
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:42,440
Are you telling me to run away right now?

481
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:48,150
The inspector general said this is the only way.

482
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,960
Your Highness, leaving the palace was your lifelong wish, was it not?

483
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,980
The inspector general said he is finally doing what he has been wishing to do for thirty years.

484
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,580
However, in case they find us—

485
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:11,140
Your Highness, you must have faith in the inspector general.

486
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:15,280
Would the inspector general have come to a rash conclusion

487
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,490
when he is more concerned about your safety  than anyone?

488
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:26,050
- What about you?
 - I will follow you right after.

489
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:31,600
Who would be able to serve you if I am not there?

490
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,370
Please hurry.

491
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,670
Where is Orabeoni?

492
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,210
Get changed.

493
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:49,980
You will not be noticed while you roam around the palace.

494
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:59,100
This is a pass for entering and leaving the palace. Use it when necessary.

495
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,140
Listen carefully to what I am about to say,

496
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,580
and do not make a single mistake in carrying it out.

497
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,840
I am prepared to accept any punishment.

498
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,130
If you only let Myeong Yun escape the palace safely—

499
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:33,780
If I do, will you hand over the antidote?

500
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,950
After Myeong Yun leaves the palace safely, yes, I will give it to you.

501
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,750
Do you expect me to believe that?

502
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,920
Though the wedding was halted,

503
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,820
Myeong Yun is more or less your wife, Grand Prince.

504
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:56,370
Please have pity on Myeong Yun, for she can go through hardship

505
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,100
because of her father's sin.

506
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,180
So please help her out.

507
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,260
Notify me first if anyone tries to come inside.

508
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,160
Yes, Your Highness.

509
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,660
I am sure your day was long,

510
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,540
but my day was truly just as long.

511
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,580
When I opened my eyes in the morning,

512
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,420
the only thing I could think about was coming back to the palace today.

513
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:03,410
I did not know if I wanted to stop

514
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,610
the crown prince investiture

515
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,720
or the wedding.

516
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,070
However, now that I am in front of you,

517
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,370
I think I know which one it is.

518
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,990
I am sorry.

519
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:29,630
I should not have said that.

520
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,560
Did you get to meet His Majesty?

521
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,810
I did see him.

522
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,260
Has his condition improved?

523
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:44,300
You already knew my father was ill?

524
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:50,020
I also know it was my father's doing.

525
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,180
Did you hear it from Do Seong?

526
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:01,830
I secretly ... entered the Main Hall last night and found out.

527
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:04,270
You entered the Main Hall?

528
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,160
Why did you do such a reckless thing?

529
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,150
If someone finds out, who knows what will happen to you!

530
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,090
If I consider what my father did,

531
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,800
I already deserve punishment from the heavens.

532
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,440
Why would I worry about what could happen to me?

533
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,320
Did you not think it could

534
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,330
be a concern for me?

535
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:35,300
For now, let us put out the more urgent fire first.

536
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,480
I am sure you were expecting this,

537
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,800
but if the food taster confesses tomorrow,

538
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,190
there will be another tempest inside the palace.

539
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:46,250
So you must escape the palace for now.

540
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,940
I will look for a chance to get you to leave the palace—

541
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:54,300
I apologize, but I do not intend to leave the palace.

542
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,750
I cannot do that.

543
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,150
What are you saying?

544
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,920
- If you stay here like this—
 - I know.

545
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,220
It's because I know that I cannot leave.

546
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,230
- Maiden!
 - Even if he is a criminal who deserves death, he is my father.

547
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,570
As his daughter, how can I escape alone to save myself?

548
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:18,470
Are you telling me to just watch, when I know

549
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:21,370
you will be in harm's way?

550
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,770
If you help me escape, you will also be put in a difficult position.

551
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,300
Knowing that, how can I—

552
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,300
Whatever difficulty may come, it is my share to shoulder.

553
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,580
Are you insane? Remember where you are.

554
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,380
This is an urgent matter.

555
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,250
Your Highness!

556
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:06,260
I told you not to let anyone in.

557
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:14,720
Your Highness, I think the queen dowager escaped with the inspector general.

558
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:31,790


559
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,750
It is now the Second Hours*.
  (9:00 p.m. - 11:00 p.m.) 

560
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,060
You must get going now.

561
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,070
By myself? I will not.

562
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,880
I cannot go until the inspector general comes.

563
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,550
He sternly ordered me to leave with you first if the promised time passed.

564
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,080
I said I will not go.

565
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:57,640
He also chose a spot where you can meet, just in case.

566
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,410
So the master will come there with my lady.

567
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:05,830
If the inspector general fails to escape the palace, what will happen then?

568
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,240
That will not be so.

569
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,720
However, if you do not go,

570
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,940
the master in the face of danger will return to the palace again.

571
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,240
So please come with me now.

572
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,880
What kind of rude act is this?

573
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,460
I am still this country's queen dowager!

574
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:27,310
Mind your manners!

575
01:01:54,810 --> 01:02:01,020
♫  In a long memory  ♫

576
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:06,320
♫  I'm searching for you, blurry in the distance  ♫

577
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,180
♫  Where is all the longing,   ♫

578
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,120
 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview  

579
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,910
 Is this why you tried to kill His Highness the Crown Prince? 

580
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:17,670
 We have to distinguish who the real crown prince is, right? 

581
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:21,580
 I meant it when I said I do not wish to harm you. 

582
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,450
 You promised me... 

583
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:26,140
 that we will live happily ever after in the next life. 

584
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:29,470
 Munhyeong will also try to get rid of Grand Prince Do Seong. 

585
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:31,570
 The food taster was murdered. 

586
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:34,460
 I heard the culprit is the deposed crown prince. 

587
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,650
 You are right. It was my doing. 

588
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:41,760
♫  You are too far away for me to get closer  ♫
