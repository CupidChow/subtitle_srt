 Episode 4 

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,320
Who are you?

13
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,160
How did you come here?

14
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,540
You must hurry.

15
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,080
Let us hurry.

16
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,330
What exactly is your identity?

17
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,330
Who are you?

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,020
Can you not tell me the truth right now

19
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,330
Please let go of my hand first.

20
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,500
Reveal your identity first.

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,670
Who are you?

22
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,010
Fine.

23
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,770
Just tell me how you knew I was locked up in here.

24
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,370
My lady told me.

25
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,920
I was only doing as my lady ordered.

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,880
Are you telling me that everything you have done for me thus far

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,550
were all orders from your mistress?

28
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,660
- Yes. 
 - How did your lady know

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,620
to send you every time I was in danger?

30
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,110
Did I ever do anything to harm you, Scholar sir?

31
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,310
As you said, I only helped you out.

32
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,170
Why are you doing this to me?

33
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,100
I have to know at least whether you are on my side or not so I can follow you!

34
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,330
Please let's just go.

35
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,120
They will catch us again at this rate.

36
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,680
Save your fights for later.

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,550
Let's get going for now, shall we?

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,420
Let's take a break here.

39
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,870
Are you all right?

40
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,200
It is endurable. Don't worry.

41
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,300
Let me see your wound for a moment.

42
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,980
It is fine.

43
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,170
Do you think I enjoy doing this?

44
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,230
That is why I said it is fine.

45
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,990
Did I tell you to do it?

46
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,100
Stop being childish.

47
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,390
- What did you say? 
 - What else is this but being a child?

48
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,850
Do you think I will reveal my identity if you do this?

49
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,430
You know medicine, you're good at horse riding, and even fighting.

50
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,170
And you have a way with words.

51
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,240
I am sure there's no other servant girl like you in Joseon.

52
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,110
Please get some sleep. You must recover your energy first.

53
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,180
Let me ask you this...

54
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,530
for the last time.

55
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,220
Were they really all orders from your lady?

56
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,720
Yes.

57
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,790
You're saying it was all because your lady ordered you

58
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:17,480
and not even an inkling of your will was involved. Right?

59
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,360
Yes.

60
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,530
All right. You can leave now.

61
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,640
I must rest.

62
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,060
It is my fault for letting my guard down.

63
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,030
I should have been more careful.

64
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,870
It is my fault. Please forgive me.

65
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,780
In any case, she is your superior.

66
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,050
So how could you stop her?

67
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,450
It is my fault for not supervising my daughter in the first place.

68
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,160
If I could find out where she hid himâ€”

69
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,360
How will you find that out?

70
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,020
Should we torture Myeong Yun or something?

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,040
 Father, it's Myeong Yun. 

72
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,830
 Have you no shame? 

73
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,130
 Did you think you could keep the ugly secret by killing me? 

74
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,800
 I will kill everyone who knows the secret if the crown prince is not enough. 

75
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,550
 She is truly a lecherous and filthy monster. 

76
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,020
 Do you recognize this needle case? 

77
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,210
 I gave out this needle case to all the physicians at the Royal Clinic. 

78
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,690
 I would like to find the owner of this item. Can you help me? 

79
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,570
 I only helped you out. Why are you doing this to me? 

80
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,430
 I have to know at least whether you are on my side or not so I can follow you! 

81
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,660
 Remember this. 

82
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,420
 From your mouth lies the safety  

83
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,930
 of the king, the queen, and also Prince Do Seong. 

84
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,360
 Yes. 

85
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,220
I did free that man.

86
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,120
He is a lucky man, for sure,

87
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,080
since he survives every time, thanks to you.

88
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,320
If he were so lucky, he would not have been kidnapped in the first place.

89
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,710
Kidnapping was done for your sake.

90
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,320
I am aware.

91
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,730
I know you made a tough decision for me, Father.

92
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,120
I helped him escape because I knew that.

93
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,320
You have been saving lives all your life.

94
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,770
I could not just sit and watch you...

95
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,200
get blood on your hands because of me.

96
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,120
I know your personality.

97
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,410
So I will not make an issue of what has passed.

98
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,550
However, this is enough.

99
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,140
Where are you hiding that man?

100
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,710
I am asking what you did to that man.

101
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,430
I freed him, so he could live. Why are you asking me to put him back in danger?

102
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,660
Are you asking because you really do not know?

103
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,790
The moment he runs his mouth, let alone the crown princess selectionâ€”

104
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,020
I will not try for the crown princess selection.

105
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,860
Whether it was kidnapping or not, I have already come in contact with a manâ€”

106
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,780
Take your leave now.

107
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,020
- Father. 
 - Enough!

108
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,670
I told you to take your leave now!

109
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,710
Father.

110
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,380
The heavens and the earth know I do not qualify to become the crown princess.

111
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,390
Why are you telling me to look the other way?

112
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,000
Mu Baek, are you outside? Escort your lady to her room right now!

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,700
I am... asking you because

114
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,010
I am too afraid and do not have the confidence to handle it.

115
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,780
How can I dare to deceive the crown prince, the heir to the nation, and marry him?

116
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,600
I am going to spend the rest of my life treating the sick by your side.

117
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,560
Attempting to mock the royal family and injuring an innocent person is a crime for which

118
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,820
I will live the rest of my life alone in atonement.

119
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,590
Please stop going after that man as well, Father.

120
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,920
The master is really too harsh.

121
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,490
You did not do anything wrong.

122
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,510
Of course, I did wrong.

123
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,820
All of this started because of me.

124
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,100
That is not true!

125
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,010
All this started because the master kidnapped the scholar in the first place.

126
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,470
If I were not born with such a terrible fate,

127
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,410
Father would not have had to do something so absurd as kidnapping.

128
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:10,290
My lady, you said you don't believe in things like fate.

129
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,190
I do not. I do not, but...

130
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,500
But seeing how all this happened even before I got married,

131
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,150
it looks as if my fate is not one to walk on a flowery path.

132
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,270
My lady ...

133
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,120
Please do not worry too much.

134
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,450
I will stand guard in front of the lady's room all nightâ€”

135
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,680
It's fine.

136
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,750
However, that is the only way to find the crown prince.

137
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,200
She is a clever child.

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,580
If she senses anyone spying on her,

139
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,690
she will not make her move so easily.

140
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,360
What should I do, then?

141
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,920
Just let her be.

142
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,150
Until she thinks it is safe and goes to meet the crown prince on her own.

143
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,040
Your Majesty.

144
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,280
The chief royal secretary passed away suddenly.

145
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,270
What do you mean?

146
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,340
Passed away suddenly?

147
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,350
How can such a thing happen?

148
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,970
It happened overnight.

149
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,280
I have not heard the details yet.

150
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
Did you ever tell anyone else...

151
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,230
about the things you discussed with me?

152
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,560
Which thing are you referring to?

153
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,460
I told you last time that I had the chief royal secretary

154
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,330
send a letter to the chief military training officer.

155
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,900
I am asking if you told anyone else about that.

156
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Why are you not answering me?

157
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,380
Did you or did you not?

158
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,530
To be honest,

159
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:30,520
Royal Mother was too anxious to sleep, so I was trying to reassure her.

160
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,500
Since the queen found out, the left state councilor must know about it, too.

161
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,390
Is that why such a woeful thing happened?

162
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,660
The chief royal secretary died.

163
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,640
Even before the letter was sent to the chief military training officer,

164
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,690
the chief royal secretary died before doing that.

165
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,930
Did you tell Grandfather, Royal Mother?

166
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,210
Tell him what?

167
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:08,100
You are the only one to whom I told that Father gave a letter to the chief royal secretary.

168
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,740
It seems Grandfather knows it as well.

169
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,510
Well, I was onlyâ€”

170
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,640
Since Father had come just in time...

171
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,950
Also, the crown prince disappeared and the palace felt so chaotic.

172
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,220
Father seemed to be gravely worried. That is whyâ€”

173
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,630
The chief royal secretary died!

174
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,240
You are in the presence of Her Highness!

175
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,280
Lower your voice.

176
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,660
Someone killed the chief royal secretary to prevent the royal decree of mobilizing the soldiers from reaching the chief officer.

177
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,620
However, that someone is among Father, Mother, myself,

178
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,000
and Grandfather. It is the four of us.

179
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,400
Only the four of us know such an order was given to the chief royal secretary.

180
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,020
F-Father...

181
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,590
Why did you do that?

182
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,890
Were you following the queen dowager's orders?

183
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,130
What is the price of being the queen dowager's henchman? How much did you get paid?

184
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,350
Yes, I was paid.

185
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,610
Do you want to know what I received?

186
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:13,760
I got the lives of the grand prince and Her Highness guaranteed.

187
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,900
The two of you have no idea of what a frightening person the queen dowager is.

188
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,260
Do you know how the deposed king lost his throne?

189
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,350
If the queen dowager decides it,

190
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,260
His Majesty can be dethroned at once, just like the deposed king.

191
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,950
Do you think such a person would not be able to harm Her Highness the Queen?

192
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:41,530
What matters to me is not His Majesty or the crown prince.

193
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,020
It is the grand prince and Your Highness.

194
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,220
Father, how can you say such a thing?

195
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,880
You also need to come to your senses too, Your Highness.

196
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,220
What would Grand Prince Do Seong gain by siding with His Majesty right now?

197
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,240
Father, please watch what you say!

198
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,410
I told you the queen dowager promised me.

199
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,210
If we just stay put and silent,

200
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,120
she would make the grand prince into the crown prince.

201
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,880
No, I am not interested in becoming the queen dowager's puppet like you, Grandfather!

202
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,080
Grand Prince, you need to stop as well.

203
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,980
You are being too stubborn.

204
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,710
His Majesty cannot help but worry because the crown prince's life is on the line.

205
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,230
But why don't you understand that you are different?

206
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,310
What is so different?

207
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,700
You have me.

208
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,010
Your grandfather.

209
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,840
What do you mean by that?

210
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,170
As for the queen dowager,

211
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,330
once the grand prince becomes the king,

212
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,510
she could just be killed.

213
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,910
Why are you outside?

214
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,900
It felt too stuffy. I am getting some fresh air.

215
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,110
Are you feeling better?

216
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,240
Yes, I am. Everything has healed.

217
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,710
She is way prettier than that lady.

218
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,470
What?

219
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,190
Are you not waiting for Baek Gu or whatever her name is?

220
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,580
Who is waiting for her?

221
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,830
So, how did you take care of the matter?

222
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,630
Were you able to reach Sang Su?

223
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,600
We meet here again.

224
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,500
They say repeated coincidences are fate.

225
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,200
Since we keep running into each other, it seems our relationship...

226
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,920
is not an ordinary one.

227
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,980
You could greet me, at the very least.

228
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,690
People might think I am flirting with someone I just met.

229
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,090
Someone must be sick again.

230
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,060
Please excuse me.

231
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,830
Please step aside. Many eyes are watching.

232
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,600
Just like at your house last time,

233
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,610
even the winter wind could not be this cold.

234
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,430
I am so sad.

235
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,320
Don't you know why I am doing this?

236
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,730
I know.

237
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,740
I know you have feelings for me.

238
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,340
And if that is the case,

239
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,780
does it mean you do not like me, Maiden?

240
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,720
I already have someone I am to marry.

241
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,380
Hence, please change your mind and look for someone else.

242
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,470
 My lady, please take a look at Ae Sim. 

243
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,500
 Why? What is her ailment? 

244
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,090
 She must have a severe indigestion. Her chest is tight and her head aches. 

245
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,940
It seems she has acute indigestion. I will give her acupuncture therapy.

246
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,420
My lady.

247
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,150
Is he here?

248
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,920
- Where is he? 
 - I don't know, either.

249
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,520
As you can see, it seems he already left.

250
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,190
If you cannot believe me, feel free to keep looking.

251
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,820
The crown prince has already escaped.

252
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,290
It looks like we lost him.

253
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,200
We were one step behind.

254
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,120
I apologize.

255
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,500
Go find out where Grand Prince Do Seong is.

256
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,000
 Were you following the queen dowager's orders? 

257
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,170
 What is the price of being the queen dowager's henchman? How much did you get paid? 

258
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,700
 Yes, I was paid. 

259
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,310
 I got the lives of the grand prince and Her Highness guaranteed. 

260
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,940
 The two of you 

261
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,060
 have no idea what a frightening person the queen dowager is. 

262
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:04,490
 Do you think such a person would not be able to harm Her Highness? 

263
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,850
 Please pardon me for a moment. 

264
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,200
What brings you to a place like this, Royal Physician?

265
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,150
I came out for a home visit and heard you are here, Grand Prince. So, I stopped by.

266
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,380
I see.

267
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,250
Please take a seat.

268
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,970
By the way, do you even do home visits to a courtesan house?

269
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,800
A physician goes wherever there is a patient.

270
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,000
This must be why the people respect and follow you, Royal Physician.

271
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,370
Would you like a drink?

272
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,130
I am fine.

273
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,120
I will ask you one thing and leave.

274
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,350
Do you happen to have feelings for my Myeong Yun?

275
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,120
I am talking about my daughter.

276
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,810
Did he really leave?

277
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,300
No way. Without even a word?

278
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,960
That cannot be, right?

279
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,050
Is he fearless or stupid?

280
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,030
If Father catches him again, it is over.

281
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,530
What is he planning to do?

282
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:48,590
All right. Just come back, and I will get you!

283
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,170
Gosh... I hope nothing happens to him.

284
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,740
Please kill me, Your Highness.

285
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,060
It is fine.

286
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,500
I heard about your circumstances from Gab Seok.

287
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,100
- You can raise your head. 
 - No, Your Highness!

288
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,870
A eunuch who is supposed to serve you with his life caused harm to your body.

289
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,910
I deserve to die a hundred times over.

290
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,840
Please do not forgive this sin and have me killed.

291
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,700
All right.

292
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,600
I have many things to ask you.

293
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,980
I will hear your answers first and decide whether to kill you or not.

294
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,710
For now, answer my questions.

295
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,930
What did you just say?

296
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,390
The chief royal secretary is not the only one who died,

297
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,660
but the food tester at the queen's palace was also poisoned?

298
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,150
Yes, Your Highness.

299
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,380
My mother. Is Mother unharmed?

300
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:26,690
Yes. However, she was quite shocked.

301
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,970
I heard she is still having a hard time.

302
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,470
Since then, Court Lady Kim of the queen dowager's palace

303
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,780
is in frequent contact with the left state councilor.

304
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,120
Then, the incident at the queen's palace could have been

305
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:46,360
planned by the queen dowager from the beginning with the left state councilor's betrayal.

306
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,170
You need to be careful as well.

307
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,800
Once they find out you let me live, they will not leave you alone.

308
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,820
I do not care about what happens to me.

309
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:04,310
However, even though I am spying on the queen dowager's palace, seeing that there is no problem,

310
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,610
it seems they are still unaware.

311
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,190
I would be glad if that is the case.

312
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,000
More importantly, Your Highness,

313
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,010
I heard the queen dowager met a man at Buyong Pavilion yet again.

314
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,860
A man?

315
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,060
Physician Heo died, though.

316
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,820
But she met a man? Are you certain?

317
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:33,070
Yes, I am certain since a palace maid from the queen dowager's palace told me.

318
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,230
 A palace maid from the queen dowager's palace? 

319
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,160
She must be on the queen dowager's side.

320
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,880
How can we trust her?

321
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,540
It might be another lie or trap.

322
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,910
Your Highness, that palace maid is the one

323
00:28:54,910 --> 00:29:00,120
who first informed you about the queen dowager's secret affair.

324
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,720
Your Highness, not everyone at the queen dowager's palace is on her side.

325
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:26,530
Just like myself, some follow their orders to save their pitiful lives

326
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,880
or only pretend to follow their orders.

327
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,860
I also don't think all those people in the palace are on the queen dowager's side.

328
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,660
However, if what that palace maid said is true,

329
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,070
the man who I saw must have been...

330
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,640
Your pulse is slow.

331
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,010
Your pulse needs to be stabilized first. I will administer acupuncture therapy.

332
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,240
Please go ahead.

333
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,180
 The deposed king had only treacherous subjects near him 

334
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,180
 so I thought he did not have a good eye for people. 

335
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,320
 But it seems he did look right through you. 

336
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,060
 As it turns out, Prince Gwang Chang is mixed with the dirty blood of the man you had an affair withâ€” 

337
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,190
 Shut your mouth! 

338
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,750
 You must truly have a death wish. 

339
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,900
 Did you not intend to kill me anyway? 

340
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,940
One chi and five pun on Fei Shu. 
  (1 chi = 3 cm, 1 poon = 0.3 cm, acupuncture point) 

341
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,140
Stop.

342
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,240
Everyone except the royal physician may leave.

343
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,710
Your Highness!

344
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,330
You can stay outside for a moment, too.

345
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,810
Yes, Your Highness.

346
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,250
If you run your mouth without caution,

347
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,770
your tongues will be cut, and your eyes will be gouged out.

348
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,740
Do you understand?

349
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,240
 Yes, ma'am. 

350
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,720
You can come closer.

351
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,180
Why are you doing this?

352
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,840
You have endured well thus far. Just a little longerâ€”

353
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,460
I cannot do this anymore.

354
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,260
I was going to endure it by any means.

355
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,320
But whenever I close my eyes,

356
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,310
Physician Heo and... the chief royal secretary come to my mind.

357
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,840
I cannot even breathe.

358
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,190
Su Ryeon.

359
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,880
Orabeoni.

360
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,600
Can we just run away to a place far away and live in hiding?

361
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,380
Let's just do that.

362
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,270
I only need you, Orabeoni.

363
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,710
You also said I am all you need.

364
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,200
Do you think I have not thought about that?

365
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,050
When you became the queen by marrying the previous king,

366
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,550
when you were locked up by the deposed king,

367
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:22,600
and when you were restored as the queen dowager,

368
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,220
I always wanted to run away with you.

369
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,830
We can still run away.

370
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,420
We just need to run away.

371
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:38,000
We could probably get out of the palace, but...

372
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,150
they will chase us to the end, and

373
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,390
will find us and kill us.

374
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,620
I do not care.

375
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,770
Even if only for a day,

376
00:34:52,570 --> 00:35:01,190
if I can live peacefully as your wife by your side,

377
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,630
I can die right now.

378
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,990
How could you speak of death so easily?

379
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,890
Saying so is denying thirty years of my life.

380
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,000
Orabeoni.

381
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,100
I went through so much to endure those long years. Those hellish days.

382
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,510
Do you think I will let you die?

383
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Even if my head will hang above the marketplace,

384
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,160
I will protect you without fail.

385
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,880
The left state councilor Yun Yi Gyeom has joined our side.

386
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,000
His Majesty is more or less tied down.

387
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,770
Can we trust the left state councilor?

388
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:26,930
We can probably trust him until Grand Prince Do Seong becomes the crown prince.

389
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,270
As long as he cannot give up on making Grand Prince Do Seong the king,

390
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,170
he will not betray us.

391
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,570
Will Grand Prince Do Seong willingly do as we wish?

392
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,630
He thinks dearly of the crown prince, more than if he were his blood brother.

393
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,290
When a man holds a woman dear to his heart,

394
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,410
many things change for him.

395
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,510
He will let go of things he could not,

396
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,860
and do things he could not do before.

397
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:59,470
Not all men's affections are as deep as yours, Orabeoni.

398
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:04,500
Do not worry. I confirmed it already with my own eyes.

399
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,340
Who is the woman Grand Prince Do Seong has feelings for

400
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,290
that you are so certain?

401
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,090
My Myeong Yun.

402
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,670
How could Myeong Yunâ€”  Myeong Yun is to become the crown princessâ€”

403
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,790
That means...

404
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,510
Since he has feelings for a woman who is to become the crown princess,

405
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:27,140
he must become the crown prince if he desires that woman.

406
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:32,140
How could he defy the queen dowager, who would make him the crown prince?

407
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,790
Myeong Yun can definitely

408
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,040
make the grand prince Do Seong turn his back on the crown prince.

409
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,360
He must do more than turn his back.

410
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,630
We have to make him strike with a dagger.

411
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,430
If it wasn't Physician Heo,

412
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,230
does the acupuncture needle case belong to someone else?

413
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,700
I am so hungry. You must be very hungry, too, Young Master.

414
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:11,530
Why did Physician Heo decide to take his own life now, of all days?

415
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,020
- Why? 
 - Should we go and ask the cook for some food?

416
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,110
Though it is a bit late...

417
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,650
You must not sleep with an empty stomach.

418
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,780
You must take your herbal tonic, too.

419
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,340
Brew it yourself.

420
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,490
Are you upset with me?

421
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,480
Why would I be?

422
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,680
You are upset.

423
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,990
Did you wait long?

424
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,390
Why would I wait for you?

425
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,150
Then, why are you still here?

426
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,270
Where on earth did you wander all day?

427
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,610
W-Wander all day?

428
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,870
Are you trying to get hurt again in that condition?

429
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,690
Are you still unable to come to your senses after having a hard time?

430
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,780
- Hard time? 
 - Forget it.

431
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,600
I will no longer worry about your life, so do whatever you want!

432
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,710
My Baek Gu.

433
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,010
You must have been very worried about me.

434
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,390
Yes. You got stabbed recently and disappeared without a word.

435
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,810
You did not come back for two hours, and I did not hear from you for four hours.

436
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,130
How could I not worry if you were dead or alive?

437
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,980
Be careful until your wound is all healed.

438
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,900
Diligently drink your herbal tonics and live a long, healthy life.

439
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,590
I am sorry.

440
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,110
I had to go somewhere urgently.

441
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,790
I did not consider how you might feel.

442
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,020
I am sorry, so please forgive me now.

443
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,240
If you are truly sorry, make a promise to me first.

444
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,380
A promise?

445
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,520
Until I say it is safe,

446
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,780
promise me you will not venture outside again.

447
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,810
All right. I promise you.

448
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:05,180
I also have a favor to ask.

449
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,600
Go ahead.

450
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,900
Can I take just one more trip outside, please?

451
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,250
Should I just do it?

452
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,680
I am still a patient.

453
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,010
Just once.

454
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,160
Just once.

455
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,840
 Physician Heo Jin Su's House of Mourning 

456
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,650
Gosh, you are so slow!

457
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,360
Do you want us to get caught as thieves?

458
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,020
Go faster!

459
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,420
Do you want us to get caught as thieves?

460
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,680
There is nothing to fear.

461
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,260
I am standing guard right here.

462
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,290
That is not it.

463
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,180
I have never done an autopsy before.

464
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,890
So, I could be wrong.

465
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,550
I told you, did I not?

466
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:51,050
I only need to find out if he was killed or took his own life.

467
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,930
Based on the locations of the livor mortis,

468
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,570
he did not take his own life.

469
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,830
Look here.

470
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,260
Someone probably killed him with poison

471
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,910
and hung him to make it look like suicide.

472
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,770
Why are you so shocked to hear that I will meet Do Seong?

473
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,670
You cannot.

474
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,220
The entire palace knows you are very close to Grand Prince Do Seong.

475
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,440
I am sure they have someone watching Do Seong as well.

476
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,010
You know so well, so how can you...

477
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:39,710
At this point, there is no one I can trust but Do Seong.

478
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,740
Still, it is too dangerous.

479
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,860
If Grand Prince leads someone to us...

480
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,990
If it is Do Seong, he will manage to lose any followers.

481
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:54,010
However, how will you tell him the time and location of the meeting?

482
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:00,180
We have this.

483
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:05,840
How can you send a message with this?

484
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,060
 Tongbo "Treasure" 

485
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:58,960
 I think we need a secret place only you and I know of. 

486
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,050
 A secret place? 

487
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:18,810
 Sangpyeong Tongbo, commonly called the yeopjeon - Joseon coin which was first minted in 1633 

488
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,140
 Make sure not to lose it. 

489
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,270
 We need to use it as a token in times of emergency. 

490
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,020
 - A token? 
 - Yes. 

491
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,430
 If one of us sends this to the other, 

492
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,030
 it means to meet here. 

493
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,990
 Secretly, without anyone knowing. 

494
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,760
 You are scaring me. 

495
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,650
 What are you scared of? 

496
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,930
 Why do we need a secret place suddenly 

497
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,000
 what is with half of a yeopjeon? 
  (Brass coin used as currency.)  

498
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 I told you. Why are you asking again? 

499
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,900
 Because I don't understand. Why do we need this? 

500
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:00,100
 Don't you know that royal family members are getting killed for treason? 

501
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,300
 Father might be framed as a traitor at any moment, 

502
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,200
 so we must prepare for the unforeseen. 

503
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Brother!

504
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,000
Are you injured?

505
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,710
Why did you contact me only now?

506
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,300
Were you determined to see your younger brother go insane?

507
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,300
Let's go inside first.

508
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,900
In any case, I should have looked for you first.

509
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,450
Please forgive me, Brother.

510
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,400
- Do you mean this? 
 - Pardon?

511
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,680
I am asking if you are still on my side.

512
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,900
Brother!

513
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:25,600
I was told the left state councilor has already turned to the queen dowager's side.

514
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,340
What is it you want to hear from me?

515
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,640
Since my maternal grandfather has betrayed you,

516
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,650
- are you asking if I followed him to side withâ€” 
 - Did you?

517
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,650
If you cannot trust me that much, why did you want to see me?

518
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:42,300
Did you want to see for yourself if I would

519
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,620
hand you over to them with my own hands?

520
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,500
I was told it barely missed the heart.

521
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:02,900
This is the... result of trusting my people...

522
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,900
whom I never doubted before.

523
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,600
Is that why

524
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,000
you doubted even your one and only younger brother?

525
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,500
I can give my life in exchange for yours,

526
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,710
but I did not want to die because of you.

527
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,520
- Do you understand? 
 - No, I cannot understand. Rather, I will never understand!

528
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,040
I do not care if I die because of you.

529
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,970
I would even go to hell if you asked me to, but how come youâ€”

530
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:47,780
I am sorry, Do Seong.

531
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,200
Brother.

532
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,020
I heard the temporary palace at the Mt. Bukhan Fortress is completed.

533
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:07,590
I am going to go there in person to confirm.

534
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:10,510
You are to know that.

535
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,030
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

536
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,330
 Suddenly inspecting the Mt. Bukhan Fortress? 

537
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,940
I am sure His Majesty is walking on eggshells every day, too.

538
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,970
This cannot be just a trip for formality.

539
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,280
It is not to see the temporary palace at the Mt. Bukhan Fortress.

540
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,440
He must be after the soldiers at the fortress.

541
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,300
What do we do now?

542
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,600
We do not have the military power to oppose His Majesty.

543
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,890
We must find another way besides military power.

544
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,710
His Majesty is coming out strong.

545
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:46,410
Is there really a way?

546
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,800
I think it is time for us to use our last resort.

547
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,400
Are you saying the Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok is the queen dowager's lover?

548
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,830
I could not believe it at first, either.

549
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,900
However, no matter how many times I think it over,

550
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,900
I could not come to any other conclusion.

551
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,400
Do you have the evidence?

552
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,510
The acupuncture needle case.

553
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:21,720
An acupuncture needle case was found in Buyong Pavilion, where the queen dowager had her secret tryst.

554
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,590
 Do you recognize this needle case? 

555
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,570
 I gave out this needle case to all the physicians at the Royal Clinic. 

556
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,010
 Where did you find it? 

557
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,260
 Yes, I know as well. 

558
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:44,330
I also went to Choi Sang Rok to ask who owned the acupuncture needle case, as Father ordered me to.

559
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,240
I am sure he told you Physician Heo was the owner.

560
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,240
And when you went to him to confirm...

561
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,390
 - he was already dead. 
 - Yes. 

562
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,250
So, I could not continue my task.

563
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:06,900
That is how Choi Sang Rok cut off the tail in order to hide his existence.

564
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:12,000
Brother, Physician Heo took his own life.

565
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,600
Physician Heo did not take his own life. He was killed.

566
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,800
Are you certain?

567
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,400
I may not be certain about other things,

568
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,270
 but it is certain he did not take his own life. 

569
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:28,470
However, just because Physician Heo was murdered,

570
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:32,340
it does not prove Choi Sang Rok is the lover.

571
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,900
Physician Heo and Choi Sang Rok were the only ones who frequented the queen dowager's palace.

572
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,720
But the day Choi Sang Rok told you that Physician Heo was the needle case's owner,

573
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,300
 Physician Heo was murdered. 

574
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,800
Can there be such a coincidence?

575
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,800
No. Choi Sang Rok has to be the queen dowager's lover

576
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,700
or he knows who the lover is.

577
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,900
- It is one of the two. 
 - However, Brother,

578
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,300
we only have circumstantial evidence and no substantial physical evidence.

579
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,700
If Choi Sang Rok denies it to the end, what do we do, then?

580
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,120
In any case, we will have to make him confess it with his own mouth.

581
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,740
Is there such a way?

582
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,200
Do you trust me?

583
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,100
Yes, I do not know how to doubt, unlike you.

584
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:31,650
Shall we work hand in hand, just like the old times?

585
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:37,130
Yes. Just give me your order.

586
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,720
To enter the palace from here and go to Hyeminseo, 
  (Public Health Agency) 

587
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,400
how long would it take?

588
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,900
It would take me at least half a day, would it not?

589
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,170
You should hurry up, then.

590
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,350
Did you want to see me, Queen Dowager?

591
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:14,380
Yes. I thought about it over and over all night.

592
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,310
But you were the only person who came to mind.

593
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:25,700
I think I was relying on you a lot without even knowing.

594
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,000
Thank you for your grace, Your Highness.

595
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,790
There is no one as kind and considerate as you in the Inner Court, Queen.

596
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,550
That is why...

597
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,730
I also took up courage.

598
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:45,270
I decided to extend my hand to you for the last time.

599
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:53,730
Queen, what I am about to tell you from now on is not as queen dowager.

600
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:58,590
I am speaking to you as just another woman.

601
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:04,630
So, please listen to me as just another woman.

602
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,950
Yes, Your Highness.

603
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:14,700
- Surely, His Majesty already told you I have a lover. Right? 
 - S-Sorry?

604
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,300
- Well, the thing is... 
 - Yes. That is right.

605
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:23,400
I have someone I have been in love with for a long time.

606
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:29,000
He and I were engaged and in love from a young age.

607
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,400
But the heavens disapproved of our fate.

608
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,460
In the end, I was selected as the late king's queen

609
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,850
and had to come into the palace.

610
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:47,070
And I was finally able to meet him again after a long time.

611
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,400
Ten years, twenty years,

612
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,030
thirty years...

613
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:02,100
I endured and lived through all those years

614
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:06,400
with my love for him.

615
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,300
I shed so many tears.

616
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,700
I cried and cried.

617
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:19,200
There were also many moments when I sought to end my own life.

618
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,110
I do not care what happens to me.

619
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,700
Even if the entire world will throw stones at me,

620
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,700
I am prepared to be stoned to death.

621
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,450
However, it cannot be the same for him.

622
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,700
He has not done anything wrong.

623
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:49,220
He was devoted to putting his life on the line to protect the woman he loved!

624
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,370
He has not done anything wrong.

625
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,380
Your Highness, please calm down.

626
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:58,740
Queen, I do not want power or wealth.

627
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,790
He is the only one I want.

628
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,360
To me, he is more precious than life.

629
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:10,880
So, I am trying to protect him, even if it will cost me everything.

630
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,930
Your Highness.

631
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,000
Queen, please help me.

632
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,500
I am sure His Majesty will grant you this if you plead with him.

633
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,700
I also know you do not want

634
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:33,100
a bloodbath in the palace, where His Majesty or Grand Prince Do Seong

635
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,900
might get hurt.

636
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:39,360
As long as His Majesty allows it, I will send back the crown prince...

637
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,900
and I will...

638
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,200
leave the palace.

639
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,750
I will leave the palace and go far away...

640
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:54,620
with him quietly.

641
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:00,100
We will live our whole lives hidden as if we were dead...

642
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,000
in a place where no one can find us.

643
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,960
So, please just convince His Majesty

644
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,360
to let us leave the palace.

645
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,500
His Majesty is distancing himself from me

646
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,640
because of my father these days.

647
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,690
I cannot help you even if I want to.

648
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,800
In that case,

649
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,370
please do this.

650
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:55,820
 Your Majesty, Her Highness the Queen is here. 

651
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:59,710
Let her enter.

652
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,670
What brings you here?

653
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:32,010
I was told you are not eating properly lately.

654
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:38,290
So, I prepared a few dishes that might be appetizing.

655
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,130
Queen,

656
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:52,690
did you know it shows on your face when you lie?

657
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,760
Pardon?

658
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,300
How would I dare lie to you, Your Majesty?

659
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,370
If you came to say something to me,

660
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,240
go ahead and say it.

661
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,750
Not at all.

662
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:13,140
I truly prepared a meal for you.

663
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,490
All right.

664
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,470
Tell them to bring it in.

665
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:03,660
Your Majesty, please help yourself.

666
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,050
Let us eat a bit more.

667
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:30,160
You have to eat to get better soon.

668
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,740
Here. Say, "Ah."

669
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:55,290
I came because I heard the royal physician is giving treatment today.

670
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,820
The royal physician?

671
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:00,470
Go behind that place there.

672
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,790
My lady,

673
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,590
the master has told you to go on a home visit.

674
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,400
- Where to? 
 - I will escort you.

675
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,500
Please hurry. He said it was an emergency.

676
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:23,290
Why are you not asking me anything?

677
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:27,030
Are you going to answer me honestly?

678
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,410
You already know everything, don't you?

679
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:31,470
Foolishly,

680
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:37,620
I guess I wanted to hear you deny it to the end.

681
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:45,990
Are you the man queen dowager met at Buyong Pavilion?

682
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:51,160
Yes. It was me.

683
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,060
I am the one who loved the queen dowagerâ€” No.

684
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:04,050
I have loved the woman named Min Su Ryeon for a very long time.

685
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,770
How can you be so shameless?

686
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,520
Having an affair with a nation's queen dowager,

687
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,790
killing countless people to hide that fact,

688
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:30,010
and you still think your affair can be forgiven?

689
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:33,420
If I can protect the precious person I have loved for thirty years,

690
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,270
I am capable of worse things.

691
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,260
Shut your mouth!

692
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,090
The moment you had an affair with the queen dowager,

693
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:44,470
you mocked His Majesty and insulted this nation's royal family.

694
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:47,060
How dare you call it love as you please?

695
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:50,830
The queen dowager was my fiancÃ©e.

696
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:56,870
Long before becoming the offering to the old late king, she was my woman.

697
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:02,750
It looks like you want to get the queen dowager killed as well.

698
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:07,820
Fine. I will make it so you two cannot meet even as spirits.

699
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,530
I will behead you two and tear up your bodies,

700
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:14,890
so they can be scattered all over the country to be fed to the wild beasts!

701
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:53,230
Traitor Yi Geon, accept your fate!

 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview  

715
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:52,850
 They have imprisoned the crown prince. 

716
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,700
 Don't you know I am their target? It is pointless. 

717
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,210
 Father has collapsed. 

718
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:01,260
 All hail Her Highness the Queen Dowager. 

719
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,260
 Choi Sang Rok is hereby appointed as the Inspector General. 

720
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,890
 Make them leave before I strike you all down! 

721
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,530
 Go ahead and strike me. 

722
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,170
 Please die. 

723
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:14,930
 I don't know what to do with all this anger after I die. 

724
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:16,990
 Do you really plan to die like this?
