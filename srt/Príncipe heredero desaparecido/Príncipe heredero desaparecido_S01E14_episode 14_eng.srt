00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,540
 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts.  

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,020
 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines. 

11
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,150
 Did you... 

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,000
 Myeong Yun ...

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,110
 ...murder... 

14
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,240
 Mother? 

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,630
 Yes. 

16
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,750
 You are right. 

17
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,230
 I killed her. 

18
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,750
 My Lady, are you all right? 

19
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,030
 It was because of Her Highness the Queen Dowager. 

20
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,380
 He killed his own wife because of the queen dowager. 

21
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,280
My Lady!

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,050
My Lady!

23
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,390
Oh Wol! Oh Wol!

24
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,370
My Lady.

25
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,380
 Episode 14 

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,890
 There is an old fox living inside the palace, and she is ruining Joseon. 

27
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,550
 The king is ill and the nation's heir seat is vacant. 

28
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,220
 How sad! The future of this country, Joseon, is as dark as the night. 

29
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,420
 All of this is surely the old fox's doing. 

30
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,560
 If you call yourself a man, you must rise in anger and hunt down the old fox 

31
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,510
 to rightfully protect the royal family and the nation. 

32
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,340
What are you all so worked up about?

33
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,590
The post says the old fox is ruining our country.

34
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,360
An old fox?

35
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,970
It is referring to Her Highness the queen dowager.

36
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,070
The queen dowâ€”

37
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,270
I am sure the rebellious remnants of the deposed king's men are still out there.

38
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,350
It must be so.

39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,580
We should have eradicated them.

40
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,320
And the palace being in such chaos,

41
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,730
I am worried that it might provide them with an excuse to create trouble.

42
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,680
Once the queen dowager's matter is exposed,

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,820
Father's right of rebellion in taking down the previous king will be discredited.

44
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,970
That means the traitors might gain a cause and bring about a rebellion.

45
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,400
Do you now understand why I cannot

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,480
expose the adultery of the queen dowager and Choi Sang Rok?

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,710
- Yes. 
 - The queen dowager's matter

48
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,140
must be dealt with secretly.

49
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,360
We will be harmed if we get caught up emotionally and attack first.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,240
So, make sure to keep it in mind.

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,880
Yes, I will do so, Brother.

52
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,560
 His Majesty's condition is not improving. 

53
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,710
I deem it proper to hold a rite for the heavens

54
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,440
and pardon the criminals to soothe the wrath of the heavens.

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,590
What do the grand princes think?

56
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,400
I am against that idea.

57
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,030
It is right to pardon anyone who was unjustly sentenced, through proper jurisdiction.

58
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,160
But if the criminals are pardoned,

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,090
their victims' resentment will actually reach the heavens.

60
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,960
Rather than that, it would be proper to expel court ladies instead.

61
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,920
The previous kings also attempted to soothe the heavens' wrath

62
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,660
by expelling a number of court ladies from time to time.

63
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,440
The previous kings expelled court ladies only at times of catastrophe.

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,970
What about this, then?

65
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,950
This is a report from the governor of Anju.

66
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:24,170
But it was omitted by the royal secretariat for some reason.

67
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,270
It says the people's resentment is severe because the construction

68
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,490
of Grand Prince Gwang Chang's grave and the temporary palace was rushed,

69
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,650
at a time when cold weather continues in the Anju region.

70
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,940
The report asks to allot more time for the construction.

71
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,620
After much careful thinking,

72
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,210
I believe that the construction of the grave for Grand Prince Gwang Chang, who died unjustly

73
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,240
and was a member of the royal family, should not be delayed.

74
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,150
If we expel a number of court ladies, there will be fewer expenses.

75
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,920
Thus, it will be proper to send that money to Anju to comfort the people.

76
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,530
His words are truly appropriate.

77
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,990
Please consider it accordingly!

78
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,310
 Please consider it accordingly! 

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,440
It seems this old man can go back to my hometown now.

80
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,720
I am flattered.

81
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:40,770
It would be great if we could only expel high-ranked court ladies from the queen dowager's palace,

82
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,380
but will she willingly comply when her people are being cut off?

83
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,250
I am sure the left state councilor will take care of that.

84
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,040
- Pardon? 
 - Though the queen dowager's power is ever so strong,

85
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,800
Her Highness the Queen is the leader of the Inner Court.

86
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,060
Please do not worry.

87
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,670
I formed a connection with the deputy senior court lady.

88
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,080
If she is to be made a senior court lady, she will help me.

89
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,970
Sort out the queen dowager's followers

90
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,920
and create a hit list.

91
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,210
This is silk cloth bestowed upon you by Her Royal Highness.

92
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,470
If this matter is being taken care of successfully,

93
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,960
you will become a senior court lady. 
  ("kSanggung" or palace matron, senior 5th rank, the highest attainable for them) 

94
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,610
Did you bring the list of court ladies to be expelled?

95
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,770
Here it is.

96
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,110
Court Lady Kim is not on the list.

97
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,970
I reckon the queen dowager will fight back

98
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,670
if we try to expel Court Lady Kim, too, so I took her off the list.

99
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,500
What are you doing?

100
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,100
My goodness.

101
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,840
I will have this burned, for it is unclean.

102
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,200
It seems the court ladies' discipline became quite loose.

103
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,380
I think they should be disciplined again.

104
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,530
All right.

105
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,090
Tell everyone to gather in front of the Main Hall tonight.

106
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,620
Yes, Madam.

107
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,910
You must punish Court Lady Kim, who dared to burn the silk from Your Highness

108
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,830
and let the court ladies remember you are the leader of the Inner Court.

109
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,780
I told you to take care of it yourself.

110
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,800
Do not report anything unrelated to Grand Prince Su Seong.

111
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,680
Your Majesty, Court Lady Kim did not only burn the silk.

112
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,640
She also mocked Grand Prince Su Seong in front of everyone.

113
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,960
What did you just say?

114
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,840
She dared to mock Grand Prince Su Seong?

115
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,330
You are sure this is true?

116
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,340
How could I dare to lie?

117
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,920
Court Lady Kim ripped apart the list of names,

118
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,840
which embodies Grand Prince Su Seong's order.

119
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,680
Her Royal Highness has arrived!

120
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,830
Senior Court Lady Kim of the queen dowager's palace, come forward.

121
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,700
Court Lady Kim Ye Bun is to be whipped a hundred times

122
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,080
for behaving arrogantly, trusting in her superior's power and authority.

123
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,090
What are you doing? Raise your skirt.

124
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,190
You dared to mock the crown prince

125
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,570
and you will even disobey my order now?

126
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,580
Do not let Her Highness know about this at all. Do you understand?

127
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,340
Yes, Madam.

128
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,290
Hurry up.

129
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,220
Her Highness will be asking for me.

130
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,320
What are you doing? Tighten it more!

131
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,580
Your Highness.

132
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,150
- It is nothingâ€” 
 - Whose doing is this?

133
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,200
It is a matter among the court ladies.

134
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,850
- Please do not be concernedâ€” 
 - Tell me the truth right now!

135
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,700
Your Highness.

136
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,920
Leave us.

137
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,980
I will keep it short.

138
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,460
You must have been prepared when you harmed one of my people.

139
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,000
Expel Court Lady Jo.

140
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,670
I refuse.

141
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,630
- Queen!
- I am going to expel

142
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,970
Court Lady Kim, not Court Lady Jo.

143
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,930
Who said you can?

144
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,200
Do you think I will allow it?

145
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,560
I am the head of the Inner Court.

146
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,880
Managing the court ladies is within my authority.

147
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,410
No matter what you say, I am going to expel Court Lady Kim.

148
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,090
Did you think I would always let you win?

149
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,020
You should also experience the pain of losing one of your people!

150
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,740
Queen!

151
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,080
Do you truly intend to oppose me?

152
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,840
Yes, I am going to oppose you.

153
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,990
I am about to lose my husband and my child. What would I have left to fear?

154
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,100
It seems you are unwell and unable to make sound judgment.

155
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,720
Let us talk again later.

156
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,290
Do not make me a patient when I am fine!

157
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,560
You will change your mind once your head clears up

158
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,570
after getting some sleep.

159
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,690
Do you think I cannot do it?

160
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,150
Just wait and see.

161
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,340
I will expel Court Lady Kim from the palace without fail!

162
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,750
Sit down.

163
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,600
It is not your fault.

164
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,860
If you made any mistake,

165
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,750
it would be that you did not tell me sooner.

166
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,570
I could not tell you, thinking Master might resort to...

167
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,480
harming you, My Lady.

168
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:10,110
When you thought of my father as a man who could even harm his own child,

169
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,120
how were you able to serve him as your master and remain in this house?

170
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:28,530
Madam was the one who rescued me as I was freezing to death on the streets.

171
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,420
I had never felt such warmth after I was orphaned.

172
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,260
And Madam entrusted you to me before she passed away.

173
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,100
How could I leave your side?

174
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,220
- Orabeoni. 
 - At least for late Madam's sake,

175
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,590
you must stay strong.

176
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,120
Move aside!

177
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,310
- Take them off. 
  - Yes! 

178
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,070
Go on about your way now!

179
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,560
Look here!

180
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,250
- There is more here. Take them off! 
  - Yes! 

181
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,700
Go on about your way now!

182
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,100
Why do you keep looking at it when it will only upset you?

183
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,330
Did you find the culprit?

184
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,730
It was my doing.

185
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,810
Pardon?

186
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,970
Why would you do such a thingâ€”

187
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,260
- Could it be... 
 - Yes.

188
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,640
I laid a trap to get Grand Prince Su Seong.

189
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:06,830
Grand Prince Su Seong will not be able to speak of our matter now.

190
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,030
And while we are at it, we should clear...

191
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,440
the queen's palace.

192
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,340
 Your Highness. 

193
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,380
It is time for you to attend the morning assembly.

194
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,120
 All right. 

195
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,840
 Bring in the guilty! 

196
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,390
This is the royal physician Kim Dal Saeng, who confirmed

197
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,130
the food taster's death.

198
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,140
He is the man who fabricated the food taster's death

199
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,340
although she was alive.

200
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,990
I will ask.

201
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:26,210
Why did you falsely say the food taster was dead although she was alive?

202
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,360
Speak the truth.

203
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,960
His Highness the Grand Prince Su Seong ...

204
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,190
ordered me to do that.

205
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,510
How dare you! Where do you think you areâ€”

206
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,470
Lower your voice, Grand Prince.

207
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,710
You may continue.

208
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,300
Let me ask Grand Prince Su Seong.

209
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,880
On the third day of last month, did you meet this man at the Royal Clinic

210
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,930
before setting out on a secret outing, Grand Prince?

211
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,210
I did meet him. However...

212
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,810
it was for a different reason.

213
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,880
Could you please tell me why you met this man?

214
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,800
 What is this? 

215
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,760
 Your Highness, that needle case was gifted to me by the royal physician. 

216
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,430
It was a personal matter.

217
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:51,900
Could you please tell me what that personal matter was?

218
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,830
 You must hold back even if you are angry and upset, Your Highness. 

219
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,390
I cannot tell you, for it was a personal matter.

220
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,100
He is innocent!

221
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,600
The fact that Grand Prince Su Seong met that man cannot prove that the two of them plotted a rebellion!

222
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,390
He is right. It is only a baseless claim without physical evidence.

223
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,980
Please consider accordingly!

224
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,750
However, does it not look suspicious to all of you?

225
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,400
If you did not collude with this man to murder His Majesty,

226
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,310
please tell us why you met this criminal...

227
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,010
and get it off your chest.

228
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,610
This man's claim is all we have right now.

229
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,080
I deem it proper to open the capital interrogations

230
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,390
and clearly find out if this man is telling the truth.

231
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,980
I also deem it proper to open the capital interrogations.

232
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,360
Please consider accordingly.

233
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,420
 Please consider accordingly! 

234
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,070
 I will just take my life now. 

235
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,810
 You cannot. 

236
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,290
I would rather say I killed her.

237
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,530
If you take your own life,

238
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,970
you will be suspected of everything that happened,

239
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,730
starting with what happened to Royal Father.

240
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,900
Do you think I am unaware of that?

241
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,240
If you know everything,

242
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,660
how could you do this?

243
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,630
Because I never want to become

244
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:13,590
a bad mother who falsely accuses her own child to save herself ever again.

245
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,170
When Grand Prince Su Seong ended up like that, I wanted to die.

246
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,480
And now you want me to do the same to you?

247
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,620
I would rather die than to do that again.

248
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,510
Royal Mother!

249
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,560
It will be all revealed in the end anyway.

250
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,170
There is the silver dagger I dropped in the prison cells.

251
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,970
With such substantial evidence,

252
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,290
what difference will you make by taking your life?

253
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,420
Brother has the silver dagger, so you don't need to worry.

254
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,610
His butt is on fire, for sure.

255
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,560
What are you doing here?

256
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,690
Did Grand Prince Do Seong say he will take his life again?

257
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,120
I mean, Grand Prince Su Seong is in such a tight clutch.

258
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,360
Grand Prince would never sit back and watch.

259
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,700
Are you fanning the fire right now?

260
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,470
That is not it.

261
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,120
This happened because the brothers are too close to each other.

262
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,340
Do you think I do not know that?

263
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,270
If you know, we need to create division.

264
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,320
Creating division between them will not solve this problem!

265
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,910
Even if I stop Grand Prince Do Seong from taking his life,

266
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:47,330
Her Royal Highness the Queen will come out right away, saying she is the killer.

267
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,870
You are being too greedy.

268
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:58,290
Are you saying you will protect both your daughter and grandson in this situation?

269
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,620
Once Grand Prince Do Seong becomes the king,

270
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,400
the problem with Her Royal Highness will be solved automatically.

271
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,300
Therefore, you need to focus entirely

272
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,960
on making Grand Prince Do Seong the king right now.

273
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,190
Have I not been doing that?

274
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,740
I gave him all that support and help.

275
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,530
But he was the one who refused it all.

276
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,950
So, you have to corner him into a situation where

277
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,660
he has to become the king whether he wants to or not.

278
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:36,490
Her Royal Highness the Queen was the one who killed the food taster, not Grand Prince Su Seong.

279
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,030
Watch what you say, Censor!

280
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:46,650
I apologize, but there is physical proof that was found at the scene.

281
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,050
Bring me the proof!

282
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,720
What is that?

283
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,160
This is Her Royal Highness' silver dagger

284
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,530
that was found next to the food taster's corpse.

285
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,690
How will you prove that the silver dagger belongs to Her Royal Highness?

286
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:36,790
The royal tailor confirmed that it was the silver dagger he made for the queen.

287
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:42,700
There is more proof that Grand Prince Su Seong did not kill the food taster.

288
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,190
I am Lee Gab Seok, the royal officer of the crown prince's palace.

289
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,490
Last night, when the food taster died, the crown princeâ€”

290
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:04,320
I mean, Grand Prince Su Seong was with me at the crown prince's palace.

291
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,930
Everyone at the crown prince's palace knows this, not just me.

292
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:16,270
If what I said is false, I will give my life.

293
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:23,150
If you dared to speak lies to slander Her Highness the Queen,

294
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,930
you will have to give your life, as you said!

295
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,560
Yes.

296
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,450
Is what that man said true?

297
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,430
That is enough!

298
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,940
Are you asking because you truly do not know?

299
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,770
Everyone here already suspects that Grand Prince Su Seong

300
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,820
gave a false confession to protect Her Royal Highness!

301
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,310
Your Highness!

302
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:04,110
It is now clear that the queen's palace was behind all of this.

303
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,000
He is right. When His Majesty collapsed,

304
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,350
was it also not the queen's palace who testified that the crown prince

305
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,140
provided the poisoned croaker?

306
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,440
Until the crimes of the queen's palace are properly investigated,

307
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,560
please have the queen confined!

308
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,160
 Please have the queen confined! 

309
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,450
How did you know where the silver dagger was?

310
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,810
Could it be that you searched my room?

311
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,530
P-Please forgive me.

312
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,250
Just go and bring me Gab Seok.

313
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,510
Yes.

314
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,320
 Your Highness, this is Gab Seok. 

315
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,420
Come in!

316
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,820
 Are your lips sewn together? 

317
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,790
I am asking why you did that behind my back.

318
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,960
Why won't you answer me?

319
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,620
Did Grandfather order you to do so?

320
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,260
All right. Do as you please.

321
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:54,500
I can understand Sang Su, but I did not think you would betray me.

322
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,100
You are not even my friend anymore.

323
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,480
What should I have done, then?

324
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,150
Was I supposed to just watch you get falsely accused and deposed again?

325
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,550
I would rather die than do that.

326
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,410
They said that is the only way to save Your Highness,

327
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:21,330
which is why I stepped up, prepared to die.

328
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,870
They said Your Highness can be saved if I just agree to this.

329
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,850
If something happened to you because I did not do that...

330
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,310
How would I...

331
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,230
A grown man should not cry like that.

332
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,750
Stop crying right now.

333
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,870
I do not even want to see you. Leave at once.

334
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,980
I will not leave until you take back what you said about not being friends anymore.

335
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,940
I refuse, you rascal.

336
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,610
You should have at least notified me in advance, if you are my friend.

337
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,590
If I did, you would have stopped me.

338
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,810
You know that, and yet you stillâ€”

339
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,630
Never mind.

340
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:17,370
What will happen to Her Highness the Queen now?

341
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,920
Go find out where they locked up Kim Dal Saeng.

342
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,570
She left the queen's palace just now.

343
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,200
Mother.

344
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,170
They locked him up at the Royal Clinic.

345
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,810
Let's go.

346
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,640
What happened? Where is Kim Dal Saeng?

347
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,720
Did he escape?

348
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,430
I apologize.

349
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,450
It happened so suddenly that we could not do anything.

350
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,410
We must catch him before he escapes the palace, no matter what.

351
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,830
Yes. He could not have gone far. We should be able to catch him.

352
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:16,900
We must reveal Choi Sang Rok instigated him, if we want to undo Mother's confinement.

353
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,610
Your Highness, he is over there!

354
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,360
Stop!

355
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,900
Stop!

356
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,100
Stop right there!

357
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,130
You must not die! Wake up!

358
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,230
Get yourself together!

359
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,650
It is too late. Stop it.

360
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:06,790
It must be Choi Sang Rok's doing.

361
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:10,360
He died from the poison spreading fast as he ran away.

362
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,940
Will you overlook it again?

363
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,320
What can we do?

364
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,170
We have no proof he was the one who did this.

365
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,880
Gosh! That damned proof!

366
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,710
- Let us go. 
 - You can go ahead.

367
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,600
I will see the end to this today, until one of us dies.

368
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,990
Do you think I am any less angry and upset than you are?

369
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,280
I am the one who wants...

370
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,140
to cut his throat right now.

371
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,600
That is why I am saying I will kill him.

372
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,500
Did you forget Choi Sang Rok is the only one who can save Royal Father?

373
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:54,170
Royal Mother must have arrived at Yesandang by now.

374
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:40,690
    
 Will you still trust Grand Prince Su Seong and wait?

375
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,180
She was only confined here for now,

376
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,950
but she will eventually be taken down as a queen

377
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:51,650
and get kicked out of the palace.

378
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,450
The only way to save the queen is for you

379
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:02,470
to become the crown prince now.

380
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,890
Did you not say he is a loyal son who can even die for his mother?

381
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,210
He's started to waver.

382
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,140
If you will say we should wait again, do not say it.

383
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:36,420
That is what we do when time is on our side. Right now...

384
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,020
we might have to use our final card.

385
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,160
It is me. Are you inside?

386
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,710
 Do Seong. 

387
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,350
- Do Seong! 
 - I apologize...

388
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,280
but I want to be alone right now.

389
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,070
I am just worried about you.

390
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,720
Can you at least let me see your face briefly?

391
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,290
I feel that I will show you...

392
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,400
my ugly side again if I see you right now, so please...

393
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,080
I will see you later.

394
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,040
All right.

395
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,910
Call me whenever you need a drink.

396
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,860
Herbalists and apothecaries with whom Choi Sang Rok has been doing business

397
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,010
for a long time should frequent his clinic.

398
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,910
Yes. Please do not worry.

399
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,700
I will not miss a single one connected to Choi Sang Rok and I'll dig into each one.

400
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,100
I will sort out and confirm herbs and medicine that might be used as an antidote.

401
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,710
So, you just need to find out all the ingredients Choi Sang Rok ever used or ordered,

402
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,020
as many of them as possible.

403
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,150
- Are you a herbalist? 
 - Y-Yes.

404
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,300
- Let meâ€” 
 - What is the matter?

405
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,320
My goodness.

406
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,690
She should just stay home. Why did she come to the clinic?

407
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,600
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

408
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,920
Wait.

409
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,480
Why is she here?

410
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,940
Was she not supposed to leave with her lady?

411
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,620
Gosh, what does it say?

412
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,980
Who goes there?

413
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,350
You are the crown prince's royal officer.

414
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,630
Why is the crown prince looking for Father's ledger?

415
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:34,160
He is trying to find any possible clues related to the poison

416
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,480
used on His Majesty or the antidote.

417
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,950
His Highness said the only way to resolve this situation

418
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:43,500
is for His Majesty to recover.

419
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,130
So, if you care about His Highness even a bit,

420
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,370
please help me find the ledger.

421
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,410
Maiden Myeong Yun was home?

422
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,570
I told her so many times. What was she thinking?

423
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,470
Your Highness, it is not the time to worryâ€”

424
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,050
Did she seem all right?

425
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,910
Yes.

426
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,380
I do not know how she feels inside, but she looks fine outside.

427
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,730
How much did you tell Maiden Myeong Yun?

428
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,770
I told her everything honestly.

429
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,210
Starting with how Her Highness the Queen was confined and

430
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,800
how Choi Sang Rok killed Kim Dal Saeng...

431
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,240
Why would you tell her all that?

432
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,250
Should I have said I was there for her father's ledger?

433
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,120
I need to explain the reason why I am lookingâ€”

434
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,130
You also told her about the ledger?

435
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,040
Yes.

436
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,480
She seemed to be very worried about you.

437
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,610
I told her to find me the ledger, if she was so worried.

438
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,650
How can you ask Maiden to do such a dangerous task?

439
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,190
You are out of your mind.

440
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,180
   

441
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,080
   

442
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,780
   

443
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,240
 The master has returned. 

444
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,040
Did you come to see me?

445
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,820
- Let us go inside. 
 - Someone came from the queen dowager's palace again.

446
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:27,890
So, I plan to meet Her Highness tomorrow at the palace.

447
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,580
I am glad to hear that.

448
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,860
I will go back now.

449
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,580
Was there anything else besides a visit from the queen dowager's palace?

450
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,210
No.

451
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,240
Oh, my. Why would a book come out from there? 
    

452
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,910
Hurry up and prepare some ink.

453
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,180
Some ink?

454
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,340
I called you in because I wanted to give you something.

455
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,730
Come closer.

456
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,690
   

457
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:49,160
I cherish this one the most. It's something I kept from before I was married.

458
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,500
So, I hope you will accept it as my token of appreciation.

459
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,920
Give me your hand.

460
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,400
I do not like ornaments.

461
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,680
If you have nothing more to say, I will take my leave now.

462
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:15,280
Could you try to understand your father just a little bit?

463
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,790
- Your father is alsoâ€” 
 - I...

464
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:20,210
do not have a father.

465
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,060
I-I see.

466
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,190
I am sure you cannot forgive him right now.

467
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,400
However, everything is my fault.

468
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,700
So, resent me if you must and forgive your father.

469
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,470
You know well what your father's life has been like.

470
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,720
- After losing your motherâ€” 
 - You mean to say...

471
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,320
after he killed her, not lost her.

472
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,010
W-What do you mean?

473
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:55,300
My mother was brutally killed by her husband, who was blinded by his lover.

474
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,970
In front of an infant on top of that.

475
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,510
That is not true.

476
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:07,420
T-That is not true. You must be mistaken.

477
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,400
Father told me himself.

478
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,030
"Yes. You're right."

479
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,970
 Yes. You are right. 

480
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,950
 - I killed her.  
 - "I killed her."

481
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:26,590
So, do not ever tell me to forgive my father again.

482
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:34,290
No child in this world would be able to forgive a father who killed their mother.

483
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,630
What is the matter?

484
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,640
Maiden Myeong Yun is at the queen dowager's palace.

485
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,850
Maiden.

486
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,350
Your Highness.

487
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:40,790
Your Highness, I came to tell you something important.

488
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:47,110
Will you wait a moment for me?

489
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,030
Yes, Your Highness.

490
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:55,230
Sang Su, is there a place Maiden Myeong Yun can stay briefly without people finding out?

491
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:59,450
There is an empty room in the palace ladies' quarters.

492
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,090
Hurry up and escort her, then.

493
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,840
Wait for me there.

494
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,610
I will be there soon.

495
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,860
Yes, Your Highness.

496
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:34,150
I understand how you want to help the crown prince, My Lady.

497
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:37,360
But a father is still a father.

498
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,340
What I mean to say is,

499
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:45,500
if you treat and save the king, then Master will...

500
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,820
He will be punished for his crimes.

501
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:51,090
My Lady, why are you being so scary?

502
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,370
Listen carefully.

503
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,170
I told you this at home, too.

504
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:59,760
I came to the palace to stop my father's evil deeds, prepared to die.

505
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,800
However, you do not need to do the same.

506
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,500
- It is not too lateâ€” 
 - I told you as well.

507
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,670
Even if the sky is to fall, I will be by your side, My Lady.

508
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:16,470
 Are you inside, Oh Wol? 

509
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,160
Do not come out.

510
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,980
Keep a close watch.

511
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,760
Yes.

512
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,530
Why are you looking at me as if I were a bug?

513
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,900
Should you not apologize first?

514
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,880
Why would I?

515
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,190
You are too lowly to even know what you did wrong.

516
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,070
What a way to show off being a nobleman.

517
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,530
Why you littleâ€”

518
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,380
Hey, move it. Hey!

519
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:09,210
Quiet. Be quiet.

520
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:15,000
Are you not at all glad to see me, Your Highness?

521
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,940
I thought I would never see you again.

522
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,450
When I saw you earlier,

523
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,830
I thought I was dreaming.

524
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,940
Then, why are you looking at me like that?

525
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,080
Why are you dressed up as a court lady?

526
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,630
To stay at the palace and help you,

527
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:41,200
would it not be better to stay out of people's sight?

528
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,030
I brought my father's clinical logâ€”

529
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,830
I do not need your help, Maiden.

530
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,470
Leave the palace right now.

531
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:56,030
- Your Highness. 
 - Get changed and come out.

532
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:02,420
Please hear me out first.

533
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,040
I do not want to hear it.

534
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,820
If you know what it took for me to send you out,

535
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,490
you cannot come back like this.

536
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:14,570
My father...

537
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,320
killed my mother.

538
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,570
How can I consider him my father when he killed my mother for the sake of the queen dowager?

539
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:37,010
So, I decided to cut my ties with him.

540
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,670
I am now Baek Gu, not Choi Myeong Yun.

541
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,380
I will live as Baek Gu until I die.

542
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,800
- Maiden. 
 - The queen dowager and Choi Sang Rok

543
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,210
are not just your enemies now.

544
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:57,020
They are also my enemies who killed my mother.

545
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,590
So, I can exact my revenge on themâ€”

546
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:10,000
â™«  You are too far away for me to get closer  â™«

547
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:17,030
â™«  So that I can touch you at the tip of the passing breeze  â™«

548
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:24,300
â™«  I will walk towards you,  wherever you are  â™«

549
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,710
 It is me. 

550
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,070
Come inside.

551
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,700
Are you feeling all right?

552
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,030
Yes.

553
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,490
I have a matter to discuss with you.

554
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,420
Let us sit.

555
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,670
 This is Cheol Du. I have urgent news. 

556
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,300
Come in.

557
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,040
What is it?

558
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,220
They said His Excellency the Left State Councilor was attacked.

559
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,750
- Grandfather? 
 - Yes.

560
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,400
He is being treated at the Royal Clinic right now.

561
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,940
Was he injured severely?

562
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,470
Grandfather, are you all right?

563
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,620
Yes.

564
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:41,020
I apologize for startling you.

565
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:46,710
It is only a shallow cut from a sword, so don't worry.

566
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:49,090
Are his bones and tendons unscathed?

567
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:52,600
Yes. Fortunately, the wound is not deep, so he will recover soon.

568
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,760
Good job. You may go now.

569
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,070
What happened?

570
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,500
Who on earth would do such a thing?

571
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,350
I apologize...

572
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:11,870
but I would like to speak with Grand Prince Do Seong alone.

573
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,740
Grandfather.

574
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,980
It is all right.

575
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,930
I will see you later.

576
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:39,100
What do you need to tell me that you would be so rude to Brother?

577
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,320
He asked Grand Prince Su Seong to leave for his sake.

578
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,280
If he finds out that his royal officer is the one who attacked the left state councilor,

579
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,260
how troubled would he be?

580
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,050
His royal officer?

581
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:57,850
Could it be Gab Seok's doing?

582
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:01,810
Yes, that is right.

583
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:04,110
That is nonsense.

584
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,360
Why would Gab Seok do such a thing?

585
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,470
The one who ordered him would know that.

586
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,860
Did you forget already?

587
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:21,070
His Excellency Munhyeong was the first one to request Her Highness' confinement.

588
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,790
There is no need for a long story.

589
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,980
Come in!

590
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,110
The chief royal guard was also

591
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:47,160
with His Excellency when he was attacked.

592
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,250
Hurry up and tell him what you saw.

593
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:57,770
The one who attacked the left state councilor is the crown prince's officer.

594
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,250
Are you certain Gab Seok is the one who did it?

595
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,010
Yes.

596
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,010
Do Seong.

597
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:39,920
Did you get to hear what happened?

598
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,240
He said Gab Seok was the one who did it.

599
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,950
And do you believe that?

600
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:49,510
The chief royal guard said he witnessed it happening.

601
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,590
 Your Majesty! Your Majesty! 

602
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:23,780
 What are you all doing? Hurry up and bring the royal physician! 

603
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,470
 Your Majesty! Your Majesty! 

604
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,660
 His Majesty seems to be in a critical condition. 

605
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,910
 Please take a look quickly. 

606
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:44,150
 - What are you waiting for? 
 - Promise you will do a job for me first. 

607
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,430
 What do you mean? 

608
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:50,010
 If you do as I say, His Majesty will live. 

609
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:54,930
 Otherwise, he will pass away. 

610
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,260
 Isn't that true? 

611
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,740
 I expect great things from you in the future as well. 

612
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,390
 No need to say such a thing. 

613
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,970
 We are more or less in the same boat now. 

614
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,220
 Do not be confused. 

615
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:22,630
 No, we are just thankful to you. 

616
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:27,230
 I do not work for you 

617
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:29,870
 nor do I work for the Inspector General. 

618
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:32,770
 I work for His Majesty. 

619
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,840
 I am aware. 

620
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,120
 But you have been supporting Grand Prince Do Seong thus far. 

621
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:44,600
 That was also for His Majesty's sake, not for the grand prince. 

622
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:50,130
 If you blackmail me one more time with His Majesty's well-being, 

623
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:53,720
 you will both pay the price with your death. 

624
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:10,140
 By the way, how did you think to ally yourself with the Inspector General again so soon? 

625
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:16,620
 In politics, you form an alliance even with your enemies if you have the same goal. 

626
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:22,440
 Truly. That is what politics is. 

627
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:49,630
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

628
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,030
Is it because of Father?

629
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:01,440
You do what you have to do.

630
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:12,140
I will do what I have to do.

631
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:33,170
Your Majesty...

632
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,530
the lord I will serve next...

633
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,830
is His Highness the Crown Prince.

634
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:05,940
Everything went as you planned, Inspector General.

635
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,930
Did Grand Prince Do Seong seem to waver?

636
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,440
Of course, he wavered.

637
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,330
Winning over the chief royal guard in advance was a genius move.

638
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,420
Where did you get such a great idea?

639
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:23,610
Thank you for going through the trouble of following my plan.

640
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:26,250
This much trouble is nothing.

641
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:33,350
I, Yun Jeong Dae, just need you to remember my contribution.

642
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:38,440
Contributions should be discerned only after we are done with all the work.

643
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:43,820
Grand Prince Do Seong wavered but did not entirely turn his back on his brother.

644
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,070
Yes, that is true.

645
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:50,030
What happens going forward is more important.

646
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:52,870
Keep a close watch on Grand Prince Do Seong.

647
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:57,360
You will always have to be near Grand Prince Do Seong to do that.

648
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,230
 This is Yun Jeong Dae. 

649
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:10,070
Can I come in for a moment, please?

650
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,660
Come in.

651
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,840
Thinking how concerned you must be over the left state councilor incident,

652
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,230
I just could not move on, so I stopped by briefly.

653
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:35,040
Do you not resent me, Mayor?

654
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:40,340
- Pardon? 
 - You must think I am a small fry who only eats what is sweet

655
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,200
and spits out what is bitter.

656
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,860
That is a completely absurd statement.

657
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:51,640
I once was upset because you seemed to distance yourself from me.

658
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:56,800
But I have never once thought that way.

659
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,490
Do you mean it?

660
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:04,370
How could I dare lie to you?

661
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,180
In that case,

662
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:12,190
could I trust you and ask for your help one more time?

663
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:16,860
I already told you I will die if you tell me to

664
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,870
and live if you tell me to.

665
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:24,060
Whatever it is, just give me the order.

666
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,230
Keep an eye on His Excellency Munhyeong.

667
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:28,990
Watch what he does, where, and whom he meets.

668
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:32,400
I must know every move His Excellency Munhyeong makes.

669
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:39,160
I was prepared to never see Your Highness again.

670
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,000
But you are so understanding.

671
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,400
This old one does not know what to do.

672
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:53,430
Who would most badly want me to oppose you and wish for dissension between us, Grandfather?

673
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,180
I cannot do as those people wish.

674
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:04,510
This is the biggest reason I held down and hid my resentment and sense of betrayal regarding you, Grandfather.

675
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:09,920
However, my heart still harbors the guilt...

676
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:15,120
of failing to stop Mother's confinement.

677
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:24,300
Hence, even if it is for my sake, this will be the last time you are doing something without my knowledge.

678
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,850
Yes.

679
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,000
However, regarding the left state councilorâ€”

680
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,420
I know that you have nothing to do with it.

681
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:36,190
I was quite surprised as well.

682
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:39,940
The chief royal guard is not someone you can easily bribe.

683
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,990
How did they get to him, too...

684
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:45,860
It is obvious what they must have done.

685
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,770
I am worried about Do Seong.

686
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:54,350
I am sure he is already having difficulty handling what happened to Mother.

687
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:57,250
Even his grandfather was attacked now.

688
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,750
How upset must he be?

689
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,430
 Are you inside, Oh Wol? 

690
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,210
 Yes. 

691
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,060
 Let's go inside for a moment. 

692
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,620
 She almost became Grand Prince Do Seong's wife. 

693
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,770
She will leave the palace right after treating His Majesty.

694
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,400
I will keep her hidden until then.

695
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,700
No one knows what can happen between a man and a woman.

696
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:19,710
What are you going to do if she becomes pregnant out of the blue?

697
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:24,070
That is not all. If Choi Sang Rok finds out, he will use his daughter

698
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:28,300
to manipulate His Highness.

699
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:31,310
What do we do now, then?

700
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:37,350
We will have to get her away from His Highness somehow.

701
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:00,090
His Excellency Munhyeong went to meet the captain of the royal guards?

702
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:05,230
Yes, I found it suspicious how he stayed in the palace and headed somewhere alone this late at night.

703
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,510
So, I followed him and saw him going to the royal guards' office.

704
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:10,200
Are you certain he met the captain of the royal guards?

705
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,500
I also know the captain of the royal guards, so I recognized him right away.

706
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,310
What brings you here, Grand Prince?

707
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,210
What did His Excellency Munhyeong order you to do?

708
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:45,450
Rather, whom did he order you to kill?

709
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:48,980
I am not sure what you are talking about...

710
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,600
Tell me the truth right now!

711
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,750
That is not itâ€”

712
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:57,290
Whom did he tell you to kill, and where did he send you?

713
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:01,500
T-The court ladies' quarters of the crown prince's palace.

714
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,300
He told you to kill a court lady?

715
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,830
That's not it.

716
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:09,250
It's the Inspector General's daughter who is there...

717
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:14,460
Did you just say the Inspector General's daughter?

718
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,500
W-Who are you?

719
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:31,410
My Lady! My Ladyâ€”

720
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:37,650
Oh Wol!

721
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,340
My Lady, please escape.

722
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:19,420
Oh Wol!

723
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,300
Who are you?

724
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,890
Maiden, are you all right?

725
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,170
Did you get injured?

726
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:55,620
It is all right. I am fine.

727
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,950
- Do Seong! 
 - I will protect the ones I care for!

728
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,840
- Why are you doing this? 
 - To protect her,

729
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,570
I must become the crown prince.

730
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:40,010

 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview  

735
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:15,470
 The queen dowager sent a message saying she will attend cheondojae. 
 (A Buddhist ritual for the deceased) 

736
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,550
 I will steal the book without fail. 

737
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:20,370
 Is someone inside the queen dowager's palace? 

738
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:24,640
 They are killers that your grandfather sent to kill Maiden Myeong Yun, Brother. 

739
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,250
 Where is Maiden Myeong Yun? 

740
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:30,310
 You must find her even if you have to search the entire palace! 

741
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:33,820
 If His Majesty does not recover, we will all die. 

742
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:38,510
 If you use more poison, he will pass away. 

743
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,550
â™«  I want to look at you  â™«
