 Episode 6 

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,880
I will make sure to at least...

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,420
protect His Majesty's life.

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,550
Please answer me.

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,480
Is it a false accusation or not?

16
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,060
I was...

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,540
At that time, I was...

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,970
outside the palace.

19
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,560
However, if Her Royal Highness said so,

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,410
it must also be true.

21
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,320
Are you admitting your crime?

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,390
I was outside the palace...

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,500
at that time.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,020
So, are you admitting your crime or not?

25
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,220
I was outside the palace.

26
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,010
At this rate, this will never end.

27
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,390
Shall we torture him?

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,280
What does everyone think?

29
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,200
Even if he is a high treason criminal,

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,850
he was still this nation's heir.

31
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,590
How about we wrap things up here?

32
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,270
Won't he change his words in the future?

33
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,620
If the guilty is not denying the charges against him,

34
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,870
we can take it as he is admitting to the charges.

35
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,700
Let us do as the Inspector-General said.

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,770
If we shed blood unnecessarily and

37
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,800
His Majesty asks us about it in the future,

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,750
who will be able to handle the aftermath?

39
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,960
How is he? Is there progress?

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,420
I am regretful to tell you,

41
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,530
but it seems it was a temporary reaction

42
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,390
due to the medicine unless Her Highness was mistaken.

43
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,130
Not at all. I clearly saw with my own eyes.

44
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,400
I saw it clearly myself!

45
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,710
His Majesty's fingers definitely moved like this!

46
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,070
Please calm down, Mother.

47
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,250
Did Mother get some sleep last night?

48
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,820
She did not sleep at all.

49
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,460
Please get some rest.

50
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,870
Grand Prince, are you doubting me as well?

51
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,540
That is not what I mean.

52
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,620
All of you can take your leave.

53
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,330
- Mother! 
 - I would like to be alone.

54
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,710
Take your leave! Right now!

55
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,430
Look.

56
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,390
Did Her Royal Highness really want to see me separately?

57
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,760
- Yes. 
 - But this way is not

58
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,890
the way to the queen's palace.

59
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,240
You will see once you follow me.

60
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,940
Is this not the king's quarters?

61
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,720
Why would Her Royal Highness be here?

62
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,130
Please go inside.

63
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,810
Why are you so shocked?

64
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,190
Don't you already know...

65
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,030
that this seat will soon become mine?

66
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,610
That is undoubtedly true.

67
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,000
You see, I have done some thinking.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,720
In the future,

69
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,300
even if I become the king of this country, Joseon,

70
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,780
I believe I would need a trustworthy aide by my side.

71
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,860
While having such a thought,

72
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,070
I also could not help but be curious about this.

73
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,640
I cannot sleep when I am curious about something.

74
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,760
So, I asked to see you to ask you my question, Mayor Yun.

75
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,410
Please ask me anything.

76
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,590
Mayor of Hanyang,

77
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,650
are you on my side... or...

78
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,960
are you on Grandfather's side?

79
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:04,310
I, Yun Jeong Dae, will offer all my loyalty to the Grand Prince.

80
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,010
Can I really...

81
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,200
trust your loyalty?

82
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,400
If you tell me to die, I will die.

83
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,110
If you tell me to live, I will live.

84
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,230
Come closer.

85
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,120
I have a favor to ask of you.

86
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,540
A favor?

87
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,560
Please do not say such terrible words.

88
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,160
Whatever it may be, please just give me the order.

89
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,380
I will carry out your order with my life on the line.

90
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,950
 As soon as Grand Prince Do Seong is made the crown prince, 

91
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,020
 Left State Councillor will first assassinate Father. 

92
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,260
 After him, 

93
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,320
 he will kill you and Choi Sang Rok. 

94
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,780
Your Highness, you should have said it was absolutely not your doing.

95
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,290
What do we do now?

96
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,960
You might be sentenced to death by poison first thing tomorrow.

97
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,100
Even so, he is the crown prince.

98
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Would they really kill him?

99
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,140
Would they not wrap up the case with an exile?

100
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,340
Do you still not know those people, after what they did?

101
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,080
They were set to kill His Highness from the start...

102
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,730
which is why they charged him with treason.

103
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,010
Their rebellion was started so they could kill His Highness,

104
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,980
so why would they spare him?

105
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,080
Your Highness, as soon as dawn breaks,

106
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,850
call over Left State Councillor or the royal physician

107
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,850
and say you know nothing about this matter.

108
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,290
Do you understand?

109
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,620
What about Father?

110
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,000
Wouldn't the queen dowager protect him, to ensure her and that man's survival?

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,720
That might be the case.

112
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,760
However, I cannot take chances with Father's life on the line.

113
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,910
Please come out, Brother.

114
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,290
Take Sang Su first and go.

115
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,280
Please hurry and come out.

116
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,490
You are still as reckless as ever.

117
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,800
After I break out, how will you handle the consequences?

118
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,480
That is why I wore a mask, so no one would know.

119
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,560
That is not what I meant.

120
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,780
- What did you mean, then? 
 - In the case that

121
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,400
I end up coming back to the palace,

122
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,910
we will no longer be brothers.

123
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,990
We will be enemies.

124
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,060
Then, you and I will have to point our swords at each other,

125
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,160
whether we wish to or not.

126
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,350
Do you still want to release me?

127
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,470
I still cannot leave you to die.

128
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,340
Let us cross that bridge when we get there.

129
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,230
You are way too soft-hearted.

130
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,020
Do you think being harsh with me intentionally will change my mind?

131
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,740
Let us hurry. We will get caught at this rate.

132
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,520
Let me ask you again...

133
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,500
one last time.

134
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,900
Won't you regret this?

135
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,010
Brother, you really like to be technical.

136
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,120
Yes, I might end up regretting this.

137
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,830
However, I will do my best to protect my family.

138
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,800
I have more questions, but...

139
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,460
I will ask them on the day I return.

140
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,880
You have done an extremely dangerous thing.

141
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,030
- If they open their mouthsâ€” 
 - The mayor of Hanyang

142
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,480
will stop them on his own.

143
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,830
Do not worry about Sang Su.

144
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,560
I will take care of him until he is fully recovered.

145
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,520
All right. I will count on you.

146
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
Do Seong.

147
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,970
Please get going now.

148
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,850
- Do Seong. 
 - What is it?

149
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,600
You really are handsome, my younger brother.

150
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,610
Brother, how could you joke at a time like this?

151
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,480
I don't know when I will get to see you again.

152
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,730
So, I did not want to say my farewell to your back

153
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,430
and leave like that.

154
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,330
You must stay strong, Brother.

155
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,290
You stay strong, too.

156
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,580
Why? Is the load too heavy?

157
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,550
Not at all.

158
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,880
That is not it. It is just that...

159
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,420
Where should we go?

160
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
I am not sure.

161
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,050
Let us think about it.

162
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,010
We don't have the time for that.

163
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,150
The moment they find out, they will send soldiers to chase us.

164
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,590
Your Excellency!

165
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,350
 Your Excellency! 

166
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,490
My Lady! My Lady!

167
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,540
What is the matter?

168
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,100
It seems that something happened to that scholar.

169
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,510
What do you mean?

170
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,840
I overheard what Mu Baek said.

171
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,010
Something happened at the Royal Investigations Bureau,

172
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,890
so Master seemed to leave in a hurry.

173
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,640
Curse you!

174
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,970
Damn it!

175
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,040
What were all the guards doing?

176
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Where is the head guard?

177
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,380
Bring me the head guard. Right now!

178
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,280
Yes!

179
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,120
Your Excellency!

180
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,110
Your Excellency! The crown prince broke outâ€”

181
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,490
My goodness.

182
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,060
How can this happen?

183
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,250
According to what the guard said,

184
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,670
he was definitely in here until the last curfew bell rang.

185
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,130
Are you certain about that?

186
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,510
Yes, I am sure he couldn't have made it out of the palace so quickly.

187
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,820
He must still be hiding inside the palace, for sure.

188
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,560
Dispatch every soldier we can use and find the criminal right now!

189
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,930
 Yes, sir! 

190
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,550
We must catch him before he escapes the palace.

191
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,530
Have them search every corner of the palace first.

192
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,490
Search everywhere inside the palace!

193
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,440
 Yes, sir! 

194
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,130
They still have not found him?

195
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,190
They will find him soon. Please don't worry too much.

196
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,940
I know the crown prince's personality better than anyone.

197
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,710
But something is off.

198
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,930
The crown prince would never break down the prison door and walk out on his own.

199
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,370
I agree with you.

200
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,290
Someone must have made him escape.

201
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,310
By "someone,"

202
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,820
could you mean Grand Prince Do Seongâ€”

203
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,930
Grand Prince Do Seong couldn't have done it alone.

204
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,720
Whoever it was, there must be someone who helped.

205
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,680
Can you find out who it was?

206
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,160
I will have to find out.

207
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,990
 Your Highness, this is Court Lady Kim. 

208
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,060
Come in.

209
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,660
Last night, Grand Prince Do Seong was seen near Danbong Gate. 
  (Gate designated for royals) 

210
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,740
Isn't it natural for Grand Prince

211
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,190
to use Danbong Gate since he lives outside the palace? So, what?

212
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,570
The Mayor of Hanyang had borrowed two palanquins briefly

213
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,810
and Grand Prince Do Seong was with those palanquins.

214
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,890
Mayor of Hanyang Yun Jeong Dae.

215
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,220
Isn't the Mayor the Left State Councillor's man?

216
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,560
He might have thought it is time

217
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,180
to get rid of his old boat and get on a new one.

218
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:39,160
Or he could have one foot in each boat.

219
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,050
If that is true, he really is a frightening man.

220
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,290
Grand Prince Do Seong might be more frightening,

221
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,480
since he knows how to use such a man.

222
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,110
Was it you, Grand Prince?

223
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,970
Answer me!

224
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,870
Your grandfather is asking

225
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,040
if you have let the crown prince free!

226
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,740
Yes!

227
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,980
I let him go free.

228
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,900
What were you thinking, to do such a thing?

229
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,480
I told you so many times to make you understand!

230
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,050
How could you do such a foolish thing?

231
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,110
He might be a stranger to you,

232
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,650
but he is my older brother!

233
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,840
If the crown prince returns later,

234
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,570
we might all die!

235
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,470
You, Grand Prince, Her Highness, and myself, too!

236
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,380
Stop him, then!

237
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,690
You need to stop Brother from coming back.

238
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,560
Did you seek to obtain power

239
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,040
when you cannot even do that much?

240
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,850
Please show me you have the ability to rule over this country

241
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,080
of Joseon in my place.

242
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,320
I will be looking forward to it.

243
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,980
I will go find out andâ€”

244
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,280
I'm going to lose my wits.

245
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,740
- Let me ask you something. 
 - What is it?

246
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,270
Did something happen at the Royal Investigations Bureau?

247
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,750
Who are you to be asking such a thing?

248
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,800
My brother is a captain of the Royal Investigations Bureau.

249
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,500
I was worried since he still had not come home.

250
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,110
But I figured something must have happened, seeing the soldiers just now.

251
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,580
My Lady!

252
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,200
You found out he escaped, so it's fine now.

253
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,950
Please let's go back home now.

254
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,950
We still do not know if the scholar is the one who escaped.

255
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,890
If it was someone else, there is no way

256
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,270
the master would have left in a hurry this late at night.

257
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,640
Now that you know he is aliveâ€”

258
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,290
He might get caught again.

259
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,950
My Lady!

260
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,730
What now?

261
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,980
We are here since you said hiding

262
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,350
in the middle of the town is safer than a remote place, but...

263
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,910
But what?

264
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,080
I know a friend of my father's who was in a wandering troupe.

265
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,940
But I have never met him since Father passed away,

266
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,250
so I'm not sure if it will be all right.

267
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,110
We will have to make it right with this.

268
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,170
Let's go in.

269
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,780
Father.

270
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,490
Your son...

271
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,410
will make sure to return.

272
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,250
Just until then...

273
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,310
Just until then,

274
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,210
please wait for your son.

275
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,180
Father.

276
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,970
 High treason criminal Yi Geon is to be deposed. 

277
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,210
We cannot leave the nation's heir's seat vacant even for a day,

278
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,060
so Grand Prince Do Seong will be made the crown prince.

279
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,350
You are to rush the investiture of the crown prince.

280
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,950
Additionally, the continuation of the Royal Family must be firmly established.

281
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,670
Therefore, in addition to the crown prince'sinvestiture, we can select a crown princess

282
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:24,920
by setting up the Royal Marriage Agency and issuing a prohibited marriage order.

283
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,370
- I refuse! 
 - What do you mean?

284
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,400
Is becoming the crown prince something

285
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,790
you can refuse or accept as you wish?

286
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,390
If I cannot refuse, I will need to run away like Brother.

287
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,220
- What kind ofâ€” 
 - What good is it to become the crown prince?

288
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:44,320
I will only be a puppet of Queen Dowager, who will keep the regency!

289
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,820
It will only be for a brief time.

290
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,990
You need to endure it until you take the throne.

291
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,800
Even if I become the crown prince,

292
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,880
do you think Queen Dowager will willingly give up the regency

293
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,450
and put me on the throne?

294
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,980
When she knows they will all die if she does that?

295
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,730
I told you I would take care of Queen Dowager, did I not?

296
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,300
And what if you fail?

297
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,960
I do not wish to end up bedridden like my father.

298
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,830
That will never happen.

299
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,090
Please trust your grandfather!

300
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,350
If you want to gain my trust,

301
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,310
make Father wake up first.

302
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,020
If Father appoints me as the crown prince, not the queen dowager,

303
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,720
I will willingly accept it at that time.

304
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,060
You still have not given up?

305
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,270
If he escaped the capital, it would be a different story.

306
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,850
But he will get caught in the end.

307
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,540
 It is my last request. 

308
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,520
 Mother! 

309
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,780
 Mother! 

310
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,030
 - Mother! Please save me. 
 - You cannot! 

311
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:28,830
 - Mother! 
 - Grand Prince! You cannot! 

312
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,110
 - Orabeoni. 
 - Su Ryeon. 

313
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,070
 Su Ryeon! 

314
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,390
 Orabeoni! 

315
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,100
You have waned a lot in the last few days.

316
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,310
Didnâ€™t you stay up all night since last night?

317
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,600
I am fine.

318
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,480
Do you think a physician would fail to look after his own body?

319
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,210
You are not looking well.

320
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,580
I am fine, so do not worry about me.

321
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,320
Please go home and rest.

322
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,610
 Your Highness. Your Highness! 

323
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,940
What is the matter?

324
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,890
 I have an urgent matter to report. 

325
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,730
Come in.

326
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,910
Why is the head eunuch here?

327
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,930
Go ahead and report.

328
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,120
The royal seal...

329
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,460
has disappeared.

330
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,460
The royal seal disappeared? What on earthâ€”

331
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,540
Let's go to the Chancery.

332
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,010
 (Chancery: A record office for public archives, where royal seals and documents are kept) 

333
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,290
So, after Her Highness the Queen's visit,

334
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,450
the chests containing the royal seal and the national seal disappeared?

335
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,320
Yes, Your Excellency.

336
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,970
Who else knows about this matter?

337
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,450
Unless you wish to die, move aside right now!

338
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,290
I am only following Her Royal Highness' order.

339
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,210
Remove this man.

340
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,070
You may kill him.

341
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,590
This is my last warning.

342
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,740
Move aside!

343
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,090
You will not be able to pass

344
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,150
unless it is over my dead body.

345
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,430
You may fire.

346
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,160
 Let him enter. 

347
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,910
What did you do with the royal seal?

348
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,520
You are in His Majesty's presence.

349
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,920
Please sit down.

350
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,260
I am asking what you did with the royal seal!

351
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,270
I do not know about that matter.

352
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,880
Your Highness.

353
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,140
 Your Majesty! 

354
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,080
 My Queen... 

355
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,290
 Yes, Your Majesty, I am here. 

356
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,600
 T-The royal seal... 

357
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,890
 The royal seal... 

358
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,780
Father, what impertinence is this?

359
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,490
Please stop right now!

360
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,450
Where is it?

361
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,690
Hand over the royal seal right now!

362
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:37,000
Your Highness, without the royal seal, all official work of this country halts.

363
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,460
Do you know how serious this is?

364
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,620
Your people may starve to death because they could not get the welfare rice.

365
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:52,520
If that happens, you might not be safe, either, Your Highness.

366
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,070
No matter what you say, I do not know.

367
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,740
Bring her in!

368
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,390
Father!

369
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,650
This is what you brought upon yourself.

370
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:21,160
Spill it. Where did you hide the royal seal?

371
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,640
I-I do not know anything.

372
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,090
Father!

373
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,120
You wench! How dare you try to deceive me?

374
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,990
You better tell the truth right now!

375
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,550
Y-Your Excellency...

376
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,080
Father, please!

377
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,670
This is His Majesty's bedchamber.

378
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,670
How can you do this?

379
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,130
If you do not give me the royal seal right now,

380
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:02,200
I will torture this wench until she confesses.

381
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,670
Where is it?

382
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:23,130
Take this wench and torture her until she confesses the location of the royal seal!

383
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,650
Yes, Your Excellency.

384
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,380
Please save me. Please help!

385
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,810
Your Excellency, I do not know anything! Your Excellencyâ€”

386
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,010
- Save me! 
 - Enough!

387
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,960
Stop right there!

388
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,270
How dare you, Chief Patrol Guard!

389
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,770
Do you dare you do this in this place!

390
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,790
Let go of her right now and leave!

391
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,240
Who are you looking at?

392
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,310
Do you dare to mock me

393
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,540
and His Majesty and the Royal Family as well?

394
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,120
Your Majesty, that is not itâ€”

395
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,480
Your Majesty, where is the royal seal?

396
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,260
It can still be taken care of if you tell me, even now.

397
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,740
You are too cruel.

398
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,710
Do you truly intend to see me die?

399
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,240
Why are you saying such a devastating thing suddenly?

400
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,300
I know full well you plan to murder

401
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,840
His Majesty when Grand Prince Do Seong becomes the crown prince.

402
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,730
What are you talking about?

403
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,440
Why would I murder His Majestyâ€”

404
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,360
Do not try to deceive me!

405
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:22,780
I heard everything you talked about with the crown prince at the prison.

406
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:32,740
If you are going to kill him, just kill me along with him.

407
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,420
I heard the royal seal disappeared. Were you aware of this?

408
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,830
What? The royal seal?

409
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,230
I guess you did not know.

410
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,560
I have not heard anything about this.

411
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,760
What was the Chancery doing for the royal seal to disappear?

412
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,340
I heard Her Royal Highness visited before the royal seal disappeared.

413
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,260
My royal mother?

414
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,490
That means my royal mother was...

415
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,220
Do you have any idea?

416
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,270
No. It was just too sudden.

417
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,740
Please think carefully.

418
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,830
You need the royal seal to become the crown prince.

419
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,920
There is nothing to worry about, then.

420
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,480
There are many who wish for me to become the crown prince.

421
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,330
Since everyone wants something,

422
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,450
I am sure it will be found soon.

423
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,510
Now, then.

424
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,260
You must know the deposed crown prince

425
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,820
was struck by a dagger when he left on a secret outing.

426
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,320
I do not know what you are trying to say, but I am not interested.

427
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,220
Do you know who treated the deposed crown prince's wound?

428
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,220
It was my Myeong Yun.

429
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,900
 I already have someone I am to marry. 

430
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,550
 Hence, please change your mind and look for someone else. 

431
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,060
Were Brother and your daughter engaged to be married?

432
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,210
No, they were not.

433
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,120
They did not know each other in the first place.

434
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,130
- Then howâ€” 
 - It was just a series of coincidences.

435
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,520
Your daughter clearly told me she was engaged.

436
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,020
It is true she has someone as her intended.

437
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:34,480
However, my Myeong Yun was chosen as the crown princess,

438
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,060
not as Deposed Crown Prince Yi Geon's bride.

439
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,440
Therefore, whoever becomes the crown prince

440
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,610
will become Myeong Yun's husband.

441
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,900
If you want to take my Myeong Yun as your wife,

442
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,540
become the crown prince.

443
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,550
Do not forget that you need the royal seal

444
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:14,510
to become the crown prince and marry the crown princess.

445
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,020
Why is he taking so long?

446
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,950
Did something happen?

447
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,640
It is him! Get him!

448
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,820
Get him!

449
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,870
 Get him! 

450
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,630
- Get him! 
 - Get him!

451
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,260
After him!

452
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,270
Stop there!

453
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,740
He went that way!

454
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,210
You bastards!

455
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,770
I am the Crown Prince's bodyguard, Lee Gab Seok!

456
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,530
He is over there! Chase him!

457
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,840
Surround him!

458
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,200
- Get him! 
 - Get him!

459
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,200
Bring it on.

460
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,700
The stab wound from before just got irritated.

461
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,710
You are acting as if I were mortally injured.

462
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,410
Are you really all right?

463
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,940
No.

464
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,120
I am dying from the pain.

465
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,360
Your Highness.

466
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,020
- Young Master. 
 - Yes, Young Master.

467
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,250
I think we really need to have a physician see you.

468
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,330
Sure, why not? Just say we go to the Royal Clinic.

469
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,650
I got to exercise today for the first time in a while. Therefore, I'm tired.

470
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,490
I must lie down, so go to your room and rest.

471
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,350
Your Highness.

472
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,660
Are the preparations complete?

473
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,530
I have trustworthy men on standby.

474
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:31,870
He must be familiar with the place since he hid there once

475
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:35,580
and it is convenient to communicate with the Grand Prince from there.

476
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,320
No matter what I think, there is no better hideout for him.

477
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,870
I also think so.

478
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,210
This is a courtesan house, not an ordinary residence.

479
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,140
There will be lots of eyes on you,

480
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,680
so move on the sly as much as possible.

481
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,820
I will keep that in mind.

482
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:06,460
Thatâ€” You know the lady who comes to see injured or sick people?

483
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,630
Did she not come today?

484
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,550
- Who... 
 - Well...

485
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,660
Oh, that eonni!

486
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,920
No. I have not seen her at all in the last few days.

487
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,810
Could you tell me where she livesâ€” I mean,

488
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,920
do you know where I need to go to meet her?

489
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,910
How would I know that?

490
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,790
It is about time she should stop by.

491
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:31,420
You can come back tomorrow if you must meet her.

492
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,720
You go that way.

493
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,940
And the rest of you...

494
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,800
That man is...

495
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,340
 Yes! 

496
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:17,830
 Where are you headed... 

497
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,550
 Your disobedient daughter, Myeong Yun 

498
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:10,400
Oh Wol, you slept enough. You should wake up now.

499
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,550
I did not sleep.

500
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,560
I apologize for waking you up.

501
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,090
Get changed now, and you can sleep more.

502
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,490
My Lady, what will you do this time?

503
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,780
Run away.

504
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,530
Run away?

505
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,230
Just for one month until the crown princess selection is over.

506
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,960
I will hide for just one month.

507
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,740
Even so, how can you run away from home?

508
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,890
Why are you doing this to me, seriously?

509
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,380
I am sorry.

510
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:10,630
But, Oh Wol, once the marriage prohibition is ordered and the selections begin,

511
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,740
I might have to end up doing as Father says.

512
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,970
I will be locked up in this room and dragged into the palace.

513
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,300
Are you capable of being coerced to marry?

514
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,950
You would rather bite your tongue and die than let that happen.

515
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:29,390
You are right.

516
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:34,640
Then, I will just stay like this, and when he tells me to marry the crown prince,

517
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,440
I will just bite my tongue andâ€”

518
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,380
I got it. I understand.

519
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,980
I am coming with you.

520
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,010
How can we be apart for a month?

521
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,800
You cannot even last a day without me.

522
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,030
Well, that is not exactly the case.

523
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,650
I will go first and notify you of my locationâ€”

524
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:01,010
No, let me just come with you now.

525
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,320
You cannot.

526
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:07,230
You need to earn time for me today so I can escape safely.

527
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,740
Then, you must notify me.

528
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:15,510
Otherwise, I will tell the master everything and set out to look for you.

529
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:18,860
I got it. Let us hurry.

530
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,200
I must leave quickly before Father returns.

531
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,900
I can understand the queen dowager getting anxious,

532
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,120
but finding the crown prince is out of our hands now.

533
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,080
I thought you had gone home for the day.

534
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,420
I guess you came back because of the deposed crown prince.

535
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:52,140
You are not looking too well.

536
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,780
The queen dowager will be worried to see you like this.

537
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,780
Should you not take some tonics or something?

538
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,070
Yes.

539
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,050
Thank you for your concern.

540
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,610
I will make some tonic for you while I am at it, Mayor.

541
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,290
You have to stay healthy in order to

542
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:16,600
be of support for Grand Prince Do Seong in the future.

543
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,270
Yes.

544
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,510
Please excuse me now.

545
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:08,720
 You cannot tell anyone about the young master being here. 

546
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,440
 Do you understand? 

547
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,770
What? Why is he going into my house?

548
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,440
He is headed toward the inner courtyard.

549
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,980
Could it be he came to see me?

550
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,690
That cannot be. How would he know who I am?

551
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,680
Why did he come to my house, then?

552
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,150
Who is it?

553
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,470
Are you a ghost?

554
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,280
What do I do?

555
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,650
If I go in now, I might not be able to come back out.

556
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,200
All right.

557
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,240
 Please save me! 

558
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,850
Please help!

559
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,220
Just hang in there for a moment.

560
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,740
Please help!

561
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,480
Oh, my. Oh Wol?

562
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,830
Have you lost your mind?

563
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,360
Unless you have lost it, how could you do this?

564
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,370
- Please hear me out firstâ€” 
 - No need.

565
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,610
Take her back to her house right now.

566
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,430
We do not know what he will do again.

567
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:14,510
We also need a weapon of some sort to fight against him to prepare for the unforeseen.

568
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,910
And the weapon you thought of

569
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,800
was to kidnap and use an innocent woman?

570
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,660
Why would she be innocent?

571
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,690
She is the enemy's daughter.

572
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,450
I said take her back right now. Why are you still here talking?

573
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,410
I am not doing this because I enjoy it, either.

574
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,850
There is no other way to pass the city gates safely.

575
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,450
If we have his daughter as hostage, he cannot doâ€”

576
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:39,720
I said we cannot do that!

577
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,350
I will not allow such an unethical act.

578
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,660
Do as I said right now.

579
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,130
I cannot do that.

580
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:52,890
What did you say?

581
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,920
Just because I am in this state,

582
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,860
even you are looking down on me?

583
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,740
Nothing you say will change my mind.

584
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,010
I will fulfill my mission to protect you, Young Master.

585
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,530
So, please let me do as I wish, just this time.

586
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,990
- Untie the sack. 
 - Not right now.

587
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:15,790
I will let her go after we safely pass the city gates.

588
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:19,220
Is that so? I will do it, then.

589
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,770
Stand back.

590
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:26,670
I will not.

591
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:30,570
You cannot.

592
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,110
Please do not.

593
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,080
Let go!

594
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,660
- I went through so much to bring her. 
  - Help me! 

595
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,010
You cannot do this.

596
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:55,030
Shit! What is it? You make me lose my luckâ€” Oh? Eonni?

597
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:58,060
- Come out. 
 - I am about to win at last.

598
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,870
You did not get enough beating. It is urgent.

599
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,350
I am basically her servant at this point.

600
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:42,140
- Let go. 
 - I will not.

601
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,400
- Let go. 
 - I will not.

602
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,560
Gosh, seriously. Please do not!

603
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,500
Let go.

604
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,130
Who are those rascals?

605
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,230
In this day and age, do people still...

606
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,720
Hey, I think that is her. Go check.

607
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,640
Hyeong-nim! What the heck?

608
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,340
Where on earth are they?

609
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,730
Geez.

610
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,500
Let's go. Let's leave.

611
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,110
Hey, come on! Let's go, quick!

612
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,760
Come on. Hurry up.

613
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,690
We are getting out of here. Hurry up!

614
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,690
Hey, let's go. Come on.

615
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,060
- Gosh! 
 - Goodness!

616
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,420
They seem to be a gang.

617
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,070
But I will go check to make sure, just in case.

618
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,920
Please calm down.

619
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:20,820
My Lady!

620
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:33,000
You are Baek Gu, are you not?

621
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,440
So the lady you serve is...

622
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,650
Does this mean...

623
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,860
you were a servant of the royal physician's household?

624

â™«  The cold moon rises  â™«

 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview 

634
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,150
 They lost the deposed crown prince at Yeonhwabang near Jong-ro. 

635
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:41,710
 I have a good idea of how to make it past the city gates. 

636
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:44,040
 The deposed crown prince and I are enemies now. 

637
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,650
 If anyone sees Myeong Yun with the deposed crown prince, 

638
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,610
 everything we have done will be for nothing! 

639
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,650
 You want to delay the crown prince investiture? 

640
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,870
 You mean fabricate the royal seal and the national seal? 

641
01:01:55,870 --> 01:02:00,460
 No matter what, I will protect you. So come with me. 

642
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:05,080
â™«  where the bright light above is intensifying. As for me now â™«
