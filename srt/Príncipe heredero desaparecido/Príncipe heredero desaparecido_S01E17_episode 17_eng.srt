 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts.

00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,970
 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines.

F-Father.

00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,670
Geon.

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,150
Geon.

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,130
I am ...

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,110
Geon.

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,990
You went through so much.

17
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,920
Not at all.

18
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,840
Your Majesty, there might be eyes on us.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,040
So, please go inside first.

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,450
Let us go inside.

21
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,090
My Lord, is it right for him to come out of the palace like this?

22
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,350
If they happen to find outâ€”

23
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,220
We are prepared, so do not worry.

 Episode 17 

25
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,050
How do you feel?

26
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,170
I recovered, thanks to you, so there is nothing to worry about.

27
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,530
Maiden Myeong Yun, who is outside, is the one who treated you, not me.

28
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,440
In fact,

29
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,470
the father of the woman outside is ...

30
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,870
I know she is Choi Sang Rok's daughter.

31
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,880
Though I could not move my body,

32
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,350
my ears were listening.

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,880
 I cannot do anything about this anymore. 

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,920
 Please help me. 

35
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:35,090
 Father, please stop sleeping and open your eyes now! Father ... 

36
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,660
 Father, there is not much time left now. 

37
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,490
 Please... 

38
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,240
 Please endure a bit longer, Father. 

39
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,630
Did you also hear the argument I had with Do Seong?

40
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,100
 Why are you not answering me? 

41
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,860
 Am I not your family? 

42
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,930
 You were the one who did not consider me family, Hyeong.  

43
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,690
 Do not be absurd! 

44
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,660
  have never once thought that way. 

45
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,550
 How can you develop feelings 

46
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,370
 for the woman your younger brother was going to marry, then? 

47
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,160
- I apologize.
 - It's all right.

48
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,920
I know how hard you have been struggling

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,280
because I heard from the head eunuch and the chief royal guard.

50
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,490
Thank you for your grace.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,160
I am sorry,

52
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,640
but I have a request to make.

53
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,630
Please have Maiden Myeong Yunâ€”

54
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,490
Do not worry.

55
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,460
I know that girl saved my life as well.

56
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,900
So, I will pardon her.

57
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,010
Thank you for your grace!

58
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,220
We should let Mother and Do Seong know you are well, Father.

59
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,130
We cannot do that.

60
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,450
The queen and Do Seong are surrounded by our enemies right now.

61
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,790
- Howeverâ€”
 - Did you forget?

62
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,670
How  did the chief royal secretary die?

63
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,750
They say "if you want to deceive the enemy, deceive your allies first".

64
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,260
There must not be a mistake this time. Do you understand?

65
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,420
Yes, Father.

66
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,670
I heard you are meeting the Southerners*.
  (One of the political factions in Joseon times) 

67
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,150
I am preparing a petition of 10,000 people

68
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,100
by gathering Southerners who are angered by what happened to my maternal grandfather

69
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,430
to impeach Yun Yi Gyeom and Choi Sang Rok.

70
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,860
I must meet them.

71
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,400
Could it be ...

72
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,470
that you intend to change the ruling faction?

73
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,650
I will drive out Westerners

74
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,070
and fill their positions with Southerners.

75
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,190
However, among the Southerners, some might still be followers of the deposed king.

76
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,960
To bring down the queen dowager and the left state councillor,

77
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,500
I will have to assume that much risk.

78
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,810
Is it because of the grand prince Su Seong?

79
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,690
There is not much time left now.

80
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,980
Once Grand Prince Do Seong becomes the crown prince, give him the throne right away

81
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,010
and let us leave for the temporary palace in Anju.

82
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:36,140
Can you trust Grand Prince Do Seong to protect Myeong Yun?

83
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,940
I have no choice but to believe that.

84
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,380
 What will you do with the Queen Dowager? 

85
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,870
We have come too far for me to forgive her.

86
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,620
Tonightâ€”

87
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,580
- Father.
 - I am fine. Do not worry.

88
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,620
Howeverâ€”

89
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:08,300
There is a place where you and me have to go, tonight.

90
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,890
I plan to bring the Tiger Hunters to the palace and end the traitor's lives.

91
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,800
The Tiger Hunters are probably at Paju right now, though.

92
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,420
Yes, I heard they went to protect the horse farm in Paju.

93
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,800
- I am going to go meet them.
 - You cannot.

94
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,230
If you write a secret royal order, I will deliver it to them.

95
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,160
The Tiger Hunters would think I am still bedridden.

96
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,100
Would a secret royal order work?

97
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,520
They would believe it only if I go in person and show my face.

98
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,520
However, I am worried your health will be affected during the journey.

99
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,710
How is he?

100
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,630
His pulse is a bit unstable, but not enough to warrant concern.

101
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,780
Do you feel better now?

102
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,830
However, Your Majesty, you have not recovered fully,

103
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,590
so you should be careful for a while.

104
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,890
Please have faith and leave it to me.

105
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,270
I am too worried to see you go in person.

106
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,050
If you are that worried, we just have to

107
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,360
bring this girl with us, right?

108
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,510
Do you think you can come with us?

109
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

110
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,870
See? Did you hear that?

111
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,530
We have a physician who is well aware of my condition, so why worry?

112
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,080
Get ready to leave now.

113
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,930
- Your Majesty.
 - Father.

114
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,060
He is not in a good condition.

115
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,730
What should we do, then?

116
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,740
Does he need acupuncture therapy or something?

117
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,150
Even acupuncture will not work right now.

118
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,550
He has to rest, no matter what.

119
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,740
No. The Tiger Hunters will be leaving Paju soon.

120
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,560
- I must meet them before that.
 - Howeverâ€”

121
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,420
If we give up now,

122
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,540
I will return to lying as a living corpse again.

123
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,650
I could hear everything

124
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,180
and know everything,

125
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,030
but I could not lift a finger.

126
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,860
Rather than returning to those hellish times,

127
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,830
I would rather choose death.

128
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,950
My sin in failing to serve you properly

129
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,190
is way too grave.

130
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,800
Please forgive me, Father.

131
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,790
 I heard you sent a secret royal order to the Tiger Hunters. 

132
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,140
Once Grand Prince Do Seong is appointed as the crown prince,

133
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,280
the left state councillor will try to get rid of us.

134
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,640
We would need a sword to go against him.

135
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,520
Will the Tiger Hunters easily follow our orders?

136
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,690
The chief tiger hunter is a typical military officer with no interest in politics.

137
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,660
If he sees the secret royal order with the royal seal on it, he will surely obey.

138
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,850
I wrote it because we do not have time.

139
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,840
But a secret royal order without the royal seal ...

140
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Take this ...

141
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,300
with you. 
   (topknot cover called a sangtugwan) 

142
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,810
I will do everything I can.

143
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,180
Please have faith in me and wait.

144
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,190
Geon.

145
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,270
Be careful and be more careful.

146
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,320
Yes, Father.

147
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,200
Go help the crown prince.

148
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,140
My Lady, I amâ€”

149
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,280
The chief royal guard is here with us.

150
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,200
This is my request.

151
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,620
Please help the crown prince.

152
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,700
I have something to tell you, so come on up here.

153
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

154
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,530
The heavens are so cruel.

155
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,790
Why was a girl like you

156
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,460
born as Choi Sang Rok's daughter?

157
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,670
They must be there.

158
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,880
Stop right there!

159
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,750
They seem to be the scouts.

160
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,640
- Are you a tiger hunter?
 - I am, indeed.

161
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,650
- Reveal your identity!
 - He is Grand Prince Su Seong!

162
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,840
Show your respect!

163
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,230
I thought His Majesty was bedridden.

164
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,820
He is keeping it a secret because of the traitors.

165
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,940
But he has recovered.

166
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,500
This is my royal father's sangtugwan.

167
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,520
Do you believe me now?

168
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,710
I cannot decide on this matter alone, so please give me one moment.

169
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,450
Please wait just a moment.

170
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,540
If His Majesty truly recovered,

171
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,620
he would give a royal decree, not a secret royal order.

172
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,550
You must think carefully.

173
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,800
If things go wrong after listening to the grand prince Su Seong rather than a mobilization order,

174
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,520
we might all get killed as traitors, like His Excellency Munhyeong.

175
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,360
Your Highness, do you not have a bad feeling?

176
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,900
It feels like they are hidingâ€”

177
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,990
You cannot kill them.

178
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,270
What are you all doing? Use the Tiger Hunting Formation!

179
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:20,080
 (Tiger Hunting Formation: A way to surround a tiger during a hunt.) 

180
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,470
How dare you!

181
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,120
He is the grand prince. Step back immediately.

182
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,530
If His Majesty finds out, you will be punished for treason.

183
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,340
We are obeying Her Highness the Queen Dowager's order!

184
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,400
Do not be anxious!

185
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,400
It couldn't be!  Did the queen dowager instigate this?

186
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,450
Yes, I received Her Highness' secret royal order.

187
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,880
However, military command is strict.

188
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,040
We will not move without a mobilization order, no matter who sent a secret royal order.

189
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,020
Throw the nets and tie them down!

190
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,010
Stop!

191
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,780
I kneel before you, Your Majesty!

192
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,360
Listen up, Tiger Hunters.

193
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

194
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,950
The traitors have infested the palace

195
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,320
and our nation is in great peril right now.

196
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,850
Will you help your king drive out the traitors

197
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,860
and protect the royal family and the nation?

198
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,510
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

199
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,050
Stand, all of you!

200
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,360
From this moment on,

201
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,680
you will be called the Loyal Justice Army.

202
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,880
Long live His Majesty!

203
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,830
 Long live His Majesty! Long live His Majesty! 

204
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,760
Long live His Majesty!

205
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,740
 Long live His Majesty! Long live His Majesty! 

206
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,710
Long live His Majesty!

207
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,700
 Long live His Majesty! Long live His Majesty! 

208
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,520
Long live His Majesty!

209
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,880
 Long live His Majesty! Long live His Majesty! 

210
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,960
Your Majesty!

211
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,700
I can endure it. Do not be worried.

212
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,540
Your Majesty, I will be by your side.

213
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,330
Please call for me anytime.

214
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,140
All right.

215
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,280
Chief Royal Guard, be watchful of those who enter the Main Hall.

216
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

217
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,500
 Before they try anything, 

218
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,710
I need you to kill His Majesty.

219
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,150
The king needs to die

220
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,950
in order for the grand prince Do Seong to take the throne.

221
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,810
If you take care of this job properly,

222
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,300
you will become the next Head Court Lady.

223
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,020
I am thankful for your words,

224
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,000
but how will I do that when His Majesty is in the Main Hallâ€”

225
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,820
Come on!

226
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:09,390
You serve Her Highness the Queen, who can enter the Main Hall whenever she wants to.

227
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,840
We will prepare the means.

228
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,580
So, you only need to do as ordered.

229
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,450
 She is not intelligent, but she is clever. 

230
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,430
She might cause some trouble later.

231
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,500
So, we need to get rid of her

232
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,710
after she has served her purpose.

233
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,200
Everyone, take your leave.

234
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,760
Have you gone mad?

235
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,400
Do you want to let the whole palace know you collude with the Queen Dowager's palace?

236
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,640
I forgot you were a rabid dog who bit her owner.

237
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,660
How dare you glare at me?

238
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,390
Do you want me to gouge those eyes out?

239
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,010
I came to tell Her Highness an urgent matter.

240
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,300
You cannot right now.

241
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,170
Tell me what it is and go back at once.

242
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,590
I am going to tell her in person.

243
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,560
We took you in because you begged us to save you

244
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,850
and now you are forgetting your place.

245
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,390
Do not be mistaken.

246
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,900
You are merely a rat who spies on others.

247
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,540
Whether I am a rat or not,

248
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,840
you must have taken me in because you need me.

249
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,550
 Please help me. 

250
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:13,070
 Since the incident with the food taster, I do not know when I will die. 

251
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,850
 What are you talking about, all of a sudden? 

252
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,990
 The left state councillor never keeps people like me alive, 

253
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,960
 if they have served their purpose or know too many things. 

254
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,370
 Why do you believe I would be any different? 

255
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,390
 I don't know enough to speak of anywhere, 

256
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,530
 but I will be useful to you, Inspector General. 

257
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,220
 I will send you word soon. 

258
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,230
 You can go back now. 

259
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,460
 Yes. 

260
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,630
Your Highness, Senior Court Lady Jo is here.

261
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,910
Why did you come to see me?

262
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:10,250
The left state councillor is attempting to murder His Majesty.

263
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,400
He gave me this and told me to give it to His Majesty.

264
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,560
Court Lady Jo is at the queen dowager's palace?

265
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,930
Your Highness, Your Highness!

266
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,970
- Why the commotion?
 - She definitely came out of the queen dowager's palace.

267
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,860
I clearly saw her coming out of the queen dowager's palace.

268
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,020
The queen dowager's palace?

269
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,640
Just what are you trying to say?

270
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,210
The sly fox, Court Lady Jo, came out of the queen dowager's palace!

271
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,710
 Are you saying Cheol Du is Choi Sang Rok's spy? 

272
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,370
 It might not be Cheol Du. 

273
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:34,390
 However, if one of your close aides is a spy, 

274
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,050
 as suggested by the letter the maiden saw ... 

275
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,390
So, Court Lady Jo is the betrayer, not Iâ€”

276
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,260
Silence!

277
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,680
Bring Court Lady Jo right now.

278
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,190
Yes.

279
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,560
Sit.

280
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,830
Do you remember how I said I would kill you

281
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,590
if you tried to act wrongly again?

282
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,860
- Yes.
 - Let me ask you, then.

283
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,650
Why were you at the queen dowager's palace?

284
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,360
- Pardon?
 - Did you secretly deliver someone's letter

285
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,220
or did you receive one?

286
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,300
No ... T-That is not it.

287
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,070
If that is not it ...

288
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,690
Search her!

289
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,180
Yes!

290
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,580
It will be better for you to stay put.

291
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,430
What are you doing? Get your hands off me!

292
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,980
I knew it.

293
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,600
Your Highness.

294
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,800
What drug is this?

295
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,760
Speak the truth right now!

296
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,610
All right. We will know if you eat it.

297
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,800
- Hold her!
 - Yes!

298
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,210
Poison!

299
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,180
It is poison.

300
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,690
Where did you get it?

301
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,440
Did the inspector general give it to you?

302
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,630
Yes, I am sure you don't know.

303
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,130
Yes!

304
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,720
The inspector general gave it to me.

305
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,410
Whom did he tell you to kill?

306
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,880
Is it Hyeong-nim?

307
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,330
Did he tell you to kill Hyeong-nim?

308
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,760
- Stay put!
 - I will ask one last time.

309
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,800
Did he order you to kill Hyeong-nim with this poison?

310
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,100
You are right.

311
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,700
He told me to kill Grand Prince Su Seong.

312
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,190
I did not think Yun Yi Gyeom would act this quickly.

313
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,950
- What do we do now?
 - We will have to stop him.

314
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,730
What if we fail to stop him?

315
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,390
If His Majesty passes away, we are next.

316
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,360
Are you afraid to die?

317
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,290
- Orabeoni!
 - Do not be afraid.

318
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,340
I have already told you that, even if my neck ends up hanging above the marketplace,

319
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,140
I will not leave you to die.

320
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,670
It has been a long time since I stopped fearing death.

321
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:44,180
What I fear the most is losing you, Orabeoni.

322
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,560
That is the only thing I fear.

323
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,390
If we fail to prevent His Majesty's deathâ€”

324
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,720
I will stop it.

325
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,530
It would be different if I were not aware.

326
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,390
But since I know, I can stop it.

327
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,710
I can stop it.

328
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,410
So, leave it to me.

329
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,090
Did the Tiger Hunters arrive?

330
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,560
Yes!

331
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,940
I am sure they must have started by now.

332
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,590
The Tiger Hunters must have arrived.

333
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,270
Go outside and confirm.

334
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,420
Yes, Your Highness.

335
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,830
If the tiger is let loose in the backyard, someone can get hurt.

336
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,750
Please do not worry, Your Highness.

337
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,310
We fed him and removed its teeth and claws in advance.

338
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,010
There will not be any casualties.

339
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:14,180
Can you find those who killed His Excellency Munhyeong before the appointed time?

340
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,040
Please do not worry.

341
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,490
Maiden Myeong Yun knows someone with many connections,

342
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,500
so we can find them soon.

343
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:27,320
The mayor of Hanyang acts as the ears and eyes of Choi Sang Rok and the left state councillor.

344
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,260
We must capture him for our plan to succeed.

345
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,590
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

346
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,050
 Your Highness, this is Seon Ok. 

347
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,450
What is the matter?

348
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,920
You will not even let me into your quarters anymore?

349
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,880
- I do not know why you are here, butâ€”
- Let's go inside.

350
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,250
Let's talk inside.

351
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,030
I have nothing more to discuss with you.

352
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,190
Go back now.

353
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,540
I did not know you would drive me away like this, Hyeong-nim.

354
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,990
 They say if you want to deceive the enemy, deceive your allies first. 

355
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,260
 There must not be a mistake this time. Do you understand? 

356
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,370
Go on. Take care.

357
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,810
Please go far away first thing tomorrow.

358
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,380
You will die if you stay here.

359
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,890
The inspector general ordered Court Lady Joâ€”

360
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,600
What is the matter?

361
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,210
I will give you word when it is time.

362
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,220
Take care of yourselves until then.

363
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,890
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

364
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,270
Your Majesty!

365
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,820
I am fine.

366
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,220
I am just dizzy from concentrating too much.

367
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,090
I will tell Choi Sang Rok's daughter to come in.

368
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,390
- Your Majesty, don't tell me that youâ€” 
 - Shh ...

369
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,430
 Your Majesty. 

370
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:46,000
 If I do not go, the crown prince could be in danger. 

371
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,050
 Is there a way? 

372
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,360
 There is a way, but ... 

373
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,820
What is it?

374
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,220
I heard a tiger broke into the backyard.

375
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,180
I am considering calling for the Tiger Hunters, to avoid a catastrophe.

376
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,410
What do you all think?

377
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:34,550
The Tiger Hunters were deployed to catch a tiger that attacked the horse farm in Paju.

378
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,300
The royal guards can easily defend the palace by themselves.

379
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,210
I believe it is right to leave it to the royal guards.

380
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,570
The royal guards have never fought against a tiger.

381
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,320
Also, I heard they have already caught the tiger that had attacked the horse farm.

382
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,140
Would it not be better to summon the Tiger Hunters and prevent potential damage?

383
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,010
That is a reasonable order.

384
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,050
If the tiger escapes the palace and attacks private homes,

385
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,990
the citizens will be greatly harmed.

386
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,590
The deputy inspector is right.

387
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,850
I deem it right to summon the Tiger Hunters and defend against the tiger.

388
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,480
Inspector General, send a messenger to Paju

389
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,070
and bring in the Tiger Hunters to defend against the tiger.

390
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,760
Yes, Your Highness.

391
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:46,160
Your Majesty, the queen dowager ordered the Tiger Hunters to come inside the palace.

392
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,360
Tell the Chief Tiger Hunter to be on high alert.

393
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

394
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:03,600
Eonni, this jackass said he saw them at the Criminal Arresting Agency's cells.

395
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,300
- Hey.
 - Yes.

396
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,000
They were locked up with me at the Criminal Arresting Agency.

397
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,490
They were bragging so much about who got their backs.

398
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,890
It was so hard to hold myself back from beating them upâ€”

399
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,950
That is enough.

400
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,310
Do you know where they are now?

401
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,290
Come over here.

402
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,070
- This is what you need, huh?
 - Aigoo!

403
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,460
Let's have a great time today!

404
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,330
What is it?

405
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,480
Who do you think youâ€”

406
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,020
How did you know I was here?

407
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,320
Who is that man?

408
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,040
He is my hyeong-nim I told you about last time.

409
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,270
Hey, forget it.

410
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,470
They are drooling left and right over these ugly women.

411
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,790
They are too low quality to have fun with. Let's go.

412
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,530
- Aigoo, H-Hyeongnim!
 - Let's go. I am leaving!

413
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,270
Aigoo, they do not know any better.

414
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:12,370
This courtesan house has the prettiest woman in Hanyang. Did you not know?

415
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,990
What?

416
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,100
I cannot take this anymore!

417
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,220
Take off your mask first.

418
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,630
Let me see your face!

419
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,980
Will 100 nyang be enough?

420
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,550
I said she does not show her face to just anyone!

421
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,050
How much does she want, then?

422
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,360
I told you! It is not money.

423
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,200
She only shows her face to a man she finds deserving.

424
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,810
Perhaps the leader of Saljugye* might be the one.
  (A violent group who killed nobles and slave owners) 

425
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,410
Saljugye?

426
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,040
Her parents were killed by nobles when she was young.

427
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,000
So, she absolutely hates nobles.

428
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,920
I heard she even spends the night with you if you bring the head of a privileged noble.

429
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,520
S-Should I be the one to bring it? T-Then I could ...

430
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,490
Spend the night!

431
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,250
But ruffians like you cannot even dream of doing it.

432
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,670
Who are you calling a ruffian? Who do you think I am?

433
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,250
Hey, I also killed a noble before.

434
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,510
Those ratbags at Saljugye are all talk.

435
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,790
Do you think they have killed an excellency as I did?

436
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,320
Shut your mouth, you bastard!

437
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,340
If that is true,

438
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,880
I will spend the night with you, sir.

439
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,490
Have you heard of His Excellency Munhyeong?

440
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,610
The old man who died on his way to exile recently.

441
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,420
This man and I did that!

442
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,990
Come over here. Come now!

443
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,180
Did His Highness send word?

444
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,470
Yes, sir.

445
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:30,580
His Highness found the culprit who killed His Excellency Munhyeong.

446
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,650
Why did you ask for me, Grand Prince?

447
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,810
E-Everything I did were orders from the left state councillor.

448
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,890
Please spare me, Your Highness.

449
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,310
Why would I spare you?

450
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,680
If you will just spare me,

451
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:37,660
I will serve Your Highness time and time again.

452
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,600
The q-queen dowager and the inspector general

453
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,870
plan to give the throne to Grand Prince Do Seong

454
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:51,350
as soon as he is made crown prince, and run away to the temporary palace at Anju!

455
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:10,500
The left state councillor plans to use Court Lady Jo ...

456
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:17,350
to murder His Majesty.

457
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,660
 Do I tell him Grand Prince Su Seong got me? 

458
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,080
 N-No, that man would not keep me alive. 

459
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,120
 Gosh, what do I do? 

460
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,490
What are you thinking so hard about?

461
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,470
Regarding the king, what do you think about doing it tonight?

462
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,830
Tonight?

463
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,160
Yes. We do not know what variable will arise again.

464
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,370
Would it not be better to get it over with, before Court Lady Jo has second thoughts?

465
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,180
I understand.

466
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,850
Go back to the queen's palace for now and wait.

467
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,250
Yes.

468
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,860
Time is of the essence, so I will cut to the chase.

469
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,440
Your father, the left state councillor, will attempt to murder His Majesty.

470
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,590
Your Highness, what are you sayiâ€”

471
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,870
You already knew about this as well.

472
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,340
Such a thing will not happen.

473
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,140
I am going to stop it by any means.

474
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,930
He told Court Lady Jo to kill him tonight.

475
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,690
What? Tonight?

476
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,060
It seems you had no idea.

477
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,760
How can you guarantee you will stop it, when you are so clueless?

478
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,320
It cannot be. You must have been misinformed.

479
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,620
Show her the poison you got from the left state councillor.

480
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:32,170
Is what Her Highness said true?

481
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,400
Yes, it is true.

482
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,700
No way.

483
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,070
It cannot be. Something must have gone wrong.

484
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,540
Pull yourself together, Queen!

485
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,930
Now is not the time to tremble like that.

486
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,120
If you want to save the king, get yourself together

487
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,390
and listen to me carefully.

488
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,690
Go ahead and wipe his face.

489
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,300
Yes.

490
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,500
What in the world!

491
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,380
You!

492
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,760
How dare you!

493
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,900
You wench. Did you confess?

494
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,090
Where are you hiding the king?

495
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,590
Where are you hiding the king?

496
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,560
Answer me right now!

497
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,200
Do you think I would tell you that?

498
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,550
What now?

499
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,910
Your Highness!

500
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:22,670
Your Highness.

501
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,820
Your Highness.

502
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,730
Your Highness.

503
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,350
What are you doing?

504
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,230
Where are you hiding the king?

505
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,980
Why are you asking me that?

506
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,980
Hand him over right now!

507
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,440
How impertinent. Where do you think you are causing commotion?

508
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:55,340
If I find the king first, you will not be safe, either.

509
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,650
Hand over the king right now!

510
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,590
You are the one who broke our promise first.

511
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:21,690
You are the one who caused this trouble, not me!

512
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,840
Why? You would kill the inspector general and me after killing the king.

513
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,210
Did you think I would let you have your way while knowing all that?

514
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,500
Take your leave now.

515
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,590
I will not leave until you hand over the king!

516
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:45,110
Should I cancel the crown prince investiture ceremony as well?

517
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:49,180
If you do not care, you can do as you please.

518
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,310
You will regret this.

519
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:03,200
We will wait and see who will regret this.

520
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:31,260
Do not ever raise your voice in Her Highness' presence.

521
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,900
I mean, will you just let things be?

522
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,770
W-We have to think of something, don't we?

523
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,400
Did you need me?

524
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,360
We have to move up the rebellion.

525
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,390
Let us aim for tomorrow morning's assembly.

526
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,160
Do you think you can do it?

527
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,140
Yes, I will prepare accordingly.

528
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,970
If we make this rebellion a success,

529
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:21,480
I will compensate you for the trouble you went through

530
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,080
when Mungyeong captured you.

531
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,920
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
 - Prepare thoroughly.

532
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,280
Yes.

533
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:38,770
By the way, what do you plan to do with Choi Sang Rok's daughter?

534
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:44,140
She will be killed along with her father.

535
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,990
There was an incident last night.

536
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:57,870
A traitor intruded into the Main Hall and attempted to murder the king!

537
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,170
Left State Councillor Yun Yi Gyeom, step forward.

538
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:38,100
I, Left State Councillor Yun Yi Gyeom, are here in front of you.

539
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,200
The left state councillor, Yun Yi Gyeom, attempted

540
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,280
to murder the king using Court Lady Jo of the queen's palace.

541
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,400
Do you admit it?

542
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:55,080
As the king's father-in-law, you were graced by the royal family the most.

543
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,770
How could you attempt to murder the king?

544
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,850
I am innocent.

545
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:09,080
I have never harbored even an inkling of an intent to rebel.

546
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,110
Inspector General, bring in Court Lady Jo of the queen's palace!

547
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:19,220
Yes, Your Highness.

548
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,260
There is a rebellion!

549
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,180
Please escape to safety quickly!

550
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:14,230
Choi Sang Rok, the traitor, you are under arrest!

551
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:24,720
All right. Let's go and find out what is going on.

552
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,130
What are you all doing? Let's all go outside and see!

553
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,290
What is going on?

554
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,910
Are you not going to go and see?

555
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:51,340
I can understand, since this will be your last moments.

556
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:56,870
So, enjoy your last moments and take your time.

557
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,900
Grandfather!

558
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,110
Did you reallyâ€”

559
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:07,020
I will tell you the specifics in due time.

560
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,580
Let's go outside for now.

561
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:47,210
So, what did I tell you?

562
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,210
Did I not say you will regret it?

563
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:56,100
We will wait and see who will be the one regretting it.

564
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:07,000
Where are the Tiger Hunters?

565
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:10,890
T-Tiger Hunters?

566
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:26,560
Tiger Hunters, come out right now and obey Her Highness' order!

567
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:50,230
 All hail His Majesty! 

568
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,410
F-Father!

569
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,960
What should we do?

570
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:04,620
Everyone I have been dying to see is gathered here.

571
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,480
You are in His Majesty's presence.

572
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,050
Kneel right now!

573
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:22,660
Where are the Tiger Hunters?

574
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:29,940
Come out right this moment!

575
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:36,800
Loyal Justice Army, are you there?

576
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,470
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

577
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:46,710
Loyal Justice Army, come out right now and obey the royal decree!

 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview  

585
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,990
 Ever since Father woke up, everything has changed. 

586
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:45,010
 They did not change. They found their rightful places. 

587
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,190
 I will not give up the inspector general. 

588
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:50,130
 I can even have him killed today. 

589
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:53,200
 I will take you and escape the capital tomorrow, Maiden. 

590
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,530
 You are pregnant. 

591
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:57,030
 Where is Choi Sang Rok? 

592
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,220
 Let us leave it to the heavens and go. 

593
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:04,730
 I will kill everyone if I have to in order to save our child.
