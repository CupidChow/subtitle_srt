 Episode 1 

12
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,470
Does your chest still feel congested, Your Highness?

13
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,740
I felt better after I took the medicine you gave me, Royal Physician.

14
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,820
But I have been feeling congested again since this evening.

15
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,150
It might be due to the unseasonable weather.

16
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,750
So please rest easily, Your Highness.

17
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,540
I will do that.

18
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,080
Is anything else bothering you?

19
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,300
Thanks to you, I feel fine.

20
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,650
Thank you for your grace, Your Highness.

21
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,980
I will now go and brew a tonic for you.

22
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,840
 

23
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,550
 

24
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,690
Your Majesty.

25
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,570
May I ask what brought you outside?

26
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,370
I came to get some air because I felt uneasy for some reason.

27
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,890
More importantly, how is Queen Dowager doing?

28
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,650
Her heart rate is a bit fast but not bad enough to warrant concern.

29
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,660
That is fortunate.

30
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,990
Your Majesty!

31
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,380
What is the matter?

32
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,220
To our horror, an unruly mob has broken into the palace.

33
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,620
Is the situation critical?

34
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,930
It seems there was an ambush

35
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,060
and some of the Royal Guards seem to have colluded with the invaders.

36
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,650
Let us avoid them immediately by going inside.

37
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,960
 

38
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,600
Hurry. The royal guards will flood in soon!

39
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,680
I will see you in hell.

40
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,990
Let us go.

41
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,420
The soldiers will arrive soon!

42
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,840
If you seek to live, drop your swords and confess your crimes!

43
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,980
I did not plan to return alive from the start, Jung Yeong!

44
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
Who are you?

45
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,980
You are...

46
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,700
He was the deposed king's chief royal guard.

47
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,220
I heard the deposed king died while making his escape.

48
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,470
The heavens sent us back to kill you traitors who overthrew the king.

49
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,880
and you, the chief of the rebels!

50
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,070
Shut your mouth.

51
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,050
The deposed king you served banished his mother and murdered his younger brother.

52
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,650
He was a tyrant and a foolish king, who sucked the lives out of his people,

53
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,740
and drowned in womanizing. Don't you know that?

54
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,290
You're the one who should shut your mouth!

55
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,720
Regardless of what you say, you are rebels who usurped the throne.

56
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,960
Now I will punish you, so prepare to die.

57
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,010
Your Majesty!

58
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,240
The royal physician is injured. Hurry up and bring a physician!

59
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,290
Your Majesty, what about you ...

60
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,460
I am fine. Bring a physician! Hurry!

61
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,840
Your Majesty, please do not worry about me.

62
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,940
The crown prince... Send someone to the Eastern Palace* quickly. 
  (The crown prince's dwelling) 

63
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,620
Please make sure the crown prince is safe.

64
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,510
 Chief Royal Guard, go to the Eastern Palace and see if the crown prince is safe. 

65
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,760
Crown Prince!  Crown Prince!

66
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,910
- Where is the crown prince?
 - What is the matter?

67
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,790
Is the crown prince inside?

68
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,250
Y-Yes, however—

69
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,360
Crown Prince!  Crown Prince!

70
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,940
His Highness is sleeping.

71
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,230
So, please go back for now.

72
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Your Highness! Your Highness the Crown Prince!

73
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,770
He is comfortably sleeping, so please come back in the morning.

74
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,130
You are the crown prince's chief secretary and bodyguard, aren't you?

75
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,270
Why are you here?

76
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,270
Where is His Highness?

77
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,910
Speak truthfully right now!

78
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,150
Well... t-the thing is...

79
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,290
A Confucian scholar who came from the countryside to take the state exam,

80
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,050
had a drink with his friend

81
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,410
and started wandering around the city in the middle of the night.

82
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:10,070
Four strong men came out from nowhere and beat him. 
  Yu Mong In's Anthology of Satire. 

83
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,220
- How scary.
 - After that,

84
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,100
they shoved this Confucian scholar into a sack and said,

85
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,760
"We will beat you to death if you say one more word!"

86
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,320
Oh, my. How scary!

87
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,250
They threatened him like this.

88
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,580
They are such cruel bastards.

89
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,170
 Yu Mong In's Anthology of Satire. 
  

90
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,930
As they ran off with the Confucian scholar on their backs,

91
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,020
the Confucian scholar was too shocked to know where they were going.

92
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,610
He was definitely kidnapped.

93
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,250
- Seriously, keep your mouth shut!
 - Be quiet!

94
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,500
All right. Focus here, everyone.

95
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,950
They ran like that for a long time and finally freed him from the sack.

96
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,060
When he came out, there was a huge tile-roofed house!

97
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,080
He went inside the room, and there awaited a beauty wearing only her undergarments!

98
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,490
The rest of the story is here.

99
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,370
- So come buy a copy if you want to hear the rest.
 - Huh? What did you say?

100
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,800
Come and buy one.

101
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,320
Boy, he's a good salesman.

102
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,590
Give me a hundred books. 
  Yu Mong In's Anthology of Satire. 

103
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,850
Come to the pavilion in Namsangol during the third hours*.
(Between 9 p.m. - 1 a.m.)

104
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,390
By the way, what happened to that Confucian scholar?

105
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,230
Did he sleep with that beauty?

106
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,460
He did, right?

107
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,320
Yes. Yes, he did.

108
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,400
Why?

109
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,960
Come this way.

110
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,520
Wait here for a moment.

111
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,930
Offer your greetings.

112
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,060
This is the prince, the hidden son of His Majesty the King,

113
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,850
who was imprisoned unfairly after losing the throne to traitors.

114
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,610
It is His Excellency Hae Seong.

115
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,300
I heard you are from Jeolla-do.

116
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,320
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- Welcome.

117
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,200
You probably heard the details from the general.

118
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,100
Allow me to get straight to the point.

119
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,550
If you supply military funds for me to put together an army,

120
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,620
you will enjoy wealth and prosperity the moment I get the throne back.

121
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,480
How much is needed for the military funds... Would 1,000 nyang do?

122
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,380
A thousand nyang?

123
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,690
What is wrong? Is the amount too small?

124
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,050
It is not small, but the more, the better.

125
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,650
If so, how about 10,000 nyang?

126
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,030
What took you so long?

127
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,570
You are loyal servants who will remain in history.

128
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,180
It is an honor, Your Excellency.

129
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,010
Where is the money, by the way? Do you have it now?

130
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,730
It is at our lodging.

131
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,820
Let us go now. Where is your lodging?

132
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,040
Maybe not today. How about I bring it tomorrow?

133
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,130
No. I need to save my imprisoned father as soon as possible.

134
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,230
With that money, I can form an army immediately,

135
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,860
eradicate the traitors who took the throne, and—

136
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,680
What are you doing?

137
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,230
- Hyeong-nim.
 - What?

138
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,950
This bastard called my father a traitor.

139
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,020
How could I hold back as his son?

140
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,970
That temper of his!

141
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,000
You cannot just punch him like that.

142
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,870
You should have coaxed him and gotten information.

143
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,160
These bastards could not have overturned the throne.

144
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
Can't you just tell?

145
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,040
They are just swindlers who steal money from naive rich people from the countryside.

146
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,500
Am I wrong?

147
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,400
Who are you?

148
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,430
I am this country, Joseon's...

149
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,810
crown prince.

150
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,880
Wow, he was the crown prince. Crown Prince...

151
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,550
 
- I have never seen one.
- Why is he so handsome?

152
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,390
You bastards. Bow down to me immediately.

153
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,080
You dared to pretend to be a royal and bring up a conspiracy.

154
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,850
You deserve to die a hundred times.

155
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,110
What will we do? What will we do?

156
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,800
But we still n-need to fight.

157
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,720
- We are dead anyway.
 - I will go along with it.

158
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,000
We will attack on the count of three.

159
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,080
One, two ...

160
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,680
You must be jesting.

161
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,890
Please stop, stop...

162
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,160
- Come on, start fighting. 
 - No, no. You go first.

163
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,970
- D-Do something. 
 - All right.

164
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,100
You actually punched him? Did you?

165
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,080
Gosh, Do Seong. I am dying, Do Seong.

166
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,630
You are better at fighting than I thought.

167
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,680
Wow, what would have happened if we actually fought?

168
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,170
You would have died. I did not hit you.

169
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,080
It is the crown prince's face. I did not hit it. All I did was push it.

170
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,880
- He hit you.
- But I did not.

171
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,400
- Send them to the Police Bureau. 
 - Yes.

172
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,390
- Your Highness, please be underestimating.
 - Understanding. Not underestimating.

173
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,910
- Please be understanding.
 - Seriously.

174
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,030
What are you doing? Take them away.

175
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,880
 - Yes, sir. 
- Your Highness!

176
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,840
- We deserve to die- 
 - I do not want to die.

177
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,490
I am just saying that.

178
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,810
- What if they actually kill us?
 - They will not.

179
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,010
You said they were definitely traitors.

180
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,550
But we still caught the swindlers.

181
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,320
Yes. I am proud of you, little brother.

182
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,970
 

183
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,420
Yes, I made a mistake this time.

184
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,060
Rumors say they are hiding in the slum outside of the South Gate.

185
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,960
We should look for them there.

186
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,780
I said it was a mistake.

187
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,590
I did not say anything.

188
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,850
Let's get going now.

189
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,210
Will you go to the palace looking like that?

190
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,290
What's wrong with how I look?

191
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,910
Goodness.

192
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,800
Are you out of your mind?

193
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,170
I know you enjoy arts and leisure, but still...

194
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,000
We cannot go to a courtesan house now.

195
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,870
We came here because of the situation.

196
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,130
I brought us here for a reason.

197
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,900
So do not complain and follow me.

198
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,260
Do you mean it?

199
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,010
- Yes.
- Must we do this?

200
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,320
Is this really the only way, little brother?

201
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,520
Yes, this is the only way, Hyeong-nim.

202
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,820
But still, I am not a clown. How could I wear makeup?

203
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,590
Will you go back to the palace looking like that, then?

204
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,860
Our royal father and mother will faint if they see you like that.

205
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,410
And how would you explain if they ask what happened?

206
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,650
You will not be able to leave the palace ever again if you tell the truth.

207
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,190
Yes, do as you like.

208
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:20,350
All right, fine! Here. Put it on. Put it on.

209
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,310
You should have dodged better.

210
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,190
You got punched by those losers.

211
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,070
So, why were you so slow?

212
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,650
Try getting tortured day and night

213
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,030
by the scholars at the Crown Prince Academy. You will end up like me, too.

214
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,110
You don't do everything you are told to.

215
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,850
Try to be clever like you were at the Royal Academy, then.

216
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,850
I wish I could, too.

217
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,800
But they keep bringing up the palace, the country, and Joseon's safety.

218
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,320
How could I be clever?

219
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,370
Being the crown prince is not a bed of roses.

220
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,290
That's what I'm talking about.

221
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,780
But, surprisingly, you have not said you would quit.

222
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,130
They say my suffering alone will grant peace to the people of Joseon.

223
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,560
How could I quit?

224
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,490
You little ... ! I am your Hyeong-nim.

225
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,910
- I did not say anything.
 - The way you were looking at me...

226
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,570
No, never mind.

227
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,700
Didn't we put enough already?

228
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,330
Let's stop. The powder smell is bothering me.

229
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,340
Just stay put, please.

230
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,200
To return to the palace before they find out we left, we need to hurry.

231
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,570
Take it easy.

232
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,710
I have not even touched the bruise yet.

233
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,910
Gosh, so dramatic.

234
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,170
 

235
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,870
I heard the crown prince is gone.

236
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,930
According to the servant at the crown prince's palace,

237
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,420
he left the palace in disguise.

238
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,240
 
 By that, do you mean ...

239
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,010
 
 he went out to party?

240
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,840
I know he is immature, but still...

241
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
Doesn't he know what situation we are in?

242
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,780
His Highness needs to understand his role.

243
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,120
This is a problem.

244
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,490
Come on. Watch what you say.

245
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,070
I am sure the crown prince knows what he is doing.

246
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,380
If he knows what he is doing,

247
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,630
he cannot go out in disguise behind His Majesty's back.

248
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,410
That's not what is important right now.

249
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,980
Do you not care about the crown prince's safety, sir?

250
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,370
I was only voicing my concern.

251
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,790
It is not the time for this right now.

252
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,570
We need to release the soldiers and look for the crown prince first.

253
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,490
His Highness the Crown Prince has returned.

254
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,060
There was an incident last night.

255
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,660
Are you aware?

256
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,930
Yes.

257
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,420
You must know how many people

258
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,200
have been deeply worried because of you.

259
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,350
Forgive me for making you worry, Royal Father.

260
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,480
Why did you leave the palace in disguise without my approval?

261
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,670
I was curious about the people's lives and what they think—

262
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,890
What nonsense!

263
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,560
Is that the only reason for it?

264
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,070
Yes.

265
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,930
What is this smell?

266
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,580
Does it not smell like makeup powder?

267
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,810
Aigoo, my goodness.

268
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,930
It is not powder. My incense pouch broke open.

269
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,850
I think that is what you are smelling.

270
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,100
Her Highness the Queen Dowager has been waiting for you without going to bed all night.

271
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,550
Come with me immediately.

272
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,230
Yes.

273
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,280
At a crucial time like this,

274
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,070
he snuck out of the palace to be with women.

275
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,570
Is it because he has the southern blood in him?

276
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,720
I am worried about the safety of the royal family and the nation.

277
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,800
I am worried about that, too.

278
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:31,280
And it is not like we can get a new crown prince at this point.

279
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,640
If it is necessary, we will have to.

280
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:43,810
There is Prince Do Seong, Her Highness the Queen's child.

281
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,320
 

282
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,040
Come on, that is enough. Let's go.

283
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,170
Our priority is to deal with the rebels.

284
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:58,750
It is because everyone is worried about this matter.

285
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,440
Let's go.

286
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,700
Where were you exactly, and what have you been doing?

287
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,520
Let me hear it, at least.

288
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,050
I met with Do Seong.

289
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,600
Do Seong? Why all of a sudden?

290
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,380
I feel bad about him living alone outside the palace.

291
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,040
 
I was also curious to know how he was doing.

292
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,590
It is nice to see the brothers getting along, Your Majesty.

293
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:46,180
They must have gone to the courtesan house together, since they get along so well.

294
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,690
Pardon?

295
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,670
Is that true, Crown Prince?

296
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,910
I went there because...

297
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:58,550
 You will not be able to leave the palace ever again if you tell the truth. 

298
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,500
My apologies.

299
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,440
You went out in disguise, but all you did was party with women.

300
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,290
Do you take the crown prince position that lightly?

301
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,520
Should I just let Do Seong become the crown prince instead?

302
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,980
Your Majesty, you are going too far.

303
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,920
Do not get angry, and talk calmly.

304
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,150
He used to live freely at a private residency, but he is stuck in the palace now.

305
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,730
He must have felt so trapped.

306
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,270
I am sure he will not do it again.

307
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,050
Because you always defend him,

308
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,480
he is misbehaving without learning his lesson.

309
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,680
He is the crown prince of the country.

310
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,230
You have to look upon him fondly.

311
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,830
The rebels who follow the deposed king are seeking their chance.

312
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,020
Do not leave the palace for personal reasons again.

313
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,570
Do you understand?

314
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,530
Yes, Your Highness.

315
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,950
I will be sure to get my Royal Father's approval from now on.

316
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,400
What did you say?

317
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,440
You have not learned your lesson yet.

318
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,630
Why? Do you want to go back to the courtesan house?

319
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,650
It is not that—

320
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,370
Can't you keep that mouth shut?

321
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:20,170
Wouldn't it be better if we get him a crown princess?

322
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,640
He will not try to go outside if he has his heart set on someone.

323
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,430
Is there a family you have in mind, by chance?

324
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,220
Of course.

325
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,910
It is Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok, is it not?

326
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,010
Yes, if it was not for his help last night,

327
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,290
his majesty could have gotten hurt, I heard.

328
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:48,330
Yes, I was aware of his loyalty toward His Majesty,

329
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:53,030
but I did not expect him to get stabbed to protect him, when he is not even a soldier.

330
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,220
It is a servant's duty to protect the king,

331
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,140
but the problem is seeking compensation for it.

332
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,220
However, the royal physician played the most integral role in the replacement of the king,

333
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,570
yet he still remains the royal physician.

334
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,410
Out of all those who helped with the replacement of the king,

335
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,410
he must be the only one who is not seeking money or power.

336
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,510
Looks like the queen and I are on the same page.

337
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,640
What do you think, Your Majesty?

338
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,140
Since the royal physician has great integrity,

339
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,770
he will not cause problems for the crown prince as his father-in-law even after he takes the throne.

340
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,770
I cannot think of a better family than his.

341
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,740
Since the three of us are in agreement,

342
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,410
we had better hurry up and announce the selection of the crown princess.

343
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:48,140
Yes. I will choose a date after discussing it with the ministers.

344
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,660
Well...

345
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,750
Do you not wish to hear my opinion?

346
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,920
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

347
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,170
Yes.

348
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,640
The royal physician's daughter is so elegant and beautiful.

349
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,920
Many families wanted her even before she was old enough to marry.

350
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,160
Matchmakers are constantly coming and going.

351
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,230
You damn idiot!

352
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,900
Cut the crap, I beg you.

353
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,610
What do you mean, crap?

354
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,870
If a grown woman saw a man's flesh, she has to be responsible.

355
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,870
Shut up and clench your teeth.

356
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,380
Why?

357
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,510
Easy! Easy!

358
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,290
Put up with it. I told you not to drink because it will get infected.

359
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,070
Seriously. What joy would I have if I didn't drink?

360
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,230
What? Will you marry me if I quit drinking?

361
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,230
What a joke. A dog can never quit eating poop.

362
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,330
My lady, please. People can hear you.

363
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,250
It's all right. Everyone knows already.

364
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,040
I cannot pretend to be ladylike at this point.

365
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,800
Done. Next!

366
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,250
Eonni. Eonni.

367
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,910
Gae Ddong,  what is it? 
 ("dog crap", frequent nickname)  

368
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,590
The men are trying to take my father away again.

369
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,570
What? Those scoundrels!

370
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,950
Let's go.

371
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,900
Wait for me, my lady!

372
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,000
I promised my wife not to gamble ever again.

373
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,240
Please let me go.

374
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,860
I'm asking you to play just once more.

375
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,090
This is a big game.

376
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,310
Look at this. I even had to cut my own finger.

377
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,520
Please let me go.

378
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,470
Your left hand is fine.

379
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,410
Let us play just once, please.

380
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,740
- I will make sure you get your share.
 - Pardon?

381
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,400
Hey!

382
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,050
"Hey"?

383
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,030
Does she think this is a clinic?

384
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,070
I told you never to come back.

385
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,480
Do you have stakes in your ears?

386
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,520
Why don't you understand what I say?

387
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,020
My lady, use your words. Your words.

388
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,990
Oh, here we go again.

389
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,580
- Come. Come at me!
 - Get her. Get her.

390
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,340
- Get her.
 - Shit.

391
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,160
Hey!

392
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,170
Let us go.

393
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,880
Bastards!

394
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,600
- Father!
- Aigoo, my baby.

395
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,690
You'd better not come back.

396
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,540
What?

397
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,600
You cannot be here every day.

398
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,510
I am sure they will come back again.

399
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,610
I don't see the point in doing this.

400
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,100
Father.

401
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,430
Yes.

402
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,340
Gosh, that little rascal.

403
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,110
She always hits the same spot.

404
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,650
Next time, her eyes will be—

405
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,750
What about my eyes?

406
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,540
What is this now?

407
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,130
Come out.

408
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,140
Come on, I just got here.

409
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,400
Where does she want me to go?

410
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,650
If you people pass out first, leave Gae Ddong's father alone.

411
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,270
If I lose, I will not care if you grill him or steam him alive.

412
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,040
- Happy?
- "You people"?

413
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,430
You are not just competing against me,

414
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,650
but all of us?

415
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,950
Are you out of your mind?

416
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,180
If you are scared, go die somewhere.

417
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,980
I'm scared, but I don't want to die.

418
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,640
Where did you learn to say that?

419
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,440
Fine.

420
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,980
Bring it on, then.

421
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,460
- What are you looking at?
 - You are so tiny.

422
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,390
I am wondering where all the alcohol is going.

423
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,830
Cut the crap and keep drinking.

424
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,990
- I lost.
 - What?

425
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,290
I lost, I said.

426
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,500
I will... call you "eonni" from now on.

427
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,490
Eonni, my foot.

428
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,590
Everyone will criticize me if you call me that.

429
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,170
What is the big deal?

430
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,910
You are better at fighting and drinking. You're the eonni, then.

431
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,520
Don't you all agree?

432
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,210
Say it with me.

433
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,640
 Eonni. 

434
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,290
 Eonni. 

435
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,360
 Eonni. 

436
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:45,240
Fine, then. Everyone, put your head on the ground.

437
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,620
- R-Right now?
 - Yes.

438
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,710
No, that's not it.

439
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,370
Pour your eonni a drink.

440
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,920
No, my lady.

441
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,990
You are already drunk.

442
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,480
Do not worry, Oh Wol. Seriously...

443
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,070
I am not drunk at all.

444
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,500
What if the master finds out?

445
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,380
Is it very bad?

446
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,610
Your daughter, Myeong Yun, is destined to bring a disaster and lose her husband. 
  Disaster 

447
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,410
Most curses can be avoided with smaller misfortunes,

448
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:41,090
but the curse of causing the husband bot be killed cannot be avoided.

449
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,900
If Myeong Yun ends up marrying the crown prince,

450
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:53,210
the crown prince will die early, and Myeong Yun will become a young widow.

451
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,670
Is there no way to avoid it?

452
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,560
There is only one way to avoid it,

453
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,260
but I am not sure if you can do it.

454
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,390
How can it be avoided?

455
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:13,110
Everything you have accomplished might go to waste if something goes wrong.

456
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,990
Would you be fine with that?

457
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,470
Since I did not take your words seriously before,

458
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,720
I have been living in hell my whole life.

459
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,600
I no longer want to live with regret anymore.

460
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,230
Please tell me.

461
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,560
Huh? Did she sober up already?

462
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,420
She did not sober up at all.

463
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:35,210
My lady, you're so impressive.

464
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,600
I said I am not drunk at all.

465
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,610
All right. Get up for a moment.

466
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,400
You should wash your feet before going to sleep.

467
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,230
My feet?

468
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,680
I should wash them.

469
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,110
I should wash them first.

470
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,170
Huh? Oh Wol.

471
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,440
Yes?

472
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,350
Oh Wol?

473
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,180
What is it?

474
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,740
I have no feet.

475
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:09,090
Where are my feet? Where are they? Where are my feet?

476
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,270
You need to take the socks off to see your feet.

477
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,880
Here it is. My foot.

478
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,970
Oh Wol, I am thirsty.

479
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,640
I am so thirsty that I could die.

480
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,010
- Water.
 - All right. I will go get it now.

481
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,310
This is water, too.

482
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,630
- You cannot drink this.
 - All right.

483
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,860
Seriously!

484
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,450
Wait.

485
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,060
Wait, foot.

486
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,910
Wait there. Wait for the water.

487
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,930
- Gosh.
  - My lady! 

488
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,880
My lady, my lady, we are in trouble.

489
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,310
Master wants to see you.

490
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,110
- Father does?
- Yes.

491
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,970
What do we do?

492
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,600
D-Do I look very drunk?

493
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,180
Your face is totally...

494
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,760
Like a persimmon? Pomegranate?

495
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,410
Like a persimmon, pomegranate, azalea, and fire.

496
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,470
What will you do now?

497
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,040
I am sure you will get caught this time.

498
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,870
My lady!

499
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,240
Father.

500
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,930
Did you have a nice outing?

501
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,690
Yes.

502
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,070
I heard you went outside the South Gate again today.

503
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,660
Yes.

504
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,950
You should quit going to the clinic from now on.

505
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,460
Why would you suddenly say that?

506
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,460
I have been allowing you since it is not a bad thing to do,

507
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,110
but you need to behave more carefully from now on.

508
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:09,710
I have already told you this,  you are someone important, who will become the crown princess.

509
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,160
People might criticize you. Quit working at the clinic.

510
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,980
One cannot become the crown princess even if she wanted to.

511
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,550
I don't know whether I will get selected or not.

512
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,000
So, I want to continue working at the clinic.

513
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,430
Please let me, Father.

514
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,860
Myeong Yun.

515
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,900
Yes, Father.

516
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,410
You have already been selected as the crown princess.

517
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,520
Pardon?

518
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,250
The palace will announce the selection per the custom,

519
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,070
but His Majesty already approved us. Keep that in mind.

520
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,420
My lady!

521
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,180
Did you get caught?

522
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,380
Gosh, how did he know? Your face no longer looked red.

523
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,540
Is it the smell?

524
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,060
No, I do not smell it.

525
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,900
Pardon? Crown princess?

526
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,180
Is that true?

527
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,010
The crown princess.

528
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,430
My lady is the crown princess.

529
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:22,700
My lady, congratulations!

530
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,370
What is wrong?

531
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,120
Why are you sighing about something so great?

532
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,940
You normally don't hide your feelings.

533
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:35,820
Just smile if you are happy. Like me.

534
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,070
Are you happy?

535
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,920
Of course I am.

536
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,580
My lady is becoming the crown princess.

537
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,690
That means that if the crown prince becomes the king,

538
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:54,830
My lady will become the queen, the mother of the country.

539
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,690
I cannot tell if it's a dream or not.

540
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:03,840
My lady is about to become the most powerful woman in the country.

541
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,040
Oh Wol.

542
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,160
Yes.

543
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,940
If I join the palace, you will follow me there, too.

544
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,380
You will have to age alone without ever getting married. Are you still happy?

545
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:21,380
Well, what is the point of getting married?

546
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:26,490
Even if I had children, they would live as slaves like me forever.

547
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:33,820
It's fine. I will join the palace with you and live comfortably for the rest of my life.

548
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,630
I...

549
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:40,170
My Lady, you will take me with you, right?

550
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,790
What would I do without you?

551
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,770
That means you will take me with you, right?

552
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,720
I am already excited.

553
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,120
By the way, My Lady,

554
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,970
I am dying to know.

555
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,040
You are actually very curious, too, right?

556
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,900
I mean about the crown prince.

557
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,930
I wonder what he is like and what he looks like.

558
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,950
What if he is too handsome?

559
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,540
How pretty and handsome will your children be?

560
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,290
How many children will you have?

561
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,370
I am in a terrible mess because I got beaten up because of my master.

562
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:29,240
But he is fishing leisurely.

563
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,310
I don't know why the world is so unfair.

564
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:39,520
Gap Dol, that master elevated your status from being a slave

565
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,810
and made you a servant at the crown prince's palace. Have you already forgotten all that?

566
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,330
I am not Gap Dol. I am Gap Seok.

567
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:50,060
Yes, Gap Dol.

568
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:55,110
I think I gave you that name when I elevated your class.

569
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,170
Since you took all the milk from my mother,

570
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:06,610
I did not get fed properly and ended up with a poor memory.

571
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:09,600
You always bring that up when you are losing an argument.

572
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,280
Don't you think you are being petty?

573
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,100
We caught something.

574
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,510
It's coming out. Come on and help me.

575
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,170
All right.

576
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,310
What is this...

577
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,160
Is it a ghost? A water ghost?

578
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,370
It is not a ghost. It is a body.

579
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,540
A body?

580
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,920
Gosh, Your Highness! Your Highness!

581
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:02,730
Stop fussing and get help quickly.

582
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,050
Do you know this girl?

583
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,640
 Autopsy 

584
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,400
Yes.

585
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,850
Don't be so upset.

586
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:56,410
Let me know once you finish the autopsy.

587
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,060
I will.

588
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,000
 I deserve to die. 

589
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,070
 Do you like yakgwa*?
 (Traditional Korean honey biscuits) 

590
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,710
 Pardon? 

591
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,140
 Have some. 

592
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,090
 I took a bite. So it's fine. 

593
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,780
 Forgive me for asking this, 

594
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,590
 but can I bring this to my mother? 

595
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,640
 Since a holiday is coming up, 

596
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,290
 I wanted my mother and siblings to try them. 

597
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,450
 So I decided to hide them. 

598
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,740
 I am very proud of you. 

599
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,800
 Prepare yakgwa for this child. 

600
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,860
 Yes, Your Highness. 

601
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,660
 Make sure to let your mother and siblings try them, too. 

602
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,500
 Will you do that? 

603
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,160
 Yes, Your Highness. 

604
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,510
Your Highness, I heard from the royal clinic.

605
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,840
He said she committed suicide.

606
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,770
Suicide?

607
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,410
Yes.

608
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,810
Jong Geum would never commit suicide.

609
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:07,050
She hid yakgwa for her mother and siblings.

610
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,640
Why would she commit suicide?

611
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,420
Where are you going?

612
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,950
 Suicide 

613
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:30,790
 Palace Maid Jong Geum of the queen dowager's palace 

614
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,350
 Physician Heo Jin Su 

615
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,140
Your Highness.

616
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,030
Are you physician Heo Jin Su, who examined the body of Jong Geum, the palace maid of the Queen Dowager's palace?

617
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,070
Yes.

618
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,930
It says you examined her body once.

619
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,960
Why did you not do it for the second time?

620
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,470
It was clearly a suicide. I thought I should not upset

621
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,920
the queen dowager with such a tragic event.

622
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,300
Therefore, I decided not to examine the body for the second time.

623
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,490
Are you sure it was suicide?

624
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:15,610
Yes, Your Highness.

625
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:22,910
This says a palace maid from the queen dowager's palace committed suicide last year

626
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:27,050
and you examined the body then, too.
  

627
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,690
- Is that true?
 - Yes.

628
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:35,300
Do you not find it strange that two palace maids from the queen dowager's palace committed suicide?

629
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,940
Forgive me, Your Highness, but ...

630
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:43,330
I am a physician, not an officer of the Police Bureau.

631
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,290
How rude!

632
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:54,510
All I did was examine the body to check whether it was a suicide.

633
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:58,470
But someone died. You must have been curious.

634
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:04,120
The most important thing in an autopsy is to set personal opinion aside.

635
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,630
All I do is examine the bodies.

636
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,680
I see.

637
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,230
I understand. You may leave now.

638
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:24,230
Yes, Your Highness.

639
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,830
Your Highness, don't you find it a bit suspicious?

640
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:49,040
I am sure we will find something if we look into it further.

641
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,770
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

642
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,150
I will look into it further.

643
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,980
Your Highness.

644
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,260
What made you come all the way here?

645
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:57,200
I have been thinking, ever since I heard you stopped by the pharmacy.

646
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,620
Something about it bothered me, so I performed an autopsy myself.

647
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,050
Did you find something?

648
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:09,280
Forgive me for saying this, but I agree with the first result.

649
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,380
It was a suicide.

650
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,440
Is it possible that it wasn't?

651
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,010
Perhaps someone made it look like a suicide after she died.

652
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:23,010
There were no signs of resistance or other wounds.

653
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:25,450
Since her belly was filled with water,

654
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:29,650
it appears to be a suicide, unfortunately.

655
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,260
There might be something I did not notice. If it bothers you,

656
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,240
I will examine it for the third time.

657
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,810
No, there is no point.

658
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:51,170
You did not find the sign of foul play, so no one else could.

659
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,210
I don't know what to say, Your Highness.

660
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:55,830
Thank you for taking all this trouble.

661
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:59,190
You must be busy. You may leave now.

662
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:12,650
I suppose it was not necessary to be suspicious.

663
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,350
Looks as if she did commit suicide.

664
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,640
Be quiet and follow me.

665
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,630
I am afraid we wasted our time.

666
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:28,010
 Buyong Pavilion. At the second gyeong. 
 (between 9 and 11 p.m.)  

667
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,480
It is way past that now.

668
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,190
We should go down now.

669
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,830
All right, let us go down.

670
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,960
Your Highness, did you also see that?

671
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,710
My eyeballs cannot be crazy, right?

672
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,820
What will you do?

673
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:53,180
We should tell His Majesty immediately, right?

674
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,290
Y-Your Highness.

675
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,870
What is this?

676
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,020
It is an acupuncture needle case used by physicians.

677
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:37,810
Not all acupuncture needle cases are the same, Your Highness.

678
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,450
Some expensive ones are made of ivory.

679
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,420
Some of them are made with bamboo or empress tree*. 
 (Paulownia tomentosa, or foxglove-tree) 

680
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:52,860
Some of them are made with cupronickel, like mine.

681
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,510
Your Highness.

682
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:03,470
Is it easy to get a needle case like this anywhere?

683
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:09,280
No, Your Highness. That needle case was gifted to me by the royal physician

684
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,300
for good luck, when we first joined the Royal Clinic.

685
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,210
Your Highness the Crown Prince, your dinner is ready.

686
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,010
I am not interested as I have indigestion.

687
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,650
I will bring a physician.

688
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:46,170
I am just feeling congested. Do not worry about it.

689
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:49,060
Yes, Your Highness.

690
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,360
Please hurry, Your Highness.

691
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:07,230
Where are we going, by the way?

692
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:13,180
To see someone who knows a lot about needle cases.

693
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,980
Yes? Who is that?

694
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,660
Welcome home, Father.

695
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:49,160
Mu Baek, are you there?

696
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:54,090
Did you call me?

697
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:59,710
Do not let my daughter enter the clinic from now on.

698
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,380
Father.

699
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,780
Yes, sir.

700
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,580
Follow me.

701
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,570
I am not interested in getting married.

702
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,410
What did you say?

703
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,150
I also...

704
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:27,070
know about my fate.

705
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,110
I heard that the man I marry will die.

706
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:34,690
Am I mistaken?

707
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:40,310
How could I possibly...

708
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:44,400
become the crown princess, then?

709
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:51,020
I want to care for you and work at the clinic my whole life.

710
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:56,370
I am proud of you for saying that, but I have a secret plan.

711
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:58,060
I will take care of everything.

712
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:02,020
You just need to do as I say.

713
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:06,210
I have never gone against your will, but I cannot this time.

714
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:09,750
Didn't I say I will take care of everything?

715
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:13,610
Quit having silly thoughts and prepare to enter the palace.

716
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:16,440
- Father—
- I need to rest.

717
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,560
You may leave now.

718
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,310
I will give you that much more if you succeed.

719
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:10,420
However, you cannot make a mistake. Understand?

720
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,890
Do not worry, sir.

721
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:16,000
I will take care of everything so that nothing goes wrong.

722
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,370
You will have to see it through.

723
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:20,040
Yes, sir.

724
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,830
My Lady, where are you going?

725
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:37,380
Do not ask unless you will come with me.

726
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:07,310
The night air is cold. Go inside, My Lady.

727
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,610
Could you pretend you didn't see me?

728
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,450
- I am sorry.
 - If so,

729
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:17,360
could you tell me what the secret plan Father mentioned is?

730
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:21,300
The others might not know, but you surely do.

731
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,250
Tell me what the plan is.

732
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:26,700
I am sorry, but I cannot tell you.

733
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:32,310
But please understand that everything is being done for your sake.

734
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:37,710
Can you promise me that it does not involve hurting others?

735
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,090
I am asking because I have a hunch.

736
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:47,480
I am thinking of leaving home for a reason.

737
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:52,960
I need to stop Father.

738
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,870
If he does something dangerous for my sake,

739
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:59,890
I wouldn't be able to live in peace even if I became the crown princess.

740
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,760
Please help me.

741
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,470
I beg you.

742
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:56,260
The royal physician is out somewhere.

743
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,930
You don't know when he will return?

744
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,520
He will be back tonight.

745
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,400
Good work.

746
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,810
- Let me pour you a cup.
- Yes.

747
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,320
Young Master.

748
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,210
- Hey, you bastard!
 - Young Mast—

749
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:39,450
Young Master.

750
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:42,330
Young Master.

751
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:50,030


752
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:59,370
 Thanks to Seo Beom Shik, Jo Jin Se, and Kim Won Hun for special appearances.

♫  In a long memory  ♫

754
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:16,530
♫  I am searching for you, blurry in the distance  ♫

755
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:22,920
♫  Where is all the longing  ♫

756
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:29,750
♫  deeply etched in my heart and lingering in the time past?  ♫

757
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,640
 Missing Crown Prince Preview 
 ♫  where could it be?  ♫ 

758
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,840
 Are you sure it is the crown prince? 

759
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,020
 I think it is him. 

760
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,940
 We do not know what danger the crown prince is in. 

761
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,160
 But you could not find any trace of him? 

762
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,780
 Why are you suddenly telling me to give up on him? 

763
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:47,480
 Make a choice. Will it be the crown prince or the throne? 

764
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:50,080
 We beg your understanding. 

765
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,660
 Do you think you can keep the ugly secret by killing me? 

766
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:56,440
 In the end he will give up  the crown prince. 

767
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:01,310
 Did Father order you to kill me? 

768
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:05,720
♫  I'm going to walk toward you  ♫
