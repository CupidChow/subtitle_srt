 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts.

 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines.

 Episode 3 

12
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,070
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

13
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,320
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and complete it.

14
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,420
Your Highness!

15
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,750
Your Highness.

16
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,130
Your Highness, p-please remain conscious.

17
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,430
Is this Gab Seok?

18
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,210
Yes, I will alert His Majesty and bring a physician right away.

19
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,090
Do not do that.

20
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,960
We need to ... escape the palace.

21
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,930
- Pardon?
 - Hurry.

22
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,010
S-Should you not go to see the physician?

23
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,710
I told you I cannot.

24
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,300
We cannot trust anyone right now.

25
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,410
But still, it will be bad if you do not get treated right now.

26
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,170
Goodness ...

27
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,480
 Scholar sir. 

28
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,880
 If anything were to happen by chance, come back to this place. 

29
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,270
 I will be waiting. 

30
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,210
 I am telling you just in case. So, do not forget. 

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,710
We will go to Danbongmun*.
 (One of the entrances of Changdeokgung palace) 

32
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,920
Danbongmun?

33
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,650
Do you think we can escape without anyone knowing?

34
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,280
There is a dog hole ( small opening in wall ) nearby, but ...

35
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,010
Let us hurry.

36
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,030
Where do we go now?

37
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,930
Your Highness?

38
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,330
Scholar sir?

39
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,980
Who is it?

40
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,270
It is me, Scholar sir.

41
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,340
You really were waiting.

42
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,590
Did your wound open up again—

43
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,100
This bleeding is ...

44
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,020
He was stabbed with a dagger.

45
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,530
- Hurry up and go to a clinic—
 - I cannot

46
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,190
go to the clinic.

47
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,870
Why?

48
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,570
I have my reasons.

49
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,790
Do you think ... you can help me?

50
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,060
I understand. Please follow me.

51
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,700
Please get on my back.

52
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,160
- Who is she?
 - I will tell you later.

53
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,040
Just follow her.

54
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,290
Can we trust that woman?

55
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,050
Your Highness!

56
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,430
Young Master!

57
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,220
Young Master!

58
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,240
- How is he?
- He must go to a clinic right now.

59
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,570
There is a clinic close by. Let us go there—

60
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,990
Didn't you hear him?

61
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,290
Y-Young Master said he could not go to a clinic.

62
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,290
Are you going to let the scholar die like this, then?

63
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,460
His wound is one thing, but he lost too much blood already.

64
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,830
If we delay further, he will lose his life for sure.

65
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,080
There is no time for this.

66
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,390
If you want to save the scholar, we must go to a clinic right away.

67
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,990
Gosh, what am I supposed to do?

68
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,780
Please wake up, Your Highness. I beg you.

69
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,530
Your Highness. Are you all right, Your Highness?

70
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,290
I only pricked it with a needle. There is no need to overreact.

71
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:43,190
The crown prince will be found soon. So please do not worry too much.

72
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,300
Even if they are eunuchs,

73
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,340
they could not handle the crown prince and had to cause this problem?

74
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,580
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

75
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,050
The head eunuch said his wound is deep, so he will not survive past tonight

76
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,010
if he does not get treated at a clinic.

77
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,580
Tell them to search every clinic near the palace.

78
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,300
We must find the crown prince before the king does.

79
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,100
- Yes, Your Highness.
  - Your Highness, His Majesty the King— 

80
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,210
The crown prince. Where is the crown prince right now?

81
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,890
Why are you looking for the crown prince here?

82
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,050
What did you do to crown prince?

83
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,820
Answer me.

84
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,390
I am asking what you did to that child.

85
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,400
Please calm down and take a seat.

86
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,140
- Sit down and calmly—
 - Do you not fear the heavens?

87
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,600
How can you recklessly harm

88
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,710
a nation's heir just to cover up your own filthy flaws?

89
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,520
Is this ... what you wish to do, Your Majesty?

90
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,400
Do you truly seek to oppose me?

91
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,190
Hand over the crown prince.

92
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,490
Give him up now.

93
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,390
If you just give up the crown prince, things will return to how they were.

94
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,370
To how they were?

95
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,540
You will live as a merciful and wise queen dowager

96
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,830
by killing the crown prince and pretending nothing happened?

97
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,070
You are quite amazing.

98
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,450
I guess you are able to live like that, Queen Dowager.

99
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,290
But I cannot do so

100
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,780
because my guts churn every time I see your face.

101
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,670
Watch what you say!

102
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,460
You will regret it, King!

103
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,760
Let us see this to the end and find out

104
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,020
who will be the one to regret it.

105
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,640
Your Highness.

106
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,710
I am all right.

107
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,920
We do not know what he will do, so hurry up and follow him.

108
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,880
Yes, Your Highness.

109
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,820
Hear ye, Chief Royal Secretary.

110
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

111
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,380
Announce a mobilization order right this moment.

112
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,660
 Mobilization order: Readying troops for rebellion or national emergency 

113
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,780
Yes, Your Majesty!

114
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,570
Did you just say mobilization order?

115
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,940
Yes, Your Highness.

116
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,250
Is this how things wil end?

117
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,150
I wanted to prevent this havoc by any means.

118
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,110
You must stay strong, Your Highness.

119
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,410
I must.

120
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,680
I am the only one who can protect him, am I not?

121
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,390
Bring in the palace's chief chef.

122
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,220
This sound is for mobilization order.

123
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,280
It looks like there is a crisis within the palace.

124
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,620
Bring me my official robe.

125
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,440
A mobilization order this late at night?

126
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,490
Did the deposed king's henchmen invade again or something?

127
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,630
I hear the crown prince was abducted by a terrible mob.

128
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,480
- Abducted?
- Yes.

129
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,730
His Highness the Crown Prince, who was in his palace, disappeared without a trace.

130
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,210
He might have gone on a secret outing again.

131
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:02,140
There are quite a number of officials who agree with you, including myself.

132
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,950
According to the chief royal secretary,

133
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,980
His Majesty claims it is absolutely not a secret outing.

134
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,980
I also heard His Majesty raised his voice at the Queen Dowager's palace

135
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,050
before giving the mobilization order.

136
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,720
Do you have any idea what is going on?

137
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,180
I must meet His Majesty.

138
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,500
Where is he right now?

139
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,870
Please just be alive.

140
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,110
I will find you without fail.

141
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,570
I will find you and protect you.

142
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,610
So, please ...

143
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,930
Please just survive.

144
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:09,650
Your Majesty, the left state councilor and other officials ask for an audience.

145
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,610
Let them enter.

146
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,840
Have you not heard about the mobilization order?

147
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,220
What brings you to the Crown Prince's palace, when you should be

148
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,530
waiting in front of the king's banner?

149
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:41,030
Your Majesty, I heard you ordered mobilization because of the crown prince.

150
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,530
- That is correct.
 - Though the crown prince has disappeared,

151
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:50,330
I heard there is no physical evidence of his abduction nor any eye witness.

152
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,280
Forgive me for saying this,

153
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,230
but he might have gone on a secret outing again like last time.

154
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,400
It is absolutely not a secret outing.

155
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,600
The crown prince was abducted for sure.

156
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:10,000
Could we also know the reason why you are so sure, Your Majesty?

157
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,870
If we know the reason,

158
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,900
it might help us find the crown prince, Your Majesty.

159
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:27,550
For now, I hope you will just trust my judgment and obey.

160
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,590
It is understood.

161
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,080
Thank you.

162
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,620
Your Majesty, I have a request.

163
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,700
Go ahead.

164
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,450
We will quickly find the crown prince.

165
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,240
So, please withdraw the mobilization order.

166
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,880
I am worried the sound of the horn blowing

167
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,580
and the movement of the soldiers will make the citizens unable to sleep and be anxious all night.

168
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,290
and be anxious all night.

169
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,600
I understand your worries, Left State Councilor.

170
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,540
But this is about the crown prince's safety.

171
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,530
Your Majesty, mobilization orders are only for a great national catastrophe.

172
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,250
It is appropriate to withdraw the order.

173
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,140
Please listen to our plea.

174
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,000
 Please listen to our plea! 

175
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,680
Enough!

176
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,050
The crown prince disappeared from inside the palace.

177
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,090
Is there a greater catastrophe than this?

178
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:32,420
Do you not feel any danger when our nation's heir, the crown prince, disappeared?

179
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,240
However, Your Majesty, the crown prince—

180
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,560
We will find the crown prince quickly.

181
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,810
I want to be alone. Take your leave.

182
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,710
The heavens helped.

183
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,340
Does that mean His Highness—

184
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,820
I mean, my young master is going to recover?

185
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,160
I think the danger has passed for now.

186
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,220
But he lost too much blood, so we cannot rest assured.

187
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,620
What are we supposed to do, then?

188
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,810
Wait, where are you going?

189
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,680
Since we cannot bring a physician, I will go find medicinal herbs.

190
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
I will come with you.

191
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,870
Leaving the scholar alone?

192
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,550
I will be back soon. So please tend to him.

193
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,580
H-Hold on.

194
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,130
You cannot tell anyone about my young master being here.

195
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,840
Do you understand?

196
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,120
I understand.

197
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,070
what is all this fuss at this late hour?

198
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,970
Do you think he's using the crown prince as an excuse

199
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,410
in order to show who is in charge, since rebels keep showing up?

200
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,650
Do you not find it strange?

201
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,520
What do you mean?

202
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,470
If it turns out to be a secret outing, not an abduction,

203
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,560
he knows there will be quite the talk.

204
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:33,250
It bothers me that His Majesty is that firm about this.

205
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:39,060
Since Queen Dowager might know what His Majesty is thinking,

206
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:45,050
how about you ask the Queen Dowager, Your Excellency?

207
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,910
Your Highness, your supper is ready.

208
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,220
I told you I do not want any. Send it back.

209
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,580
Your Highness, you skipped dinner, too.

210
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,540
You must stay strong, especially at times like this.

211
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,000
- Bring it in.
- Yes.

212
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,150
Look!

213
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,940
Hey, there—

214
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,970
- Hey, there!
 - W-What is going on?

215
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,270
W-What do we do?

216
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,960
Y-Your Highness, Your Highness!

217
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,510
Your Highness, please wake up!

218
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,750
Please calm down.

219
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,200
It will only add to the chaos if you do not hold your ground, my queen.

220
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,920
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

221
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,470
Despite trying so hard to pull myself together,

222
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,870
my chest keeps trembling, and I cannot breathe.

223
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,460
Your Majesty, the Queen Dowager has arrived.

224
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,510
Let her enter.

225
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,670
You need to rest, so stay seated, my queen.

226
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,560
- However—
 - It's all right, so do as I say.

227
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,720
Why is it only you? Where is Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok?

228
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,680
Choi Sang Rok took off from work early, because he was on the night shift last night.

229
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,620
But he will soon come back to the palace, since there was a mobilization order.

230
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,130
They are physicians whose medical skills are just as good as Choi Sang Rok.

231
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,180
So please do not worry too much, Your Majesty.

232
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,360
Since you ordered mobilization, all of your officials will gather soon.

233
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,960
So, can you be doing this here?

234
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,700
I will tend to the queen, so you should get going.

235
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,660
Oh, my. Your belt has come loose.

236
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,100
Just what did I tell you?

237
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,100
I told you not to do anything.

238
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,450
Did I not tell you so?

239
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,260
Everyone, take your leave.

240
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,430
I ordered you to take your leave!

241
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,370
Is the crown prince alive?

242
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,960
He is still alive for now.

243
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,400
But it would depend on your effort, Your Majesty.

244
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,440
It ended with a warning this time.

245
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,720
But you will see someone you cherish bleed for sure

246
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,960
next time.

247
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,610
What are you saying right now?

248
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:25,430
I absolutely do not understand what you two are talking about!

249
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,150
It is better you do not know, Queen. So do not try to understand.

250
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,830
Y-Your Majesty!

251
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,420
Is the head eunuch out there?

252
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

253
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,310
Tell the chief royal secretary

254
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:05,550
I said to withdraw the mobilization order.

255
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,010
Are you satisfied now?

257
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:25,130
It would have been better if you had listened to me sooner.

258
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,960
I will take care of the food taster matter, so do not worry.

259
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,540
The queen seems to be in a state of great distress.

260
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:38,970
So, you can just comfort the queen, Your Majesty.

261
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,340
If a mobilization order is withdrawn so lightly, as if it were a joke,

262
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,450
will the royal decrees have any meaning?

263
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,550
I am sure His Majesty had his doubts, too.

264
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,570
After the chaos last time,

265
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,730
how could he have even imagined that the crown prince

266
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,820
would go on a secret outing again?

267
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,810
I can understand once or twice.

268
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,120
This is a serious problem.

269
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,630
That is exactly what I am saying.

270
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,530
Don't you agree?

271
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,700
Did you want to see me, Royal Father?

272
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,750
How is the queen doing?

273
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,680
She will get better since she took medicine.

274
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,030
By the way, what on earth has happened?

275
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,010
My mother would not tell me, no matter how many times I asked.

276
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,890
Is it something I should not know?

277
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,230
Come.

278
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,340
Come closer.

279
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,730
- Then, Hyeong-nim is ...
 - Either he is held hostage by the queen dowager ...

280
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,050
or he has run away.

281
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,440
I will find Hyeong-nim this instant.

282
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,240
How will you find him?

283
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,390
I will capture someone close to the queen dowager and threaten them.

284
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,020
Starting with that head eunuch ...

285
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,970
What? And what if queen dowager finds out?

286
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:07,200
Did I not tell you to fix that fiery temper of yours?

287
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,760
Please forgive me.

288
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,190
The crown prince's safety is on the line.

289
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,400
We cannot be cautious enough, don't you understand?

290
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,210
Then, what do we do?

291
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,030
We cannot let the queen dowager control us and do everything she wants.

292
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,590
We must also find the queen dowager's weakness.

293
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:31,500
You will meet with Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok

294
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,200
and find out who the needle case belongs to.

295
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,190
The case owner is queen dowager's only weakness.

296
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,520
But she can simply discard him.

297
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,370
Will she not try to cut off her tail

298
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,500
since she has been found out?

299
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,080
She would have discarded him already, then.

300
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,470
If that were the case, the situation would not have come to this.

301
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,530
Do you not think he is

302
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,850
very important to the queen dowager, since she gas gone that far?

303
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,450
- You are leaving again?
- Yes.

304
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,830
My Lady, what has gotten into you?

305
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,170
What if the master comes in?

306
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,640
That is why I must leave quickly before he comes home.

307
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,900
Goodness! I am going insane.

308
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,400
Why? What, now?

309
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,580
You said everything went well without Father catching you.

310
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,080
Exactly!

311
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,440
We did not get caught and barely got away with it.

312
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,600
- But if you leave like this again—
 - I will be back as soon as I can.

313
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,230
My Lady!

314
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,570
I will be back.

315
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,320
Wait, hold on. You are just leaving like this?

316
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,990
I told you he thinks I am you.

317
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,860
And is it good that the servants see you leaving like this?

318
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,900
This ought to do it, right?

319
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,660
Why don't you just kill me before you leave?

320
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,680
I'll die anyway, so dying by your hands rather than the master's would be ...

321
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,540
Oh Wol,

322
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,560
I did not tell you because I was afraid you would be shocked.

323
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,800
That scholar was stabbed with a dagger.

324
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,590
What?

325
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,110
Who would do something so evil—

326
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,520
Could it be His Lordship the master—

327
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,010
No way. I am wrong, right?

328
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,340
Tell me I am wrong, My Lady.

329
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,080
I wish you were wrong, too.

330
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,680
So if that scholar dies, the master would be charged with murder‍—

331
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,310
That is right. So, we should save that man for Father's sake, right?

332
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,680
Yes, all right. Go save him.

333
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,690
I will come up with something to tell the master.

334
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,280
Thank you.

335
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,980
I just need to return before daybreak, then, right?

336
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,520
I am off!

337
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:16,280
My Lady! I never said that!

338
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,280
Do you not recognize me?

339
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,260
I am sure you do.

340
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,300
What brings you to our house?

341
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,060
Your house—

342
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,210
You were this family's daughter?

343
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,340
Were you not here to see me?

344
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,250
I did miss you with all my heart,

345
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:12,570
but how could I find you,

346
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,480
when you would not tell me your name, residence, or anything else?

347
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,590
I came to see the royal physician.

348
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,230
Is he inside?

349
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,250
He went to the palace because of the mobilization order.

350
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,540
Come back next time.

351
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,660
The mobilization order was withdrawn, so he should be back soon.

352
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,550
I must meet him today, so I shall wait.

353
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,760
Be my guest. Please excuse me.

354
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,480
Wait!

355
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,970
Even if we are grown man and woman,

356
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,950
still we are acquainted with each other.

357
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:49,490
If your father is not home, is it not right for his daughter to treat his guest?

358
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,650
I apologize. There is somewhere I must be urgently.

359
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,180
You are still as cold as ever.

360
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,540
But I know where you live now,

361
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,450
so you can no longer run away from me.

362
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,920
 He was bitten by a snake? 

363
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,100
 He was bitten by a snake! 

364
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,790
 - What is the matter?
 - Come see him! 

365
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,910
 What happened? 

366
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,020
 Oh, no! 

367
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,410
 Do you know who he is? 

368
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,890
 Get that away from him right now. 

369
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,860
 If a venomous snake bit him, he might die if untreated. 

370
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:55,280
 Your blood is black. It seems it was a venomous snake. 

371
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,580
 What are you doing? Bring a physician! Quickly! 

372
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,500
 All right! 

373
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,230
 I think I stopped the poison from spreading. 

374
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,370
 But please stay put until the physician comes, just in case. 

375
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,430
 Do you understand? 

376
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:46,250
♫  You keep growing larger/i&gt; ♫ 

377
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:53,510
♫  and seem just unreachably far away,  ♫

378
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,460
 Maiden, I did not even know I got a paper cut from studying so hard. 

379
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,520
 Look at how much I am bleeding. 

380
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,170
 I think I am too dizzy. 

381
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,710
 I think I might get better if I lean on you for a mom— 

382
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,390
 I think you need acupuncture therapy. 

383
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,450
 - Acupuncture therapy?
 - No, not acupuncture therapy— 

384
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,510
♫  the more my heart aches deep inside  ♫

385
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,860
 I have a cold. Is this a concoction good for a cold? 

386
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:35,360
♫  Are you there?  ♫

387
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,280
♫  Look at me, can you feel my heart?  ♫

388
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,120
 Do you want some? 

389
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,230
 This is a new one. 

390
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,350
 This is the biggest one. 

391
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,090
 No, So Hui. 

392
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,580
 Please open your eyes, So Hui! Please ... 

393
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,060
 She did not even know she was pregnant. 

394
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,310
 This girl did not do anything wrong. 

395
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,900
 Why do you need to die like this? 

396
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,500
 I am sorry, So Hui! 

397
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,710
What brings you to my house, Your Highness the Grand Prince?

398
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,850
It has been a while, Sir.

399
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,340
Have you been well?

400
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,110
Yes. Yourself as well, Your Royal Highness?

401
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:41,290
Yes. What can possibly happen to a bum

402
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,490
who only drinks alcohol and reads poems?

403
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,440
What a silly thing for you to say.

404
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,260
Oh, right.

405
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,890
I just met your daughter.

406
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,210
My Myeong Yun?

407
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,410
Yes.

408
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:15,050
Father, how can you try to harm an innocent life?

409
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,020
Did you have to go this far?

410
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,290
Who ...

411
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,110
It was you.

412
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,170
Are you awake now?

413
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,500
Where is...

414
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,970
my companion?

415
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,290
Wake up.

416
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,210
Who goes there?

417
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,960
Young Master!

418
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,250
Are you all right?

419
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,020
M-My chest ...

420
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,990
He survived because the dagger missed his heart by heavens' luck.

421
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,970
It was not luck.

422
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,040
He intentionally missed a vital spot.

423
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,160
What do you mean by that?

424
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,120
I came to where you were because Sang Su—

425
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,840
I will tell you later.

426
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,740
I will make some porridge.

427
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,750
She catches on quickly.

428
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,780
Who is that maiden?

429
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,020
She belongs to the household I was kidnapped by.

430
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,980
What? Why would someone from that household ...

431
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,090
That is not important right now.

432
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,940
How long have I been unconscious?

433
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,880
It has not even been one night.

434
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,420
Where is this place?

435
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,050
It is the courtesan house.

436
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,830
The courtesan house?

437
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,530
Who on earth is he?

438
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,450
Could it be a lover you hid from your family?

439
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,550
No, I told you he is not.

440
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,460
How about the man who followed you around all the time?

441
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,720
Who?

442
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,020
The scholar who got bitten by a snake.

443
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,610
Oh, the handsome scholar?

444
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,420
It seems it was all in vain.

445
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,300
I should say.

446
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,360
Sang Su did?

447
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,080
Sang Su was the one who told you?

448
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,110
Yes, Sang Su informed me in advance

449
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,730
and thus I was able to save Your Highness.

450
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,720
Who is it?

451
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,850
 Urgent 

452
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,740
 Please forgive me, Your Highness. 

453
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,680
I survived thanks to Sang Su.

454
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,460
Gosh, that is not true, either.

455
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,910
That knave dared to put a dagger into your body.

456
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,320
I will beat him when I meet him.

457
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:00,460
In fact, ones like us cannot help it when superiors give us an order.

458
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,830
It is obvious what happened.

459
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,650
They probably threatened him with his family's lives.

460
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,040
That is why he could not help—

461
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,130
Be quiet.

462
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:12,620
I understand what you mean, so you can stop.

463
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,100
By the way,

464
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,370
we should at least let Grand Prince Do Seong know.

465
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:25,630
Once he knows, the first thing he'll do is barge into the queen dowager's palace.

466
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,840
Forget it. Things will only get worse.

467
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,600
Is it not at its worst already?

468
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,020
How much worse can it be when you were stabbed?

469
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,250
All right. What brings you here?

470
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:00,380
His Highness the Crown Prince probably had shown you a needle case.

471
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,830
Perhaps you remember that?

472
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,510
Yes. I do remember.

473
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,760
He told me that you said you would check

474
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,250
who the needle case belongs to at the Royal Clinic.

475
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,260
- Did you find out?
- Yes.

476
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,840
It belongs to Heo Jin Su, a physician in charge of the queen dowager's palace.

477
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,730
The queen dowager's palace?

478
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,540
Yes. What is the matter?

479
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,770
It is nothing.

480
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,960
Do you happen to know where he lives as well?

481
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,010
Sir, you have a guest.

482
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,640
Sir!

483
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,140
Sir!

484
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,180
Sir?

485
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,570
 Physician Heo is dead! 

486
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,450
Your Highness!

487
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,100
Your Highness!

488
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,800
Your Highness ...

489
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,020
It seems he took his own life to protect the queen dowager.

490
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,830
I am worried about what the queen dowager will do once she finds out about this.

491
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,810
Do not worry too much.

492
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:01,850
I have also set up measures for the unforeseen.

493
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:13,330
I told the chief royal secretary to convey what I said to the chief military officer.

494
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:19,490
If anything happens, the chief military officer will bring his soldiers and wipe them all out.

495
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,850
You heard, right?

496
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,950
As such, Royal Father has prepared his plans as well.

497
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,960
So do not worry too much, Royal Mother.

498
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,790
How can I not worry?

499
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:35,330
That means there can be a bloodbath inside the palace.

500
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,320
His Majesty or you might end up getting hurt.

501
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,270
I am afraid.

502
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,490
I cannot forget the face of the food taster vomiting blood.

503
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,630
How can you say such absurdities?

504
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:53,740
You have my royal father and myself on your side.

505
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,610
Royal Mother, there is actually a woman I have feelings for.

506
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,620
Is that true?

507
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,560
Yes, Royal Mother.

508
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,080
Which family's daughter is she, and how old is she?

509
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,450
M-Mother.

510
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,600
Hurry up and tell me. I am dying.

511
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,190
What is the rush?

512
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,900
You refused his excellency Pil Dong's daughter and the chief scholar's niece.

513
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,240
You rejected every woman there is, so how could I not be at my wit's end?

514
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,530
I will send a matchmaker right away and—

515
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,090
Royal Mother!

516
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,250
Why?

517
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:44,030
I could not tell you because I knew you would have acted like this.

518
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:48,180
I will tell you after taking care of

519
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,610
the problem with the queen dowager.

520
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:56,670
Truly, the crown prince needs to get married first for you to get married.

521
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:02,480
I wonder what the crown prince is doing and where he is.

522
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,650
I hope he has not been hurt in any way.

523
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,080
Why are you staring at me?

524
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,780
I did not know last time because I was unwell.

525
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,770
But your skills are good, you've been properly trained.

526
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:37,550
When did you learn medicine when you are only a servant girl?

527
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,480
I just caught on by observing.

528
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,100
And it is very unpleasant to hear you keep calling me a servant girl.

529
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,250
You can tell me your name, then.

530
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,250
Since I do not know your name, what else am I supposed to call you?

531
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,900
You know I cannot tell you.

532
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,770
In that case, can I give you a name?

533
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:00,140
Do as you please.

534
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:08,680
Since your face is as white as snow, it will be "Baek" for white.

535
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:14,090
And your face is as round as a moon. I will add "Gu" for round.

536
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,870
Baek Gu. How is Baek Gu?

537
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,540
Isn't it perfect, Baek Gu?

538
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,570
Do you wish to die?

539
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:24,010
My goodness. Baek Gu has such a vulgar speech style, hasn't she?

540
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,320
You told me to do as I please.

541
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,680
That hurts, Baek Gu.

542
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,690
Baek Gu.

543
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,120
Baek Gu.

544
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,830
By the way, doesn't it really bother you at all?

545
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,250
What do you mean?

546
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,530
Even if you are not a noble lady,

547
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:58,630
you are a young woman who kept

548
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,730
unfastening a man's robe and baring his chest.

549
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,980
Does it make you feel a certain way?

550
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,750
I am a physician, and you are just a patient.

551
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,380
You might be a physician, but I am not just a patient.

552
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,820
I am "Husband Sir."

553
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,930
You are so persistent.

554
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:24,990
A man ought to have persistence.

555
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:27,250
Do you not agree, Baek Gu?

556
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,330
I am joking.

557
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,710
I only joked because I am sad to part ways with you, so do not get angry.

558
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,300
Part ways with me?

559
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,000
What do you mean, all of a sudden?

560
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,010
I must go somewhere urgently.

561
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:46,870
No matter what the rush, you cannot move yet.

562
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,830
Your wound might open up again, and it will be serious trouble.

563
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:53,430
Thank you for your concern, but I cannot postpone it.

564
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,920
You cannot.

565
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,050
I do not know what it is, but nothing is more important than your life.

566
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,880
So I cannot let you go.

567
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,600
Even if the person I am trying to meet is the royal physician?

568
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,410
Sorry? The royal physician?

569
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:13,800
If my condition worsens, I am sure he will give me proper treatment.

570
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,700
So, can I get going now?

571
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,450
No, you surely cannot go.

572
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,780
What? Could it be you do not trust the royal physician's medical skills?

573
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,800
N-No, that is not the case.

574
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,800
Well, if you are that worried about me,

575
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,640
you can come with me.

576
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,060
Yes, I will—

577
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,230
- Sorry?
 - What is the matter now?

578
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,050
You are acting as if you lost your mind.

579
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,900
It is nothing. You said it is an urgent matter.

580
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,700
You should get ready. I will be outside.

581
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,890
Their fates have become twisted.

582
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,980
If the crown prince lives, your daughter dies.

583
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:11,990
If your daughter lives, the crown prince dies.

584
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,900
Is there no other way?

585
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,380
Even I cannot do anything about it this time.

586
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,760
You can only accept the fate.

587
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,470
Give up on the crown princess position.

588
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,740
I cannot do that.

589
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:34,120
Alas, one of the two will certainly die if your daughter becomes the crown princess!

590
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,340
Do you not believe what I am saying?

591
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,930
Not at all. How can I not believe you, Master?

592
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:46,910
However, the crown prince is a position, not a person.

593
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,540
What?

594
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,610
You cannot possibly be saying—

595
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:58,560
Anyhow, you are my life savior.

596
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,910
I cannot leave without even knowing your name.

597
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,210
Are you not going to tell me to the end?

598
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,620
We will not even be meeting again.

599
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:15,020
What use will my lowly name be for you?

600
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,300
Just remember me as Baek Gu.

601
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,060
Still, you never know how things will turn out in life.

602
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,390
I heard you are bound to meet the person you need to meet.

603
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,750
Fate might make us meet again after a long way around, right?

604
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,940
That will never happen.

605
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:40,530
Because there are people who never should have met sometimes.

606
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,320
You must be busy, so please get going.

607
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,730
It is fine. You can leave first.

608
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:51,620
No. I will leave after seeing you go.

609
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:57,930
Either one of you can go first. Why keep dragging this on?

610
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,140
Well, I will get going first, then.

611
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,910
Please get home safely and feel better soon.

612
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,810
Thank you.

613
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,530
You get home safely as well.

614
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,170
You need to get going now.

615
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,180
Gosh, I know!

616
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,220
Do not rush me.

617
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,640
Aigoo, that girl did not look back even once.

618
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,830
You were the only one getting anxious.

619
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:46,790
In any case, a servant girl is not right for a crown prince, right?

620
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,990
Be quiet.

621
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,150
Let us go.

622
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,120
My Lady!

623
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,330
I am still safe, right?

624
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:23,450
Yes, Master is still out.

625
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,590
No, that scholar. I am talking about the scholar we kidnapped!

626
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,050
Why would he come here? Did you get found out?

627
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,050
- No, that is not—
-  Come here*!
(A phrase said at the gate or front door) 

628
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,690
He came!

629
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,500
He's here!

630
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,050
Come here!

631
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,870
Come here!

632
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:56,780
It will be terrible if you get found out. What do we do?

633
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,720
You go and find out why he came.

634
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,940
- M-Me?
- What, should I go, then?

635
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,950
Of course, you need to go!

636
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,110
But he knows my face.

637
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,000
You showed him your face?

638
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,500
You should have hidden your face!

639
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,390
I already showed him, so what can I do?

640
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,630
Hurry up and find out why he is here!

641
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,920
I guess that lady is the one who will become crown princess.

642
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,550
Oh, my!

643
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,060
For crying out loud ...

644
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,520
Please come inside.

645
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,390
Yes.

646
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,990
They say a great boast and a small roast.

647
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:43,530
Her face is a bit ...

648
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,280
You are not in a position to talk about other people's faces.

649
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,990
I mean, there are a lot of rumors—

650
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,120
Just think!

651
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,770
I am sure her heart is beautiful.

652
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,000
Yes, yes.

653
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,730
It has a nice scent.

654
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,590
- What kind of tea is this?
- Pardon?

655
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:18,150
I only brought what I was given, so I do not really ...

656
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,970
It is green tea.

657
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:31,300
I came because I had something urgent to ask the royal physician.

658
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,280
Do you know when he will be home?

659
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,760
Pardon?

660
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,890
Well, n-no, I do not really ...

661
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,080
You can leave it.

662
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,530
- What are you doing?
- Sorry?

663
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,050
Oh, y-yes.

664
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,520
Is there something you want to say?

665
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,900
Well, the thing is ...

666
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,840
our servant told me you came to see my father.

667
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,840
Why do you want to see my father?

668
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,610
Young Master told you just now.

669
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:27,800
He came to ask the royal physician about something.

670
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,280
Yes, what was I thinking? You are right.

671
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,190
He did say he came to ask my father about something.

672
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,800
 By chance, did he come knowing that he was kidnapped? 

673
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,480
I think the tea was brewed well.

674
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,380
The scent is great, and the taste is great, too.

675
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,070
Wait, wait, wait.

676
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,000
What are you doing?

677
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,100
Are you in your right mind? Why would you be wearing-

678
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:28,840
The Scholar we kidnapped is in the men's quarters right now.

679
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:36,880
 The fates have become twisted. 

680
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,720
 If the Crown Prince lives, your daughter dies. 

681
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,890
 If your daughter lives, the Crown Prince dies. 

682
00:57:55,990 --> 00:58:01,820
Did you find out who this needle case belongs to?

683
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,570
Yes.

684
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:05,470
Who is it?

685
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:12,460
I regret to tell you,

686
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,120
but this needle case's owner

687
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,190
has already hung himself to death, Your Highness.

688
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:28,270
 He is Physician Heo Jin Su, who was in charge of the queen dowager's palace. 

689
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,100
 Are you physician Heo Jin Su, who examined the body of Jong Geum, 

690
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,880
 the maid of the queen dowager's palace? 

691
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,710
 Yes, Your Highness. 

692
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,610
 It says you examined her body once. 

693
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,620
 Why did you not do it for the second time? 

694
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,480
 It was clearly a suicide. 

695
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,810
 I thought I should not upset the queen dowager with such a tragic event. 

696
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:54,260
 So, I decided not to examine it for the second time. 

697
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,390
You are looking gravely pale.

698
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,940
Please rest a bit before leaving.

699
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,950
It is all right.

700
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:55,010
I would love to do so, but I have something to take care of.

701
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:02,240
Father ...

702
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,080
Where are you going this time?

703
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,000
What did you say just now?

704
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,970
I said if that man lives, you die.

705
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:19,960
And that man needs to die in order for you to live.

706
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,390
If it is again Master Geo Wu's words, I—

707
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,400
Whether you believe him or not,

708
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,440
I will do whatever it takes to save you.

709
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,400
Father, why are you trying to kill a healthy person just because of the words of an astrologer?

710
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,850
How will you handle all these evil deeds?

711
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:37,430
There is nothing a father could not do to save his child.

712
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,320
That man is also someone else's dear child.

713
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,060
That man also has a father.

714
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,920
Are you trying to lecture your father right now?

715
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,730
That is enough now.

716
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:59,530
Why? Did you think I would not know

717
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:03,260
you helped him escape and have been with him all this time?

718
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,880
I am sure there is nothing more you can do.

719
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,270
But be prudent now and

720
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:14,500
refrain from going outside until the crown princess selection begins.

721
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:33,610
- What about the crown prince?
 - I did as you ordered.

722
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,270
As soon as dawn breaks, you will go back

723
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:40,120
and protect the crown prince until I give you the order.

724
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:45,060
Yes. By the way, if I leave the house,

725
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,480
what will we do about my lady?

726
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,060
I made her understand, so nothing much will happen for a while.

727
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,370
Did you find out?

728
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,310
- Yes.
- What about Father?

729
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:16,800
He went to the palace just now.

730
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,400
Stay put, for goodness' sake!

731
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,050
So I can think for a moment.

732
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:39,190
Think about what?

733
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:44,790
We need to at least guess who locked us up.

734
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:47,120
Do you really need to think to figure that out?

735
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,650
I am sure it was the queen dowager's doing.

736
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,640
How would she know where we were?

737
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,360
She would have had someone follow us out of the palace!

738
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:00,670
If she did, why did they act only now

739
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,080
when they did nothing at the courtesan house?

740
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,660
Why, of all times, did it have to be after meeting the royal physician?

741
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,980
Right.

742
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:16,700
They could have been watching the royal physician's house.

743
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,850
How did she know I would go there?

744
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,030
That is true, too.

745
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,820
What do you plan to do with the crown prince?

746
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,990
I will have to kill him.

747
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,050
Will His Majesty stay put?

748
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,260
Just hold him hostage instead—

749
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:37,380
Did you already forget why we were trying to make

750
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,820
Myeong Yun the crown princess?

751
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:44,510
At this point, for Myeong Yun to become the crown princess,

752
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,780
the current crown prince

753
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,720
must die.

754
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,790
Who are you?

755
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,120
How did you come here?

756
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:30,350
You must hurry.

757
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,720
Let us hurry.

758
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:40,550
What exactly is your identity?

759
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:48,030
Who are you?

760
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:57,870


761
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:04,390
♫  Like a perenially blooming flower also newly blooms  ♫

762
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:09,770
♫  the flowers that bloom again eventually wither and bloom again  ♫

763
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:15,520
♫  What is at the place where the bent branch is above fate?  ♫

764
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,450
♫  I want to dive into the water  ♫

765
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:22,340
♫  where the bright light above is intensifying.  ♫

766
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,580
 Missing Crown Prince
 Preview  

767
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:35,980
 Queen Dowager's lover, who has loved her for a very long time. 

768
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:39,600
 I must at least know if you are on my side or not, in order to follow you! 

769
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,490
 Since you grew feelings for a woman who is to become the crown princess, 

770
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:46,000
 can you oppose the queen dowager, who will make you the crown prince? 

771
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,920
 I freed that man. 

772
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,310
 Where are you hiding that man? 

773
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:53,870
 My Lady. Is he here? 

774
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:57,180
 Traitor Yi Gon, accept your fate!
