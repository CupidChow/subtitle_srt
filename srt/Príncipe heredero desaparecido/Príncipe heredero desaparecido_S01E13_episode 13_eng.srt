 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts.  

10
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,010
 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines. 

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,990
 Do you want to become a mother who killed her own son?? 

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,690
 I told you to shut your mouth! 

13
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,100
I killed her.

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,150
You lost the only way to clear your name because of me.

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,300
And you cannot cure Father or get rid of those people anymore!

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,400
 Why, then? Why aren't you saying anything? 

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,570
Yell at me and ask me why I did such a thing, or whether I have gone mad!

18
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,230
Your younger brother is causing your death so he can live!

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,560
Let go of me. Let go!

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,570
- It's all right.
 - Let go— Let go.

21
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,200
Do Seong.

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,960
It's all right.

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,850
Hyeong-nim.

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,190
 - The food taster was ...
 - As for the food taster ... 

25
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,410
I was the one who killed her.

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,470
Your Highness!

27
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,600
Your Highness. Your Highness!

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,220
Your Highness! Your Highness, you cannot! Your Highness!

29
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,450
Your Highness, please open your eyes.

30
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,830
Calm down.

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,090
What Su Ryeon drank was a drug, not poison.

32
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,220
She will wake up after a couple of hours.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,960
I will now leave it all to you and go, Court Lady Kim.

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,110
Please take good care of Su Ryeon.

35
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,850
You cannot.

36
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,830
What are you doing right now?

37
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,720
The food taster is dead.

38
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,840
I do not know the details yet,

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,670
but a jailer at the prison cells saw the food taster's corpse with a stab wound. So—

40
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,630
It seems I must attend today's assembly.

41
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,620
Once Su Ryeon wakes up, bring her to the Royal Council Hall. All right?

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,480
Y-Your Highness.

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,400
 Episode 13 

44
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,710
What about the letter?

45
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,400
I was headed towards the crown prince's palace.

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,360
Never mind. You can give me back the letter.

47
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,830
Did you look at it?

48
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,050
I was worried for my lady.

49
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,020
I thought I should know the situation to rescue my lady.

50
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,600
Please put me to death.

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,880
I hear the food taster died. Did you know?

52
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,810
Did you also hear who did it?

53
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,530
It was the deposed crown prince. The deposed crown prince.

54
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,720
Is there something wrong with what I said?

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,080
Your late father was such a loyal subject.

56
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,530
The crown prince has arrived!

57
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,730
I received word on the way here.

58
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,800
Her Highness might be late, so it seems we must wait.

59
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,880
 Yes, Your Highness! 

60
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,610
Why does she want to see me?

61
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,890
She said she must ask you something.

62
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,850
You may go in.

63
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,520
Is the crown prince all right?

64
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,200
Are you adding fuel to the fire?

65
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,590
You must have heard everything from here.

66
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,540
He is not all right at all.

67
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,170
Happy now?

68
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:47,670
I know my father falsely accused His Highness of committing high treason.

69
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,220
However, I do not know the reason behind it,

70
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,950
so I cannot find a way to help His Highness even if I want to.

71
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,530
I know it is shameless of me, but if you tell me the reason—

72
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,230
Is this a cat worrying about a mouse or

73
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,500
curing the illness you caused, since you are a physician's daughter?

74
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,270
Why on earth is my father trying to kill His Highness?

75
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,390
Your father has

76
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,020
committed an unspeakably shameful act

77
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,600
and His Highness happened to witness it.

78
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,500
So, your father tried to kill His Highness

79
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,030
to hide his filthy crime, and when that failed,

80
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,800
he even poisoned His Majesty.

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,340
What is the crime my father tried to hide?

82
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,640
The act His Highness witnessed—

83
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,190
If you are so curious, go to your father right now—

84
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,950
Never mind. That man would never tell you.

85
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,250
If you really want to know, go inquire at the queen dowager's palace.

86
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,920
Are you saying Her Highness the Queen Dowager knows about this, too?

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,440
They say even the walls have ears in the palace.

88
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,820
Make sure she cannot set foot outside.

89
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,220
Yes.

90
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,020
You must guard against those entering as well, not just her leaving.

91
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,410
Especially the people from the queen dowager's palace.

92
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,050
 If you really want to know, go inquire at the Queen Dowager's palace. 

93
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,220
We can rest assured for now.

94
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,210
So put your mind at ease and  take care of your health first.

95
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,300
Though Yun Yi Gyeom is not trustworthy,

96
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,580
he will keep an eye on Munhyeong and the crown prince

97
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,450
until Grand Prince Do Seong becomes the crown prince—

98
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,180
How could you do this?

99
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:48,000
How could you attempt to leave me behind and die by yourself?

100
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,060
Did you want me to live on like a living corpse?

101
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,800
- Su Ryeon.
- Please leave.

102
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,140
I do not want to see your face right now.

103
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,410
- Su Ryeon.
- I told you to take your leave.

104
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,220
I am sorry.

105
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,830
I am sorry for what I did, Su Ryeon.

106
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,970
Did you believe I can live without you, Orabeoni?

107
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,820
How could you not know that I would die with you if you died?

108
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,930
Su Ryeon.

109
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,310
It looks like the effect of the drug is still there.

110
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,500
You need to get acupuncture therapy first.

111
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,320
Please let me ask you, Grand Prince.

112
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,420
The food taster died last night

113
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,290
and I heard the culprit is

114
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,130
the deposed crown prince.

115
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,750
Is what I heard correct?

116
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,430
- Regarding that matter—
 - Correct.

117
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,410
It was my doing.

118
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,730
 He killed the food taster? 

119
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,630
Could there be a reason why you could not have the food taster speak?

120
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,630
Is that why you silenced her?

121
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,810
You are speaking inapporpriately.

122
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,600
Are you interrogating the crown prince?

123
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,020
I am not interrogating him.

124
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,900
Anyone would think this, right?

125
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,300
If he was not involved in the scheme to poison His Majesty,

126
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,280
there was no reason to kill her, when he was the one who brought her in.

127
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,110
- Am I wrong?
 - Do not cloud the issue!

128
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,800
They said His Majesty collapsed after eating the croaker the crown prince sent.

129
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,980
If that were true, the food taster should have died back then, too.

130
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,410
The fact the food taster was alive proves

131
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,800
the crown prince has nothing to do with His Majesty's collapse!

132
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,770
He is right! The crown prince was outside the palace

133
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,710
when His Majesty collapsed.

134
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,520
 Are you admitting your crime? 

135
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,540
 I was outside the palace 

136
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,760
 at that time. 

137
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,770
 So, are you admitting your crime or not? 

138
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,640
 I was outside the palace. 

139
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,740
However, the deposed crown prince admitted to treason, did he not?

140
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,110
If you have eyes, read the statement once more.

141
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,510
He has never admitted to it.

142
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,870
That does not mean he denied it, either.

143
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,880
All right. Since the man himself is here,

144
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,130
let me ask you one more time.

145
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,640
Why did you not deny the charge

146
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,250
if you were truly innocent?

147
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,370
Look.

148
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,190
- Even now—
- All right!

149
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,480
This is enough!

150
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:09,580
What is the use of arguing about someone who is already dead?

151
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,950
There is a more important matter at hand.

152
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,150
What matter could be more important than this?

153
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,750
We need to discern which one of these two men is the real crown prince!

154
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:34,340
Could you possibly think we could have both of them reside at the crown prince's palace?

155
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,210
- Hyeong-nim.
 - It's not the time yet.

156
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,760
Her Highness the Queen Dowager is feeling ill,

157
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,360
so she said to dismiss today's morning assembly now.

158
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,090
 Is it  Grand Prince Do Seong or Her Highness the Queen? 

159
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,560
Who are you trying to protect by doing this?

160
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,020
Please tell me.

161
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,760
I need to know your reason to prepare a plan.

162
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,500
It was my doing.

163
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,790
It has nothing to do with the queen's palace.

164
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,980
If they have nothing to do with it,

165
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,340
would the former left state minister Yun Yi Gyeom be as quiet as he is now?

166
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,990
Is it possible he is afraid you may change your mind and speak the truth,

167
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,890
which must be why he is restraining himself.

168
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,810
Your Highness.

169
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,220
I can only say I feel sorry towards you, Grandfather.

170
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,700
Please do not worry.

171
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,000
Hyeong-nim will make sure nothing happens to you, Mother.

172
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,090
I cannot let the crown prince take the blame again.

173
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,730
You know Hyeong-nim, don't you?

174
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,280
He is a wise person, so he must have a plan in mind.

175
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,090
I cannot let the Crown Prince take the blame gain.

176
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,610
Mother, please!

177
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,350
You will only make things harder for Hyeong-nim by doing this.

178
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:55,570
So, please have faith in Hyeong-nim and wait.

179
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,580
- Mother!
- It was my doing.

180
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,160
So, I must be punished.

181
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,850
Your lunch is ready to be served.

182
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,180
- My Lady.
- Please announce me.

183
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,580
H-Her Highness is not—

184
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,590
This is Myeong Yun, the Inspector General's daughter.

185
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,020
Please excuse me, for I have an important matter to discuss with you.

186
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,160
Was this the reason?

187
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,820
This was why you were trying to kill the crown prince?

188
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
My Lady.

189
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,790
What are you doing? Hurry up and go after her.

190
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,860
Nothing I say will be of any use right now.

191
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,310
- Orabeoni!
 - After some time passes,

192
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,720
I will talk to her in a calm manner. Do not be too troubled.

193
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,800
Even if Myeong Yun is strong and brave,

194
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,660
it will be difficult for her to understand.

195
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,260
 So why are you doing this? 

196
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,640
 I just cannot understand why you are trying to kill that man. 

197
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,730
 I never asked for your understanding. 

198
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,210
 So, consider me your birth mother ... 

199
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:25,790
 Father has been poisoned and Hyeong-nim was falsely accused of it. 

200
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,640
 Was this the reason? 

201
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,320
 This was why you were trying to kill the crown prince? 

202
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,390
Maiden. Maiden Myeong Yun—

203
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,580
She would not have gone straight to the queen dowager's palace‍—

204
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,030
Maiden.

205
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,830
Maiden.

206
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,520
Please put me to death, Your Highness!

207
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,780
Please put me to death.

208
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,020
Please put me to death!

209
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:43,570
♫  How much longer must I live until I can forget?  ♫

210
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:50,850
♫  Will you be there after all the years pass?  ♫

211
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:58,230
♫  I am looking only at you with a blank stare.  ♫

212
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:05,520
♫  Like the moonlight there which waxes before you know it  ♫

213
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,810
♫  don't leave  ♫

214
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:19,290
♫  Because it is like the wind is brushing by  ♫

215
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:26,670
♫  it hurts like my breath was taken away and the tears flow  ♫

216
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:34,300
♫  I want to look at and embrace you  ♫

217
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:41,030
♫  I am destroying the longing which comes to me  ♫

218
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:50,640
♫  You are just moving farther away as if you were flying  ♫

219
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,080
♫  I want to hold onto you even if I live only tearfully  ♫

220
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,240
♫  When the sun sets the longing to do it again  ♫

221
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,850
♫  spreads out of control again  ♫

222
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,350
Please move inside and continue your talk.

223
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,940
♫  Like moon waning there  ♫

224
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,340
♫  because it hurts to hear you saying you love me  ♫

225
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:24,740
♫  the tears flow and I cry as though my breath were taken away  ♫

226
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,820
♫  I want to look at and embrace you  ♫

227
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,580
♫  I want to look at you  ♫

228
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:40,170
♫  Destroy it. Because I think it's a wind filled with longing coming to me.  ♫

229
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,620
I also witnessed what you saw, Your Highness.

230
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,760
Maiden, your father and the queen dowager—

231
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,180
How could he do this ... to Your Highness... and to His Majesty...

232
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,970
- Maiden-
 - What am I supposed to do now?

233
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,480
After what he did to you ...

234
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,460
After he did such an atrocious thing to you ...

235
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,540
How am I to pay for all these sins?

236
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,450
Maiden, look at me.

237
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,760
I did not ... grow feelings for someone's daughter.

238
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,210
You are the first woman

239
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,420
I have feelings for the first time in my life.

240
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,730
So, I would like you to also remember me not as the crown prince...

241
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:19,600
but as a man who once had feelings for you.

242
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,260
Where is Myeong Yun?

243
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,350
Why are you looking for Myeong Yun here?

244
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,610
Did you not take her from Yanghwadang yesterday?

245
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,500
The crown prince took Myeong Yun from Yanghwadang, not me.

246
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,140
Did the crown prince hide it from you, too?

247
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,930
When I went to see the crown prince last night, Myeong Yun was with him.

248
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,570
Tell the crown prince to hand over Myeong Yun.

249
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,590
Why do I need to do that?

250
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,330
You will end up marrying Myeong Yun anyway, Grand Prince.

251
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,240
Thus, you must hurry before people start talking.

252
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,230
I will leave it to you now and get going.

253
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,690
Are you Mu Baek?

254
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,180
Where does her mother's maternal family live?

255
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,060
Her mother's maternal uncle lives in Buyeo.

256
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,310
Do you think you can take your lady there without your master knowing?

257
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,240
I only follow my lady's orders.

258
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,590
If my lady wishes to go home—

259
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,960
If your lady goes back home and stays with your master,

260
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,300
she will be punished for treason alongside him.

261
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,350
Lower your head right now!

262
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,320
How dare you—

263
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,310
Treason? That is absurd.

264
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,160
My lady did not do anything wrong.

265
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,760
She is a traitor's daughter.

266
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,750
You must know what your master did, since you are not inquiring further.

267
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,660
However, it would be better if it is not her mother's maternal family.

268
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:34,410
Will you be able to safely protect your lady at a place no one knows?

269
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,120
I already told you.

270
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,110
I only serve my lady as she wishes.

271
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,100
Even if it means your lady will die?

272
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,990
I am going to protect my lady, no matter what.

273
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:53,920
Will you still do the same even if it is against the wishes of your master?

274
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:03,040
The only person I must protect with my life is my lady.

275
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,740
 Did the crown prince hide it from you, too? 

276
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,080
 When I went to see the crown prince last night, Myeong Yun was with him. 

277
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,300
 I already let the kitchen know. 

278
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,030
 They will send in the food and drinks soon. 

279
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,430
 I think people will be coming in and out of this room all night. 

280
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,670
 Let us drink in your room. 

281
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,990
Where is Hyeong-nim?

282
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,000
How did you know he was here?

283
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,920
I was on my way to find you because His Highness wanted to see you.

284
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,680
There is something I must discuss with you regarding Maiden Myeong Yun.

285
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:17,900
The maiden is at Buyongjeong right now.

286
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,180
Choi Sang Rok was there earlier.

287
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,340
Did he come to get his daughter?

288
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,440
Yes.

289
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,480
To be honest,

290
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,070
Choi Sang Rok had entered my room last night with a knife to kill me.

291
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,460
Choi Sang Rok went to such an extent?

292
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,100
Did you get injured?

293
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,290
 I was waiting for her to calm down a bit. 

294
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,840
 But it took this long. 

295
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,810
- I am sorry.
- Not at all.

296
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,720
I am glad nothing happened.

297
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,490
However, just now ...

298
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,840
Never mind.

299
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,520
What do you plan to do now?

300
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,230
If Father's health suddenly turns for the worse today,

301
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,730
we need to get the antidote, even if we have to torture Choi Sang Rok.

302
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,880
Would Choi Sang Rok just sit and take it?

303
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,290
I secretly met with the Chief Military Officer and the Captain of the Royal Guard before entering the palace and got their promise.

304
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,900
They will storm in as soon as they receive the word.

305
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,140
- Then, Maiden Myeong Yun will also—
 - Yes.

306
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,220
She will not be able to avoid harm, either.

307
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,190
We must get her out of the palace as soon as possible.

308
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,650
Hyeong-nim, please. The wind is still cold.

309
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:49,090
How could you make her wait in a place like this?

310
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,810
What else could I do?

311
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,030
Avoiding people came before avoiding the wind.

312
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,580
Are you all right?

313
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,160
- Yes.
- Let us go to the crown prince's palace.

314
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,840
- Your Highness.
 - After much thought, Hyeong-nim and I ...

315
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,210
decided that is the safest place for you right now.

316
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,210
So, please comply.

317
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,690
I will let you get out of the palace by tonight.

318
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,100
- Please do not. I am—
 - If you will not leave,

319
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,510
I will also stay here.

320
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:24,490
Then I will also have to protect Hyeong-nim here.

321
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,040
If she is not at the crown prince's palace, where could she have gone?

322
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,150
She could not have left the palace yet.

323
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,540
She must be in here somewhere.

324
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,720
In here somewhere?

325
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,100
She must be in shock.

326
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,060
What if she goes around in that state and is put in harm's way?

327
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,810
We must find her before such a thing happens.

328
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,450
I am sure her heart was scathed.

329
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:04,120
However, the crown prince and the grand prince Do Seong would not hurt Myeong Yun.

330
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,880
I am sure she is physically safe.

331
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,190
It is true for the grand prince, since he has feelings for Myeong Yun.

332
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,970
But how can you be certain even the crown prince would do the same?

333
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:20,230
I confirmed that the crown prince's feelings toward Myeong Yun are not any different from the grand prince's.

334
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,390
- That means ...
 - Yes.

335
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,300
Since things came to this,

336
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,700
I am letting her be, since it would be better for her to leave the palace knowingly.

337
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,310
So please do not worry.

338
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,500
I understand.

339
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,500
What should we do about the crown prince, then?

340
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,000
Give him the royal decree.

341
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,780
The royal decree?

342
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,650
Get some rest here.

343
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,910
I am going to have a word with Do Seong.

344
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,260
Yes.

345
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,880
Will you be all right by yourself?

346
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,910
Yes.

347
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,050
Gab Seok is standing guard, so—

348
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,790
I am all right now.

349
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,360
Do not worry about me. Please go ahead.

350
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,330
Is the man named Mu Baek trustworthy?

351
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,170
We will have to trust him.

352
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,400
There is no other choice than relying on that man.

353
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,730
I understand.

354
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,920
I will escort her to the meeting spot then.

355
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,590
- You will?
 - Yes.

356
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,950
Would that not be better since there are more eyes watching you than me?

357
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,730
I owe you one, then.

358
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,180
You do not owe me.

359
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,500
She almost became my wife.

360
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,650
Of course, I should do so.

361
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,380
It will be a difficult journey.

362
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,620
I was worried you might collapse if you leave on an empty stomach.

363
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,120
That is why I prepared this.

364
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,400
So, force yourself to take a bite even if you're not hungry.

365
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,060
Yes, Your Highness.

366
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,610
You should eat, too.

367
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,110
Everything is pointless.

368
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,010
I will never get to see her again anyway.

369
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:01,320
So what does it matter, this way or that way?

370
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,540
Did you draw this?

371
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,410
Yes.

372
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,550
There is a village called Sarugae near where my mother's maternal family lives.

373
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:27,310
I was reminded of the sight of apricot flowers blooming in spring.

374
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,920
So I drew this.

375
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,410
These flower petals were apricot flowers?

376
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,780
They are way more gorgeous than this,

377
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,910
but my drawing skills are lacking.

378
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:55,040
They do look like wild peach flowers or snowflakes.

379
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,100
Surely, I think I know when a picture is well drawn.

380
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,590
Well, I am not a painter, am I?

381
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,260
Who is this man?

382
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,420
Who do you think it is?

383
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,280
Judging from his great looks, you must have drawn a handsome scholar.

384
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,780
Could it be the man you love, Maiden?

385
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,580
"I will remember you for eternity."

386
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,460
I will remember you for eternity.

387
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,900
I do not know who she is, but she has a beautiful face.

388
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,400
It seems you drew a beautiful woman.

389
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,000
Could it be the woman you love, Your Highness?

390
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:39,400
♫  The days we loved, the day we ached  ♫

391
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:47,050
♫  Even the day we sometimes exchanged harsh words  ♫

392
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,420
♫  The day that blurred within the fog  ♫

393
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,490
"Until all these flower petals fall and become a mountain...

394
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,640
 I will remember you for eternity." 

395
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:10,340
♫  In the breath which only I hear  ♫

396
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:17,690
♫  I close my eyes again and take a deep breath   ♫

397
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:26,020
♫  Suddenly thinking of you  ♫

398
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:30,000
♫  your breath makes me relax  ♫

399
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,550
♫  so that I can fly anywhere  ♫ 
  Baek Gu 

400
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,640
Baek Gu.

401
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:43,210
I wish I were Baek Gu instead.

402
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:49,070
♫  breathe life with your breath and mine  ♫

403
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,150
I wish you were Baek Gu.

404
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,130
 If I were Baek Gu, I would not have to leave like this. 

405
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,200
 I would be able to stay with you like this. 

406
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,530
 If you were Baek Gu, I would have stopped you from leaving. 

407
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:25,320
 I would have made you stay with me like this. 

408
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:35,870
♫  In the breath that you blow just toward me,  ♫

409
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:45,000
♫  only then can I breathe the same breath againr  ♫

410
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,110
♫  Suddenly, thinking of you  ♫

411
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,890
Please ...

412
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,480
be well and healthy, Your Highness.

413
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,360
You as well, Maiden.

414
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,540
Please be safe.

415
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,810
Eat well and ...

416
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,060
sleep well.

417
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:22,250
♫  You don't have to be afraid anymore  ♫

418
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:30,070
♫  When we release a sigh while our eyes meet  ♫

419
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,020
♫  I fill this breath with my love for you  ♫

420
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,360
This is how I feel.

421
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:46,940
♫  And send it off on a gentle breeze  ♫

422
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:53,220
♫   Breathing life into me with all your might  ♫

423
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,960
♫  Your breath gives me life, ♫

424
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,540
♫  allowing me to stand up no matter what  ♫

425
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:08,750
♫  Into my parched heart  ♫

426
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:16,500
♫  breathe your warm breath  ♫

427
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,120
 "Until all these flower petals fall and become a mountain 

428
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,790
 I will remember you for eternity." 

429
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,440
Are you all right?

430
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,220
Let us take a break.

431
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,100
I apologize.

432
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,570
Did something happen

433
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,290
at the queen dowager's palace during the day?

434
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:31,170
I also saw what the crown prince witnessed.

435
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:38,250
I could not bring myself to go against the crown prince's will, so I came along.

436
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,820
But how could I dare wish to survive?

437
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,720
If it means I can pay for my sins with death ...

438
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,380
What kind of nonsense is that?

439
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,900
You did not choose your father.

440
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,880
Whether I chose or not, the fact I am my father's child does not change.

441
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,870
Are you saying a murderer's child is also a murderer?

442
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,990
If I truly thought that way, you would not be here right now.

443
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:11,590
Because I would have killed you a long time ago.

444
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:16,150
So, do not think that way, please.

445
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,960
Do you think you can walk?

446
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,680
Yes.

447
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,130
 Hyeong-nim, it is me. 

448
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,100
Come in.

449
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,210
I got her out safely.

450
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,420
You did great.

451
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,930
I told her one more time that she cannot go home.

452
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,560
So, you should not worry.

453
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,010
The city gates will open only after sunrise.

454
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,890
She will have to sleep inside the capital today.

455
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,660
I am worried if she will even have a place to sleep.

456
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,630
By the way, where will we sleep if we do not go home?

457
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,000
I found a place near the city gates.

458
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,290
Let us go home.

459
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,930
My Lady, you cannot.

460
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:34,580
If I disappear like this, who do you think will be blamed?

461
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:40,070
It is clear either the crown prince or the grand prince will ultimately be in trouble.

462
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,490
I will not let that happen.

463
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,530
W-What do we do, Ajae?

464
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,990
No, you cannot go home.

465
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,870
- Move aside.
- I cannot.

466
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,190
I told you to move.

467
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,310
My Lady, you know better than me why I am doing this.

468
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,140
Do you not know why I am doing this?

469
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,430
I do. However ...

470
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,570
please do as I say just this once.

471
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,250
My Lady.

472
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,380
If you continue to stop me,

473
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,720
one of us will get hurt, either you or me.

474
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,720
You know me well.

475
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,330
Do not test my will anymore.

476
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,950
Gosh, I am going to lose it. Why is she doing this?

477
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,770
Let us go.

478
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,100
Pardon? G-Go home?

479
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,800
Wait, they said she will die for sure if we go home.

480
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,340
You need to make her pass out and carry her or something.

481
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,170
We cannot let her go home.

482
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,710
Ajaae Mu Baek!

483
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,140
The master has returned.

484
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,550
My Lady.

485
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,220
It is fine.

486
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,220
Sit down.

487
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,570
Do you not hear your father?

488
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,320
Sit down.

489
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,090
What you saw at the queen dowager's palace was—

490
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,150
I do not want to hear it.

491
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,600
The misunderstanding needs to be cleared.

492
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:12,660
I clearly saw it with my own eyes. What are you saying I misunderstood?

493
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,080
What you see with your eyes is not everything.

494
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,030
If it is not everything,

495
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:21,350
do I need to know more about your relationship?

496
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,060
We are ...

497
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:31,860
Did you just say, "We"?

498
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,350
I could not believe what I saw.

499
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,920
I did not want to believe it.

500
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,790
Do not judge me based on what you saw, thinking you know everything.

501
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,280
Loving someone means—

502
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,040
You loved someone ...

503
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,230
you should never have loved.

504
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:56,300
You made the queen dowager of a nation mock and devastate everyone

505
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,730
for not being to overcome her lowly desires.

506
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:03,750
Myeong Yun, you can resent and criticize me all you want.

507
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,150
However, that person is—

508
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,290
How can you be so shameless?

509
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,530
How can you do this as a human being?

510
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,170
Do you not fear the heavens?

511
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,650
This is what I would have told you if I was not your child.

512
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,800
Do you not think there could be a story

513
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,180
the world does not know, which explains how the queen dowager and me ended up like this?

514
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,690
Sure.

515
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:37,300
I am sure there is a story.

516
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,590
However, what I cannot handle is not your relationship.

517
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:49,180
It is the fact that my father is the terribly cruel criminal who killed innocent people,

518
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:54,200
falsely accused the deposed crown prince to silence him,

519
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,350
and even resorted to

520
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:05,040
poisoning His Majesty ...

521
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:12,140
all to hide his filthy relationship!

522
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,400
Even if you had thousands of reasons to justify yourself, I cannot tolerate you.

523
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,340
Your own daughter cannot tolerate you!

524
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,360
Do you think the world will forgive the two of you?

525
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,270
Never.

526
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,130
Even the heavens

527
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,850
will not forgive you.

528
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,560
 Until all these flower petals fall and become a mountain... 

529
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,380
 I will remember you for eternity as well. 

530
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,420
 You did not choose your father. 

531
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,400
 Whether I chose him or not, 

532
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,290
 the fact I am my father's child does not change. 

533
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:58,290
 Are you saying a murderer's child is also a murderer? 

534
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:03,020
 If I truly thought that way, you would not be here right now. 

535
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,430
 Make sure my Myeong Yun ... 

536
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:55,640
This is the queen dowager's royal decree regarding the deposed crown prince Yi Geon.

537
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,100
Please take a look.

538
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,910
All right, then.

539
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,210
You can read it for us.

540
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,620
Yes.

541
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,760
Regarding the deposed crown Prince's exoneration and restoration,

542
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,740
the Royal Court is getting emotional and repeating the same arguments.

543
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:34,870
 Because I am unfortunate and lack virtue, 

544
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,120
 great crises occurred in a row. 

545
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,430
 And after I have taken charge of the state affairs, I am always full of worries. 

546
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:47,970
 So how can I dare rest assured, even if for a moment? 

547
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:53,830
 A crown prince's a nation's root, which the royal family and the nation depend on. 

548
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:56,990
 The faith of the heavens and the people is also at stake. 

549
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,160
 For those reasons... 

550
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,330
The restoration of the deposed crown prince, who murdered an important witness,

551
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:12,190
who could have revealed the treason, is prohibited.

552
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:25,520
 However, after giving it deep consideration, 

553
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,530
 the crime of treason didn't make sense. 

554
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:31,490
 The Deposed Crown Prince Lee Geon will be exonerated 

555
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,450
 and become the Grand Prince Su Seong. 

556
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:39,930
 He shall be henceforth be called the Grand Prince Su Seong. 

557
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,290
How could you laugh right now?

558
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,620
Should I be crying instead, then?

559
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:54,100
That is not what I meant.

560
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,100
How could they make you the grand prince now?

561
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,810
That is not what matters right now.

562
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,640
What does it matter whether I am the grand prince or the crown prince?

563
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,430
I am satisfied with being cleared of treason.

564
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:14,830
It seems that the queen dowager quite openly wishes to start a fight.

565
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,970
Exactly so.

566
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,820
Everyone is already fighting,

567
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,130
divided between the grand prince Do Seong and Your Highness.

568
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:35,850
Her Highness had let her affection get the better of her judgment.

569
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:41,190
Anyone can easily tell why he killed the food taster.

570
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,160
That is an absurd statement.

571
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,400
He should have been restored, not just exonerated.

572
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,970
You need to think about the reason His Majesty entrusted him with the royal seal.

573
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:55,570
The situation is different now.

574
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:59,350
No matter what anyone says, Grand Prince Do Seong should have—

575
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,090
I think that is enough.

576
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:19,490
I have something to tell you all.

577
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:23,920
I am aware the royal court is noisy every day about my issue, day and night.

578
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,890
However, my issue is mine.

579
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,790
I think you must still do what you need to do.

580
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:38,770
While you were arguing about my issue, the appeals piled up this much!

581
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:44,450
If I am guilty, I will humbly accept the punishment anytime. However ...

582
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:49,340
you must not forget the people's issues because of me.

583
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:54,360
Let us first take care of the petitions, even if we have to stay up all night.

584
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,430
Please help us.

585
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,880
We need your experience.

586
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,800
I heard a plague broke out near the Honam region.

587
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,550
We need your help as well, Inspector General.

588
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:49,770
Your grandson has a request for Your Highness.

589
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,280
Go ahead.

590
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,590
I heard we still do not have a left state councillor.

591
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:59,790
The people will suffer for a year if the royal court does not work for one day.

592
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:05,620
I request you reinstate Former Left State Minister Yun Yi Gyeom.

593
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:17,020
What do you all think, officials?

594
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,710
Grand Prince Su Seong's thoughts are truly beautiful and proper.

595
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,920
So, please accept his request.

596
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,970
 Please accept his request! 

597
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,650
Congratulations!

598
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,650
- Congratulations.
 - Congratulations.

599
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,680
Congratulations, Your Excellency.

600
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,250
- Congratulations.
 - Congratulations, Your Excellency.

601
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:13,710
As expected, he is not an easy foe.

602
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:17,930
He captivated the officials in one moment.

603
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:22,100
I think his innate qualities as a ruler are sprouting.

604
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,160
It would be great if we can just change Grand Prince Su Seong's mind.

605
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,570
Could there be a way?

606
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,140
Should I at least brew some concoction?

607
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:53,130
She does not even eat anything, so would she take the concoction?

608
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,790
What do I do, then?

609
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:03,170
No matter how upset she was, she has never been as lifeless as now.

610
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:05,260
Excuse me.

611
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,820
T-This way, please.

612
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,440
I am from the queen dowager's palace.

613
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,860
What does the queen dowager's palace need?

614
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:21,740
Her Highness ordered Maiden Myeong Yun to come to the palace right now.

615
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,290
Tell her I cannot come to the palace because I am unwell.

616
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,360
My Lady,

617
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,360
we are all prepared to leave.

618
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:44,790
If you just tell me where, I will escort you there now.

619
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:49,230
I also want to get out of this house right away if I can.

620
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:53,700
But he is still my father.

621
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:59,730
How can I abandon my father and run away to save myself?

622
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,530
Since you found out everything now,

623
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,650
I will tell you.

624
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:11,720
In fact, on the day the food taster died,

625
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:17,590
Master had attempted to escape the palace with Her Highness.

626
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:23,220
He ordered me to bring Her Highness to the rendezvous.

627
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:28,070
But he did not even mention you, My Lady.

628
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:32,200
I realized clearly that day.

629
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:38,080
To Master, Her Highness' safety comes first and is more important than yours.

630
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,430
Do not speak so thoughtlessly.

631
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:46,830
The master is way more scary than you think.

632
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:51,250
You must know that he can abandon his own child if necessary.

633
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,160
That is enough.

634
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:58,850
No matter what you say, I will not leave without my father.

635
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,820
My Lady.

636
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,120
- Master has— 
 - I am aware ...

637
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,670
that he killed innocent people.

638
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,050
Among those innocent people—

639
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:11,560
I already know the crown prince

640
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:15,840
and His Majesty are among them.

641
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,530
The Madam was among them, too.

642
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:26,620
Your mother, who gave birth to you, was also killed by the master.

643
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,550
What are you ...

644
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,380
Father killed Mother?

645
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,960
How can you utter such absurd words?

646
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,210
I swear to the heavens it is true.

647
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:52,980
I clearly remember the Madam as she bled ...

648
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,440
to this day.

649
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,080
There is no way.

650
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:07,550
You must have been mistaken. Why would Father—

651
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,630
It was because of Her Highness.

652
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:12,920
He killed his own wife

653
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,300
because of the queen dowager.

654
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:20,860
You were only a year old, and you were with her.

655
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:25,290
As if you knew what was happening,

656
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,030
you were sobbing inconsolably.

657
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,350
I still remember your face clearly.

658
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:09,690
Myeong Yun ...

659
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,170
Madam.

660
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,010
Mu Baek.

661
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:27,150
Yes, Madam.

662
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:32,070
Myeong Yun ... Make sure my Myeong Yun ...

663
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,350
Madam.

664
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:44,060
Madam, Madam!

665
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,030
Madam!

666
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,020
This is ...

667
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,450
the swaddling you were wrapped in that day.

668
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:11,790
I just could not throw it away because of Madam

669
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:16,880
who died an unjust death, so I kept it with me.

670
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,840
But I wished you would never

671
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:26,450
have to see this swaddling, My Lady.

672
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,770
Mother.

673
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:15,830
Mother.

674
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,790
Why did you want to see me?

675
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:16,000
This is what the Royal Investigations Bureau found out about your grandmother.

676
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:31,050
What are you trying to say?

677
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,880
I am saying let us forget the past.

678
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,310
You and I have a common goal, do we not?

679
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,760
And if I refuse?

680
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,310
Do you want me to reveal who murdered the food taster?

681
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:59,880
You also know it was not the deposed crown prince's doing, do you not?

682
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,100
 "Until all these flower petals fall and become a mountain..." 

683
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:59,550
This is Mother's silver dagger.

684
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:04,310
She had dropped it at the prison, and I picked it up.

685
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,470
Good job.

686
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:09,030
I will get rid of it.

687
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:12,880
You can forget such a thing even existed.

688
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,620
Is it true?

689
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,400
What do you mean?

690
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,360
Are you the one

691
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:50,220
who killed Mother?

692
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:58,260
Please answer me.

693
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:01,380
Did you ...

694
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,790
murder ...

695
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,410
Mother?

696
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,930
Tell me you did not if it is not true.

697
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:19,740
Why can you not say anything?

698
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,820
Father!

699
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,810
Yes.

700
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,970
You are right.

701
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:41,820
I killed her.

702
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:55,070

 Missing Crown Prince 
Preview  

708
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:28,040
 Find out where Kim Dae Seung is locked up. 

709
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,720
 I am sure it is his doing. 

710
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:33,820
 I came to the palace to stop my father's evil deeds, prepared to die. 

711
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:37,790
 This happened because the brothers are too close to each other. 

712
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,840
 We need to create division. 

713
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,030
 The crown prince's royal officer attacked the left state councillor. 

714
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:45,890
 Did the grand prince Do Seong seem to waver? 

715
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,120
 Of course, he wavered. 

716
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,040
 I cannot sacrifice the maiden, too. 

717
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,830
 In this world, there are things you must do even if you do not want to. 

718
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:56,770
♫  I want to look at you  ♫
