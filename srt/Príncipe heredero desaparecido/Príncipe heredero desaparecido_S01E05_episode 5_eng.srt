 Episode 5 

12
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,680
Your Majesty!

13
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,330
Your Majesty!

14
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,200
Grand Prince, His Majesty was—

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,760
His Majesty was—

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,200
What is going on?

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,860
Why is Father in this state?

18
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,940
I am asking you what happened to him!

19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,900
Please put me to death.

20
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,970
 Please put me to death! 

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,170
Mother, please calm down.

22
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,130
Please calm down

23
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,410
and tell me what happened.

24
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,180
Grand Prince. I was ...

25
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,600
Yes, Mother.

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,480
Your son is listening.

27
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,330
I-It was not me.

28
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,600
I did not do it.

29
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,080
I really did not do anything.

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,950
It is true, Grand Prince.

31
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,250
Please calm down and take your time.

32
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,960
Take your time and tell me.

33
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,690
His Majesty was having his meal, and suddenly ...

34
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,480
He suddenly ...

35
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,260
Were you with him as well, Mother?

36
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,910
Does it mean you prepared the meal, too?

37
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,870
Yes.

38
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,430
No.

39
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,220
It was not me, but Queen Dowager—

40
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,380
Did you ... just say, "Queen Dowager"?

41
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,060
I did not know.

42
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,610
I really did not know anything!

43
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,880
The Queen Dowager ...

44
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,330
The Queen Dowager was ...

45
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,580
What are you all doing? Stop him!

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,540
Stop him!

47
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,200
Your Highness!

48
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,120
Tell them to leave immediately!

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,770
Before I strike them all down.

50
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,950
You already deserve to die for the crime you committed against the Crown Prince.

51
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,200
But you dared to harm His Majesty's body and frame my mother

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,340
to hide your filthy crime?

53
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,910
So, are you going to strike your grandmother with that sword?

54
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,240
Shut your mouth!

55
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,160
The moment you had an affair with Choi Sang Rok,

56
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,150
you were only a lewd wench who is mad for men, not the Queen Dowager.

57
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,510
Do you think I cannot strike you?

58
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,880
Go ahead, then.

59
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,180
Kill me.

60
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,790
However, if I die, His Majesty will never wake up again,

61
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,390
the Queen will be charged with treason for trying to kill the king,

62
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,280
and you would not avoid death for killing me,

63
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,360
the Queen Dowager.

64
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,140
If you still do not care,

65
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,220
go ahead.

66
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,150
 Do you mean it? 

67
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,110
 I am asking if you are still on my side. 

68
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,430
 Since Grandfather has betrayed you, 

69
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,740
 are you asking if I followed him to betray you— 

70
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,630
 Did you? 

71
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,470
 If you cannot trust me that much, why did you want to see me? 

72
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,150
 Did you want to see for yourself if I would 

73
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,410
 hand you over to them with my own hands? 

74
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,800
I also gave His Majesty the option to choose between the throne and the crown prince.

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,690
Unfortunately, His Majesty chose the Crown Prince

76
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,040
and the result is as you see right now, Grand Prince.

77
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,320
I will also give you a chance to save one of the two.

78
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,180
State your choice.

79
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,490
Is it your mother or your half-brother?

80
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,930
Traitor Yi Geon, accept your fate!

81
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,970
 Do you trust me? 

82
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,290
 Yes. 

83
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,860
 I do not know how to doubt, unlike you. 

84
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,990
I have something to discuss with the Grand Prince.

85
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,990
Stand back.

86
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,770
Did something happen at the palace?

87
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,720
Father has collapsed.

88
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,060
What are you waiting for? Arrest the criminal right now!

89
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,940
That is enough.

90
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,780
Your Highness.

91
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,510
It is fine.

92
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,200
Let us go.

93
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,480
Where is Father?

94
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,360
Rather, - what just happened?
 - Pardon?

95
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,210
Why did the Royal Investigation Bureau arrest the scholar whom Father kidnapped?

96
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,880
Did Father even get the Royal Investigation Bureau involved

97
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,520
because he could not take care of it alone?

98
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,680
This was why I was sent on a home visit hurriedly?

99
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,870
Because I should not see it?

100
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,380
My Lady, that is not it.

101
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,800
Why can you not answer me if that is not it?

102
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,020
You can say I am wrong if I am wrong. Why are you unable to say anything?

103
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,120
What is his crime?

104
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,830
At least tell me what crime he was arrested for.

105
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,670
I apologize. His Excellency has—

106
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,300
He has done it all for me, huh?

107
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,590
Are you saying it is right

108
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,110
to trample on and harm an innocent person like this if it is for your child?

109
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,470
Where is Father?

110
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,570
Is he inside?

111
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:41,440
I did everything you told me to do.

112
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,510
So treat Father right away so he can wake—

113
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,140
His Majesty will wake up when it is time.

114
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,130
Please go back to the palace now.

115
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,130
Should you not be by the Queen's side at times like this?

116
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,030
Why? Is there still a way to harm Mother or

117
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,750
is there a reason why I must go and protect her?

118
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,180
How could that be the case?

119
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,340
If something happens to Father

120
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,320
or attempt to kill Hyeong-nim again,

121
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,880
I will kill you, then!

122
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,510
Including the Queen Dowager whom you cherish so much. Both of you!

123
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,430
Introduce yourself.

124
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,710
He is Grand Prince Do Seong.

125
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,460
 Grand Prince Do Seong? 

126
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,300
 Grand Prince? 

127
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,950
 Do you happen to have feelings for my Myeong Yun? 

128
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,330
 I am talking about my daughter. 

129
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,240
What are you doing?

130
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,630
Move out of the way.

131
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,350
Please answer me.

132
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,700
That man does not even know it was you who kidnapped him.

133
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,610
So why are you doing this?

134
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,100
I just cannot understand, no matter what.

135
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,660
I just cannot understand why you are trying to kill that man,

136
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,910
even to the end.

137
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,220
Please give me an explanation.

138
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,690
So I can understand why something like this must happen.

139
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,080
Stop avoiding me so I can understand you.

140
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,940
I never asked for your understanding.

141
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,130
Father.

142
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,430
You were not like this before.

143
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,800
Why did you become like this?

144
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,530
You only lived as a physician who saves people.

145
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,750
How did you end up killing—

146
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,160
Is Mu Baek outside?

147
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,350
Take this child and go back home right away.

148
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,630
If today's incident has nothing to do with you, Father,

149
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,010
please save that man.

150
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,980
Lock her up in her room as soon as she gets home

151
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,150
and do not let her step a foot outside before I give you the order.

152
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,490
- Father.
 - What are you doing?

153
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,060
Take her away immediately!

154
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,040
Please come.

155
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,890
What on earth ...

156
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,360
are you hiding from me?

157
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,700
Just how much did they torture you?

158
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,310
Those rotten bastards!

159
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,010
Aigoo, those wretched bastards!

160
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,490
He's in pain.

161
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,260
Your Highness, I-I will take mine off..

162
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,170
It is fine.

163
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,080
Are you awake?

164
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,290
Your Highness.

165
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,070
Yes, it is me.

166
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,880
It is fine. Do not try too hard.

167
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,810
This lowly and foolish one

168
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,730
has thus again failed to serve you.

169
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,700
How did you endure it until you ended up like this?

170
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,240
Were you also charged with treason?

171
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,210
They said I delivered the poisoned croaker, 
  (yellow corvina) 

172
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,560
which the Crown Prince gave me, to Her Highness the Queen.

173
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,010
Your Majesty!

174
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,660
The Royal Investigation Bureau has detained the Crown Prince.

175
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,280
That means Father was ...

176
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,060
I apologize, Your Highness.

177
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,050
That was it.

178
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,570
That was the reason why.

179
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,670
That was why Grand Prince Do Seong also ...

180
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,680
Yes.

181
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,690
Because Her Highness the Queen is the one who prepared that meal ...

182
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,980
But it is Queen Dowager's doing, not the Queen's.

183
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,670
That treacherous Queen Dowager!

184
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,970
I am worried for Mother.

185
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,750
She must be deeply pained, because she is very fragile.

186
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,750
It is all my fault!

187
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,070
I let Crown Prince end up like that!

188
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,160
This cannot be happening.

189
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,550
What kind of a mother would drive her child to his death?

190
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,960
Mother, please calm down.

191
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,270
I will expose the truth even now.

192
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,340
I'm the foolish wench who was deceived by Queen Dowager.

193
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,050
I offered the meal, not knowing it was poisoned.

194
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,300
It was all my doing.

195
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,660
I will confess it was all my doing and accept any punishment for it.

196
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,050
Mother!

197
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,910
I must go to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

198
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,000
No, I must go to Queen Dowager's palace.

199
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,970
Mother, please calm down!

200
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,550
You will faint at this rate!

201
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,410
I cannot let the Crown Prince die because of me!

202
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,300
I cannot do that!

203
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,780
- I must save the Crown Prince.
 - Mother!

204
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,640
The Crown Prince did not do anything wrong.

205
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,040
I should be the one to be punished. Why would the Crown Prince-

206
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,170
What did Crown Prince do wrong?

207
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,350
Mother!

208
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,090
Crown Prince!

209
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,610
Crown Prince—

210
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,330
Mother! Mother!

211
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,000
You stay there.

212
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,050
Please step outside.

213
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,330
I am sorry, Hyeongnim.

214
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,570
You fool.

215
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,260
What was I supposed to do, then?

216
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,200
What do you think you would have done?

217
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,060
You should have caught Choi Sang Rok.

218
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,710
If you caught the one who used the poison,

219
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,710
Father would have been saved.

220
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,620
As Father has always said,

221
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,510
you really need to fix your fiery temper first.

222
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,250
Hyeongnim, now is not the time—

223
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,500
You should have given it a second thought, especially in a situation like that.

224
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,410
There you go again!

225
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,900
After I die, you will have to rule over this country as the king.

226
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,520
I am sincerely worried.

227
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,620
Are you really going to die like this?

228
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,150
Is there any other way?

229
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,730
Were you always this quick to give up?

230
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,380
It is not like you.

231
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,930
If I deny the charges,

232
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:26,590
Mother could not avoid punishment for treason.

233
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,180
Is that what you wish to happen?

234
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,500
If you are trying to relieve me of guilt—

235
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,340
Is Mother doing okay?

236
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,960
I do not know how I will make up for being such a bad son.

237
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,990
What a great person you are.

238
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,920
Even in this situation...

239
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,210
Please use that smart brain of yours to think up a way out of this.

240
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,040
Hyeongnim!

241
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,160
My Lady, what are you thinking so hard about again?

242
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,830
My Lady?

243
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,280
Huh?

244
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,020
I understand you are worried about the scholar.

245
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,290
But what are you trying to do again, to be thinking so hard?

246
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,960
This lowly one is anxious to death.

247
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,140
Do not worry.

248
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,480
It would be great if there were anything I can do.

249
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,260
I am like this this because there is nothing I can do.

250
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:44,520
♫  In a long memory  ♫

251
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,070
♫  I'm searching for you, blurry in the distance  ♫

252
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,470
 What exactly is your identity? 

253
00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:00,900
♫  all the longing deeply etched in my heart and lingering in the time past,  ♫

254
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,450
 Who are you? 

255
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,720
 Baek Gu. How is Baek Gu? 

256
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:16,100
♫  I'm wandering like a lost child  ♫

257
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:28,300
♫  You are too far away for me to get closer  ♫

258
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:34,580
♫  So that I can touch you at the tip of the passing breeze  ♫

259
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,600
♫  I'm going to walk towards you  ♫

260
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,480
♫  Wherever you are  ♫

261
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,280
This will not do. Let's go.

262
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,300
Pardon? Go where, this late at night?

263
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,870
Why would you treat and visit people even at night?

264
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:07,050
Quit picking fights with me.

265
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,810
I had to do something to stop my head from exploding.

266
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,010
Why would your head explode?

267
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,190
Because there is no solution, no matter how hard I think about it.

268
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,200
I want to stop thinking, but I think even more as I try to stop.

269
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,370
You should just drink alcohol, then.

270
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,440
If you pass out drunk, you will not be able to think at all.

271
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,670
Do you mean it? Can I really do that?

272
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,750
- Sorry?
 - Wait.

273
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,260
- I need to get alcohol from the kitchen first— 
 - Gosh, are you really going to drink?

274
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,700
You cannot!

275
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,300
All right, fine.

276
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,900
Hold on!

277
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,140
I forgot to give Jin her medicine.

278
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,760
I will be right back.

279
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,730
Where will you run off to again?

280
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,920
You can go give it to her, then.

281
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,300
You cannot go anywhere, all right?

282
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,200
Would I leave you behind and go?

283
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,160
I came here because I wanted to drink in silence.

284
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,300
Do not disturb me and leave.

285
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,300
We meet again.

286
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,690
This is a place I frequent.

287
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,870
I did not think I would see you here, Grand Prince.

288
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,000
- If you are asking me to leave-
 - I am not.

289
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,270
I also came to drink in silence.

290
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,700
So, if you do not mind, I will finish drinking this and leave.

291
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,110
I will not disturb you.

292
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,800
Gosh!

293
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,710
My goodness.

294
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,740
Where is she hiding, really?

295
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,480
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

296
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,330
- At the Hyeminseo earlier today— 
 - Didn't you say you will not disturb me?

297
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,920
I shared my alcohol with you, so consider it payment for that—

298
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,060
I decline.  You can take it back.

299
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,030
People would think I am trying to flirt with a man I don't even know.

300
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,990
- You were upset that I was colder than the coldest winter wind— 
 - Cheol Du!

301
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,080
- Cheol Du! 
 - Yes!

302
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,200
- Did you need me? 
 - More to drink.

303
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,900
Yes.

304
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,930
I apologize.

305
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,030
I just had too many things happen today.

306
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,120
So I unjustly lashed out at you, Maiden.

307
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,060
You have my apologies.

308
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,630
I am sorry.

309
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Not at all.

310
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,190
I also had an upsetting thing happen to me today, too.

311
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,370
If I was rude, I apologize.

312
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,210
Let's just drink.

313
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,600
Why are you looking at me like that?

314
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,800
Maiden,

315
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,540
why, out of all people, did you have to be born as the Royal Physician's daughter?

316
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,980
Then, why did you have to be born as His Majesty's son, Grand Prince?

317
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,570
Oh, right. What did you mean to ask me earlier?

318
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,010
I was wondering what you discussed with my father.

319
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,300
I think it would be better for you to ask your father.

320
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,300
In that case, I saw a scholar being taken by soldiers at Hyeminseo today.

321
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,690
Do you happen to know what that was about?

322
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,380
You did not see it?

323
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,610
I am sure you were at Hyeminseo as well when that scholar was being taken away.

324
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:39,240
Why are you curious about that matter?

325
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,160
There is no way you know that scholar.

326
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,720
I just suddenly remembered seeing that.

327
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,850
The person I love and respect the most in this world

328
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,020
might die because of me.

329
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,340
I also might become the cause of—

330
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,060
Rather,

331
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:24,120
I might make an innocent person die because of the fate I was born with.

332
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,540
If it is for that person's sake,

333
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:32,200
I thought I could die in his place.

334
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,170
Instead, I ran away alone and am drinking like this.

335
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,970
I did not know I was such a cowardly bastard.

336
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,100
I somehow barely saved his life, but again today...

337
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,810
"I guess it really is the end this time."

338
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,610
"He will die because of me in the end."

339
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,360
"He will die."

340
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,760
Just thinking about it is driving me insane.

341
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
But there is nothing more

342
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,070
I can do anymore.

343
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,890
 You little— I am your Hyeong-nim. 

344
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,690
 Just stay put, please. 

345
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,310
 Do you trust me? 

346
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:53,420
 Yes. I do not know how to doubt, unlike you. 

347
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,560
 Baek Gu. It looks like I made you worry a lot. 

348
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,660
 He was stabbed with a dagger. 

349
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:16,390
 Do you think ... you can help me? 

350
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,660
 That man does not even know it was you who kidnapped him. 

351
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,310
 So why are you doing this? 

352
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,870
 What are you hiding? 

353
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,050
 We have to make the Crown Prince admit to it voluntarily. 

354
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,870
Will the Crown Prince willingly confess?

355
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:59,990
Well, you have to make him confess, Left State Councillor.

356
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,630
That is how Grand Prince Do Seong will become Crown Prince

357
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,970
and there will be no issues when he becomes the king at a later date.

358
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,200
You will have to do your best to convince the Crown Prince.

359
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,300
Once the Crown Prince says something unnecessary,

360
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,960
all our other plans will be soiled.

361
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,550
Should that happen, things would become uncomfortable between us, right?

362
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,550
Your Majesty, please put your heart at ease.

363
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,650
If you keep skipping meals and do not sleep like this...

364
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,950
- Your Highness?
 - I must go and see his face, at least.

365
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,910
Your Highness, I am sure Chief Royal Guard is guarding the bedchamber.

366
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:53,090
He said he would alert me right away if something happened, so-

367
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,730
Your Highness, Your Highness!

368
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,540
Your Royal Highness, please!

369
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,090
Yes.

370
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,760
You.

371
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,400
M-Me, too?

372
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,940
Send away the guards outside

373
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,110
and go wait at the conference hall.

374
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,250
Yes.

375
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,150
Stay outside for a moment!

376
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,180
How do you feel?

377
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,540
Is the cat caring for the mouse?

378
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,170
You are being a bit harsh.

379
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,150
Do you really think so?

380
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:50,230
I find this situation just as unfortunate as you do.

381
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,790
What is it you want?

382
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,590
If you have come to meet me, whom you have framed,

383
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,890
there must be something you want.

384
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,210
Go ahead and say it.

385
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,880
Please die.

386
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:19,420
Both Her Highness the Queen, who raised you as if you were her own son

387
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,440
and Grand Prince Do Seong, who thinks of you more than his birth brother,

388
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,110
can only be saved by you.

389
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,630
Why would I have to do that?

390
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,090
It looks like you already forgot why I was brought in here.

391
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:42,260
Above all, you need to save His Majesty, don't you?

392
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,410
If you wish to save His Majesty,

393
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,640
you will have to do as I say.

394
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,140
If I die as you order, Left State Councillor,

395
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,410
Father will be the next one.

396
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,460
Am I wrong?

397
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,900
Because, as long as Father is alive,

398
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,090
Do Seong cannot become the king.

399
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,520
That is an absurd speculation.

400
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,500
A speculation?

401
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,330
Had you wished, you could make the Minister of Defense to act

402
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,280
and get rid of the Queen Dowager and Choi Sang Rok!

403
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,610
Do you think I do not know why you obediently

404
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,950
follow the Queen Dowager's orders?

405
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,320
If it means you can make Do Seong the king— Or rather ...

406
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,810
If it means you can become the king's grandfather to grasp the power and control this nation,

407
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,790
you will harm my father without an ounce of guilt,

408
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,450
whether your daughter becomes a widow or not.

409
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,880
Go ahead and deny it again,

410
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,560
if what I said is wrong.

411
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,280
You will not believe me, regardless of what I say.

412
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,040
So you can believe what you want.

413
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,130
However, if you want to save His Majesty

414
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,600
and the people you cherish,

415
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,420
make sure to remember what I say.

416
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,290
You should also keep this in mind, Left State Councillor.

417
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,580
If you are to cause even the slightest harm to Father's body,

418
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,530
you will suffer the consequences without fail.

419
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,810
Your Highness, what happened inside?

420
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,660
Your Highness, are you all right?

421
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,300
How did it go?

422
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,550
What did the Crown Prince say?

423
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,780
Did he accept it obediently?

424
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:31,650
Why did Her Highness come to the prison?

425
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,190
Did you call her to convince the Crown Prince—

426
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,050
What are you talking about?

427
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,680
Her Highness the Queen was at the prison?

428
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,310
 If I die as you order, Left State Councillor 

429
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,800
 Father will be the next one. 

430
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,960
 Because as long as Father is alive, 

431
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,950
 Do Seong cannot become the king. 

432
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:27,250
Your Highness, please return to your palace and go to sleep now.

433
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,930
I already told you

434
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:34,560
I will not move a foot until His Majesty wakes up again.

435
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,360
That is final, so you can leave.

436
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,240
Your Majesty—

437
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,620
What is the meaning of this?

438
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,660
Move aside!

439
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,920
Her Highness the Queen has solemnly ordered not to let anyone enter.

440
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,050
Anyone?

441
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,630
Don't you know who I am?

442
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,040
I am Her Highness' father.

443
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,290
She ordered not to let anyone enter without exception.

444
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,350
Are you being serious?

445
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,860
What are you waiting for?

446
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,050
Announce that I have come immediately!

447
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,930
What are you doing? Hurry up and announce it!

448
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,700
I apologize.

449
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,870
Why you little—

450
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,930
Move aside!

451
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,600
If you do not step back, I might have to be impolite.

452
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,690
How dare you!

453
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,720
Get out of the way this instant!

454
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,740
 Your Highness, I have something to tell you in private! 

455
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,520
Please allow me to see you for a moment!

456
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,010
 Your Highess the Queen! 

457
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,340
Please go back.

458
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,490
Your Highness!

459
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,980
 Chief Royal Guard, until you have my permission, 

460
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,590
do not let anyone enter the bedchamber!

461
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,680
Do you understand?

462
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,080
Yes, Your Highness!

463
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,710
 During Yi Geon's childhood 

464
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:04,760
 Dear wife, we will go live in the palace soon. 

465
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,030
 I do not know when I will be able to come to see you again. 

466
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,490
 Please ... 

467
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,410
 look after and protect our Geon. 

468
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,300
 When I die, in the future, 

469
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,090
 please bury me together with your mother. 

470
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,220
 Geon. 

471
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,200
 Yes, Father. 

472
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:44,300
 The palace is like a mountain of swords. 

473
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,400
 I already know. 

474
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,410
 You don't know yet. 

475
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,600
 Once I become the king 

476
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,630
  and you become the crown prince, 

477
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:03,740
 countless groups who seek power will surround you. 

478
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:10,130
 They will try to seduce you with tongues scarier than swords. 

479
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,810
 Some will claim they are giving loyal advice 

480
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:18,110
  and others will attempt to deceive you with slander. 

481
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,200
 Can you promise me you will protect your mother and your brother, 

482
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:37,210
 no matter what may happen in the future, without wavering? 

483
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,600
 Please do not worry, Father. 

484
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:52,200
 I will protect Mother and my brother without fail. 

485
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,700
 Please believe me. 

486
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,700
Your Highness.

487
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,630
Sang Su and I will say we are the ones who did everything.

488
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,640
So please claim you have no knowledge of it.

489
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,360
Yes, Your Highness.

490
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,980
We will state you had never once were involved,

491
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,430
and we are the ones who plotted everything.

492
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:36,620
I am thankful for your intention, but don't you know I am their target?

493
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,900
- It is pointless. 
 - However ...

494
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,580
I must meet Queen Dowager.

495
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,900
Send a word to Queen Dowager's palace.

496
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:57,800
Her Highness Queen Dowager has arrived.

497
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,700
She said you are allowed to raise your heads.

498
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,180
 All hail Her Highness Queen Dowager. 

499
00:46:55,870 --> 00:47:02,470
Misfortune has befallen His Majesty and his life is in great peril now.

500
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:06,600
Those who were involved in this incident will not be forgiven.

501
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,800
So you must interrogate the guilty and find

502
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,740
every single one of the treasonous mob.

503
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,010
As such, you are to prepare the Capital Interrogations.

504
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,110
 Yes, Your Highness! 

505
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:29,590
Your Highness, to open the Capital Interrogations,

506
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,770
it is proper to have the Three Offices* present, according to the laws. 
 (Offices of the Inspector General, Censor and Special Advorsors ) 

507
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,000
But the inspector general's* position is vacant. 
  (The office that monitored government officials for corruption) 

508
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,650
I believe it is in order of events to first appoint the inspector general.

509
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:49,090
You may nominate those who are qualified to be the inspector general.

510
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,700
I, Mayor of Hanyang Yun Jeong Dae, dare to speak.

511
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,570
I believe Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok is a qualified inspector general candidate.

512
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,740
Although Choi Sang Rok has been a physician,

513
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,080
he is from a prestigious family that has produced a minister and

514
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,400
he has passed the state exam in the past.

515
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,900
Additionally, even after making the biggest contribution to crowning the current king,

516
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,160
he has never once sought power, for he is a man of integrity.

517
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,700
He is a man the officials respect.

518
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,600
So there is no one fitter to be inspector general than him.

519
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,090
Please accept my suggestion.

520
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,800
Are there any other opinions?

521
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,100
The mayor of Hanyang's opinion is appropriate.

522
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,300
So please accept his suggestion.

523
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,800
 Please accept his suggestion. 

524
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,800
Choi Sang Rok, step forward.

525
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:20,010
Choi Sang Rok is hereby appointed as the inspector general.

526
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,310
 Thank you for your grace. 

527
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,180
Additionally, Choi Sang Rok is appointed as the Master of the Household to replace the left state councillor.

528
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,460
He will also be working in the deceased

529
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:35,060
chief royal secretary's place until his successor is decided. This is final.

530
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:40,210
 (The Master of the Household supervised the activities of the kin'gs relatives.) 

531
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,940
Thank you for your grace.

532
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,740
 Thank you for your grace. 

533
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,500
Let me have a word with you. 
   
  

534
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,500
They will be the ones in power from now on.

535
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,080
- What if they dislike you? 
 - Then,

536
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,700
- Are you telling me to cater to their vices and flatter them? 
 - That is not it.

537
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,440
They say the wise one knows what he must do in his situation.

538
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,400
I am sure the right time will come if you wait.

539
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:25,000
Is not the Master of the Household  traditionally a job for the king's father-in-law?

540
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,680
The Left State Councillor will not easily let it go.

541
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,150
Have you not heard?

542
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,020
- Hear what?
- The royal physician—

543
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,000
Or rather, the inspector general— No, no. Right.

544
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,900
No, as the Master of the Household, he is now senior first rank.

545
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,210
The Master of the Household's daughter was internally chosen as the crown princess.

546
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,330
Grand Prince Do Seong hasn't yet become the crown prince.

547
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,480
But they had already decided on the crown princess.

548
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,210
Once the interrogations are complete,

549
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,240
they will probably rush the crown prince investiture.

550
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,490
That seems most likely.

551
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,730
I can understand making him inspector general and chief royal secretary

552
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,680
because that is putting a check on us.

553
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,000
But where did Master of the Household come from?

554
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,200
He needs to be seated in that position,

555
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,960
so they can meet freely without worrying about others.

556
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,800
Just like right now.

557
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,950
You did great.

558
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,190
I am proud of you.

559
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,450
Once Capital Interrogations open,

560
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:45,830
what do you plan to do with the crown prince?

561
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:16,610
Your face is looking quite unwell.

562
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,790
- So why did you—
- As soon as Grand Prince Do Seong is made the crown prince,

563
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:24,430
the left state councillor will first assassinate Father.

564
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,460
After him,

565
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,370
he will kill you and Choi Sang Rok.

566
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,960
Are you worried about me right now?

567
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,140
What I am saying is

568
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,620
you will have to protect my Royal Father by any means if you want to live.

569
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:50,390
I heard you told Do Seong to choose between his mother and his hyeong.

570
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:54,320
But it seems that you don't even have the luxury to choose.

571
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,470
If you want to survive, you will have to continue your regency

572
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:02,750
and to continue your regency, you will have to protect Father.

573
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,140
I believe you understand and will take my leave now.

574
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,690
 The Dowager Queen is regent while the King is incapacitated. 

575
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:25,470
May I ask you one last question?

576
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,900
Were all the moments you interacted with me thus far

577
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,640
entirely pretenses and lies?

578
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,200
If you were sincere even the slightest bit,

579
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:52,650
please let Bodyguard Lee Gab Seok and Eunuch Han Sang Su go.

580
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,290
It is my last request.

581
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
 Many years earlier when the Queen Dowager's son was alive 

582
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,440
 Let go. Let go! 

583
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,880
 Let go! 

584
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,720
 Mother, Mother! 

585
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,520
Please help, Mother!

586
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,750
- Mother!
- Let go. Grand Prince!

587
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:28,800
- Mother!
- You cannot!

588
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,620
Please save me!

589
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,120
- Grand Prince Gwang Chang!
- Mother!

590
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,860
You cannot! Do not do this! My Gwang Chang...

591
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,070
 Grand Prince, do not die! 

592
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,910
Crown Prince!

593
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,100
Crown Prince!

594
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,970
Please let go.

595
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,230
Could you...

596
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,520
Could you just let the Crown Prince live?

597
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:02,780
It feels like I am losing Grand Prince Gwang Chang again.

598
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,410
So I cannot endure this.

599
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,000
Please at least let him live—

600
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,770
I am sorry.

601
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:22,930
I am sorry, Su Ryeon.

602
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,490
Bring the criminals!

603
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,340
 Yes! 

604
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,890
Prepare to interrogate the criminals!

605
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,830
 Yes! 

606
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:56,860
Please wake up right away,

607
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,890
punish this foolish one,

608
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,610
and save the Crown Prince.

609
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:21,100
Do you admit to having attempted to poison His Majesty?

610
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:29,710
I was outside the palace when Father collapsed.

611
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:35,320
Han Sang Su, eunuch of the Crown Prince's palace, has already confessed

612
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:41,320
that the criminal ordered Han Sang Su to deliver the poisoned yellow corvina to the Queen's palace.

613
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:46,390
And Han Sang Su delivered the said fish to Senior Court Lady Jo.

614
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:52,570
This was cross-confirmed between Senior Court Lady Jo and Eunuch Han Sang Su.

615
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:59,040
 Testimony 
 The testimony I provided in advance has the details.

616
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:07,590
In addition, Her Highness also said the criminal had sent her the yellow corvina.

617
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,600
Is this true?

618
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,380
That is correct.

619
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:17,070
I confirmed it with Her Highness myself.

620
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:20,290
That is not true! This is a false accusation!

621
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:24,360
I swear to heavens, the Crown Prince does not know about this matter!

622
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,450
It is a false accusation!

623
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,200
Once His Majesty wakes up,

624
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,580
he absolutely will not pardon those who participated in this!

625
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,990
What are you all waiting for?

626
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:39,810
Make that bastard shut his mouth right now!

627
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,520
 Yes! 

628
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,960
Your Highness—

629
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,510
Your Highness!

630
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,720
Your Highness.

631
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,560
Your Highness!

632
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:18,380
Do you agree with what that man said?

633
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:32,990
Are you going to claim Her Highness has told a lie or

634
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:41,560
or are you going to admit to having attempted to murder His Majesty?

635
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,940
I will make sure to at least

636
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,400
protect His Majesty's life.

637
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,670
Please answer me.

638
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:17,560
Is it a false accusation or not?

639
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:33,090


640
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,100
Your Majesty, are you awake?

641
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,050
Your Majesty!

642
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:05,720
♫  Because it is like the wind is brushing by  ♫

643
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,720
I was...

644
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:16,480
♫  it hurts like my breath was taken away and the tears flow  ♫

645
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:24,100
♫  I I want to look at and embrace you  ♫

646
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:31,000
♫  I am destroying the longing which comes to me  ♫

647
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:40,440
♫  You are just moving farther away as if you were flying  ♫

648
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,850
♫  I want to hold onto you even if I live only tearfully  ♫

649
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:46,070
 Missing Crown Prince 

650
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:50,140
 Capital Criminal Yi Geon is to be deposed. 

651
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:53,110
 He broke out of prison. The Crown Prince is guilty of high treason. 

652
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,750
 They still have not found him? 

653
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,460
 He will get caught in the end. 

654
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,760
 The royal seal disappeared? 

655
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,440
 The chests containing the royal seal and the national seal disappeared? 

656
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,370
 Were Hyeongnim and your daughter engaged to be married? 

657
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:07,130
 If you want to have my Myeong Yun, become the crown prince. 

658
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,220
 It is him! Get him! 

659
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,050
 I will go back, no matter what. 

660
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:12,030
 Please wait for your son.
