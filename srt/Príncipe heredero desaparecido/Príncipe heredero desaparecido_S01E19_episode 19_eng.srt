 Missing Crown Prince 

9
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,910
 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts. 

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,860
 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines. 

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,640
 You are... 

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,380
 You are surely pregnant. 

13
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,110
 Orabeoni. 

14
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,710
Su Ryeon.

 Episode 19 

16
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,020
Why did you come outside when the air is cold?

17
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,550
Are you watching the moon?

18
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,920
If we get caught while running away like this,

19
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,790
neither you nor I will be able to avoid death.

20
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,190
Why are you saying something we already know?

21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,970
We cannot let our child in your womb die with us.

22
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,450
The child is listening. That is enough.

23
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,300
Even if we manage to escape,

24
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:44,050
this child will have to live in hiding as a fugitive's child forever.

25
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,280
I will not let that happen.

26
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,910
I know.

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,060
His only fault is in meeting the wrong parents.

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,880
It would be too cruel for this child.

29
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,700
What can we do about it, though?

30
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,730
There is nothing we can do for our child.

31
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,290
Let us go back ...

32
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,950
to the palace.

33
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,550
- Orabeoni.
- Let us go back.

34
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,810
We will go back and survive one way or the other.

35
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,130
Orabeoni, please!

36
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,620
I am going to save this child, no matter what.

37
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:37,100
Even if I have to kill everyone, I will save our child.

38
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,030
I will save him, no matter what.

39
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,470
We can go by ourselves from here, so you should leave now.

40
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,770
- Will you be all right? 
 - We are almost there.

41
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,610
We are almost there.

42
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,580
I am worried someone will see us. Hurry and go.

43
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,320
I will escort her safely, so please do not worry.

44
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,140
I will leave it to you, then.

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,670
- I will send word. 
 - Yes.

46
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,310
Yes.

47
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,000
Your Highness.

48
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,090
There.

49
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,130
You should wrap up and leave now.

50
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Your entire body is like fire. Your fever is so high.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,750
I am just tired because I suddenly walked a long distance.

52
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,850
Do you not know the child in the womb is also tired if you are tired?

53
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,810
If you are worried about the child, quickly leave.

54
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,780
If something happens to you at this rate,

55
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,330
what about this child?

56
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,840
All right. It is done.

57
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,220
By the way, regarding the king ...

58
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,680
I am sure he will be watching your move every second of the day.

59
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,120
Is it be possible for you to move about avoiding their eyes?

60
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,390
Do not worry. I have plans.

61
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,320
More than that, I cannot figure out how the king

62
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,890
was able to get up so quickly like that.

63
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,740
Could there be a way to do that without me knowingâ€”

64
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,170
I confirmed the book for sure.

65
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,080
 

66
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,900
Oh my! Just who did this?

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,500
- Myeong Yun! 
 - But when did Myeong Yun do this?

68
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,380
You left the queen dowager's palace for Grand Prince Gwang Chang's cheondojae.

69
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,190
 Cheondojae.  A ceremony to allow the soul of a dead person to pass to the afterlife. 

70
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 Five 

71
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,270
However, we cannot be sure that it was Myeong Yun's doing.

72
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,000
- Someone else could haveâ€”
 - Among those who come here,

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,750
the only one who would recognize and need the contents of this book

74
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,220
is Myeong Yun.

75
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,740
Was it your doing?

76
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,940
Are you ... the one who took that book?

77
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,210
Yes, it was me.

78
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,530
Do you truly not know what you have done?

79
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,670
I only did what I had to do.

80
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,820
Are you saying as my daughter you had to corner your father to death?

81
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,890
I did it because I am your daughter.

82
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:37,540
As your daughter I thought I had to correct your wrongdoing.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,010
Do you resent me that much?

84
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,430
Do you hate me so much that you would join their side

85
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,100
just so you can have me killed?

86
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,390
Yes. I hate you.

87
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,510
I resent and despise you endlessly.

88
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,370
When I think about Mother, the grief and bitterness

89
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,940
make my bones ache.

90
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,470
You are forbidden to go outside from this moment.

91
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,440
Do not set foot outside your room, and behave yourself.

92
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,310
I refuse.

93
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,010
- What did you say?
- I said I refuse.

94
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:28,150
I will go to the palace every day until His Majesty recovers fully.

95
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,720
If you insist on stopping me,

96
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,940
I would rather ... leave this house on my own accord.

97
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,020
Mu Baek, are you there?

98
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,720
Lock up Myeong Yun in her room, and do not let her step a foot outside!

99
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,650
Please let my lady go.

100
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,770
How dare you?

101
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,100
On top of conspiring with Myeong Yun to deceive me,

102
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,450
you will even defy my order now?

103
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,780
You can put me to death if you want.

104
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,220
I will do anything you order me to do

105
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,360
if you will let my lady go.

106
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,430
If you order me to die, I will die with no hesitation.

107
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,260
Please let ...

108
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,860
my lady go.

109
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,990
Go.

110
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,230
From the moment you leave this room,

111
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,850
you are ...

112
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,620
no longer my daughter.

113
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,440
Your Highness!

114
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,950
Your Highness, how did you know I was here?

115
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,640
Did you bring him here?

116
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,200
No ...

117
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,950
We met on the way.

118
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,500
Yes, he said we met on the way.

119
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,030
We must go to the palace quickly.

120
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,770
Did His Majesty's condition worsen?

121
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,900
Did you sleep comfortably last night?

122
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,290
I slept well.

123
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,730
It seems the fever has declined,

124
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,500
but it will rise again if you overexert yourself.

125
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,200
- So, pleaseâ€”
 - I understand. I will be careful.

126
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,940
He still seems to have trouble breathing.

127
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,310
Could you improve his condition with a concoction or acupuncture therapy?

128
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,100
= Is it bothering you a lot? 
 - I am fine.

129
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,050
Can you not tell from looking?

130
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,570
You had a dry cough when I came in the morningâ€”

131
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,230
Didn't you say you had seoyeon*?
  (Tutoring for the crown prince) 

132
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,470
- Yes.
 - Get going quickly.

133
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,640
Yes.

134
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,270
Buyong Pavillion.

135
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,090
Why are you still here?

136
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,450
Yes, I will be right back.

137
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,210
Buyeong Pavillion.

138
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,110
Your Majesty, I regret to tell youâ€”

139
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,290
If you are regretful, do not say it.

140
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,020
I told the head eunuch ...

141
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,810
to prepare a place for you to reside in.

142
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,520
You will have to stay there for a while

143
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,350
and see me in the morning and the evening.

144
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,810
Do you think you can do that?

145
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

146
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,120
What do you mean by that?

147
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,980
I am sorry to tell you,

148
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,560
but there are many Westerners who used to follow Yun Yi Gyeom.

149
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,020
So, they seem to have trouble with the investigations.

150
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,260
I had expected this.

151
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,510
But this might be our last chance to sort out the traitors.

152
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,580
So there must not be any mistakes.

153
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,420
Yes, we will give it all we have.

154
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,480
As you both probably know,

155
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Yun Yi Gyeom will not give up just because he was imprisoned.

156
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,110
If we give them time, we do not know what they will do.

157
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,450
So please make haste.

158
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,870
You are not looking well.

159
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,970
Are you feeling unwell?

160
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,970
Not at all.

161
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,420
I am fine, so do not worry about me.

162
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,720
I am more worried about youâ€”

163
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,610
I am also fine.

164
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,240
You know I have always been a loafer who likes to have a good time.

165
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,770
In any case, why did you want to see me?

166
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,180
He wishes to see you, Grand Prince.

167
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,700
Whom are you talking about?

168
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,070
Your grandfather wants to see you.

169
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,950
I refuse. I do not want to see him.

170
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,550
Grand Prince, he is still your grandfather.

171
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,510
And my grandfather tried to kill Fatherâ€”

172
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,990
Do you not even resent Grandfather, Royal Mother?

173
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,040
I hate him just as much as you do.

174
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,610
Just thinking about it is terrible enough to make my heart tremble and suffocate me.

175
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,490
However, what can I do?

176
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,360
He is my father and your grandfather.

177
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,920
Just once.

178
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,980
Please meet him just once.

179
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,040
He can be exiled any day now.

180
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,620
We might never get to meet him again.

181
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,100
For your mother's sake,

182
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,470
please consider this the last time and meet him just once.

183
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,300
Please?

184
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,070
Grand Prince.

185
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,220
I thought you were confined to your residence.

186
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,530
Is it all right to wander outside so freely?

187
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,620
His Majesty gave me permission.

188
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,850
Are you saying Father told you to come in?

189
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,600
Yes, I was told to come to the palace

190
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,150
to transfer the duty to the new inspector general.

191
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,310
What brings you here, Grand Prince?

192
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,390
Did you come to see your grandfather?

193
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,960
The Southerners will definitely kill your grandfather.

194
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,050
After him,

195
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,950
it will be Her Highness the Queen ...

196
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,570
and you, Grand Prince.

197
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,170
 First day of the month, between 3 a.m. - 5 a.m., Prison break 

198
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,500
W-Who on earth wouldâ€”

199
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,510
Grand Prince, I knew you would come. Your grandfatherâ€”

200
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,380
How could you commit such a terrible act?

201
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,660
- Grand Prince.
 - Even if you were blinded by greed for power,

202
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,370
a human being cannot do such a thing.

203
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,950
Do you not fear the heavens, Grandfather?

204
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,000
How could you attempt to murder Father?

205
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
Please listen to your grandfather firstâ€”

206
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,330
What on earth did you want moreâ€”

207
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,110
That is not it!

208
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,440
These are all false accusations!

209
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,570
Just as the queen dowager, the king also falsely accused me

210
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,970
to get rid of me for the crown prince's sake!

211
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,740
Are you telling me to believe you right now?

212
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,380
Try to come up with a better excuse if you want to deceive me.

213
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,550
I was only doing it for you and the queenâ€”

214
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:20,470
You tried to kill my father for my sake?

215
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,180
You tried to kill Mother's husband for her sake?

216
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,010
Grand Prince, I only considered our familyâ€”

217
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,600
Enough!

218
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,650
Please stop it now.

219
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,020
Mother is in such a dangerous situation because of you.

220
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,350
Yet you still have something left to say?

221
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,300
I came here only because Mother begged me.

222
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,780
This is the last time.

223
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,150
I do not wish to see you ever again.

224
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,730
What do you want ...

225
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,290
this old man to do?

226
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,430
Confess all your sins and beg for forgiveness.

227
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:15,870
That is about all you can do now, Grandfather.

228
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,500
 Buyeong Pavillion { 

229
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,920
Why did the new inspector general summon you?

230
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,820
He was testing me, using the transfer of duty as an excuse.

231
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,420
I guess that his way of wanting to make a contribution.

232
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,880
He is probably watching us even now.

233
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,640
Is it right for us to meet like this, then?

234
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,590
They already know everything anyway.

235
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,540
If they wanted to make it an issue, they would have exposed us already.

236
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,900
- We should still be carefulâ€”
- Are you ... feeling all right?

237
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,400
Is anything bothering you?

238
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,660
I am fine.

239
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,810
More importantly, I heard Myeong Yun entered the bedchambers again today.

240
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,530
What is going on?

241
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,620
Have you still  not spoken to Myeong Yun?

242
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,230
I cut my ties ...

243
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,340
with Myeong Yun as her father.

244
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,950
Orabeoni!

245
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,120
That is why I said you have to clear up the misunderstanding first.

246
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,260
Why on earth are you letting her believe that you killed her mother?

247
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,770
The words have been said already.

248
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,960
Even if I tell her I did not kill her mother now, will she believe me?

249
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,650
So why did you say such a thing?

250
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,480
Do you think Myeong Yun will be at ease once her misunderstanding is cleared?

251
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,400
Do you not think she could suffer more, torn between the crown prince and me?

252
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:53,270
Even so, letting her believe her father killed her mother is too cruel.

253
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:58,700
Don't you understand that this is making her live in hell?

254
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,640
If you will not tell her, I will do it.

255
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,710
No ... she would not believe me, either.

256
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,700
I will ask Master Geo Wu.

257
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,820
Myeong Yun would believe it if Master Geo Wu told her.

258
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,690
Just let her be.

259
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,510
Let's allow Myeong Yun to stay by the crown prince's side.

260
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,740
- Orabeoni.
 - She needs to stay by the crown prince's side.

261
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,630
So that in case our plan goes awry,

262
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,540
Myeong Yun can survive.

263
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,380
Myeong Yun.

264
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,090
You still secretly meet up inside the palace after all that has happened.

265
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,620
I am truly ashamed and embarrassed that we live under the same sky.

266
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,320
Watch what you say.

267
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,710
You are in Her Highness' presence.

268
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,880
To me, she is the lover of my despicable father, who caused my mother's death.

269
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
Did you already forget?

270
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,200
I have cut my ties with you. Why are you calling me your father?

271
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,170
Why are you doing this? Please ...

272
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,470
Let us go now.

273
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,170
Soundlessly ...

274
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,710
What are these flowers for?

275
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,560
Did you pick them up on the way again?

276
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,830
How did you know?

277
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,520
They are beautiful.

278
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,650
There are even more gorgeous spring flowers outside.

279
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,820
Let us go outside.

280
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,070
What if someone sees usâ€”

281
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,900
If someone sees, we can just hide in the midst of flowers.

282
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,710
I cannot tell you apart from the flowers.

283
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,340
Maiden.

284
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,870
Maiden?

285
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,690
Maiden?

286
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,660
When the spring wind blows, the first thing that blossoms

287
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,330
in the palace are plum blossoms,

288
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,520
cherry, apricot, peach blossoms, pear blossoms.

289
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,210
When they bloom one after the other ...

290
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,650
shepherd's purse in Mt. Dumae and elm trees bear fruit.

291
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:56,410
And I would also say, it is the spring wind.

292
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,040
They came because of you.

293
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,900
"It is the spring wind. They came because of me" is the correct line.

294
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,410
You are right.

295
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,000
They came because of you.

296
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:19,420
"Spring Wind." It is such a fitting poem for today's scenery, right?

297
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,880
Yes.

298
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,450
It is the spring wind.

299
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,860
The winter is gone, and the spring is here now.

300
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,880
So, let us worry about the cold winter winds later.

301
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,880
To be honest,

302
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,320
I saw my father and the queen dowager in front of Buyongjeong.

303
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,900
Is that so?

304
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,940
He should be home since he is under confinement, but he came to the palace.

305
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,330
You must let His Majesty know quickly.

306
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,880
I understand. I will tell him when I go to the Main Hall later.

307
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,040
- The preparations?
- They are all complete.

308
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,330
By the way, is this something you must do?

309
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,350
I apologize.

310
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,790
I was worried about what would happen to my lady now.

311
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,960
Please forgive me.

312
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,020
I must succeed for Myeong Yun's sake as well.

313
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,490
If you thought I had to fail for Myeong Yun to be with the crown prince,

314
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,920
you are wrong.

315
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,700
Whether I succeed or fail,

316
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,320
Myeong Yun is already a traitor's child.

317
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,950
Even if the crown prince wants to,

318
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,960
would he be able to take in a traitor's child as the crown princess?

319
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,890
Of course, I do not think the crown prince will kill

320
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,650
Myeong Yun, even if I were to fail.

321
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,670
Yes, her life will be spared. However ...

322
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,700
Even if, by heavens' luck, she avoids becoming enslaved,

323
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,960
she will have to live in hiding all her life.

324
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,060
Do you think Myeong Yun would really want to live like that?

325
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,100
If you understood,

326
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,790
you will have to wish me success, at least for Myeong Yun's sake.

327
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,440
I ordered you to investigate Yun Yi Gyeom and Yun Jeong Dae, who falsely accused the crown prince.

328
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,380
But I still have not received their confession.

329
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:44,410
And why is no one discussing the deaths of Physician Kim Dal Saeng and Physician Heo?

330
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,420
Are you defending Yun Yi Gyeom, Yun Jeong Dae, and Choi Sang Rok

331
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,630
because they are in the same political faction as you?

332
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,520
Who exactly do you serve as king?

333
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,310
Will you listen only after

334
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,490
I dismiss all Westerners and fill up the Royal Court with Southerners?

335
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,160
Bring me their confessions by tomorrow!

336
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,120
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

337
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,240
Father!

338
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,030
Your Majesty!

339
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:33,050
I am fine, so you all can leave.

340
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,720
Your Majesty, you must have a physician take a look first.

341
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,670
Please reconsider your order.

342
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,690
 Please reconsider your order. 

343
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,940
I told you all to leave!

344
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,260
Your Majesty, your pulse is so unstable that I can barely sense it.

345
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,490
You must take absolute restâ€”

346
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,260
You are not saying I will die right now.

347
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,500
- Your Majesty.
 - I understand. I will be careful.

348
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,460
You must not look after the state affairs.

349
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,410
Thanks for the help. You can leave now.

350
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,040
Your Majesty, you must not take that drugâ€”

351
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,020
Is the head eunuch out there?

352
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

353
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,720
I must get some rest.

354
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,600
You can leave.

355
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,620
Is he not doing well at all?

356
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,640
Yes, he must take some rest,

357
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
but he suffers from too much work day after day.

358
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:06,120
I think his condition is bound to worsen.

359
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,720
What should we do, then?

360
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,500
Your Highness ... in factâ€”

361
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,160
Your Highness, this is Gab Seok.

362
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,120
Come in.

363
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,810
I stand before you, Your Highness.

364
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,690
It has been a long time.

365
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,480
The day the queen dowager married the previous king and entered the palace,

366
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,240
your father made the wrong decision.

367
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:15,210
He jumped off a cliff to end his own life.

368
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:20,090
And your mother was the one who saved your father back then.

369
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,500
Following that encounter, they got married

370
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,250
and he learned medicine from his father-in-law,

371
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,860
who was a royal physician, and become a physician himself.

372
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,250
It would have been a great story if it ended there.

373
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,780
Finding out the terrible life of his ex fiancÃ©e, who in the meantime had become the Queen Dowager,

374
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:46,020
was the beginning of all of this.

375
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,460
 Your Highness! 

376
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,190
 Your Highness! You cannot! 

377
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,650
 Su Ryeon! 

378
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,410
 Court Lady Kim! 

379
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,810
 Court Lady Kim! 

380
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,400
When the queen dowager's life was in peril due to the deposed king's continued harassment,

381
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,590
your father brought the queen dowager to your house and hid her.

382
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,950
 Did you say, "queen dowager"? 

383
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,020
 I am sorry for startling you. 

384
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,290
 Not at all. That is not it. 

385
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,760
 You are holding a sword. 

386
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,300
 I will explain the details later. 

387
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,560
 - Just know that andâ€” 

388
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,410
 You! 

389
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:30,280
When your father went to explain the situation to your mother,

390
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,990
the assassins sent by the king had already invaded your house.

391
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,180
 - Let's go.
 - Yes. 

392
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,960
 Wife! 

393
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,000
When your father went back to the room,

394
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,500
the assassins had already killed your mother,

395
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,070
mistaking her for the queen dowager.

396
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,760
 Hurry up and go. You must go and stop them. 

397
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,970
 Do not speak. 

398
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,290
 Let me look at your wound first. 

399
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:42,460
 Since they found out you hid away Her Highness, 

400
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,800
 they will not let us be. They will kill all of us. 

401
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,870
 Our Myeong Yun ... 

402
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:55,590
 To save Myeong Yun, you must stop them. 

403
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:28,480
If he did not stop those assassins, as your mother said,

404
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:35,940
both you and your father would not have made it alive.

405
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:43,350
Your father gave up your mother to save you.

406
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:50,040
He did not kill your mother.

407
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,330
I cannot believe this.

408
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:59,050
When I asked Father if he killed Mother, he clearly said

409
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,030
he is the one who killed her.

410
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,190
He believes he killed her

411
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,960
because she died because of him.

412
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:21,110
That is how he blamed himself all his life.

413
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,880
How pitiful.

414
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,140
Both you are pitiful ...

415
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,700
and your mother is pitiful.

416
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,690
Your father is pitiful, too.

417
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,220
How wicked.

418
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,390
What will he do about this unfortunate fate?

419
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,910
Thank you for coming all the way here.

420
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,950
Yes, Your Highness.

421
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,980
Escort him.

422
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,070
Yes. Please come this way.

423
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:43,520
Is the fate between the crown prince and Maiden Myeong Yun really bad?

424
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,570
Their fate has already been twisted.

425
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,610
A twisted fate?

426
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,750
Are you saying it will not work out well?

427
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:57,170
The crown prince was born to become a great king and

428
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:04,390
Myeong Yun's fate is far from wealth and fame.

429
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,500
Do you understand what I mean?

430
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,590
Your Highness ...

431
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:54,980
There is nothing I can do for you.

432
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,560
So why do you keep giving me more and more?

433
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,170
I did not give you anything.

434
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,370
Don't you even resent my father?

435
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,070
If I were you, I would have resented and hated him to death.

436
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,260
Why did you even bring in Master Geo Wu

437
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,020
to clear up my misunderstanding about my father?

438
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,090
Would you like to have a drink?

439
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,150
Let us drink.

440
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,810
I have developed an addiction these days.

441
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:12,540
An addiction to you.

442
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,820
It is an oddity.

443
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:23,490
They say if you do not read a book for a day, you get sores in your mouth.

444
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:28,760
I get sores in my mouth if I do not get to

445
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,050
see you smile, even for a day.

446
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,140
Did you smear honey on your tongue?

447
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,510
Your lips are where honey was spread, right?

448
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,680
They were so sweet.

449
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,250
Someone will hear.

450
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,600
You are ...

451
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,930
my addiction.

452
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:17,510
â™«  The day we loved, the day we hurt,  â™«

453
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:24,420
â™«  Even the day we sometimes exchanged harsh words,  â™«

454
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:33,080
â™«  The day that became cloudy in the fog  â™«

455
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,820
â™«  caress my heart like a spring breeze  â™«

456
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:42,740
 Not that. I am asking what this shape looks like. 

457
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,740
 They look like flower petals. 

458
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,630
 You are right. They are apricot flower petals. 

459
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,440
 The apricot flowers you like, Maiden. 

460
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:56,170
â™«  and take a deep breath  â™«

461
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:04,620
â™«  Suddenly thinking of you  â™«

462
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,300
â™«  your breath makes me relax  â™«

463
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:13,640
â™«  so that I can fly anywhere  â™«

464
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:19,940
â™«  nto my frozen heart  â™«

465
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:25,260
â™«  breathe life with your breath and mine/i&gt; â™« 

466
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,080
 My Lady! 

467
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,600
 Why are you so surprised? 

468
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,220
 I am not surprised. 

469
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,100
 Because you were so threatening, I thought you looked like a goblin. 

470
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,100
 - But you are prettier than I expected.
- Pardon? 

471
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:49,790
 You might be a physician, but I am not just a patient. 

472
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,470
 I am "Dear Husband." 

473
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,980
 Still, you never know how things will turn out in life. 

474
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,790
 I heard you are bound to meet the person you need to meet. 

475
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:09,240
 Just like fate, we might meet again after a long way around, right? 

476
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:17,670
 You are the first woman I have feelings for the first time in my life. 

477
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,380
 So, I would like you to also remember me 

478
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,440
 not as the crown prince, 

479
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,100
 but as a man who once had feelings for you. 

480
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:39,570
â™«  transform into spring rain, gently patting my back  â™«

481
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:45,180
 "Until all these flower petals fall and become a mountain... 

482
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,370
 I will remember you for eternity." 

483
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:54,720
â™«  I  take a deep breath  â™«

484
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,880
â™«  Suddenly thinking of you  â™«

485
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,890
 You and the crown prince cannot be together. 

486
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:07,240
 I know what kind of a person you are. 

487
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,470
 And I know how hard you worked for my sake, 

488
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,680
 so I am thankful. 

489
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:21,050
 Also, I sincerely want to grant you anything you wish for. 

490
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,880
 Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty. 

491
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,740
 However, I cannot allow your relationship with the crown prince. 

492
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:36,360
 It is not solely because of your father. 

493
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:41,610
 Right now, the crown prince needs a trustworthy and reliable 

494
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:46,100
 wife who could give him power. 

495
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,890
 Do you understand what I mean? 

496
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,910
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

497
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,700
 I will leave the moment you recover completely, Your Majesty. 

498
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,810
 Do you not resent me for saying these things? 

499
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,930
 Not at all, Your Majesty. 

500
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:16,810
 You are showing endless mercy to a criminal who deserves to die. 

501
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,740
 I am thankful for your grace. 

502
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:27,460
 The heavens are so cruel. 

503
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:35,250
 Why was a girl like you born as Choi Sang Rok's daughter? 

504
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:56,440
I believe our positions got switched since last time.

505
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,880
Back then, you asked me to die for everyone's sake.

506
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,080
I am sure you remember.

507
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:12,400
At least for Do Seong, whom you cherish so much,

508
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,700
please confess all your sins and accept the consequences.

509
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,350
If I become a traitor,

510
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,730
do you not know that both Grand Prince Do Seong and Her Highness the Queen

511
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,580
will be in danger as well?

512
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:46,140
Even if I were a Southerner, the Southerners would not just let the two survive.

513
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,850
If you truly care for Grand Prince Do Seong,

514
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:56,250
Your Highness needs to take charge and let me go free!

515
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,720
Do you truly plan to turn me into a tyrant like the deposed king

516
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,670
who kicked out his mother and killed his brother?

517
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:13,240
To me, Father and this country, Joseon,

518
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,190
are more important than Her Highness and Do Seong!

519
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:24,470
I will see you again at the interrogation grounds.

520
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:35,900
He could not have meant what he said, could he?

521
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:21,450
Inspector Generalâ€”

522
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:33,450
Are you the one who saved us?

523
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,360
That is right.

524
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,950
Why?

525
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:44,170
Your enemy's enemy is your friend, right?

526
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,990
- What is this?
 - It is poison.

527
00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:00,350
- What did you say?
 - If you have betrayed once, you may betray twice.

528
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,480
Help yourselves.

529
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,610
How dare you!

530
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,980
Why did you take us out if you were going to do this?

531
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,380
If you agree to a rebellion,

532
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,040
I will give you the antidote.

533
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,980
A-A rebellion, you say?

534
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,680
Why are you so shocked?

535
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:26,190
Is there any way for Your Excellencies and me to survive besides a rebellion?

536
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:29,850
It is a path I have already travelled once.

537
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,480
Do you think I could not go down that path a second time?

538
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,910
And the next king is?

539
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,120
Of course,

540
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:49,330
it will be Grand Prince Do Seong.

541
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:26,960
Tell me what you want now.

542
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:38,190
I need the Westerners' ...

543
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,930
cooperation.

544
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:46,020
There are still those who collude with the criminals in the palace!

545
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:49,050
Am I wrong? Inspector General, answer me!

546
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:53,380
I regret having to tell you, but they are in here now and interfere

547
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,830
with the investigations on the criminals with every chance they get!

548
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:59,340
Please punish the Westerners, Your Majesty!

549
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,880
That is not true, Your Majesty.

550
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,660
The ones in charge of the criminals were Southerners.

551
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:08,380
Please punish the Southerners for failing to guard them, Your Majesty!

552
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,870
Enough!

553
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,940
You officials are still preoccupied with factional strife

554
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,880
when the situation has worsened to this degree!

555
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,960
It is truly lamentableâ€”

556
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,740
Your Majesty!

557
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,440
- Your Majesty. Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

558
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,900
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

559
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,580
Bring Maiden Myeong Yun right now.

560
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,930
Maiden Myeong Yun has left the palace

561
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:55,670
as soon as the gates opened, saying she needed to go home.

562
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,000
Father.

563
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,370
My Lady.

564
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:34,560
 You will now have to  do the work ...

565
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:44,310
I've been trying to do myself, Crown Prince.

566
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:53,900
Are you ... prepared to take it on?

567
00:57:56,350 --> 00:58:00,180
Yes, Father.

568
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,790
I have ...

569
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,070
faith in you, Son.

570
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,010
I will dedicate my body and soul.

571
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:20,540
Bring the queen ...

572
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,240
and the court officials.

573
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,410
Stand me up.

574
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:53,570
Crown Prince, come closer.

575
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,310
 A father's transfer of crown to his son has always been 

576
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,520
 the proudest thing to do, historically. 

577
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:13,780
 I have fallen ill and can no longer govern the state affairs. 

578
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:19,050
 Thinking of the state affairs, my mind is further troubled. 

579
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:21,410
 So, I will leave the state affairs to the crown prince 

580
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:25,770
 and live in peace to treat my illness. 

581
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:31,690
 Crown Prince Geon is wise and virtuous as a sage. 

582
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:35,220
 He is worthy of the crown. 

583
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:39,920
 He is given the royal seal and made the king. 

584
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,900
 All officials of all levels are to accept my sincere request 

585
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,540
 to cooperate and unite as one 

586
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:34,070
 and welcome the rise of the new sun with joy. 

587
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:59,390
I am sorry.

588
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:01,500
Why are you saying such a thing?

589
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:09,050
Since I stepped down, the Southerners ...

590
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:18,800
will not leave you and Do Seong alone now.

591
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,520
I am sorry that I cannot ...

592
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,880
protect you.

593
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:37,090
 All hail His Majesty. 

594
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:32,210
He says to raise your head.

595
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:39,720
We stand in your presence, Your Majesty!

596
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,100
 We stand in your presence, Your Majesty! 

597
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,150
Father is to be respectfully called the Grand King.

598
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:53,250
His Majesty the Grand King will move to Onyang Palace for convalescence.

599
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,680
So, you all are to make the needed preparations with diligence!

600
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,460
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

601
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,070
How shall we refer to Her Highness the Queen?

602
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:09,940
The queen has committed... a grave crime of murdering the food taster

603
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:13,600
who attempted to murder His Majesty the Grand King.

604
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,790
So according to royal family custom,

605
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:21,520
the Queen from the Yun clan will be deposed and confined in a residence outside the palace.

606
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,960
Grand Prince Do Seong will also be made a commoner

607
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,570
and be expelled from the capital without any title!

 What are you all doing? Protect Her Highness! 

614
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,350
 Her Highness the Queen Dowager was murdered tonight. 

615
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:30,340
 Is this why you took the throne? 

616
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,680
 To get rid of your mother, brother, and everyone else? 

617
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,850
 You should be thankful that you were not ordered to die by poison! 

618
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:37,900
 Just order death by poison instead! 

619
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,490
 If I am to become the king, I would need to lead a rebellion, right? 

620
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:45,000
 I will take down Hyeong-nim, not Father. 

621
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,200
 I will become the king.
