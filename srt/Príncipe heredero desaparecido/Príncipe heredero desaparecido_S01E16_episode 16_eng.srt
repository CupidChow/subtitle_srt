 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts.

 Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines.

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,490
Royal Father.

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,040
Can you see me?

13
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,110
Royal Father.

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,300
I am Geon.

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,240
Can you recognize me?

16
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,170
Royal Father.

17
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,870
He looked at me.

18
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,730
He recognized me for sure.

19
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,770
Yes, Your Highness.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,580
Your Highness!

21
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,510
 Come inside. 

22
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,340
Royal Father has opened his eyes.

23
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,080
Royal Father, can you hear what I am saying?

24
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,490
It might take some time, so please wait a bit.

25
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,860
Yes.

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,110
He opened his eyes, but his consciousness has yet toâ€”

27
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,720
His consciousness came back, too.

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,700
He recognized me for sure.

29
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,510
Royal Father, I am Geon.

30
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,970
Can you recognize me?

31
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,710
Can you see me?

32
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,950
If you can see me,

33
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,870
please blink your eyes one more time.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
Did you see that?

35
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,590
Father blinked his eyes.

36
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,690
He recognized me.

37
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,800
Yes, I am sure he recognized Your Highness.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,470
Yes, I-I saw it, too.

39
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,590
Please stay strong.

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,280
You cannot give up, Father.

41
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,950
He opened his eyes, but he went back to sleep?

42
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,710
 Episode 16  
 What do you mean by that?

43
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,430
Are you saying he might not wake up again?

44
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,160
- Hey! 
 - What? Sir?

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,870
Do you not know disasters come from the mouth?

46
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,970
How dare you run your mouth like that?

47
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,400
Do you want to be muzzled like him, too?

48
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,850
Oh, Royal Officer Lee.

49
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,710
Where is His Highness?

50
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,120
I apologize.

51
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,140
They found the Sabaltongmun. 
  (A letter with the name of the person involved written in a round bowl shape to hide the mastermind) 

52
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,750
We could not find a way to save Teacher.

53
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,010
He must have created the Sabaltongmun to prevent anyone from changing their minds.

54
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,690
But we do not know what to do.

55
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,640
Do not be too worried.

56
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,210
I think I found a way to save Royal Father.

57
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,860
Do you mean it?

58
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,060
I apologize.

59
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,370
I could not help myself.

60
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,260
It is fine.

61
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,180
He will soon wake up.

62
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,930
So, do your best to delay the executions until then.

63
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,210
Yes, I will do everything I can.

64
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:41,880
By the way, I do not understand how they were able to lay a trap, Your Highness.

65
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,890
Is there anything you know?

66
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,160
Did you come to criticize me?

67
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,250
Just go ahead and ask me whether it was my doing.

68
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,780
- Was it? 
 - Yes. It was.

69
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,060
I told them to prepare because you would mobilize...

70
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,430
the military in a pinch.

71
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,560
Do not look at me like that.

72
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,550
As much as you cherish your grandfather,

73
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,340
I cherish my mother.

74
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,980
Father has shown some progress in recovery.

75
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,230
Could you be saying he woke up?

76
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,700
Though it was for a moment, he recognized me.

77
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,440
What is going on?

78
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,190
Why the acupuncture therapy, suddenly? What happened?

79
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,390
His pulse sped up suddenly, and his complexion looked worse.

80
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,370
He took the same medicine, so how could this be?

81
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,820
It had an effect for sure.

82
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,030
He could not speak, but he recognized me and even replied by blinking his eyes.

83
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,080
It is true.

84
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,700
Let me ask you this.

85
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,610
Are you certain Royal Father will be able to recover?

86
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,050
I am certain.

87
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,140
Royal Father will wake up for sure.

88
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,610
Brother, when have you ever said that you did not believe Royal Father would not wake up?

89
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,060
If there is even the slightest hope,

90
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,610
one must not give up.

91
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,690
If you give up on Father so easily...

92
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,310
I am not trying to give up.

93
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,710
I am trying to protect Mother.

94
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,160
I cannot let Mother sacrifice herself again.

95
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,450
Are you saying it is fine to sacrifice my grandfather and Seon Ok, then?

96
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,200
No matter what you say, I will not change my mind.

97
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,390
I will not risk my family's safety on something that might not even succeed.

98
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,150
Do you remember what I asked you on the day

99
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,900
you helped me escape the prison cells?

100
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,650
 Will you not regret this? 

101
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,150
 Brother, you really like to be technical. 

102
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,900
 Yes, I might end up regretting this. 

103
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,530
 However, I will do my best to protect my family. 

104
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,490
 I have more questions, but... 

105
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,560
 I will ask them on the day I return. 

106
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
Let me ask you now.

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,080
Am I included in the family that you mentioned?

108
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,980
Why are you not answering?

109
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,630
Am I not your family?

110
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,900
You were the one...

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,200
- who did not consider me family, Brother. 
 - Don't be absurd!

112
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,280
I have never once thought that way.

113
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,480
How can you grow feelings...

114
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,650
for the woman your younger brother was going to marry, then?

115
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,570
I asked your father to hurry up and set the date for our wedding, just so you know.

116
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,560
I have something I must tell you.

117
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,690
I cannot marry you, Grand Prince.

118
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,170
I already harbor feelings for the crown prince.

119
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,040
Brother said he will never forgive your father.

120
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,340
Do you think you can marry someone like him?

121
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,050
I never even dreamed of marrying him.

122
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,910
I never intended to force you to marry me, either.

123
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,720
However, even if you are to resent me for life,

124
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,330
I am going to marry you and protect you, Maiden.

125
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,020
I do not want that.

126
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,110
I am going to protect myself.

127
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,490
Can you protect...

128
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:54,020
your father, my father, and mother as well, Maiden?

129
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,760
The only way to protect all of them is for us to get married.

130
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,130
Do Seong is acting that way because he is struggling.

131
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,790
So, please be understanding.

132
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,840
You should be understanding as well.

133
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,320
He needs to have some sense beaten into him.

134
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,390
But I spoiled him too much these days, which is why he is acting up like that.

135
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:11,650
In my opinion, if you have a fight with Grand Prince, you will be the one to lose.

136
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,460
Did you let him off easy because you are afraid to get beaten up?

137
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,830
How did you know?

138
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,850
I will look after Father now. Go and get some sleep.

139
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,420
I am all right, so you can go and get some rest.

140
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,880
I am...

141
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,160
resting when I am next to you and Royal Father.

142
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,470
I am also resting when I am next to Your Highness.

143
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
 I cannot put your life in danger, too. 

144
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,360
 If you insist on opposing, I will do it alone if I have to. 

145
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,770
 - Maiden! 
 - Until I find the right antidote for His Majesty, 

146
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,650
 I will never give up. 

147
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,420
 What is the matter? 

148
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,140
 Do you think I cannot do it? 

149
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,380
 You win. 

150
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:44,010
 Instead, do not even dream of running away from me until you die. 

151
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,180
 Why would I run away? 

152
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,290
 If His Majesty recovers later, he will reward me greatly. 

153
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,630
 What do you want as a reward? 

154
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:03,370
 I plan to request permission for women to become physicians, too. 

155
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,560
 The first female physician of Joseon, huh? 

156
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,450
 In addition, I also need a house where I can start a clinic. 

157
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,570
 All right. I will have that done. 

158
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,890
 I will also reward you with a signboard. 

159
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,340
 How does "Baek Gu Clinic" sound? 

160
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,620
 "Hwang Gu Clinic" sounds better, does it not? 

161
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,320
 Your Highness! 

162
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,870
- What is the matter? 
 - The queen dowager will personally do interrogations right after the morning assembly.

163
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,060
Enough!

164
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,440
You can still be spared if you confess who is behind you.

165
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,330
Confess whom you were trying to make the king now!

166
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,160
We are not traitors.

167
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,740
We only attempted to protect His Majesty

168
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,770
and expel disloyal subjects like yourself!

169
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,900
Brand the traitors until they open their mouths!

170
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,720
 Yes! 

171
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,950
As the late King Yeong Jo said,

172
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,610
there has always been a rule on when to apply which punishment.

173
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,510
Even if you were to get confessions by illegal means,

174
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,980
the judgment will be discredited in the end.

175
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,680
He ordered the removal of the types of torture like branding and crushing with rocks permanently!

176
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,630
Nonetheless, how can you order branding?

177
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,300
Furthermore,

178
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,090
he limited tortures to once a day during interrogations.

179
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,030
For the more serious crimes, he limited them to twice a day.

180
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,590
It was to prevent lives from being taken.

181
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,850
Additionally, the late King Jeong Jo ordered the delay of punishments

182
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,310
on those who confessed and those who were in critical conditions

183
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,740
during interrogations!

184
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,870
Please reconsider accordingly!

185
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,010
I deem Grand Prince Su Seong's words to be truly appropriate!

186
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,520
Please reconsider accordingly!

187
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,250
Please reconsider accordingly!

188
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,010
Continue the punishments.

189
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,790
 Yes! 

190
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,130
Your Highness,

191
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,560
they are not traitors!

192
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,960
It is the deposed king!

193
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,830
Our lord is the deposed king!

194
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:08,830
We attempted to reinstate the deposed king!

195
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,610
Do Seong.

196
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,070
See me for a moment.

197
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,990
Please save... my grandfather.

198
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:56,100
You know very well that my grandfather is innocent.

199
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,130
Father will wake up soon.

200
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,390
Just until then,

201
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,940
could you at least delay the final execution of their punishments?

202
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,700
For my sake.

203
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,550
Not for my grandfather, but for your brother.

204
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,820
Please help me just once.

205
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,630
Do Seong!

206
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,080
 Crown Prince's Quarters 

207
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,270
Your Highness.

208
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,420
How did it go?

209
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,360
Maiden Myeong Yun went to get medicinal ingredients with the head eunuch.

210
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,730
He probably wants to be alone.

211
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,090
Father.

212
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,330
What am I supposed to do now?

213
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,490
 Father. 

214
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,540
Father!

215
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,870
 Father. 

216
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,270
 Father. 

217
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,200
 Father! 

218
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,380
Father.

219
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,420
I must take a trip outside.

220
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,750
I will escort you.

221
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,360
It is fine. You can go and stay at the crown prince's palace.

222
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,640
Please look after Maiden Myeong Yun.

223
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,350
Yes, please do not worry and go ahead.

224
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,520
There is a place I must visit.

225
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,310
You cannot leave the bedchambers, Maiden.

226
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,260
It will not take long.

227
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,580
You cannot. I do not know what it is,

228
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,720
but please wait for His Highness to return and ask for his permission.

229
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,820
It is to save His Highness' grandfather.

230
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,590
I must meet Grandfather. Please move aside.

231
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,040
If Your Highness were to meet the Teacher right now,

232
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,920
do you not know you are doing as they wish?

233
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,230
To prevent you from becoming the one who ordered a revolt,

234
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,320
the Teacher even falsely confessed that he attempted to reinstate the deposed king

235
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,450
and became a high treason criminal.

236
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,090
Do you truly not know the Teacher's intention when he went that far?

237
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,650
I know! However...

238
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,070
I will never allow Grandfather to be hurt because of me.

239
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,460
I will meet Grandfather and

240
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,700
ask him to withdraw his false confession.

241
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,530
I will not let the Teacher's sacrifice go wasted.

242
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,080
If you must go, please strike us down first!

243
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,100
 Even if he is sentenced to exile, 

244
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,150
he will eventually die in exile due to his old age.

245
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,500
Is there a need to order him to die by poison?

246
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,860
I am not doing this because I want to save Munhyeong.

247
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,700
I do not wish for you to get blood on your hands again, Orabeoni.

248
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,690
How could I not know your intention?

249
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:29,130
However, Yun Yi Gyeom will not obediently back down this time.

250
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,030
 Your Highness, Maiden Myeong Yun wishes to see you. 

251
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,520
How did you come into the palace?

252
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,660
I came in using the pass Her Highness gave me.

253
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,010
Do you not know that pass is not to be used carelessly?

254
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,830
Have a seat.

255
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,490
Court Lady Kim, please prepare some snacks.

256
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,850
Yes, Your Highness.

257
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,520
Oh, yes. Tell them to prepare the five-flavor fruit tea as well.

258
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,170
Yes.

259
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,700
They offered five-flavored fruit tea from Mungyeong, and it was delicious.

260
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,780
They said it is good for health, too. So take some with you when you leave.

261
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,740
I have something to tell you.

262
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,580
Oh, sure. You may go ahead and tell me.

263
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,570
Please save His Excellency Munhyeong.

264
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,220
How did you hear about His Excellency Munhyeong when you were at the temple?

265
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,420
I went to the marketplace to buy a new brush

266
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,720
and I heard the rumors going around.

267
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,400
- So, you came running? 
 - Yes.

268
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,050
You should not meddle in this matter.

269
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,340
Go home right now.

270
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,780
Myeong Yun must have had her reasons when she came.

271
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,750
Let us hear her out first.

272
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,890
I will marry Grand Prince Do Seong.

273
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,660
What is it you want?

274
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,770
I already told you.

275
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,590
Please save His Excellency Munhyeong.

276
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,190
Why do you care about His Excellency Munhyeong?

277
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,010
Did Grand Prince Su Seong order you to do this?

278
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,020
The crown prince does not know about this.

279
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:40,100
Grand Prince Su Seong would not have sent Myeong Yun to do this.

280
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,490
Why are you asking her to save Munhyeong, then?

281
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,950
It does not concern you whether that man dies or notâ€”

282
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,020
I wish to stop your evil deeds, Father.

283
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,340
Please stop the killing.

284
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,780
Please stop sinning.

285
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,710
That is all I want from you, Father.

286
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,700
Please go outside and wait for a moment.

287
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,320
She can say those things because she is your child.

288
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,220
She is not criticizing you.

289
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,540
They are concerns stemming from filial piety.

290
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,520
She said she would marry Grand Prince Do Seong if we let Munhyeong live.

291
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,440
Is it not for the better?

292
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,110
That may be the case for us.

293
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,190
But would Yun Yi Gyeom accept it?

294
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,520
We will have to convince him somehow.

295
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,990
If Myeong Yun marries Grand Prince Do Seong,

296
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,570
we can also take a deep breath. Right?

297
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,910
We will do as you wish.

298
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:18,010
However, you will have to keep your promise and marry Grand Prince Do Seong.

299
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,730
And you will have to let His Excellency Munhyeong live

300
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:25,410
without fail if you want to become the king's father-in-law.

301
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,180
I will spend a few more days at the temple.

302
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,170
I will go home after I am done, so until thenâ€”

303
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,500
I understand.

304
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Instead, I will inform Grand Prince Do Seong in advance, so keep that in mind.

305
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,280
I am telling you to end it by exiling him to Jeju or someplace.

306
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,630
So why are you not saying anything?

307
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,320
Munhyeong is a high-treason criminal who got caught

308
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,190
while plotting a rebellion to reinstate the deposed king!

309
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,440
Are you insisting on killing him, then?

310
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,440
If you insist on killing His Excellency Munhyeong,

311
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,790
I will take it as you will also kill Brother...

312
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,440
and bring on about a sword dance myself.

313
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,040
If you still do not care, you can kill him as you wish.

314
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:37,370
 Please pardon, Jang Hyeon Mok! 

315
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,590
 Please pardon Jang Hyeon Mok! 

316
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,240
Though Jang Hyeon Mok is a criminal,

317
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,100
he has also contributed to this nation greatly.

318
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:54,590
I deem it right to at least save his life and exile him to the border regions.

319
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,760
What is your opinion, Left State Councillor?

320
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,510
I also think the Inspector General's opinion is right.

321
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,270
Please reconsider accordingly.

322
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,540
 Please reconsider accordingly! 

323
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,260
Dismiss the criminals from their positions.

324
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,420
Exile them separately to Jeju, Geojae, Jindo, and so on.

325
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,030
So that they cannot live among each other; and fence their houses with thorns.

326
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,960
 Yes, Your Highness! 

327
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,480
Thank you.

328
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,580
My wedding date with Maiden Myeong Yun will be set this month.

329
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,380
You cannot. My resolve was further solidified by what happened.

330
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,780
I will punish Choi Sang Rok and the queen dowager without fail.

331
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,500
That means your marriage with Maiden Myeong Yun will be called off.

332
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,200
If you got married, in the end, you and she would both become miserable.

333
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,290
Do you think I will let that happen?

334
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,140
Do as you wish, Brother.

335
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,620
I will also do what I must do.

336
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:19,140
Does that include deciding on a marriage on your own?

337
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,140
Maiden Myeong Yun already agreed as well.

338
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,120
Didn't you know?

339
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,760
How did it go?

340
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,860
Fortunately, he avoided death by poison.

341
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,620
It was decided he would be exiled to Jeju.

342
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,130
That is so fortunate.

343
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:03,210
By the way, did you say you would marry Do Seong?

344
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,990
Could it be that you are jealous?

345
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,900
J-Jealous?

346
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,490
That is not it. I only asked because

347
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,750
I was told you agreed to marry him suddenly.

348
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,380
I did it to buy time until His Majesty woke up.

349
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,600
I guess it worked.

350
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,040
You put the marriage as a condition?

351
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,310
We have to save your grandfather first.

352
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,520
As long as His Majesty wakes up before your grandfather is sent to Jeju...

353
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,930
Your Majesty!

354
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,320
His Majesty opened his eyes again.

355
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,710
Father, can you see me?

356
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,320
Can you recognize me?

357
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,420
 Your Highness, this is the chief royal guard! 

358
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,280
Come in!

359
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,380
Royal Father woke up again.

360
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,430
Your Highness, the inspector general is on his way.

361
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,470
Why is the inspector general coming here suddenly?

362
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:40,020
We stopped the royal clinic's visits after His Majesty opened his eyes.

363
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,720
It looks like the inspector general got the report, though I gave excuses to avoid suspicion.

364
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,000
That means he is coming here out of suspicion. What should we do?

365
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,440
The head eunuch quickly called in the Main Hall's palace maids and eunuchs.

366
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,020
Royal Father, we cannot have them find out about your condition yet.

367
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,110
So, you must pretend to be unconscious, though it may be difficult.

368
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,690
The inspector general has arrived in front of the Main Hall.

369
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,640
We must hurry and put the device on first.

370
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,170
My father will realize His Majesty is recovering just by checking his pulse.

371
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:25,310
Is there a way to slow down the pulse with acupuncture therapy?

372
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,850
I will announce your arrival.

373
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,170
Please wait for a moment.

374
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,300
Is... someone inside?

375
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,470
His Majesty is inside, of course.

376
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,960
You can announce him.

377
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,610
Your Majesty!

378
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:11,150
 The inspector general has arrived! 

379
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,220
His pulse weakened a bit.

380
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,730
But it is not bad enough to cause concerns.

381
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,140
However, you will have to let the royal clinic make visits

382
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,840
in case he is in a critical condition again.

383
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,830
I understand.

384
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:55,360
He left. Please come out.

385
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,140
Royal Father, you can open your eyes now.

386
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,380
Father.

387
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:36,170
He seems to have fallen asleep again because my treatment was a bit strong.

388
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,460
I apologize.

389
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,940
It is all right. It is enough that we did not get found out.

390
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:50,000
It seems Royal Father fell asleep while pretending

391
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,100
to be sleeping in order not to get found out.

392
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,260
Please force yourself to sleep even if you don't want to.

393
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,040
You have not slept a moment for days now.

394
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,110
I will go and stand guard at the Main Hall.

395
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,560
Are you out of your mind?

396
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,920
How can you leave Oh Wol alone and come here?

397
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,370
Your Highness, His Excellency Munhyeong is being sent to exile right now.

398
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,340
Your Highness.

399
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,330
Stand back!

400
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,370
Stand back!

401
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,170
You treacherous scoundrel!

402
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,700
Let us kill this traitor!

403
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,290
Yes!

404
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,320
If we let the traitor live, there will be another rebellion

405
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,730
and the world will be in chaos!

406
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,820
Kill the traitor!

407
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,580
There will be a rebellion, and the world will be in chaos!

408
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,980
- Kill the traitor! 
  - Kill him! 

409
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,570
 Kill him! 

410
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,300
Y-You cannot.

411
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,900
Let go!

412
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,210
- You cannot, Your Highnessâ€” 
 - Let go!

413
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,040
Your Highness!

414
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,130
Grandfather.

415
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,550
What are the guards doing?

416
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,260
Stop them right now!

417
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,260
Stop them! Stop them right now!

418
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,120
Grandfather!

419
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,300
Grandfather, this is your grandson, Geon.

420
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,980
Please open your eyes!

421
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,920
Open up the cage right now. Hurry!

422
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,500
Yes!

423
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,890
Grandfather.

424
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,990
Grandfather!

425
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,200
Grandfather!

426
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:45,080
 There was an unfortunate incident where the criminal died while being transferred. 

427
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,310
Mayor of Hanyang, you must search out the culprit.

428
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,030
I will do all I can.

429
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,220
Heed my words.

430
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,480
 Yes, Your Highness the Queen Dowager! 

431
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,460
The king's health is still in critical condition.

432
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,680
But unsavory incidents are happening inside and out of the palace.

433
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,330
The royal family and the nation's future is in peril.

434
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,750
As such, I plan to install our nation's heir

435
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,490
to solidify the royal family and the nation.

436
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:28,940
Grand Prince Su Seong and Grand Prince Do Seong are the only descendants of the king.

437
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,030
After careful consideration,

438
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:35,030
I decided that Grand Prince Do Seong is more fit to be the nation's heir

439
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,780
than Grand Prince Su Seong, who is involved in a sordid matter.

440
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,970
I shall invest Grand Prince Do Seong as the crown prince on an auspicious day.

441
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:53,910
Hence, the queen's confinement will end...

442
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,890
and Grand Prince Su Seong...

443
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,180
will leave the palace.

444
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:32,370
Your Highness, how troubled you must have been.

445
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:35,210
Once the grand prince gets invested as the crown prince,

446
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,280
Your Majesty's future will only be greatly honorable.

447
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,820
Please protect the queen's palace firmly.

448
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,370
Please stay strong.

449
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,960
Such farewells are for people who will never meet again.

450
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,030
Once Father wakes up, I am going to look for you first.

451
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,710
So, we will be able to meet again soon.

452
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:16,520
â™«  How much longer must I live until I can forget?  â™«

453
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:23,090
â™«  Will you be there after all the time passes?  â™«

454
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,700
Please send word when you arrive safely.

455
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,220
â™«  I am looking only at you with a blank stare 

456
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,770
â™«  Like the moonlight there  â™«

457
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:44,780
â™«  which waxes before you know it, don't leave  â™«

458
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:52,100
â™«  Because it feels like the wind is brushing by  â™«

459
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:59,540
â™«  it hurts like my breath was taken away and the tears flow  â™«

460
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,570
â™«  I want to look at and embrace you  â™«

461
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,340
â™«  I want to look at you  â™«

462
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:14,160
â™«  Destroy the longing coming to me  â™«

463
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,730
Ajae Mu Baek!

464
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,500
Many are watching us. Let us hurry on.

465
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,420
I did consider what you and Brother said, although it's highly unlikely,

466
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,230
the eventuality that Father might indeed wake up.

467
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:00,360
So, I did not tell anyone you were inside the palace and kept it to myself.

468
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,420
You said you will do your best

469
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,280
and give up if it does not work, and that is why I waited.

470
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,780
But you failed in the end.

471
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,330
Please do as I say from now on.

472
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:15,930
I did not fail. I just need more time.

473
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:17,920
I have not given up yet.

474
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,320
Do you still not get it?

475
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,960
Do you think they will leave Brother in peace?

476
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,640
If you do not give up,

477
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,940
Brother will ultimately die.

478
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:38,020
If you think so dearly of your brother, quit obsessing over me first.

479
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:43,050
Though the crown prince and I cannot be together in this life,

480
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:46,180
I am more or less his woman already.

481
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:51,120
Brother is the one who needs to quit obsessing over you, not me.

482
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,320
I am the one who loved you first

483
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,140
and the one who almost married you...

484
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,120
not my brother.

485
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,340
Are you saying it does not matter whom I love?

486
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,740
If that was the case,

487
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,030
would I be hurting so much?

488
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:20,100
Because that person had to be my brother,

489
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:23,510
it pains me even more.

490
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:35,390
However, regardless of how much it hurts, I will marry you

491
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:39,730
and will protect you even if I have to die.

492
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,210
I will see you on the wedding day.

493
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,270
Father, I am...

494
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,920
now leaving the palace.

495
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,160
Please take your medicines...

496
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:24,430
and I will surely... see you again soon.

497
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:30,250
Until then, please stay strong.

498
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:46,090
W-What brings you here?

499
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:00,390
 Is that everything the inspector general ordered you to do? 

500
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:02,380
 I sent the goods from Senior Court Lady Kim 

501
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:07,540
 to the families of a palace maid named Jong Geum and Physician Heo. 

502
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,110
W-Why are you looking at me like that?

503
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,030
It is nothing.

504
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:19,860
I came to bid my farewell, so announce my arrival.

505
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,520
I used the farewell as an excuse because I had a question I wanted to ask.

506
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,100
Please go ahead.

507
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,790
Who was the one who instigated...

508
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,430
my grandfather's death?

509
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:44,000
I already know it was not your doing, Your Highness.

510
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,460
Was it the inspector general

511
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,620
or was it the left state councillor?

512
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,080
I already know you sent goods to the families

513
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,870
of Jong Geum and Physician Heo, who are dead.

514
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:05,550
I am sure you probably did the same for the others who were sacrificed because of Your Highness.

515
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:10,080
I also know you are not after power, Your Highness.

516
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,320
You probably wish to live at the temporary palace being built in Anju

517
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,060
and look after Grand Prince Gwang Chang's grave, once Do Seong takes the throne.

518
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,220
You are trying to wed Maiden Myeong Yun to Do Seong

519
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:25,330
as a means to keep him hostage, in case he changes his mind.

520
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,170
All of your evil deeds were only done to those who realized the truth

521
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,990
or interfered with your plan.

522
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:38,620
If Your Highness were an evil person who killed just anyone to gain power,

523
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,590
I would have exposed your crimes long ago and seen the end of it.

524
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:52,390
In that case, could you forgive the inspector general and me and accept our relationship?

525
00:53:52,390 --> 00:54:00,780
If you do, I will appoint you as the crown prince instead of Grand Prince Do Seong.

526
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,200
- And Maiden Myeong Yun willâ€” 
 - No.

527
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:10,320
Just because I understand you doesn't mean I can forgive Your Highness.

528
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:15,790
Too many people have died because of Your Highness already.

529
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,640
It seems I will not hear an answer.

530
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,500
So, I will make my final request.

531
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,160
I will take Seon Ok with me.

532
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,520
Please allow it.

533
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,710
You can take her.

534
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:54,520
I did not want to hurt you, Crown Prince.

535
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,640
I will... take that as an answer.

536
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:36,390
   

537
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,810
How can you get this drunk in broad daylight?

538
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,910
Living like this is not too bad, either.

539
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,540
Am I right, Gab Dol?

540
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,470
I am Gab Seok.

541
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,150
Sure, Gab Dol.

542
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,480
Goodness, he got so drunk!

543
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:01,490
 He spent the entire day at the courtesan house again today? 

544
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,570
Do you not find it strange?

545
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:10,460
Do you consider Grand Prince Su Seong to be that kind of a man?

546
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,090
How is Myeong Yun doing?

547
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:20,570
She stayed in her room all day and just left for the slums after hearing

548
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,850
of an emergency patient.

549
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,310
- This late at night? 
 - I apologize.

550
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:28,340
I will stop her next time.

551
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,690
It is fine.

552
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,730
She must feel uneasy since the wedding is right around the corner.

553
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:36,090
She will not be able to do it in the future.

554
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:39,590
So, let her do as she wishes for the next few days.

555
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:53,960
Maiden!

556
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,090
Your Highness, have you been well?

557
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:06,790
Just like last time, you have a knack for surprising people.

558
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,690
I apologize.

559
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:13,860
I had to come out of the blue in order to avoid my father's watch.

560
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,020
Please talk inside.

561
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,440
Is His Majesty showing any progress?

562
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:39,670
I have been sending him medicine through the head eunuch, but not yet.

563
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:46,870
If he shows any progress, I will let you know through Mu Baek right away.

564
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,820
So, do not make such dangerous trips like this.

565
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,220
In fact...

566
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:56,670
I stopped by briefly to see you before going to my mother's maternal family.

567
00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:00,520
Going to your mother's maternal family? Why all of a sudden?

568
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,670
I believe His Majesty will wake up for sure.

569
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:08,860
However, that day may not come before the wedding day.

570
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:12,220
So, I decided to leave the capital.

571
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:19,570
I plan to live with patients who need me, at a place no one knows about.

572
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,700
I understand what you are saying,

573
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,350
but how can you live alone in a strange placeâ€”

574
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh Wol and Mu Baek are coming with me.

575
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,190
That is not what I am saying.

576
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,960
I cannot...

577
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,930
I cannot let you go.

578
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,730
Being dragged to a wedding forcibly once was enough.

579
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:48,830
I do not want to experience that again.

580
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,740
I understand. You can go ahead.

581
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:57,740
Whether it is your mother's maternal family or Mt. Dumae, I will come to find you.

582
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,090
You cannot.

583
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:04,060
If Your Highness comes to find me, my father will find out.

584
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,860
That will not happen.

585
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:11,410
Did you forget how terrifying of a person my father is?

586
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:22,440
If we are fated to be, we might meet again one day.

587
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,310
Please think of it that way and let me go.

588
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:39,410
If you will allow it,

589
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:43,720
I would like to bid you a final farewell.

590
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:51,630
â™«  The day we loved, the day we hurt  â™«

591
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:59,290
â™«   Even the day we sometimes exchanged harsh words  â™«

592
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:07,140
â™«  The day that became cloudy in the fog  â™«

593
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:13,940
â™«  caress my heart like the spring breeze  â™«

594
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:21,990
â™«  In the breath which only I hear,  â™«

595
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:30,190
â™«  I close my eyes again and take a deep breath  â™«

596
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,890
 Your Highness! 

597
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,590
What is the matter?

598
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,740
What brings you here without a notice?

599
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:03,280
By chance, did something happen to Royal Father?

â™«  You are too far away for me to get closer  â™«

611

 Missing Crown Prince 
  Preview  

616
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:58,740
 We should let Do Seong know that you have recovered, Father. 

617
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:01,560
 They said to fool your ally first if you want to fool the enemy. 

618
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,500
 Please go far away, first thing tomorrow. 

619
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,080
 You will die if you stay here. 

620
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,200
 I heard you sent a secret letter to the tiger hunters. 

621
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,580
 Did the queen dowager instigate this? 

622
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:15,930
 Traitor Choi Sang Rok,  you are under arrest! 

623
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:19,770
 If you do not wish to have the queen dowager killed as well, kneel down right now. 

624
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,440
 Kneel down right now!
