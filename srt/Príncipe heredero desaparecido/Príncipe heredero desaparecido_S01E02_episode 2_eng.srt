00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,900
 This drama is fiction. Characters, places, organizations, and events have no connection to historical facts. Child actors and animals were filmed according to production guidelines. 

10
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,360
 It is an acupuncture needle case used by physicians. 

11
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,000
I have not seen you around before.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,910
Did you come to the capital to take the state examination?

13
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,690
Is that so?

14
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,620
No.

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,270
I hope you do well on your examination.

16
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,910
Did you enjoy your meal?

17
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,790
I ate well.

18
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,580
Get ready.

19
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,740
Young Master.

21
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,130
He is fine.

22
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,050
How about those men?

23
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,300
I took care of them.

24
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,700
Good work. Summon Oh Wol.

25
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,750
 My lady. This is Mu Baek. 

26
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,410
 What is it? 

27
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,590
The master is asking for Oh Wol.

28
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,100
Oh Wol...

29
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,270
Is Oh Wol not in the room?

30
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,030
Why is Father asking for Oh Wol at this late hour?

31
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,360
Where is Oh Wol?

32
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,750
She went to sleep about two hours ago.

33
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,240
I am coming from Oh Wol's room.

34
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,130
Master is waiting for her.

35
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,550
Oh Wol, if you are in there, come out immediately.

36
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,300
Actually, I sent her for an errand at the physician's.

37
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,420
This late at night?

38
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,800
I feel I have an indigestion issue.

39
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,850
Are you feeling very ill?

40
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,190
If you are unwell, I will tell the master.

41
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,480
No. Oh Wol will bring me the medicine soon.

42
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,400
That shall be enough.

43
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,460
Please send Oh Wol to the men's quarters as soon as she returns.

44
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,160
Even now, is it not possible for you to help me?

45
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,890
The master is doing this for your sake, my lady.

46
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,260
Orabeoni.

47
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,380
My lady, you cannot address me like that...

48
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,110
I told you not to ever call me that.

49
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,940
- That is not the issueâ€” 
 - We need to abide by the rules between nobles and commoners.

50
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,750
If someone overhears, I will die.

51
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,750
Do you truly want to kill me?

52
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,810
What is taking her so long?

53
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,670
Hurry up, Oh Wol.

54
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,880
Ajae* Mu Baek. 
  (Archaic equivalent of "ajeossi") 

55
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,900
Well, my lady told me to go to bed early, but...

56
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,730
I-I could not fall asleep...

57
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,900
- I'm telling the truth. 
 - Follow me.

58
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,390
The master is asking for you.

59
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,290
If you understand me, hurry up and get ready.

60
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,210
Yes, My Lord.

61
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:30,250
Do not forget that... your lady's fate depends on the tip of your tongue.

62
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,710
Follow me.

63
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,870
Why did you bring me medicine all of a sudden?

64
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,200
I heard you told ajae Mu Baek that you have indigestion.

65
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,020
The master said you will feel better in no time if you drink this...

66
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,410
That is because he suddenly showed up asking for you,

67
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,480
so I panicked and looked aroundâ€”

68
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,070
Ajae Mu Baek is outside.

69
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,120
I got it. I got it, so tell me how things went with your outing.

70
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,650
What did he say? Did he say he would do so?

71
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,070
Please go ahead and drink the medicine.

72
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,420
Hurry.

73
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,950
Good, good. Let it all go down.

74
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,400
Gosh, no!

75
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,450
Why did you drink this whole thing?

76
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,850
Why not? You said to drink it.

77
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,800
I mean, that's because...

78
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,180
Dear me!  I do not know what to do anymore...

79
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,790
Come on. What shall we do if you don't know?

80
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,840
Did he say he could prepare it?

81
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,900
This is so frustrating! I'm dying here.

82
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,780
Why? Did he say he couldn't? Did he say no?

83
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,230
I mean, that is not it ... Actually, my lady ...

84
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,390
Actually, what?

85
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,750
Did they ask for more money?

86
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,250
Is that what they demanded?

87
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:58,240
 Do not forget that... your lady's fate depends on the tip of your tongue. 

88
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:10,100
Oh Wol. What is wrong? Did something happen?

89
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,920
My lady, I deserve to die.

90
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,450
Please kill me, my lady.

91
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:24,900
No way ... Did those bastards do something terrible to you ...

92
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,700
I should justâ€”

93
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,930
Huh?

94
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,490
My lady! My lady... My lady...

95
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,460
Do not worry.

96
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:45,940
I will go immediately... and get those rascals... get those...

97
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,970
My lady ...

98
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,820
I have finished all the preparations.

99
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,680
- How about that man? 
 - I have done as you have instructed.

100
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,070
The moment he sees Myeong Yun's face,

101
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,130
all of this will come to naught.

102
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,730
There should not be even an inch of deviation from the plan.

103
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,680
Even if he awakes in the middle of the night,

104
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,600
he will not be able to see anything.

105
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,570
You must keep an eye on Myeong Yun as well.

106
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,150
If she awakens before the rooster crows, things will go wrong.

107
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,440
Be sure to tell Oh Wol to keep guard in front of her room.

108
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,690
- Yes. 
 - And all this matter

109
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,350
should remain a secret, no one except you and Oh Wol should know about it.

110
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:49,460
Be sure to secure the room so no one, including other servants, can get near it.

111
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,960
Be sure to keep a tight watch.

112
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,920
You must notify me immediately if you hear anything suspicious coming from the room.

113
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,570
Do you understand?

114
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,340
Yes.

115
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,640
 The two of them must be dressed in wedding attire 

116
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,230
 and must sleep together until their soul and energy are in sync. 

117
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:33,360
 If perfect union is achieved, Myeong Yun's curse will disappear. 

118
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,760
 However, the moment the man sees Myeong Yun's face, 

119
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,030
 everything will fail. 

120
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:47,670
 Be sure to remember this and keep it in mind. 

121
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:19,700
 Destruction of the curse that causes one's husband to die and become a widow 

122
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:31,600
 Prayer for a couple to become husband and wife 

123
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,000
Your Highness...

124
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,570
Your Highness...

125
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,400
Your Highness.

126
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,770
Your Highness!

127
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,490
Your Highness.

128
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,940
 It happened so suddenly, so I do not remember much. 

129
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,890
 But I had never seen them before, either. 

130
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,630
You must be safe, Your Highness...

131
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,790
Please... Please...

132
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,560
Your Highness...

133
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,820
Your Highness.

134
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,140
 I heard that the man I marry will die. 

135
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,800
 I have a secret plan. 

136
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,400
 I will take care of everything. You just need to do as I say. 

137
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,600
My lady?

138
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,240
Oh Wol?

139
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,680
Yes, my lady.

140
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,660
My lady, I deserve to die...

141
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,780
 His lordship told me to do this. 

142
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,800
So, I had no choice.

143
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,300
It is all right.

144
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,420
How would you go against Father's orders?

145
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,660
 I am all right, so go ahead and open this door. 

146
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,900
Would it be all right with you if I didn't?

147
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,160
 You little... 

148
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,710
I will break it down.

149
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,670
I will open it. I will.

150
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,570
How about what I asked you to do?

151
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,830
You did not get an answer?

152
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,530
I am sure he is already waiting for you.

153
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,360
Let's rush.

154
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,120
Wait. You cannot, my lady.

155
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,110
The moment you opened that door, you went against Father's order.

156
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,790
Nothing will change even if you do this. So, hurry up and help me out.

157
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,820
That is not it.

158
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,310
Even if you rescue this man, he cannot see your face.

159
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,810
He also should not know where this is.

160
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
Hurry up and take off your clothes.

161
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,600
Sorry? You want to switch our clothes again?

162
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,300
I have to take him to where Father cannot find him.

163
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,770
But I cannot go outside the house dressed like this.

164
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,530
And I cannot very well go out naked.

165
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,260
How about you just let this man go?

166
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,440
We can just let him climb over the wall.

167
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,290
- How could he climb the wall when he is all tied up like this? 
 - Then, just untie his hands.

168
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,170
And? What if he unties his blindfold as soon as he goes over the wall?

169
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,860
You said he cannot know where our house is, either.

170
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,710
I guess he could take off his gag, too.

171
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,150
That means he could scream for help, right?

172
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,600
Then, I will take him.

173
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,190
Do you even know how to ride a horse?

174
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,100
I will get undressed.

175
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,950
My lady ...

176
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,850
Can I undo this, at least?

177
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,300
My lady.

178
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,970
You cannot.

179
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,800
If Father happens to take a look,

180
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,310
he has to think you are me, so we can earn some time.

181
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,890
Stop pouting and wake him up.

182
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,000
Look.

183
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,880
Look. Wake up.

184
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,290
Move.

185
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,980
What are you going to do?

186
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,160
My lady.

187
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,430
My lady!

188
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,970
Since the young lady is unwell, she needs to rest.

189
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,440
Did you not hear that no one should come near the women's quarters?

190
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,000
W-Well, someone is here and is urgently asking for the master.

191
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,990
I do not know what I should do.

192
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,370
- Who is here? 
 - A royal officer from the crown prince's palace.

193
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,060
A royal officer from the crown prince's palace?

194
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,150
Why would an officer from the crown prince's palace look for me at this late hour?

195
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,560
He says he is searching for the crown prince.

196
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,650
What in the world are you talking about?

197
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,450
He went on a secret outing and disappeared?

198
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,320
I am sorry, but it is as I have told you.

199
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,470
He was drinking at a tavern and passed out all of a sudden.

200
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,060
At that very moment, someone struck my head with a bat and I passed out.

201
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,980
And when I came to, His Highness was nowhere to be found.

202
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,060
This tavern you've mentioned...

203
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,590
where is it?

204
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,050
It is a tavern on a three-way road on top of a small hill.

205
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:46,810
I looked around the tavern and everywhere else, but could not find any trace of him.

206
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,060
It is not his first time coming out on a secret outing.

207
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,650
He is an intelligent man, so I am sure he will be fine.

208
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,730
But why did you come looking for me?

209
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,460
Over such a matter, should you not first notify the palace?

210
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,960
I was rushing to the palace to do that myself, but...

211
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,440
I turned around because I remembered you.

212
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,490
The reason His Highness came out on a secret outing

213
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,030
was because he needed to see you despertely.

214
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,430
- Me? 
 - Yes.

215
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,810
Thus, I thought perhaps he was already over here.

216
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,960
I apologize for bothering you at this late hour.

217
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,450
It's all right.

218
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,840
I will also come up with a solution, so you should return to the palace quickly.

219
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,780
Be careful going back.

220
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,840
So, I was kidnapped in order for your lady to avoid her cursed fate

221
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,800
and if I stayed here like this, I could be killed to shut me up.

222
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,530
So, the lady pities me and wishes to let me go?

223
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,450
That is correct.

224
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,380
You surely gave me a disease and then the cure.

225
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,320
I understand, so untie me.

226
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,260
Before I untie you, there is one thing you need to keep in mind.

227
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,160
The only people who will help you

228
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,770
are my lady and me. Please keep that in mind.

229
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,710
And I am merely a servant girl,

230
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,630
so do not think of taking me hostage to escape from here.

231
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,800
Then, I will untie you now.

232
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,550
Did you kidnap that man from the tavern on the three-way road?

233
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,150
- Yes. 
 - Are you sure he is the crown prince?

234
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,020
Could it be someone else?

235
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,130
I waited with the concoction in the drink

236
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,520
and a man who looked like a valet showed up.

237
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,740
So, they said they knocked him out and kidnapped him.

238
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,580
I believe it was the crown prince.

239
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,210
How could such a thing happen?

240
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,400
We planned the kidnapping to avoid the curse that might befall the crown prince.

241
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,620
So what will happen if the man we kidnapped turns out to be the crown prince?

242
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,450
What should I do?

243
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,180
How much time do we have until the rooster crows?

244
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,490
Please shut up before I break your wrist.

245
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,190
It was not intentional at all.

246
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,600
It was a mistake. A mistake.

247
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,690
If you make one more mistake, I will surely break it.

248
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,810
Take this blindfold off of me, then.

249
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,500
Then, you will die, Scholar sir.

250
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,930
Let us go.

251
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,620
You have to climb over the wall.

252
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,330
It is a ladder.

253
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,850
Go ahead. Hurry.

254
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,130
H-Hurry... Hurry...

255
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,880
Go, go!

256
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,350
W-Who is there?

257
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,450
Huh?

258
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:47,460
Who dared put a ladder here?

259
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,880
Aigoo...

260
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,940
- Should I go after her? 
 - No need.

261
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,020
In any case, a rooster crowed. So, that means we avoided harm.

262
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,270
But still, I should check if His Highness the Crown Prince is all right.

263
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,960
I am sure Oh Wol will take him to a safe place.

264
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,050
Myeong Yun must have made sure of it.

265
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,170
- Yes. 
 - But just in case, keep an eye on Myeong Yun

266
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,930
and find out what happened to the crown prince when Oh Wol returns.

267
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,480
Yes.

268
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,190
It is downhill, so please be careful.

269
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,580
There are steps.

270
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,690
I cannot go any further.

271
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,970
We must hurry.

272
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,210
Can you not see my pitiful state?

273
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,580
You seem to have a strong arm and lots of energy.

274
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,870
Why not you carry me on your back?

275
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,650
Do not try to be clever.

276
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,800
What? C-Clever?

277
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,500
I know you are injured, and this is tough. But if you do not go now,

278
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,700
you will die.

279
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,290
If you want to live, just follow me quietly.

280
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,250
Why must you threaten me whenever you open your mouth?

281
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,640
I will go. I will.

282
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,060
I am trying to keep you alive, Scholar sir.

283
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,300
We need to go a little further, so please stay strong.

284
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,270
 Leave her alone until the morning. 

285
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:34,760
 She went through quite an ordeal. We should let her rest. 

286
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,510
Gosh, which way are they coming from?

287
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,570
Over here! Eonni, over here.

288
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,590
Wait here for a moment.

289
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,420
All right.

290
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,230
Hurry.

291
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,840
What is going on?

292
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,410
Who is that man, and why are you dressed like that?

293
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,760
Geez, you want to die?

294
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,150
I sent you so much money. How could you bring me such a horrible horse?

295
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,840
It is better than it looks.

296
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,460
If you do not like it, I will take it back.

297
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,260
Give me the reins and get lost.

298
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,350
Let us take a shot later...

299
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,060
Let us grab a drink, Eonni.

300
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,780
I am off.

301
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,390
A drink?

302
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,860
Let us go.

303
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,000
It is a horse. Please get on.

304
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,620
Can I take off the blindfold, then?

305
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,410
You cannot.

306
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,250
Who will lead the horse, then?

307
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,510
You're a mere girl servant, could you possibly know how to ride a horse?

308
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,930
A female servant who kidnaps and knows how to ride a horse?

309
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,020
How great of a family must that be?

310
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,220
Your Excellency, there is a message from the palace.

311
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,510
Are you going to the palace?

312
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:55,130
Yes. I got an urgent message to enter the palace.

313
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,200
I will escort you.

314
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,820
No. Go and bring Master Geo Wu as soon as the morning breaks.

315
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,330
Tell him I have something to ask him urgently.

316
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,920
Yes.

317
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:38,310
 Your Highness, this is Head Court Lady Kim. 

318
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,080
Come in.

319
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,370
What happened?

320
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,750
Did you find the crown prince?

321
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,330
It seems like the horse is exhausted.

322
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,440
Please come down ...

323
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,200
Are you all right?

324
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,750
I want to say I am, but ...

325
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,350
I am not all right.

326
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,960
Is it your ankle?

327
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,960
Did you injure it when you fell off the wall?

328
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,730
Yes.

329
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,020
You should have said so sooner.

330
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,480
You said not to be clever.

331
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,000
 You have lots of energy. Why not you carry me on your back? 

332
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,700
 Don't try to be clever. 

333
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,900
 What? C-Clever? 

334
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,750
I thought you were being over-dramatic.

335
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,490
You can take off your blindfold now.

336
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,220
Why are you so surprised?

337
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,450
I am not surprised.

338
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:52,550
Because you were so threatening, I thought you would look like a goblin.

339
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,960
But you are prettier than I expected.

340
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,980
I mean...

341
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,610
you are prettier than I anticipated.

342
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,220
I did not say a thing.

343
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,670
If the servant is as beautiful as you,

344
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,950
how beautiful your lady must be?

345
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:22,270
Well, is she some fairy or something?

346
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,130
Stop talking nonsense,

347
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,870
are you hurt anywhere else?

348
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,270
Over here.

349
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,320
My heart?

350
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,260
Gosh, seriously!

351
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,400
Don't play around, and tell me where you are hurting, Scholar sir.

352
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,720
I was not playing around.

353
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,040
It hurts...

354
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,210
over here, I said.

355
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,330
Scholar sir! Scholar sir!

356
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,300
It looks like his ribs are broken or fractured.

357
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,160
He must have been in grave pain if he rode a horse in this state.

358
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,370
How did he endure this?

359
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:40,440
I thought he was a scholar studying literature.

360
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,020
Is he a physician?

361
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:51,380
We do not know what kind of danger the crown prince is in.

362
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:57,960
You mean, you have not found any trace of him yet?

363
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,350
What are the royal guards doing

364
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,410
and what is the Public Security Bureau up to?

365
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,140
Even if you have to use the military,

366
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,760
go and find the crown prince!

367
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,000
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

368
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,060
Needless to say, just like last time,

369
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:32,260
I am sure he is partying it up in a courtesan house. He probably has no idea about all this chaos.

370
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,100
I wonder if we are overreacting.

371
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,610
Look here, Your Excellency Head of the Capital Bureau.

372
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,780
He is the crown prince of this nation.

373
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,950
Please mind your manners.

374
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,290
All right, our priority is to find the crown prince.

375
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,430
Let us hurry.

376
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,620
What are you doing?

377
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,830
Are you awake now?

378
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,370
I gathered some medicinal herbs to put on your wound.

379
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,120
So, are you a physician?

380
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,120
Physician?

381
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,470
Is this not yours, Scholar sir?

382
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,780
It must be an object of importance to you.

383
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,370
Yes.

384
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:45,080
From now on, do not address me as "Scholar sir."

385
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,600
Call me "Husband sir."

386
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,210
- Pardon? 
 - Whether it was kidnapping or not, your lady and I spent a night together.

387
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,120
That makes me her husband.

388
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,600
Am I wrong?

389
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,530
Are you in your right mind?

390
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,580
Come on now. Do not argue with me and call me that.

391
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,960
"Husband sir."

392
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,090
If you do not call me "husband,"

393
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,620
I will not receive treatment, either.

394
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:18,530
Fine. I understand...

395
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,060
Scholar sir.

396
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,490
Wait...

397
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,110
Really...

398
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,100
Deposed crown prince?

399
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,900
What do you mean by that, Grandfather?

400
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,250
Why are you so shocked?

401
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:44,220
So many look at him with disdain since he is of southern blood.

402
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,980
This is happening again only after a few days of what happened last time.

403
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,300
Of course, we should consider it.

404
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,980
But still, I think you are speaking too harshly, Father.

405
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,900
Come on. I cannot believe you are so relaxed.

406
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,510
Listen to me carefully, both of you.

407
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:06,330
The one in power does not allow the next candidate to live in peace.

408
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,500
Hyeong-nim would never do that.

409
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,800
There is no such a thing in the world as "never."

410
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,860
Why do you think the queen dowager's son, Prince Gwang Chang, died?

411
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,850
The deposed king also was opposed to it.

412
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:26,350
However, the southerners ultimately made him into a traitor and killed him.

413
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,970
Would he have done so if he were his blood sibling?

414
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,650
Just like the deposed king and Prince Gwang Chang,

415
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,120
the crown prince and our prince Do Seong...

416
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,050
are not of the same blood.

417
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,800
I have never discriminated against the crown prince or our prince Do Seong while raising them.

418
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,400
I am aware. I am fully aware.

419
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,090
That is why they get along so well.

420
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,320
However, whatever the case,

421
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:01,030
blood is still thicker than water.

422
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,740
If the crown prince becomes king one day,

423
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,420
the southerners, his maternal family, will come into power.

424
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,200
I wonder if they will...

425
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,140
let prince Do Seong live, then.

426
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,270
Please stop!

427
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,540
I will pretend I did not hear what you said today.

428
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,860
Where are you going?

429
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,370
Should I not look for Hyeong-nim?

430
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,690
I will take my leave.

431
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,200
He is so soft-hearted.

432
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,410
Are you not overly concerned, Father?

433
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,340
Perhaps so.

434
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,780
However, our family's safety is on the line.

435
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,850
Just look at the queen dowager who was confined to a back garden palace for over ten years.

436
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:09,980
 Who can guarantee something of that sort will not happen to you, Your Highness? 

437
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,510
- Are you sure it is this place? 
 - Yes.

438
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,290
The tavern owner woman did not see them because she was tied up

439
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,530
and you did not see them because you were passed out.

440
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,250
What a crazy turn of events.

441
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,780
Look around the area one more time!

442
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,650
 Yes, sir! 

443
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,130
Where are you going now?

444
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,690
- I am here. 
 - Pardon?

445
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,150
Thanks to you, I have come safely. Thank you.

446
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,570
We are at the end of the road...

447
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,660
By chance...

448
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:46,410
you are not talking about going into that palace, are you?

449
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,560
I am.

450
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,120
You are not just a physician, but a royal physician?

451
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:56,060
N-N-No!

452
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,570
Why not?

453
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:03,300
 If he is a royal physician, Father would know him right away. 

454
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,220
What will you do by entering the palace in your condition?

455
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,990
You must know since you are a physician, but you bled a lot

456
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,790
and your broken rib could puncture your stomach. You could be in danger.

457
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:18,290
You need to go home and rest.

458
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,680
I can go to the Royal Clinic to get treated. Do not worry.

459
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,600
You cannot go to the Royal Clinic! That is why I am saying this...

460
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,270
I cannot go there? What do you mean?

461
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:31,720
Anyway, something terrible could happen if you enter the palace now.

462
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,680
If you must go, please go home.

463
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,210
I-I will escort you.

464
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,750
Thank you for your concern, but I have something to do in the palace.

465
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,840
I am sure you do not have to do it today.

466
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,860
Treat yourself first...

467
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,310
This is so strange.

468
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:53,620
Are you hiding something from me?

469
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:01,390
Fine. Whatever it may be, I am sure you cannot tell me.

470
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,490
In any case, I will go to the palace, so you should go back.

471
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,930
- Scholar sir. 
 - Come on now.

472
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,820
Husband.

473
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:20,960
If anything were to happen by chance, come back to this spot.

474
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,690
I will be waiting.

475
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,320
Like what?

476
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:28,010
What do you mean by that?

477
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:32,020
I am telling you just in case. So, do not forget.

478
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,180
   (A part of Cheongdeok Palace) 

479
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,630
Stopâ€” Y-Your Highness the C-Crown Prince!

480
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,640
Good day.

481
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,050
I am sorry, but I do not feel well. Would you help me walk?

482
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,950
Yes, Your Highness.

483
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:53,390
Go and tell everyone that the crown prince has returned to the palace.

484
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,830
Yes!

485
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,540
 The crown prince has returned to the palace. 

486
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,540
 The crown prince is back. 

487
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,010
 Your Highness, this is Court Lady Kim. 

488
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,900
What is it?

489
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,010
The crown prince has returned to the palace.

490
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:37,550
Your Highness, if His Majesty finds out, you cannot turn things back.

491
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,700
Your Highness the Queen Dowager!

492
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,810
Let us go to the main hall.

493
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,930
What do you mean to give up on the crown prince... out of the blue?

494
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,540
What do you mean by that?

495
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,390
The crown prince is a criminal who saw what he should not have seen

496
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:10,700
and knows what he should not know.

497
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:16,230
Do not enquire further and just do as I say.

498
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:20,030
I am the king of this nation.

499
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,520
Even though you are the queen dowager, your words are quite harsh.

500
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,530
King, I am the one who put you on the throne.

501
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:33,350
Remember that I can also bring you down.

502
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:45,150
I will pretend that I did not hear that, in consideration of the grace you have shown me.

503
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,060
Please leave now.

504
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,270
Is the chief eunuch out there?

505
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,540
Is anyone out there?

506
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,000
The deposed king.

507
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,600
Because of that despicable man who deserves to be chewed up,

508
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:21,220
do you know what I did while I was confined to the back garden palace for those ten years?

509
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:27,130
I made sure everyone in the palace became my people.

510
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:31,980
I kicked out whoever did not follow my order by coming up with whatever excuses

511
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,880
and put one of my own people in that position.

512
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,450
With the sole aim to take revenge on the deposed king.

513
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:44,080
And after that, do you know what I did?

514
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,310
For a year, through the primary royal chef,

515
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,550
I fed the dethroned king...

516
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,260
a little bit of opium.

517
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,270
And his original madness became even worse.

518
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:03,140
I thought of using poison in case opium did not work on him,

519
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,730
but that wasn't necessary after all.

520
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,610
I cannot believe this.

521
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,100
Chief Eunuch, are you out there?

522
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,140
 Yes, Your Highness. 

523
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,120
Chief Court Lady, are you out there?

524
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,750
 Yes, Your Highness. 

525
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,490
Are the royal cook and food tester also out there?

526
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,530
 Yes, Your Highness. 

527
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:53,110
Going forward, report to me of His Majesty's every move.

528
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,710
 Yes, Your Highness. 

529
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,610
You can all take your leave.

530
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,620
 Yes, Your Highness. 

531
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,990
Now, you believe me, do you not?

532
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,440
Make a choice.

533
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,620
Will you choose the crown prince

534
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,620
or will you choose the throne?

535
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,270
Must you take things this far?

536
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:47,150
You just have to give up on the crown prince.

537
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:53,260
You have another son besides the crown prince.

538
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,700
I will ask you one last time.

539
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:03,030
Will it be the throne or the crown prince?

540
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:13,750
Give me some time.

541
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:20,670
Fine. However, I cannot wait too long.

542
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,820
Are you not even ashamed?

543
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,950
Watch what you say.

544
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:53,940
Just by killing me, do you think your ugly secret will stay hidden?

545
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,510
If getting rid of you alone is not enough,

546
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:01,500
I will kill everyone who knows the secret.

547
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,290
Why?

548
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,280
Do you think I cannot do so?

549
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,110
The deposed king had only treacherous subjects near him,

550
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:12,320
so I thought he did not have a good eye for people.

551
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,170
But it seems he did look right through you.

552
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:19,140
As it turns out, Prince Gwang Chang is mixed with the dirty blood of the guy who you had an affair withâ€”

553
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,380
Shut your mouth!

554
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,970
You must truly have a death wish.

555
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,900
Did you not intend to kill me anyway?

556
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:32,520
I told you many times to watch what you say.

557
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,960
Remember this. From your mouth lies

558
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,340
the safety of the king, the queen, and also Prince Do Seong.

559
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:06,160
What a truly lewd and ugly monster she is.

560
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,270
What do you intend to do?

561
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:29,770
The most urgent thing is to look for the owner

562
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:34,440
of this needle case without the queen dowager's knowledge.

563
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:40,550
Seeing how she is hellbent on hiding him,

564
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:44,760
that wretch who fornicated with the queen dowager must be her weakness.

565
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,020
But I cannot trust anyone in the palace.

566
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,700
If we make a hasty move and the queen dowager finds out,

567
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:54,350
we do not know what she will do.

568
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:59,010
What do you think of the royal physician?

569
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,230
I don't know.

570
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:04,380
I can trust his character and ability, but

571
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:08,080
I am not certain whether he will stand on my side.

572
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,890
If you promise a marriage between his daughter and me,

573
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:14,890
the royal physician will stand on our side.

574
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:17,290
But the queen dowager could ruin the whole thing.

575
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:21,850
However, in order to find out who the owner of this needle case is,

576
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:24,640
we need the royal physician's help.

577
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,900
I will test him.

578
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,790
You must be careful

579
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,670
and then be careful again.

580
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:37,200
I will summon the royal physician with the excuse of my treatment.

581
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,080
The queen dowager will not be suspicious, either.

582
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,990
I am relieved this is the extent of your injury.

583
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,390
I am ashamed.

584
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,300
You must have your reasons.

585
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:05,270
Are you already siding with me since I will be your son-in-law?

586
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:08,980
That could not be.

587
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,690
Your daughter is well, is she not?

588
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,740
Yes.

589
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,770
I cannot believe that the man I trust and respect so much

590
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:22,360
will become my father-in-law. What a joyous occasion.

591
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:28,050
I am overcome with gratefulness to hear you say that.

592
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:31,540
So, I was wondering...

593
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:39,350
do you recognize this needle case?

594
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,960
I gave out this needle case to all the physicians at the Royal Clinic.

595
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,890
Where did you find it?

596
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:48,470
I obtained it by coincidence.

597
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:53,710
Moreover... I would like to find the owner of this item.

598
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,900
Can you help me?

599
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,130
I passed them out to so many people.

600
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:07,600
First, I will go to the Royal Clinic and find out if anyone has misplaced theirs.

601
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,630
I will tell you the reason later. So, please look into it in secret.

602
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,340
Yes.

603
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,720
I will do so.

604
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:33,450
Is he feeling unwell?

605
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:39,100
No. If you notice anything wrong with His Highness,

606
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,900
be sure to notify the Royal Clinic. Do you understand?

607
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,660
Yes. Do not worry.

608
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:04,490
 What will the king do? 

609
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:11,570
In the end, he will give up on the crown prince.

610
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:19,080
He has too much to lose if he were to protect the crown prince.

611
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:35,610
 Your Highness, are you asleep? 

612
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:39,800
Who is there?

613
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,910
 This is the chief eunuch. 

614
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,280
What is it regarding?

615
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,440
 His Majesty is asking for you, Your Highness. 

616
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:51,760
At this late hour?

617
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,220
 Yes, Your Highness. 

618
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:59,170
I will get dressed, so wait.

619
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:13,140
I told you to wait.

620
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,130
I will assist you.

621
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,990
Did Father order you to do this?

622
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:42,380
To have me killed?

623
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,900
Your Highness! Your Highness!

624
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,860
Your Highness...

625
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,640
Your Highness...

626
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,040
Where is this place?

627
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,490
Please come in, Your Highness.

628
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:42,920
You must hide quickly.

 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview  

639
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:54,890
 I must escape the palace. 

640
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:56,780
 I cannot trust anyone. 

641
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,190
 We must find the crown prince before the king does.  

642
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:01,920
 Order the curfew right now. 

643
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,760
 I will find you for sure. 

644
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,460
 Give back the crown prince. 

645
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,030
 Is the crown prince still alive? 

646
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:09,260
 It would be up to you, would it not? 

647
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:12,690
 If you give up the crown prince, you can return to how things were. 

648
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:16,710
 Is she intending to depose the crown prince with this? 

649
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,100
 He bled too much. 

650
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,520
