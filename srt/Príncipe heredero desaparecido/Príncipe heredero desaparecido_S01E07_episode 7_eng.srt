 Episode 7 

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,850
Please calm down.

13
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,990
My Lady!

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,360
You are Baek Gu, aren't you?

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,880
So, the lady you serve is ...

16
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,480
Does this mean you were a servant of the royal physician's household?

17
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,490
Answer me. Are you truly the royal physician's servant?

18
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,090
Is that girl really your servant, Maiden?

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,320
My Lady! My Lady! My Lady!

20
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,440
Her pulse is normal. She must have been too scared ...

21
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,840
My Lady.

22
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,260
Are you all right?

23
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:47,230
Yes. I did not know what to do, so I just pretended to faint.

24
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,160
Good job. You are better than me.

25
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,220
However, what is going to happen now?

26
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,090
We will have to wait and see.

27
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,160
Seeing how they kidnapped you from my room right away,

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,220
it seems he is trying to get revenge for the kidnapping.

29
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,260
How did he know my house...

30
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,630
If he knew where my house was, he would know who I am as well.

31
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,820
Why did he ask me if I was the royal physician's servant?

32
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,650
Isn't it weird?

33
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,380
I don't know about that.

34
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,370
But it did not seem he was trying to get revenge.

35
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,330
Why did they kidnap me?

36
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,370
You said Baek Gu said that it was to prevent her lady's misfortune.

37
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,370
Could it be I was not initially the target,

38
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,340
but I was coincidently dragged in when they decided

39
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,390
to kidnap someone for that reason?

40
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,510
Choi Sang Rok must have been scared out of his wits when he recognized Your Highness.

41
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,490
They kidnapped you just in case they were caught by Father again?

42
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,950
Yes. I think they tried to use me as hostage, mistaking me for you.

43
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,010
Are you sure?

44
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,210
Yes. However, the handsome scholar said

45
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,030
he will never cowardly use a woman as a hostage.

46
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,930
He said to let me go right away.

47
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,870
He was really awesome.

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,680
Awesome?

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,510
No, this is not the time.

50
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,580
My Lady, you should escape while you can.

51
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,280
It would be hard for both of us to escape,

52
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
but I am sure you can get out alone.

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,900
You are the one who matters the most to those people, not me.

54
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,110
We do not know what they will do to you if they think you are me.

55
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,900
That will not do. I am not leaving alone.

56
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,280
You can escape quickly and let the master know.

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,530
So you can come rescue me again.

58
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,470
You are escaping already, huh?

59
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,280
Are you saying we should just go?

60
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,380
What if we don't?

61
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,920
Are you this type of person?

62
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,840
I did not think you would be like this, but you kidnap women and—

63
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,240
Watch what you say! Who do you think you're—

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,610
Whatever the reason,

65
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,140
my lady tried to help you to the end, in order to save you.

66
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,110
So how can you do this?

67
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,450
Had I known you were like this, I should have just left you to die.

68
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,430
I am sincerely full of regret.

69
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,590
Well, that is—

70
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,700
I have no way to justify what happened.

71
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,100
Tell her I apologize and go back with your lady.

72
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,320
Hurry up and go get our belongings.

73
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,910
I apologize.

74
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,490
You only did as your master told you.

75
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,570
I lashed out at you

76
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,800
when you did nothing wrong.

77
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,410
I am sorry.

78
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,300
I made you go through all kinds of trouble.

79
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,720
I am sorry you have to be chased like this because of my father.

80
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,340
That is what my lady told me to tell you.

81
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,260
I see.

82
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,860
Let us go.

83
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,540
Do you even have a place to go?

84
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,350
As expected, you are the only one who cares about me, Baek Gu.

85
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,420
I have a good idea of how to make it past the city gates.

86
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,030
I will have to find a way.

87
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,320
If you do not mind,

88
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:23,030
I have a good idea on how to make it past the city gates.

89
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,390
Would you like to hear me out?

90
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,680
 Your daughter clearly told me she was engaged. 

91
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,230
 It is true she has someone as her intended. 

92
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,320
 However, my Myeong Yun was chosen as the crown princess, 

93
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,250
 not as Deposed Crown Prince Yi Geon's bride. 

94
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,340
 Maiden, why did you have to be born as the Royal Physician's daughter? 

95
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,730
 Why did you have to be born as His Majesty's son, Grand Prince? 

96
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,770
 If you want to take my Myeong Yun as your wife, 

97
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,490
 become the crown prince. 

98
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,570
Grand Prince.

99
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,930
What brings you all the way here?

100
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,480
The captains were chasing the deposed crown prince earlier today,

101
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,650
but they lost him at Yeonhwabang near Jong-ro.

102
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,330
According to the captains, he is most likely hiding around there.

103
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,410
What should we do?

104
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,260
If the deposed crown prince is caught and confesses about you or me, it would be bad.

105
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,310
I did tell them to search Changseonbang further south from there.

106
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:16,610
I think it will be problematic if the left state councillor finds out later.

107
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,680
- Tell them to search Yeonhwabang.
 - Pardon?

108
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,360
Do you think Hyeong-nim will leave us alone if he returns?

109
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,170
I did my duty when I helped him escape the Royal Investigations Bureau.

110
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Hyeong-nim and I ...

111
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,010
No.

112
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,020
The deposed crown prince and I ...

113
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,430
are enemies now.

114
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,020
We cannot lock them up forever.

115
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,290
Tell the grand prince that we must find the crown prince quickly.

116
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,380
The grand prince is already looking for him.

117
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,230
Is this the last house?

118
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,770
Yes.

119
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,850
Are you saying you lost him again?

120
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,930
I was worried the people might get aroused,

121
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,790
so I did not tell my underlings they were chasing the deposed crown prince

122
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,060
and searched secretly.

123
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,230
So, there are limitations there.

124
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,490
Is that even an excuse?

125
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,780
How will I trust you and plan for greater things in the future like this?

126
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,660
I am deeply sorry.

127
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,610
If you give me one more chance, I will make sure to bring the deposed crown prince back.

128
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,540
All right. You can leave now.

129
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,270
Yes.

130
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,690
 I do not yet know where I will head or where I will stay. 

131
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,320
 But I will come back the moment the selection is over. 

132
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,330
 I will accept any punishment, then. 

133
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,920
 Please be well and healthy until I see you again. 

134
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,230
 Your disobedient daughter, Myeong Yun. 

135
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,350
Places Myeong Yun frequented.

136
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,250
Places Myeong Yun would frequent.

137
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,620
Scour them all without skipping any.

138
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,080
- Yes.
 - No matter what happens,

139
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,920
you must find her before the selection begins.

140
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,450
Do you understand?

141
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,040
Yes.

142
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,350
What is this?

143
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,040
Is it a corpse or a patient?

144
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,380
They are patients.

145
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,120
Please do not get too close to them.

146
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,820
They have the plague.

147
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,760
They are more or less dead bodies rather than patients.

148
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,140
We took them to the Hyeminseo, but they said to take them out of the city

149
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,570
since the plague will spread—

150
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,970
I-I think I have it, too!

151
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,800
I-I got it, too!

152
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,420
Go!

153
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,510
Great work.

154
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,150
Well, I didn't do it for free.

155
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,070
It is real gold. Y-You see the mark here, right?

156
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,520
You can go on ahead.

157
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,320
I will, Eonni.

158
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,200
If you ever need me, please let me know. Aigoo...

159
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,660
Even if I cannot repay you for this, I will not forget it.

160
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,580
Thank you.

161
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,110
We should get going now.

162
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,930
You should also take your lady and go now.

163
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,540
I will also come with you along with my lady.

164
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,180
- What?
 - Sorry?

165
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,340
No need.

166
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,810
This is more than enough, so you should go now.

167
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,250
You barely made it out of the capital.

168
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,850
It is too early to let your guard down.

169
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:51,450
I understand. I will be extra careful from now on.

170
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,030
- Well...
 - Why?

171
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,370
Do you have something more to say?

172
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,420
The thing is ...

173
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,230
Since we are here already, my lady said

174
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,660
it will be better to go with you until we are completely sure you are safe.

175
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,450
- Your lady did?
 - Y-Yes.

176
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,170
My lady said so.

177
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,410
I mean... The thing is...

178
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,700
I am thankful for your words alone.

179
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,480
Yes. Now, then.

180
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,150
M-My lady always likes things to be very clear.

181
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,540
She said...

182
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,790
she wants to help you ...

183
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,410
for sure! To the end!

184
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,660
That's what she wants to do.

185
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,450
You do not need to repay for your father's mistake, Maiden.

186
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,030
That is not it.

187
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,230
It has nothing to do with the master.

188
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,310
That is what you said, right, My Lady?

189
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,080
But still, this journey will not be easy, even for men like us.

190
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,470
I do not want you and your lady to join. Therefore—

191
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,040
She is willing to help voluntarily, so why are you refusing?

192
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,120
Do we have the luxury to refuse right now?

193
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,500
Thank you.

194
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,280
I will make sure your journey is comfortable and safe.

195
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,670
Please come this way.

196
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,780
Let's go, Baek Gu.

197
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,140
Gab Seok! Baek Gu!

198
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,980
Excuse me, Maiden.

199
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,660
Wait— Maiden!

200
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,940
They are following us nicely.

201
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,830
Are you that happy?

202
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,290
It is not that I am happy.

203
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,750
I risked my life to kidnap her because we needed a hostage,

204
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,510
but they are following us on their own.

205
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,080
I am just grateful since the heavens must be helping.

206
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,800
Why do you keep looking back, Young Master?

207
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,930
It is because I am worried.

208
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,090
After all, we cannot sleep together with these women.

209
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,620
We do not know how many days it will take to reach Mungyeong.

210
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,280
Where are we to sleep later tonight?

211
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,950
Oh Wol, are you still mad at me?

212
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,530
I am not mad at you.

213
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,870
I just cannot understand what you are thinking, My Lady.

214
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,520
You said they kidnapped me, thinking I was you.

215
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,990
That means they kidnapped you.

216
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,330
Why should we help them like this?

217
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,700
As I said before, all of this started because of me.

218
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,540
If it were not for my fate, there would have been no kidnapping.

219
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,760
If there were no kidnapping, this would not have happened to the scholar.

220
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,770
Oh Wol, I am sorry for putting you through this,

221
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,060
but could you just bear it for a little while, for my sake?

222
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,530
We cannot go back home right away anyway,

223
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,680
let us just think we are going on a trip.

224
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,410
The two of us alone can go on a trip, though.

225
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,550
Right! I forgot an important matter.

226
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,900
The scholar's wound.

227
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,720
You also know it is bad for a wound to get infected.

228
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,230
So, until he is healed completely—

229
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,840
I got it, so you can stop it now.

230
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,380
The more you speak ...

231
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,050
The more I speak what?

232
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,240
the more suspicious I get.

233
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,210
S-Suspicious? What—

234
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,830
- I am?
 - Yes.

235
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,470
Listen to me carefully. The reason why—

236
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,320
Gosh, I got it.

237
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,330
We will say I understand it all, so you can stop.

238
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,950
Let's hurry up and go. They seem to be waiting for us.

239
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,740
L-Let us go.

240
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,680
Mu Baek is going to kill me.

241
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,920
M-Move aside. Hey, move aside.

242
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,430
Why, you little—

243
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,270
Damn it!

244
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,720
Hey, w-we surrender.

245
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,180
I will tell you everything, so please stop hitting me.

246
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,890
I escorted Nunim, her servant, and two men all the way past Shigumun.

247
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,420
- Men?
- Y-Yes.

248
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,600
Was it this man?

249
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,300
I think he was.

250
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,990
If you are lying, you will lose your head.

251
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,220
What did you say?

252
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,050
Myeong Yun is with the deposed crown prince?

253
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,260
Yes.

254
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,250
What is ...

255
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,310
What is going on?

256
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,690
Could it be ...

257
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,960
Myeong Yun ran away from home to meet up with the deposed crown prince?

258
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,550
Find Myeong Yun.

259
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,300
You must find her, no matter what. Do you understand?

260
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,500
- Yes.
- If anyone sees

261
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,230
Myeong Yun with the deposed crown prince,

262
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,620
everything we have done will be for nothing!

263
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,380
You must find her immediately!

264
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,000
Do you understand?

265
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,640
We are going to sleep here?

266
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,180
Yes.

267
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,270
It's the perfect place to freeze to death—

268
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,210
I will find some wood for a fire.

269
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,720
Let's go.

270
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,390
Yes.

271
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,780
You do not need to overdo it and follow us.

272
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,900
So, convince your lady and go back now.

273
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,550
Are my lady and I a burden to you, now that you made it past the city gates?

274
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,690
That is not it.

275
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,200
Your lady is having a hard time—

276
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,290
I will take care of my lady, so don't worry.

277
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,640
It will also be hard for you.

278
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,840
Will you be all right?

279
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,840
Yes.

280
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,420
Is there any progress?

281
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,470
I am asking if he got any better.

282
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,070
 Please have us killed. 

283
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,530
You can all take your leave.

284
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,870
Court Lady Jo, are you there?

285
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,590
Yes, Your Highness!

286
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,620
I was a fool to trust them and just wait.

287
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,520
Who are those people anyway?

288
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,690
They all belong to the Royal Clinic anyway.

289
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,560
Would there be even one of them who is not connected to Choi Sang Rok?

290
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,230
I apologize, Your Highness.

291
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,750
Take a trip outside the palace.

292
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,050
 Grand Prince, someone from the palace is here. 

293
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,160
Mother has said so?

294
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,340
Yes.

295
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,220
She is looking for a physician who has no connections to Choi Sang Rok.

296
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,510
Who is the person behind you?

297
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,510
He seems to have come from outside the palace.

298
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,700
Just who allowed you to bring him inside the palace?

299
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,490
It is not your business, so please move aside, Court Lady.

300
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,590
What if I will not move?

301
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,460
Please focus on matters of the queen dowager's palace.

302
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,950
I will take care of the queen's palace matters.

303
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,910
If we were in the queen's palace,

304
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,030
I would let it pass, too.

305
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,330
But we are in the Main Hall.

306
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,410
Her Highness the queen is the one guarding the Main Hall right now.

307
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,020
Also, the mistress of the Inner Court is

308
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,980
Her Highness the queen, not the queen dowager.

309
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,580
 Your Majesty, are you feeling unwell? 

310
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,990
 Your Majesty. 

311
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,200
 Go on and take him in your arms. 

312
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,530
 Even Do Seong has left the palace, 

313
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,780
 so I brought this cat since you must be feeling lonely. 

314
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,220
 You have to keep Her Highness company so she does not feel lonely. 

315
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,400
 This is a royal decree. Do you understand? 

316
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,390
 What will I do with my crybaby wife? 

317
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,830
 Please do not cry. 

318
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,580
 Your Highness, the queen dowager has arrived. 

319
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,550
 The left state councillor and the inspector general are here as well. 

320
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,310
Let them in.

321
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,240
Who is that man?

322
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,940
Who is he to dare touch His Majesty's body?

323
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,180
I invited him.

324
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,070
He is a physician I brought in from outside the palace!

325
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,090
Your Highness, how can you do such a devastating thing?

326
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,700
Head Eunuch! What are you doing, Head Eunuch?

327
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,760
Take that man away right now!

328
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,200
Father.

329
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,380
Father!

330
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,380
You were too rash.

331
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:32,110
How could you bring an unidentified man into His Majesty's bedchambers?

332
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,740
Even for you, this is not something you can do, Your Highness.

333
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,330
What should I do, then?

334
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:42,340
All the royal physicians known for their medical skills have made no progress!

335
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,680
How much longer should I trust them and wait?

336
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,360
Your Highness, you are in His Majesty's presence.

337
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,100
Please lower your voice.

338
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,200
Queen, the left state councillor is right.

339
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,100
The palace has its own rules and regulations.

340
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,170
How can you bring just anyone in?

341
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,080
If you cannot trust the Royal Clinic—

342
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,520
Yes, I cannot trust them.

343
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,840
How can I trust them?

344
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,380
Whose fault was it that His Majesty is in this state?

345
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,060
Your Highness, what do you mean by that?

346
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,920
Are you asking because you do not know?

347
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,480
You must know well, since you are on the same side as these two, Father.

348
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,460
So how can you pretend not to know?

349
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,090
Inspector General, please take a look at His Majesty.

350
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,550
Would you not be better than the physicians?

351
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,130
Yes.

352
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,550
Chief Royal Guard, are you there?

353
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,540
Yes, Your Highness!

354
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:57,740
If the inspector general tries to harm His Majesty in any way,

355
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,360
strike him down right away!

356
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,300
Yes.

357
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,540
Your Highness, how can you—

358
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:55,560
His pulse is slow, but not to a worrying degree.

359
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,180
Please do not worry too much.

360
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,720
It seems that the queen has something to tell me.

361
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,320
You can leave us.

362
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,160
Do you ... resent me that much?

363
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,770
Yes, I resent you to death.

364
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,750
Every night, I dreamt of running

365
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,340
to the queen dowager's palace and killing you -  over and over again!

366
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,620
But that was the end of it.

367
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,370
Because I do not know how to shed fake tears,

368
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,020
claim that an affair is feelings of love,

369
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:54,170
and I have never even fathomed killing innocent people for my ambition!

370
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,940
I was afraid and scared to oppose you, so I avoided you and hid!

371
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,130
However, the moment I saw you,

372
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,910
I became angry, not scared.

373
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,760
I was so furious that I could not breathe!

374
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,890
Queen, what do you need me to tell you—

375
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,040
Do not speak.

376
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,570
I will be the one to talk, since I am the human being here.

377
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,800
Yes. You do not seem human to me.

378
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,100
You dared to harm His Majesty

379
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,210
by using his own wife, on top of that!

380
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,820
You framed and deposed the crown prince, who is so good-natured.

381
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,930
You could never have done these things if you were human.

382
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:41,370
You were able to because you are a beast!

383
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,640
- Queen.
 - Don't look at me with those eyes.

384
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,540
I will never be fooled again.

385
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,980
Also, do not even set one foot toward the Main Hall ever again.

386
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,710
Do not even go near Grand Prince Do Seong, either.

387
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,020
And stop chasing after the crown prince.

388
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,380
If you try to harm my family again,

389
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,290
I will never forgive you.

390
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:17,520
Let us talk again later after you calm down.

391
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:28,810
Despite how weak I may be,

392
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,970
do not forget that I am this nation's mother!

393
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,920
 Your Highness. Your Highness! 

394
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,630
 - Your Highness! 
 - Summon a physician promptly. Hurry.

395
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,010
What are you saying?

396
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,440
You want to delay the crown prince investiture?

397
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,790
We have neither the royal seal nor the national seal.

398
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,690
How will we send the crown prince appointment letter without the national seal?

399
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,260
I said I will take care of that matter!

400
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,000
How will you do that when Her Highness is so determined?

401
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,050
Did you sleep well?

402
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,150
Did you get a comfortable sleep as well, Scholar sir?

403
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,120
Of course. What about your lady?

404
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:47,420
She did not get much sleep during the night. She is still sleeping.

405
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,780
What are you doing right now?

406
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,100
Isn't it obvious?

407
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,420
Stop it right now.

408
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,130
What are you doing right now?

409
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,280
You are still a patient, Scholar sir.

410
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,170
What if your wound got irritated?

411
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,420
Look at this! Are you an idiot?

412
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,330
Even so, "idiot" is too mean.

413
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,010
Are you a fool, then?

414
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,600
This will not do.

415
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,100
I will go buy some cotton cloth at the marketplace.

416
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,920
Come with me. Gosh ...

417
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,290
 Alert the government office right away if you see these men. 

418
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,440
This will not do.

419
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,670
How is it?

420
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:28,800
You cannot tell who I am unless you look closely, right?

421
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,260
One moment.

422
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:47,000
Your face is too pale and elegant for a servant.

423
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,290
I think we will have to cover it a bit.

424
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:55,900
My goodness. I mean, it is true I am quite handsome.

425
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,770
Baek Gu, you have good eyes.

426
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,810
Yes, sure.

427
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,830
What's the matter?

428
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:26,420
Do I look even more handsome up close?

429
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,000
It means you are pale because you stay in your room all day.

430
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,120
So please stay put.

431
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,120
This is why I told you to stay put.

432
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,600
Let me see that.

433
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,910
Will you put it on yourself?

434
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,230
What are you doing?

435
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,840
You are also too pretty for a servant.

436
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,780
You need to hide it.

437
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,640
You are blatantly flirting with her, saying she is pretty.

438
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:11,270
♫  Like a perenially blooming flower also newly blooms  ♫

439
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,740
 She looks like a different person, dressed up like that. 

440
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,090
I have to say she is pretty—

441
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,280
Young Master?

442
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,640
Huh?

443
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,160
Yes, what is it?

444
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:30,020
All right. Now that we switched our outfits,

445
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,340
Baek Gu and I will pretend to be a married couple from now on—

446
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,060
Hold on!

447
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,050
I do not think a married couple is a good idea.

448
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,390
That does not suit you.

449
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,860
- Sorry?
 - Rather than a married couple...

450
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,880
Yes, let's say you are siblings. That would be better.

451
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,620
That sounds more unnatural.

452
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,590
They look nothing alike.

453
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,640
- Exactly.
 - Hey, now.

454
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,080
Look beyond the stereotype that all siblings must look alike.

455
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,030
One can take after their father

456
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,380
- and the other can take after their mother.
 - Gosh.

457
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,720
A married couple still seems more natural than siblings.

458
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,500
Then, let's say he took the wrong medicine and ended up that way.

459
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,430
Wait, what's wrong with my face—

460
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,530
Be quiet.

461
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,220
We will say they're siblings. All right?

462
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,220
All right. Let's go.

463
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,300
We have a long way to go.

464
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,930
What a nice view.

465
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,790
Let's take a break here.

466
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,230
Should you be enjoying the view right now?

467
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,970
We should keep our minds at peace, especially at times like this.

468
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,490
It is coming my way!

469
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,880
Well, I need to light the fire!

470
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,290
Do it properly—

471
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,010
Gosh, I am dizzy.

472
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,890
 Hyeong, hurry up! 

473
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:04,460
 Hurry up, Hyeong! 

474
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,780
 You can go. 

475
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,590
 You're going to fall! 

476
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,780
 Geon and Yeong, be careful not to get hurt! 

477
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,440
 Yes, Mother! Don't worry! 

478
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,630
 Does it hurt? 

479
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,630
 You pushed me? Stop right there! 

480
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,560
 Go play over there. 

481
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,300
 You are going to scare all the fish away. 

482
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,500
 Let me catch you, and you will see! 

483
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,730
 Why, you little ...! 

484
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,220
 I am coming for you! 

485
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:07,640
 There! 

486
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,340
 There you go! 

487
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,680
 Come with me. 

488
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,740
 Put this down for a moment and come with me. 

489
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,280
 Let's go. 

490
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,530
 This is too fast. 

491
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,020
 Hold tight! 

492
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,450
Your son will ...

493
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,610
make sure to ...

494
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,340
I will make sure to put everything back in place.

495
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,390
Aigoo, I am so dizzy.

496
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,060
Why did you come alone?

497
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,640
I thought you went to get the young master.

498
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,400
I did not.

499
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,270
Oh, there he comes.

500
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:03,320
Aigoo, it is so cold. I am about to freeze to death.

501
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,730
It looks like you were really cold.

502
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,080
He even shed tears.

503
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,000
Gosh, I shed tears and have a runny nose when it gets too cold.

504
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,450
You never did. When did you?

505
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:28,690
Oh, right! We also need a name to call you by, Scholar sir.

506
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,340
- A name?
 - Yes.

507
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,240
A servant must have a name befitting a servant.

508
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,140
We cannot call you "scholar" in front of other people.

509
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,990
That is true.

510
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,210
A name, huh?

511
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,460
Since your face is yellow, it will be "Hwang" for yellow.

512
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,960
Hwang?

513
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,450
And your face is as round as a moon as well.

514
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,680
So, I will add "Gu" for "round."

515
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,540
Hwang Gu. How is Hwang Gu?

516
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,110
Hey!

517
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,210
Watch what you say, Hwang Gu!

518
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,450
People will hear you.

519
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,920
Yes, madam.

520
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,370
Should we spend the night over there, tonight?

521
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:59,550
It looks like a cabin used by herbalists and hunters.

522
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:04,510
We even slept in a cave. This is not so bad.

523
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,490
Stop pushing.

524
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,520
We will stick to each other.

525
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,320
You already saw everything about each other.

526
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,500
Why are you acting like strangers now?

527
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:45,020
She only saw my chest while treating my wound.

528
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,350
Yes.

529
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,080
She even saw your chest,

530
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,110
so what if your butts are touching?

531
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,950
I can hear you.

532
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:04,610
Usually, It is the generous nature of the superiors to pretend not to hear anything

533
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:10,940
even if they hear their subordinates complain.

534
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,870
You can say that again!

535
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:29,540
T-The rice cakes are about to burn.

536
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,500
What are you doing? She said the rice cakes are almost burning.

537
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,310
Oh, yes.

538
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,280
- Did you hear that?
 - What about it?

539
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,540
- She said, "That is it!"
 - I told you to be careful!

540
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,700
It came out accidentally. 
    

541
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:55,060
They are cooking well.

542
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,420
Did you find one?

543
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,370
Yes, there is one down by the village.

544
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,220
But wouldn't it be too dangerous?

545
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,430
We need to first save her life, right?

546
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,040
What do I do?

547
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,290
Her entire body is on fire.

548
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,310
I am coming in.

549
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,190
She cannot even open her eyes now.

550
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,920
We need a physician to—

551
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,500
I will carry her on my back.

552
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,380
I will carry her.

553
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:31,350
It is fine. Go down first and be on the lookout.

554
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,360
 Clinic 

555
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:23,130
She just caught a severe cold. So don't worry too much.

556
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,940
However, she is weak from the cold.

557
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:34,150
She might get worse if she overexerts herself.

558
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:37,580
I would recommend that she rest for a few days.

559
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,580
It seems you are not from around here.

560
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,200
Do you have a place to stay?

561
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,450
Fabricate?

562
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:58,740
Are you saying you will fabricate the royal seal and the national seal?

563
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,270
What if someone finds out?

564
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,770
Which is why we must do it without anyone knowing.

565
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,520
Even so, if we get caught,

566
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,680
we will be charged with treason.

567
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,490
This is ...

568
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,400
I do not think this is right, Your Excellency.

569
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,750
Do not worry.

570
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:23,480
After Grand Prince Do Seong is invested as the crown prince,

571
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,990
who would dare to raise issues about this matter?

572
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,080
Even if it becomes an issue,

573
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,030
do you think Her Highness will just sit by and watch?

574
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:40,160
It is about her child.

575
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,060
She will have to hand over the royal seal.

576
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,990
If you understand, do not worry about useless things.

577
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:53,260
You just go and capture the deposed crown prince.

578
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,630
As soon as the crown prince investiture takes place,

579
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:03,450
I plan to take in Choi Sang Rok's daughter as the crown princess.

580
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:08,600
I told you I will not become the crown prince until Father recovers his health!

581
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,630
Stop throwing a tantrum.

582
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:15,840
Did you forget how His Majesty became the king?

583
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,400
The queen dowager and Choi Sang Rok might ally with another royal descendant

584
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,790
and frame us all.

585
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:25,850
While the queen dowager is governing by regency,

586
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:31,150
remember that your safety, as well as Her Highness'

587
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:36,610
and His Majesty's, is in Choi Sang Rok's hands.

588
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,120
Whether you like it or not,

589
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,950
you must take in Choi Sang Rok's daughter as the crown princess.

590
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,970
D-Do you have no appetite?

591
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:17,970
Yes. You can eat up.

592
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,860
I will go and take a look, so you do not need to follow me.

593
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:41,550
C-Can you leave me just half?

594
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,370
You can take some first.

595
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,520
Oh Wol, I want water—

596
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,560
Scholar sir.

597
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,720
Scholar sir.

598
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,060
Baek Gu.

599
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,100
Get him!

600
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,640
Get him!

601
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:28,950


602
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:36,140
♫  If I wait, how much longer until I can see you??  ♫

603
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:43,410
♫  Will you be there after this night?  ♫

604
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:50,670
♫  Will I be able to meet you again someday?  ♫

605
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:59,010
♫  Like the faint moonlight there which waxes before you know it  ♫

606
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,250
 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview  

607
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,290
 They arrested the deposed crown prince. 

608
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:05,610
 Do you think this matter will be forgotten with my death? 

609
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:08,850
-  Is it the royal seal? 
 -  This is fake. 

610
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,270
 We will commence the crown prince investiture. 

611
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,440
 I will just follow you, Scholar sir. 

612
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,580
 Do not follow me. Come with me. 

613
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,440
 Are you not interested in becoming the crown prince? 

614
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,410
 These are all petitons asking that the Grand Prince Do Seong be punished. 

615
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:24,420
 When my fury consumes everyone who lives in that house, 

616
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,930
 I hope she will not be there. 

617
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:31,910
♫   Destroy it. Because I think it's a wind filled with longing coming to me.  ♫
