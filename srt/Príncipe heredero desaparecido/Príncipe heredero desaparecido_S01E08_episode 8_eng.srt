 Episode 8 

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,850
Young Master.

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,040
Gab Seok.

14
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,570
Young Master.

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,780
Your Highness. Your Highness!

16
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,450
 (Let's run off now. What do you say?) 

17
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,820
 (We cannot.) 

18
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,550
 (When can we escape if not now?) 

19
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,130
 (I said we cannot, did I not?) 

20
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,980
 (Arghhhh!) 

21
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,330
Aigoo! Aigoo, I am dying!

22
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,250
Your Highness.

23
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,910
What are you doing? Stand them back up!

24
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,470
 Yes! 

25
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,290
What is this?

26
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,940
Scholar sir.

27
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,170
- Let's go. 
 - What about my lady?

28
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,500
- O-Oh Wol— 
 - Now is not the time.

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,120
Gab Seok has your lady.

30
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,330
You chase them. The rest of you, come with me!

31
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,160
 Yes! 

32
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,000
 Clinic 

33
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,350
I am sorry for bringing a sick person to a place like this.

34
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,860
I could not think of anywhere else that would be as safe.

35
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,610
I am sure you came back here because they would not even guess

36
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,990
you would have hidden here again.

37
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,930
Wait here for a moment.

38
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,050
Come here.

39
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,070
How are you feeling?

40
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,290
I am fine.

41
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,860
I am sure Gab Seok safely ran away with your lady.

42
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,340
So don't worry too much.

43
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,690
You also saw how fast he was, right?

44
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,740
To be honest, he is also better at martial arts than I am.

45
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,850
Is it too cold?

46
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,010
I am fine.

47
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,590
I am sorry to be a bother.

48
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,360
Get some sleep.

49
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,740
I will take a break, too.

50
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,120
Gosh, are you a dog that needs to poop or something?

51
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,730
What?

52
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,610
I cannot hear myself think, so please stay put.

53
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,880
I am doing this because I cannot stay put.

54
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,540
Do you think I am sitting still because I am at peace?

55
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,040
I am more upset than I look right now.

56
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,530
Am I the one who told you to come along?

57
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,780
Who are you blaming here?

58
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,050
Why do you think Oh Wol got sick?

59
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,330
The cave and then a shitty cabin like this—

60
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,280
Did I tell you to come along?

61
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,720
You kept clinging to us when we told you to go back!

62
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,220
Clinging to you?

63
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,770
Do you think we wanted to?

64
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,910
Why did you come along, then?

65
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,830
Because I did not know you were ruffians who kidnap women!

66
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,360
Am I the only one who kidnapped someone?

67
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,850
Your father started it first!

68
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,910
Your father not only kidnapped my young master.

69
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,720
H-He also tried to kill him, too!

70
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,870
If we are ruffians, your father is a murderer!

71
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,800
Your hands are ice cold.

72
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,280
Baek Gu, can you hear me?

73
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,910
♫  In a long memory  ♫

74
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:40,220
♫  I'm searching for you, blurry in the distance   ♫

75
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,560
♫  Where is all the longing  ♫

76
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,530
♫  deeply etched in my heart and lingering in the time past  ♫

77
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,600
♫  where could it be?  ♫

78
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:05,100
♫  I am wandering like a lost child  ♫

79
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,370
♫  You are too far away  ♫

80
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,890
♫  for me to get closer  ♫

81
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:25,040
♫  So that I can touch you at the tip of the passing breeze  ♫

82
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,030
♫  I’m going to walk towards you  ♫

83
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,210
♫  wherever you are  ♫

84
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,570
♫  Inside the memory of the past  ♫

85
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:54,740
♫  The blurred moments come and hurt  ♫

86
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,200
♫  Will I miss all the longing which remains deep in my heart  ♫

87
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,340
♫  even the loneliness?  ♫

88
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,800
 It will also be hard for you. 

89
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,290
 Will you be all right? 

90
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,690
♫  I am wandering like a lost child  ♫

91
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:26,310
♫  You are too far away for me to get closer  ♫

92
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,420
 What pained you so much, Scholar sir? 

93
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,370
 Was it my father? 

94
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,380
 I want to be by your side. 

95
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,290
 Though I am feeble, let me remain as Baek Gu, the servant 

96
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,110
 and be of help to you. 

97
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,440
 I probably cannot be forgiven, 

98
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,130
 but just let me stay by your side. 

99
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:01,400
♫  I want to be in the time we can't return to  ♫

100
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,460
♫  Forget all the dark days  ♫

101
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,320
♫  You are too far away  ♫

102
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,740
♫  for me to get closer  ♫

103
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,760
♫  So that I can touch you at the tip of the passing breeze  ♫

104
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,850
♫  I will walk towards you  ♫

105
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,780
♫  You are too far away  ♫

106
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:45,180
♫  for me to get closer  ♫

107
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,600
♫  You are the only one for me  ♫

108
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,700
How are you feeling? Are you still cold?

109
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,580
No, I'm not. I feel a lot better.

110
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,330
I apologize.

111
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,660
It is fine now that you feel better.

112
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,910
Do you still intend to come with me?

113
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,090
- Pardon? 
 - You almost died last night.

114
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,640
You could face danger again, so—

115
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,090
I will come with you.

116
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,660
If you agree,

117
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,730
I want to talk to your lady and take you out of servitude.

118
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,470
What do you think?

119
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,190
I am saying this because your talent is too good.

120
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:06,140
If you are no longer a servant, you can live freely, doing what you want.

121
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,370
Fortunately, I have enough wealth to make that happen.

122
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,740
So tell me if you are interested.

123
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,030
I am thankful for the offer,

124
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,290
but we need to get out of this place and find those two.

125
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,180
I don't think it is the time to think about my status.

126
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,740
Could I tell you about it later?

127
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,880
You are right.

128
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,580
Do you think you can move?

129
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,200
Yes.

130
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,090
Should we not look for the royal seal?

131
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,160
The crown prince's investiture cannot happen without the royal seal—

132
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,870
We need to delay the crown prince investiture as much as possible.

133
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,230
The Left State Councillor is capable of killing His Majesty

134
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:20,460
if Grand Prince Do Seong is proclaimed as the crown prince, in order to make him the king.

135
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,570
Do you believe what the deposed crown prince said?

136
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes, that's why

137
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,470
I'm not looking for the royal seal.

138
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,720
If we are to safely escape the palace as we planned—

139
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,850
 Your Highness, the Left State Councillor has arrived. 

140
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,900
Let him enter.

141
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,080
Is that the royal seal?

142
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,110
Did the queen give it back?

143
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,640
Are you mocking Her Highness?

144
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,390
This is fake.

145
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,370
So what if it is fake?

146
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:54,380
If Her Highness the Queen Dowager says this is the royal seal, it will be so.

147
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,390
The royal seal is one thing.

148
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,980
What about the national seal? 
  (Bestowed by the Chinese emperor) 

149
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,170
If they find out the national seal is fake when the crown prince's investiture letter is sent,

150
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,350
how are you going to handle the emperor's wrath?

151
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,880
What do you suggest we do, then?

152
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,860
Shall we all die together?

153
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,590
I have bet my life on this matter.

154
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,000
It seems that the two of you did not.

155
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,480
If things go wrong, we will die as traitors anyway.

156
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,730
I am prepared to die after a sword fight with all my might.

157
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,400
Would you like to see me give it a try?

158
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,880
The Gwansanggam has stated 
  (Joseon's agency that observed the weather and constellations.) 

159
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,580
that the first day of next month will be an auspicious day.

160
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,780
On that day, the crown prince's investiture will take place.

161
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,180
This is a joyous event where Joseon's lineage will be continued.

162
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,620
You are to set up the Investiture Agency promptly 
  (Temporary agency to oversee the investiture ceremony) 

163
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,960
and thoroughly prepare to welcome the nation's heir.

164
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,780
 Yes, Your Highness! 

165
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,540
What is the matter?

166
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,080
Your Highness, this is Court Lady Jo!

167
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,960
Congratulations, Your Highness.

168
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,330
The crown prince investiture date has been set.

169
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,780
Are you sure?

170
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:45,110
Yes, the mayor of Hanyang went to escort the grand prince right now.

171
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,230
Your Highness, is something wrong?

172
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,270
 Please die. 

173
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,210
 If I die as you order, Left State Councillor, 

174
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,200
 Father would be the next one. 

175
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,440
 Am I wrong? 

176
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,360
 Because as long as Father is alive, 

177
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,580
 Do Seong cannot become the king. 

178
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,100
Sir Magistrate, the criminals are here.

179
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,170
 I need to see them in private. Send them in! 

180
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,110
Pardon?

181
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,020
Oh, yes!

182
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,920
Leave the criminals here and get out!

183
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,590
Pardon?

184
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,260
I told you to get out. What are you waiting for?

185
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
Gab Seok!

186
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,330
Are you injured at all?

187
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,890
I am fine.

188
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,210
How did you know we would get arrested?

189
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,260
Before that, how did you come in here?

190
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,140
I came in last night when no one was here.

191
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,080
Does that mean you were hiding here all night?

192
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,600
Yes.

193
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,680
I waited, suppressing my sleepiness,

194
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,480
and as soon as this...

195
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,480
magistrate came in,

196
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,180
I took him hostage.

197
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,820
You saved me again. Thank you.

198
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,350
There is another door this way.

199
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,810
Let's go, Young Master.

200
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,160
Well, what about my lady?

201
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,930
- That man is... 
 - He is Choi Sang Rok's right-hand man.

202
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,950
Is he?

203
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,310
Yes.

204
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,840
I will just follow Scholar sir.

205
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,010
Please just leave!

206
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,950
Because of you—

207
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,050
I will make sure not to cause any problems.

208
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,870
Rather, I will be of help.

209
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,540
- What help? 
 - I grew up with that orabeoni like siblings.

210
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,880
You can use me as a hostage if necessary.

211
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,990
The scholar's wound!

212
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,870
What if it gets infected again?

213
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,560
I should be by his side to treat it right away.

214
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,830
I am also good at fighting.

215
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,810
I learned martial arts from that orabeoni.

216
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,390
I can easily take on a few men.

217
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,940
Please let me follow you.

218
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,160
Do not follow me.

219
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,180
Come with me...

220
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,690
- Baek Gu. 
 - Young Master.

221
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,640
Thank you, Hwang Gu.

222
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,270
Scholar sir.

223
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,320
So where did you hide it?

224
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,200
Oh, you are really amazing.

225
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,970
How did you know you would get arrested?

226
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,000
We cannot afford to lose this.

227
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,280
Hence, I prepared for the worst.

228
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,380
You prepare for the worst,

229
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,630
yet you are trying to take that girl with us?

230
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,200
She is the royal physician's servant.

231
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,900
- Even if she is only a servant— 
 - Yes, a servant.

232
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,410
Regardless of her will, she was born as somebody's servant

233
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,550
and that somebody just had to be Choi Sang Rok.

234
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,400
That is not her crime, is it?

235
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,190
Gab Seok,

236
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,570
I am going to get my revenge for sure.

237
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,240
I am going to take everything Choi Sang Rok has

238
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,680
and crush him to the ground.

239
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,750
When my wrath consumes everyone who lives in that house,

240
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,640
I sincerely hope that girl will not be there.

241
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,920
When I wipe out Choi Sang Rok,

242
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,290
I don't want that girl to get swept away and die with him.

243
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,160
Do you like Baek Gu that much?

244
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,110
What have you heard? That's not what I mean—

245
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,970
Whether it is or isn't, let's take her with us.

246
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,700
That is all we need to do, right?

247
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,310
Just put this on your back.

248
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,090
Let's go.

249
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:20,400
Baek Gu is waiting for us.

250
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:27,520
Please get on the palanquin.

251
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,140
Why? Are you scared I will refuse to go?

252
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,890
You come with me.

253
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,850
- Me, too? 
 - Yes.

254
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,980
You always said how envious you are of Gab Dol, right?

255
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,790
Get a rank while we are at it.

256
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,490
Aigoo, thank you so much, Grand Prince!

257
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,740
Would it be all right to do that?

258
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,400
Once you get on the throne, the entire country of Joseon will be yours.

259
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,910
A mere bodyguard position is not a big deal.

260
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,280
Please do as you wish.

261
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,520
In that case, forget the palanquin, since it is too stifling.

262
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,810
Let's ride the horses.

263
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,190
However, there are rules on how to welcome the crown prince in the palace.

264
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,700
You told me to do as I wish.

265
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,470
Were you just saying that?

266
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,300
 Stand back! 

267
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:36,320
This is Grand Prince Do Seong! Hear ye!

268
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,350
Stand back!

269
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:44,600
This is Grand Prince Do Seong! Hear ye!

270
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,460
Stand back!

271
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:53,140
This is Grand Prince Do Seong! Hear ye!

272
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,380
Stand back!

273
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,040
This is Grand Prince Do Seong!

274
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,860
 Being the crown prince is not a bed of roses. 

275
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,390
 That's what I'm talking about. 

276
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,470
 But surprisingly, you have not said you would quit. 

277
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,590
 They say my suffering alone will grant peace to the people of Joseon. 

278
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,020
 How could I quit? 

279
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,360
 You little... ! I am your brother. 

280
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,180
This is Grand Prince Do Seong! Hear ye!

281
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,320
Stand back!

282
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,900
This is Grand Prince Do Seong!

283
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,220
It seems that the plum tree will blossom early this year, Your Highness.

284
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,960
There is a time for everything.

285
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,740
I am worried it will wither lifelessly, for it bloomed in a rush.

286
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,650
Please don't be concerned.

287
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:12,100
I am sure it is doing its best to repay you for your efforts.

288
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,380
It seems to need sunlight.

289
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,390
Let it sit in the sun for a while.

290
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,330
Yes, Your Highness.

291
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,550
Is this the plum tree the queen dowager cherishes

292
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,460
as if it were Grand Prince Gwang Chang?

293
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,130
Yes.

294
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,250
Let me see it.

295
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,680
May I ask why?

296
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:03,170
I thought anything and everything you touch was destroyed, Queen Dowager.

297
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,960
But this one miraculously survived.

298
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,360
Please give it to me.

299
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,760
Her Highness especially cherishes it.

300
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,990
Is that so?

301
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,210
I thought you only knew of affairs between men and women.

302
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,110
But I guess you have affection for a tree, too.

303
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,070
You are speaking out of line!

304
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,760
Out of line?

305
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,180
Did you say I am out of line?

306
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,820
What are you doing right now?

307
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,720
She easily dared to frame the crown prince, the heir of our nation,

308
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,030
so I thought Court Lady Kim was too brazen and thick-skinned to bleed.

309
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,840
I guess I must have been mistaken.

310
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,970
Now that I am back in the palace, I will visit you often.

311
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,230
I will see you again.

312
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,430
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

313
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,180
It is a small cut, so please do not worry.

314
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,610
He is intentionally doing this to make you angry.

315
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,250
Please do not let him affect your mind.

316
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,330
If it bothers you, I will speak to the Left State Councillor.

317
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,060
Did you want to see me?

318
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,120
You heard the governor of Mokcheon sent a messenger, right?

319
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,330
Yes.

320
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,570
Since the prince is headed south,

321
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,990
he must be going to his maternal grandfather in Mungyeong.

322
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,630
I believe we already sent a messenger to Mungyeong.

323
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,290
Come on!

324
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,110
Do you think I do not know?

325
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,910
I am telling you because just arresting him is not enough.

326
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,390
Y-You mean...

327
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,960
I will take care of the aftermath.

328
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,520
Aigoo, y-you will get hurt!

329
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,870
Aigoo, what is going on?

330
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:10,420
Go back to Mu Baek right now and tell him to go to Mungyeong.

331
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,010
Yes.

332
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,810
Is Myeong Yun...

333
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,320
all right?

334
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,990
Yes, Master.

335
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,920
Did that man try to harm her to get revenge?

336
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,890
No, those men think I am the lady.

337
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,850
What about you, then?

338
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,760
Nothing happened to you, either?

339
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,190
Yes, I am fine as well.

340
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,360
How was she...

341
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,230
in your opinion?

342
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,920
What do you mean?

343
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,470
Did Myeong Yun really run away from home to evade the crown princess selection?

344
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,050
Yes.

345
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,740
She said she would be back as soon as the marriage prohibition was over.

346
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,240
By chance, is the deposed—

347
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,630
Never mind.

348
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,770
 Your teachers have arrived. 

349
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,780
What brings you here?

350
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,160
Is there a reason you are not coming to your classes?

351
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,400
I fell asleep.

352
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,390
T-These darned books are the best for putting you to sleep.

353
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,750
How can you treat books that contain valuable words of saints like that?

354
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,400
Is our country in this sorry state because we were

355
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,160
so respectful towards those words from saints?

356
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,800
I am joking!

357
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,890
Since you seem to be curious about a peaceful world,

358
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:39,010
we will discuss peaceful times during tomorrow's class.

359
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,530
Whatever you say.

360
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,600
Also, you seem to find it inconvenient to come all the way to Yeonghwadang,

361
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,680
so we will come to the Crown Prince's palace tomorrow.

362
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,240
What is the matter?

363
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,410
Your Highness, this is Jung Yeong!

364
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,840
Move aside!

365
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,300
What is going on?

366
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,710
W-What is he—

367
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,350
What are you doing? Stop him right now!

368
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,120
W-What on earth—

369
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,210
Should we make everyone leave instead?

370
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,410
That sounds good.

371
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,700
Everyone, leave at once!

372
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,630
What are you all waiting for? Make everyone leave

373
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,230
and close the crown prince's palace gates! Hurry!

374
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,280
 In the case that I end up coming back to the palace, 

375
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,940
 we will no longer be brothers. We will be enemies. 

376
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,390
 Still, I cannot leave you to die. 

377
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,370
 You must stay strong, Brother. 

378
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,160
 I am going to do my best to protect my family. 

379
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,180
 You stay strong, too. 

380
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,700
 You are so light! 

381
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,680
Please punish Grand Prince Do Seong for violating the virtues of Confucianism!

382
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,790
 Please punish him! 

383
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,250
Please punish Grand Prince Do Seong for violating the virtues of Confucianism!

384
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,260
 Please punish him! 

385
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,620
These are all petitions asking that the Grand Prince Do Seong be punished.

386
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,670
Never, since the establishment of Joseon, has such a devastating event occurred

387
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,290
and there will never be one in the future.

388
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,050
Since His Majesty is still bedridden,

389
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,280
the grand prince must have been extremely frustrated.

390
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,200
Though it was not the right way,

391
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,730
you could understand it as the result of sincere filial piety.

392
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,890
The grand prince will soon become the crown prince.

393
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,800
He should be the role model for all nobles in this country.

394
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,260
But he is basically insulting all nobles who are studying Confucianism!

395
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,640
What the censor said is right.

396
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,300
He should refrain from superstition and shamanism that seduce people's minds.

397
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,110
However, he brought a shaman to the sacred palace.

398
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,090
Please calm down.

399
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:13,050
I will have the grand prince promise me not to do such a thing again.

400
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,110
I would like to let this incident slide.

401
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:22,380
However, Your Highness, the grand prince is even skipping his classes.

402
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,560
I heard the grand prince even harassed a palace lady at the queen dowager's palace.

403
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,530
Is that true?

404
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,420
Your Highness, I, Kim Dae Seung, implore you with my life on the line!

405
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:41,590
Please cancel the crown prince investiture for Grand Prince Do Seong!

406
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,690
 Do not look at me with those eyes. 

407
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,400
 I will never be fooled again. 

408
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,890
 You dared to harm His Majesty by using his own wife, on top of that! 

409
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,720
 You framed and deposed the crown prince, who is so good-natured.. 

410
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,920
 But I cannot do so because my guts churn every time I see your face. 

411
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,040
 If things go wrong, we will die as traitors anyway. 

412
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,510
 Shut your mouth! 

413
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,490
 The moment you had an affair with Choi Sang Rok, 

414
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,430
 you were only a lewd wench who is mad for men, not the Queen Dowager. 

415
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,070
 Do you think I cannot strike you? 

416
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,470
 - Kill me.  
  - If we are to safely escape the palace as we planned... 

417
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,090
 Were all the moments you interacted with me thus far 

418
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:38,890
 entirely pretenses and lies? 

419
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:43,360
 You could never have done these things if you were human. 

420
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,580
 You were able to because you are a beast! 

421
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,760
Is it that hard on you?

422
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:18,010
I do not know who I am anymore.

423
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,650
How did I end up like this?

424
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,360
How did I become such a vicious wench?

425
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,660
No, you did not change at all.

426
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,420
If you had changed, you would not be suffering like this.

427
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,780
I vividly remember.

428
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,320
You coming to Dosoram to find me.

429
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:50,530
You are... still the... same person you were back then.

430
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,250
 I am sorry... 

431
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,110
 and I'm grateful to you. 

432
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,350
 It will be over soon. 

433
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:27,060
 So, please wait a bit longer. 

434
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,370
 Orabeoni. 

435
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,950
 I will pass the state exams for sure this time. 

436
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:34,970
 I will marry you and make sure... 

437
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:39,400
 to repay you for the debt I owe you for what you have done for me. 

438
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,490
 Although we have not officially married yet, 

439
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:56,330
 I've considered you my husband for a long time now. 

440
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,900
 I thought you felt the same as me. 

441
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,950
 But I must have been mistaken. 

442
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,640
 How could that be? 

443
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,420
 Don't you know I have considered you my woman 

444
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,850
 since the moment I started to have feelings for you? 

445
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,140
 Then, how could you say you will repay me, as if we were strangers? 

446
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,920
 I only did my duty as your wife. 

447
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,770
 I am going to go back now. 

448
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,990
 I must have said something wrong again. 

449
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,450
 That is not what I meant. 

450
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,730
 Did I make you upset? 

451
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,660
 Next time, I will be the one who'll come to find you. 

452
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,790
 Wearing an official hat with winter jasmine on my head, 

453
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,910
 with the Four Pillars Letter on my back, 
 (Letter with his written fortune which serves as a marriage proposal) 

454
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,800
 I will knock on the gates of your house. 

455
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:05,780
 Four Pillars of fortune: year, month, day, and hour of birth were used to predict the future of the person 

456
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,470
 Orabeoni. 

457
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,940
 It is not too late to hurry the wedding. 

458
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,890
 I told you before. 

459
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,690
 Unless you want to lose Maiden Su Ryeon, 

460
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:50,250
 you should marry her right away. 

461
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,800
 I will marry her. Once I pass this state exam— 

462
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,640
 If you fail, are you not going to marry her? 

463
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,040
 I am going to pass for sure. 

464
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,250
 If you are going to pass anyway, 

465
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,920
 it does not matter if you marry her first. 

466
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,960
 The state exam is coming up soon. 

467
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,210
 Could something possibly happen in those few days? 

468
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:20,510
 Bad events come to you like thieves at night! 

469
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:29,090
 If you delay it further, you might lose Maiden Su Ryeon forever! 

470
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,670
 Our Young Master will have to pass the state exam. 

471
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,610
 Sounds lovely. 

472
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,520
 Though she is a new queen consort, she is still a queen. 

473
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,730
 I will have to go through the formalities and steps. Right? 

474
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:56,560
 Your Majesty, you looked fondly upon my lowly daughter and visited us in person. 

475
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,420
 I am so overwhelmed with gratitude that I cannot bear it. 

476
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:07,480
 But my daughter already has a man whom she promised to marry. 

477
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,570
 Oh, is that so? 

478
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:29,790
 What are you doing? Hurry up and greet His Majesty. 

479
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,370
 Yes. 

480
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:49,060
 Aigoo, the ground is cold. 

481
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:54,420
 I am satisfied with having seen your face today. 

482
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,260
 So, skip the protocol. 

483
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,140
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

484
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:22,690
 Look into that girl's betrothed. 

485
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,190
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

486
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,340
 Let us go! 

487
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,380
 My Lady. 

488
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,780
 Should you not inform Young Master, at least? 

489
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,850
 The state exam is right around the corner. 

490
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,100
 My Lady, still... 

491
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,390
 Even if Orabeoni finds out right now, 

492
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:53,100
 what can he possibly do? 

493
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:58,870
 It might only disturb him, and he could lose ten years of his efforts. 

494
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,670
 What are you going to do now? 

495
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,570
 For now, I will have to wait it out somehow... 

496
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,700
 until the state exams end. 

497
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:30,140
 All hail His Majesty! 

498
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,720
 Young Master! 

499
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,740
 Young Master! 

500
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,010
 What brings you here? 

501
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:18,740
 The royal decree told her to send her Four Pillars Letter by today. 

502
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,900
 But it is all over once her Four Pillars letter is sent. 

503
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,270
 What do we do? 

504
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:29,250
 Bad events come to you like thieves at night! 

505
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:35,000
 If you delay it further, you might lose Maiden Su Ryeon forever! 

506
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,070
 - Orabeoni. 
 - Yes. 

507
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:14,590
 You have to go before anyone sees you. 

508
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:05,320
 You deserve to die for having dared 

509
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,480
 to mock me and steal what is mine! 

510
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:14,040
 You already know your crime! 

511
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:20,540
 This humble one has never stolen or sought after someone else's things. 

512
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:26,760
 This family's daughter is my beloved whom I have loved for a long time 

513
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,430
 as well as my betrothed, whom I have promised to marry. 

514
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,640
 How dare you! 

515
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,940
 - Twist the criminal's legs! 
 - Yes! 

516
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,110
 My Lady! 

517
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,220
 Your Majesty! 

518
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,100
 Please spare him, Your Majesty! 

519
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,040
 Su Ryeon, do not do this. Go back! 

520
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,540
 Your Majesty, he has not done anything wrong. 

521
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,460
 It is all my doing. 

522
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,600
 Stop! I told you to stop! 

523
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,810
 Do I have to bite my tongue to make you go back? 

524
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,530
 His mouth is still uttering words. 

525
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,890
 What are you all doing? 

526
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,370
 Your Majesty! 

527
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,770
 This lowly one was foolish and committed a grave sin. 

528
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,900
 Please have compassion. 

529
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,500
 Just for once, please have mercy. 

530
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:38,130
 Please spare that man's life. 

531
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,640
 Spare his life? 

532
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,860
 If I spare his life, 

533
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:16,750
 what will you do for me in return? 

534
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,220
 Your Majesty! 

535
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,350
 The criminal is here. 

536
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,660
 Take them off. 

537
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,350
 Su Ryeon! 

538
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,300
 - Su Ryeon. 
 - Stand back! 

539
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,510
 Su Ryeon. 

540
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:10,820
 Stand back! 

541
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,060
 Orabeoni! 

542
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,460
 - Get out of the way! 
 - Su Ryeon. 

543
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,270
 Orabeoni! 

544
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,550
 Su Ryeon. 

545
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,520
 Orabeoni! 

546
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,400
 Su Ryeon. 

547
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,090
 Su Ryeon. 

548
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,720
 Orabeoni. 

549
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,560
 - Su Ryeon. 
 - Orabeoni. 

550
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,610
 Su Ryeon. Su Ryeon! 

551
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,960
 Su Ryeon. 

552
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,890
 Su Ryeon. 

553
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,860
 Orabeoni. 

554
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,530
 Su Ryeon. 

555
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,440
 Su Ryeon. 

556
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,400
 Orabeoni. 

557
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:33,010
 When I met you again after a long time passed, 

558
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:38,850
 if you had changed, I would have given up on you. 

559
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,310
 It's because you are still the same as back then, 

560
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,800
 that I am staying by your side. 

561
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,690
Orabeoni.

562
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,410
How could you do such a thing?

563
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:16,910
Aren't you interested in becoming the crown prince?

564
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,950
Is everything you told me the other day all lies?

565
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,530
Listen now, Mayor.

566
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:28,990
- Yes. 
 - Why must I become the crown prince by getting filth all over my body?

567
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,990
Filth, you say?

568
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:34,160
What do you mean by that?

569
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,050
The royal seal is fake.

570
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:40,600
The national seal is also fake.

571
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,590
Even if we somehow make it work for now,

572
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:46,530
if anyone objects to my legitimacy

573
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:49,450
and the emperor ends up hearing about it,

574
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:52,070
how would I look?

575
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:55,580
You are bound to choke when you eat in a rush.

576
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,800
Anyway, after the deposed crown prince is eliminated,

577
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:05,810
who else can become the king besides me in this country?

578
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,500
Listen to me now.

579
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:20,660
I do not want the slightest speck of dust on my path to the throne.

580
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:26,110
I failed to understand your deeper thoughts

581
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:31,600
and ended up being hasty and foolish.

582
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:37,440
Mayor, please, stop having those useless worries

583
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,170
and go find the deposed crown prince as quickly as possible!

584
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,530
   

585
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,270
This is an edict from the queen dowager.

586
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:57,760
   

587
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,510
- Depart now! 
  - Yes! 

588
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:09,890
 Palace Gate 

589
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,050
Hear ye!

590
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,230
Hear ye!

591
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,010
Grandfather!

592
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,940
This is Geon.

593
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,890
Geon is here.

594
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,860
Grandfather.

595
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,010
Your Highness.

596
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,110
 Your Highness? 

597
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:57,920
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

598
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:10,940
How hard must it have been for you?

599
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:19,950


600
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:30,500
♫  although I am about to go somewhere    ♫

601
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:37,780
♫  Our fate flows like running water  ♫

602
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:42,930
♫  You must follow the fate given to you  ♫

603
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:48,280
♫  The red thread continues in repeated lives  ♫

604
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,020
♫  I want to dive into the water  ♫

605
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,880
♫  where the bright light above is intensifying. As for me now  ♫

606
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,390
 Missing Crown Prince 
 Preview 

607
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:05,620
 I am Myeong Yun, the daughter of the royal physician who kidnapped you. 

608
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:08,720
 Do not ever mention your father to me. 

609
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,560
 His Majesty is in a critical state. 

610
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,750
 Choi Sang Rok is the only one who can cure him. 

611
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,350
 I decided to become the crown prince as they wish. 

612
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:21,650
 Please forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye. 

613
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:24,900
 Traitor Yi Geon, you are under arrest! 

614
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,400
 The deposed crown prince has been captured.
