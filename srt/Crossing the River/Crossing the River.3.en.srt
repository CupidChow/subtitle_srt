1
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,083
Welcome.

2
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,041
Hello, do you have a reservation?

3
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,625
This person,

4
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,166
does he live here?

5
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,041
Yes.

6
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,708
May I ask, what is your relationship with him?

7
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,500
He is my fiancé.

8
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,208
Has anyone come to see him recently?

9
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,750
No one has really come to see him.

10
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,083
Oh.

11
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,958
There was a man about his age

12
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,166
who came to see him a few times.

13
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,916
This gentleman

14
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,000
looks familiar.

15
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,291
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

16
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,208
Yes, we've met.

17
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,375
At Jinling Hotel.

18
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,375
I apologize for that day.

19
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,291
I accidentally bumped into your handbag.

20
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,666
Sorry for the rudeness.

21
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,333
No wonder you look so familiar.

22
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,250
I knew I'd seen you somewhere.

23
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,791
Pleased to meet you.

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,500
You didn't do it on purpose.

25
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:49,583
It's all right.

26
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:54,958
Jinling Fuhai Machinery Factory.

27
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:55,791
Zhao Jiaqi.

28
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,750
I appreciate your support.

29
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,916
Teacher at Jinling Women's College.

30
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:00,875
Xia Yuying.

31
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:02,833
Boss Zhao.

32
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,791
An industrialist.

33
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:04,916
I admire you.

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,833
Oh, it's just a small business.

35
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:08,833
Teacher Xia.

36
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:09,583
Please have a seat.

37
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,541
Given the current situation,

38
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,041
running a business must be tough.

39
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,875
Times are chaotic.

40
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,125
Business is hard.

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,125
It's very difficult.

42
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:27,875
I was thinking,

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,833
maybe I could visit your factory someday.

44
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,166
to learn a thing or two.

45
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,708
Would that be convenient for you, Boss Zhao?

46
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:35,791
Of course.

47
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,041
Miss Xia, your visit would be an honor.

48
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,500
You're welcome anytime.

49
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:44,875
Boss,

50
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:45,916
we should go.

51
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,375
Right now.

52
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,333
I'm very sorry, Miss Xia.

53
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:54,333
I must excuse myself.

54
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,541
I'll be at Fuhai

55
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,041
waiting for your visit.

56
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,291
Goodbye.

57
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:15,583
Farewell.

58
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,375
Waiter,

59
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,291
I'd like a cup of coffee.

60
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:58,791
The 79th Division

61
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,791
can be contacted now.

62
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:02,291
Yes.

63
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,791
I heard Commander Wang has been feeling more lost lately.

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,875
We need to strike while the iron is hot.

65
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,208
Actively work for it.

66
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:10,708
Mm.

67
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,875
Commander Wang’s 79th Division

68
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,625
is part of the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang).

69
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,250
It’s a major division.

70
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,875
Cooperating with him

71
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,125
is very important.

72
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,583
I’ve made some preparations.

73
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,458
I bought two northeastern wild ginseng roots.

74
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,208
And I got a black pearl necklace for his wife.

75
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:28,625
I

76
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,250
hope to get closer to them soon.

77
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:31,916
So we can work together as soon as possible.

78
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:32,833
Mm.

79
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,541
It’s worth trying for.

80
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,416
But right now, there’s a more urgent task.

81
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,458
What task?

82
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,375
There’s a batch of medicine

83
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:42,875
that needs to be shipped to Jiangbei.

84
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,708
How much is there?

85
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,625
How many boats do we need?

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,125
Not much, actually.

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,333
A small boat will be enough.

88
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,583
But time is tight.

89
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,166
Patrols along Jiangbei are strict now.

90
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:56,666
It’s hard to get it out.

91
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,791
We’ll use a diversion tactic.

92
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,916
Go from the abandoned dock at Shatou Town.

93
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,041
Create chaos below the dock.

94
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,791
Draw all the enemies from above the dock.

95
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,583
We’ll launch the boat amidst the chaos.

96
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:22,666
Alright.

97
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,541
Grandmother.

98
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,875
I’m back, Grandmother.

99
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,500
Jiaqi is back, Aunt.

100
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,208
Come in, quickly.

101
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,916
Alright, Aunt.

102
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,791
Okay, Uncle, take it slow.

103
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,125
Alright.

104
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,583
Sit down, sit down.

105
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,166
Alright, come on.

106
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:53,708
Sit down, sit down.

107
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,166
Alright, alright.

108
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:54,833
Uncle, you all sit too.

109
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:00,750
Jiaqi,

110
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,708
It’s been ten years since you left Nanjing, hasn’t it?

111
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,416
More than eight years.

112
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:05,750
Where did you go?

113
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,291
Why didn’t we hear from you at all?

114
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:08,666
I went to the northeast.

115
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,500
Did some business there.

116
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,625
Well, the situation has been chaotic lately.

117
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,875
So I couldn’t get in touch.

118
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,875
Sorry for making you and Aunt worry.

119
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,666
It’s good you’re back, that’s all that matters.

120
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,541
Aunt,

121
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,750
How’s my grandmother? Is she well?

122
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,000
She passed away last year.

123
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,083
When she left,

124
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,000
she kept saying your name.

125
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,041
Let me pay my respects to Grandmother.

126
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,541
Alright, go ahead.

127
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:12,958
Grandmother

128
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,875
Jiaqi has come back to see you.

129
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,791
This time Jiaqi is back

130
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:20,875
and won't be leaving again.

131
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:22,791
Jiaqi

132
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,208
That's wonderful.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,833
You can finally be with your mother again.

134
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,208
Your mother missed you so much her hair turned white.

135
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:31,625
I'm not leaving.

136
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,166
I'm not going anywhere.

137
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,875
So, what are your plans next?

138
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll do some business in Nanjing.

139
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:38,833
By the way, Uncle,

140
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,541
I need a favor.

141
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:41,875
Just tell me what you need.

142
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,333
I have some materials to sell across the river.

143
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:45,875
Our family's boat—

144
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,166
is it still usable?

145
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,208
You mean that old little boat?

146
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,541
It can still be of use.

147
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:51,875
It's fine.

148
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,041
I don't have much cargo.

149
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:53,916
It won't attract attention.

150
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:54,541
That's just right.

151
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,250
But—

152
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,666
The police are watching closely these days.

153
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,833
And also,

154
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:00,875
your uncle and I

155
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,583
can't row it anymore.

156
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,625
What do you know?

157
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,250
Since the kid brought it up,

158
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,458
he must have a way.

159
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:07,875
Jiaqi,

160
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,958
it can be used, it can.

161
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,208
That's good, that's good.

162
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,291
I've already found a boatman.

163
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,666
We just need the boat when the time comes, Uncle.

164
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:27,791
What do you do?

165
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:28,625
Oh!

166
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,625
Sirs,

167
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,791
I just brought goods back from Shanghai.

168
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:32,875
It's all

169
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,000
Jingdezhen porcelain.

170
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,833
Just trinkets, nothing valuable.

171
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,333
Enough talking, move aside.

172
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:37,916
Step aside.

173
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,750
Sirs, it's all porcelain.

174
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,708
What are you doing here?

175
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,208
Sirs, sirs,

176
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,875
Still working so late?

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,625
What are you up to? Planning to cross the river?

178
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,166
Oh, cross the river? Not at all.

179
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,875
This is how we make a living.

180
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,791
We fix it and rely on it to feed ourselves.

181
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,458
Do you have a permit? Did you report this?

182
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:07,791
Sirs,

183
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,041
We’re all law-abiding citizens.

184
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,125
No one would keep this without a permit.

185
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:11,875
Hey,

186
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:12,791
Sirs, come over here.

187
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:13,791
Get out of the way.

188
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,750
Sirs, sirs,

189
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,250
Move aside.

190
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,291
What’s this?

191
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,000
Hurry, hurry!

192
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:40,625
Get the sack.

193
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,125
Quick, quick!

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,291
One, two, three.

195
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,041
Once these two good-for-nothings enter the river,

196
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,166
Old Liu's family will be in danger.

197
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,625
We need to help them relocate quickly.

198
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:43,791
Tonight.

199
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,166
They truly understand the bigger picture.

200
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:45,541
Let's go.
