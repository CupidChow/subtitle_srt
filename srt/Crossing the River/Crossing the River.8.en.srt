1
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:12,625
Ms. Xia is here again.

2
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,416
This woman is so persistent.

3
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,333
You go first.

4
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:21,416
I'll deal with her.

5
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,541
Okay.

6
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,208
Who is it?

7
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm looking for Boss Zhao.

8
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,208
Boss Zhao isn't here.

9
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,583
Then open the door.

10
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,416
The factory has closed down.

11
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,125
Oh, it's Ms. Xia.

12
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:20,916
Li, is that you?

13
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,708
Why won't you open the door?

14
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:25,541
I don't dare.

15
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,166
Let me in first.

16
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:30,333
Alright.

17
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,416
It's only been a few days.

18
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,541
The grass has grown so tall already.

19
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:58,750
Where's Boss Zhao?

20
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,958
Boss Zhao went out for business a few days ago.

21
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,666
He had a car accident.

22
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,541
He passed away.

23
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,458
When did this happen?

24
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:15,791
It's been a week.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,666
In the factory,

26
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,791
We owed a lot of debts from previous investments.

27
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,833
Once the creditors heard about Boss Zhao,

28
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,208
they all came to collect their debts.

29
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,125
We can't tell who's real and who's not.

30
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:26,750
Ms. Xia,

31
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:27,750
you know as well,

32
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,416
the factory just started.

33
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,000
There's barely any profit.

34
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,166
We can't even pay the electricity bill.

35
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,583
We can't pay the workers either.

36
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,333
So everyone left.

37
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:37,958
Now,

38
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,583
I'm the only one left here.

39
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:41,833
Once my boat ticket arrives,

40
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,125
I'll leave too.

41
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,791
What about Director Zhang?

42
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,333
He's an official.

43
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,875
You know how it is.

44
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:20,875
Give me a pack of Da Qianmen.

45
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,416
Alright.

46
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,166
Keep the change.

47
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:24,750
Okay.

48
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,500
Thank you, sir.

49
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,291
Your cigarettes.

50
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:27,250
Take them.

51
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,416
Take care.

52
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,291
To the west side of town.

53
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,125
Alright, just a moment.

54
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:35,583
Alright.

55
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,625
Take care, sir.

56
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,708
Cigarettes.

57
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,375
Cigarettes here!

58
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,208
All brands available.

59
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,541
Stop!

60
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,125
Raise your head.

61
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:15,541
Officer.

62
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,208
Come here.

63
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:19,958
Grab him, hurry!

64
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,916
What are you doing? What are you doing?

65
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:22,375
Take him away.

66
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,791
What are you doing? Why?

67
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:24,458
Why?

68
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,125
Someone accused you of colluding with bandits.

69
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,375
Colluding with bandits?

70
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,208
How is that possible?

71
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:31,625
Where's the evidence?

72
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:32,833
Where's the evidence?

73
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,041
It's a special time.

74
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,333
I am the law!

75
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,291
Take him away.

76
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,958
You've got the wrong person! Let me go!

77
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:38,833
Let me go!

78
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,625
You've got the wrong person!

79
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:40,541
Let go!

80
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:41,500
You've got the wrong person!

81
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,000
Let go!

82
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,208
Let go!

83
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:46,875
Sir, where to?

84
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:47,333
Hurry.

85
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:48,916
To the train station.

86
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:49,500
Alright.

87
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,958
Sit tight.

88
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,166
Faster.

89
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,000
Alright.

90
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,541
We don't have much time left.

91
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:28,750
Quick, get the stuff out.

92
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,708
We must deliver it without fail.

93
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,458
Hide the car well.

94
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,416
You two, come with me. Hurry.

95
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:36,625
Hurry.

96
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:47,875
Done.

97
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,416
Get on the boat quickly.

98
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:00,708
Stop.

99
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:01,666
Inspection.

100
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:02,625
Go.

101
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:06,541
Xiao Qi.

102
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:07,875
You two, remember this.

103
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:09,875
No matter what,

104
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,708
make sure to deliver it safely.

105
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,333
We

106
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,625
will cover for you.

107
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:15,541
Secretary Qiao.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,625
Go.

109
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,125
Hurry, go!

110
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:27,791
Go.

111
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,041
Hide quickly.

112
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:50,291
Go.
