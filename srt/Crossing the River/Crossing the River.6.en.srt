1
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,041
Director

2
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:17,708
How's the progress?

3
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:19,583
According to plan.

4
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,083
We can take action tomorrow.

5
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:22,541
This time,

6
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,708
he won't get away.

7
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,750
These people

8
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,333
are so cunning.

9
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,208
Will they believe your intel?

10
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:37,750
They should.

11
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,333
If we come up empty-handed,

12
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,666
we'll alert the enemy.

13
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:45,833
I've taught you this.

14
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,125
Without absolute certainty,

15
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,875
never act rashly.

16
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,458
Please trust me, Sir.

17
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,333
We'll definitely act tomorrow.

18
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:58,458
Good.

19
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,541
You truly are my student.

20
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,250
Tomorrow, two groups of power experts will be transferred.

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,833
They are involved in all transmission networks in Jiangsu.

22
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,708
Once they're sent to Taiwan, China,

23
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:46,833
Jiangsu

24
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,125
could fall into darkness at any moment.

25
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,458
Are you ready?

26
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,666
There are four per train.

27
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,958
Three per military vehicle.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,083
We're planning to take action in Zhenjiang.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,041
We can't touch the ones on the train.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It could be a trap.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,250
Let the comrades in Shanghai handle it.

32
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,083
I'll take care of the ones in the military vehicles.

33
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:07,791
Okay.

34
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,875
Inspection.

35
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,000
Can't you read?

36
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:57,791
Sorry, Sir.

37
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:58,666
He's new here.

38
00:03:59,083 --> 00:03:59,541
Go.

39
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,208
Don't move.

40
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,291
Surround them.

41
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:12,625
Get off.

42
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:16,625
Hurry up.

43
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:17,708
Get down.

44
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:19,916
Hurry up.

45
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,791
Move!

46
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:27,708
Hurry!

47
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:29,916
Quickly!

48
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:34,500
Stand straight.

49
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:36,708
Brother,

50
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,458
We're on official duty.

51
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:39,583
Let's talk this out.

52
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,166
Which unit are you from?

53
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:43,583
Which unit?

54
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,333
Ever heard of Boss Sun?

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,416
What bullshit mission are you on?

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,250
What the hell does that have to do with me?

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
In times like these,

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,500
Chiang Kai-shek won't let me survive.

59
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,208
I have to find my own way.

60
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,250
You three,

61
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,291
Who do you work for?

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,333
Them?

63
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,291
They're my friends.

64
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,666
Talk to me if you have something to say.

65
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,333
It's got nothing to do with them.

66
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,000
Get out of the way.

67
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,000
I wasn't asking you.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,291
Speak.

69
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,250
What are your names?

70
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:20,875
What do you do?

71
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:23,250
Hero,

72
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,041
My name is

73
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,083
Fang Zhengyi.

74
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,916
I'm an engineer at Central Radio Company.

75
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,291
He,

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,791
He's Zhang Yibin.

77
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,750
From Jiangnan Power Plant.

78
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:35,416
Chief Engineer.

79
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:36,333
Oh, right.

80
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:37,791
And him,

81
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,791
He's the Chief Engineer at Southern Cement Plant.

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,125
His name is Zhang Fayin.

83
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:45,875
Sir,

84
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,916
We've never done

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,125
anything immoral.

86
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:50,625
Please,

87
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,541
let us go.

88
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,291
Let you go?

89
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,416
You three look well-educated.

90
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,958
You must be worth something.

91
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll trade you for some cash for my men.

92
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,250
Please don't kill us.

93
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,083
We have elderly parents and young children to support.

94
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:09,625
If you kill us,

95
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:10,666
what will happen to them?

96
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:11,750
That's right.

97
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:12,708
Exactly.

98
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,166
Don't worry.

99
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,333
I'm not going to kill you.

100
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,625
I want money.

101
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,166
But,

102
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,083
if you try anything funny,

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,125
then it's not just about money anymore.

104
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,125
Boys,

105
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,333
Strip their clothes.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,333
Tie them up.

107
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:32,958
Take them away.

108
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:34,958
Boss,

109
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's go.

110
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:36,791
Move.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,291
Chief,

112
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,125
Boss,

113
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:46,666
Please let us go.

114
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:47,625
Boss,

115
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:48,791
Don't go.

116
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:51,708
Chief,

117
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,958
Hurry!

118
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,083
Keep up.

119
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,041
Hurry up.

120
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,458
Come on.

121
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,708
Get in the car, quick.

122
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:13,666
Hurry!

123
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:14,291
Look here.

124
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:18,875
You all,

125
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:19,375
Fall back!

126
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,166
Don't be nervous.

127
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,583
Zhao Jiaqi from the PLA Nanjing advance team.

128
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm responsible for your safety.

129
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,541
Where are we going?

130
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't worry.

131
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,291
We won't leave Jiangsu.

132
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,541
I'll take you to a safe place first.

133
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,000
Just wait a couple of days.

134
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,166
Everything will be fine.

135
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,041
Keep driving.

136
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,833
Head to a safe spot up ahead.

137
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,000
Get everyone to run quickly.

138
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,333
I'll cover this side.

139
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,291
Chief.

140
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,208
This is too dangerous.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,500
Follow orders!

142
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,250
Experts, come with me.

143
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:38,833
Move!

144
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:39,916
Hurry!

145
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:40,291
Quick!

146
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:41,083
Go!

147
00:08:59,166 --> 00:08:59,875
Everyone's in the car.

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,333
Go after them!

149
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,000
Chase them!
