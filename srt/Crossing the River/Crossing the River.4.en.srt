1
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,416
Awesome.

2
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,666
In our Wang family,

3
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,166
we're about to have a pianist.

4
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,125
Why are you

5
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,291
pulling such a long face?

6
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:58,916
Who are you showing that to?

7
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:18,708
Grandpa,

8
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,458
do you not like the piece I played?

9
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,458
I can play many more.

10
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,791
Grandpa really likes this piece.

11
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,291
You played with

12
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,750
the spirit of "High Mountains Flowing Water,"

13
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,666
as if searching for a soulmate.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,291
It sounded beautiful.

15
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:34,625
Grandpa,

16
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,958
do you ever feel lonely too?

17
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,708
Grandpa

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,083
doesn't lack friends.

19
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,833
But you shared with Grandpa

20
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,458
the stories of those who fight against fate.

21
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,583
They overcome destiny

22
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,708
and immerse themselves in happiness.

23
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,458
Grandpa is very happy.

24
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,083
Keep practicing.

25
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

26
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,000
Captain

27
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,166
Would anyone cross the river in this cold?

28
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah.

29
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,250
Only a madman would cross the river on a night like this.

30
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,916
Damn it!

31
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,208
Stop talking.

32
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,125
Keep your eyes wide open tonight.

33
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:18,375
Captain

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,791
There's a boat over there.

35
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:27,583
You guys,

36
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:28,708
go check it out.

37
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,750
Yes, sir.

38
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,875
Captain, watch out! It's dangerous—go!

39
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:02,583
How is it?

40
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,208
It's time.

41
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:03,916
Get the boat out now!
