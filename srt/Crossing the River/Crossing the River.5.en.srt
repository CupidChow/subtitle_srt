1
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,350
Thank you.

2
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,800
Lately,

3
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,630
Has your wife been feeling better?

4
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:30,870
About the same.

5
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,120
But

6
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,590
she's getting better day by day.

7
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,710
Given the current situation, it shouldn't be long now.

8
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,000
She should recover soon.

9
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,120
Report.

10
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,590
Do you know this person?

11
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,630
Him?

12
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,680
I've met him twice.

13
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,280
We just started interacting.

14
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,470
The newly established Jinling Fuhai Machinery Factory.

15
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,800
He's a businessman.

16
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Polite and refined.

17
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,400
Very active socially.

18
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,030
There have been frequent incidents lately.

19
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,960
The Communist agent Flying Dragon

20
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,750
has already infiltrated Nanjing.

21
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,030
We must find him as soon as possible.

22
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,030
Are you saying

23
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,910
he is Flying Dragon?

24
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,750
I can't be sure yet.

25
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,120
But he's definitely connected.

26
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,190
The word "enemy"

27
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,710
is never written on one's face.

28
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,430
You have to coexist

29
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,080
to tell good from bad.

30
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,750
Only through confrontation

31
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,870
can you distinguish friend from foe.

32
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,870
Understood.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,920
Keep a close watch on him.

34
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,750
Yes.

35
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,120
Follow them.

36
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,390
Little girl, you must be hungry.

37
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,600
Here.

38
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,750
Take this. Hurry, eat well.

39
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,750
Boss, I haven't eaten in days.

40
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,510
Please give me something to eat.

41
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,720
I haven't eaten either! Why should you eat? Get lost!

42
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,190
Auntie, could you give me some food?

43
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,040
No. Go as far away as you can.

44
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,040
Go.

45
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,270
Go on.

46
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,190
Here.

47
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,800
Eat.

48
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,240
Jiaqi,

49
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,510
Recently, they've moved all the experts to Shanghai and Guangzhou,

50
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,720
and to Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, China.

51
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,480
Has this affected you?

52
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,430
As for me,

53
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,560
it hasn't made much difference.

54
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,070
But with all the experts gone,

55
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,430
what will happen to Nanjing in the future?

56
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,240
What can we do?

57
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,040
They're relocating experts from every field in large numbers.

58
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,240
They're not leaving anything for our Party.

59
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,630
That's not acceptable.

60
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,480
These people must stay.

61
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,150
For building the new government,

62
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,720
they are a vital force.

63
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,720
Come in.

64
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:42,960
Oh,

65
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,750
Teacher Xia,

66
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,390
what brings you here?

67
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,030
Boss Zhao,

68
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,200
this factory is truly impressive.

69
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,320
Such grandeur,

70
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,200
it's admirable.

71
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,270
Let me introduce you.

72
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,910
This is Teacher Xia from Jinling Women's University.

73
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,550
Nice to meet you.

74
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,750
And this is Director Zhang from the Second Department of the Ministry of Transport.

75
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,270
Hello, Director Zhang.

76
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,720
Sorry for dropping by unexpectedly.

77
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,240
I hope I'm not interrupting your work.

78
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,240
Not at all.

79
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,390
A beautiful lady visiting us—

80
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,600
we're more than happy to welcome you.

81
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,030
Absolutely.

82
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,390
Please,

83
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:11,870
have a seat.

84
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,440
Please, sit down.

85
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,150
Jiaqi and I

86
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,440
were just chatting idly.

87
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,600
Given the current situation,

88
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,960
factories in Nanjing

89
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,270
are either closing down or shutting their doors.

90
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,000
Boss Zhao running a business at this time

91
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,960
shows real courage.

92
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,080
Today,

93
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,150
I came here especially to learn from you.

94
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,750
Business is tough these days.

95
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,870
So I'm trying out a factory first.

96
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,120
If things go well,

97
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,200
I might even make some money.

98
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,550
Just trying my luck.

99
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,910
Teacher Xia,

100
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,200
Teacher Xia,

101
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,750
look—

102
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,270
Boss Zhao looks so confident.

103
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,670
This factory

104
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,270
definitely has great potential.

105
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,080
It's hard to do business nowadays.

106
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,600
No workers when you need them,

107
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,790
and no technology either.

108
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:08,870
There's no technical expertise.

109
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,030
How can that be?

110
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,270
The Nationalist government is sending top talent

111
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,630
to the south for protection.

112
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,910
Now, experts in Nanjing

113
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,390
are getting fewer and fewer.

114
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,630
No wonder.

115
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,870
Several professors from our university have left too.

116
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,480
In fact,

117
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,720
my teacher and their family are leaving tomorrow.

118
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,720
I'm going to the station to see them off.

119
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,200
So, you two came here

120
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,270
to discuss work?

121
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,510
Besides, your experts and professors

122
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,270
have nothing to do with my factory.

123
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,670
That's true.

124
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,270
Yes.

125
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,750
Let's just take a look at your factory.

126
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,000
Alright.

127
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:49,910
This way, please.

128
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,240
After you.

129
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,240
This Ms. Xia

130
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,320
Did you know her before?

131
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,000
I've met her.

132
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,910
But I wouldn't say I know her.

133
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,510
So why did she suddenly come to the factory today?

134
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,750
I'm puzzled too.

135
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,200
This matter

136
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,510
is indeed a bit strange.

137
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,790
She was at our factory,

138
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,120
looking around very carefully.

139
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,440
She kept asking about what products we make.

140
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,480
I suspect Ms. Xia's identity.

141
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,240
There's definitely something off about her.

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,630
Makes sense.

143
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,480
We should be cautious.

144
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,550
Oh, right.

145
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,510
She mentioned the experts will be relocated tomorrow.

146
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,550
Can we trust this?

147
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,150
Boss.

148
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,870
Boss.

149
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,670
She mentioned the experts will be relocated tomorrow.

150
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,550
Can we trust this?

151
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,550
You brat,

152
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,150
can't you think for yourself?

153
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,240
I...
