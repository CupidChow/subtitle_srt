1
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:14,125
Don't move.

2
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:19,666
Speak quickly.

3
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,833
Where is the explosive hidden?

4
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,125
I don't know.

5
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,583
I really don't know.

6
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,375
Let me tell you.

7
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,541
If the factory is destroyed,

8
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:29,875
the workers will lose their jobs.

9
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,500
the whole city will be plunged into darkness.

10
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,500
It’s the ordinary people who will suffer.

11
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,791
Then bandits will run rampant.

12
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,125
Women and children will be bullied.

13
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,250
You're helping the wrongdoers.

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,041
Do you understand?

15
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,416
I'm just a junior guard.

16
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,125
How would I know all this?

17
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:46,750
Jiaqi.

18
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,291
Listen to me carefully.

19
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,791
If you still have any conscience as a Chinese,

20
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,666
tell us where the explosives are hidden.

21
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,000
We can spare your life.

22
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,250
Explosives.

23
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:02,458
The explosives are over there.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,708
You two, come and check.

25
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:09,833
Jiaqi.

26
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,291
Here.

27
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:22,458
Scissors.

28
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,041
Be careful.

29
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,833
Do you know why we buried the explosives?

30
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,166
Just in case.

31
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,500
Orders from above.

32
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,083
If the Communist forces cross the river,

33
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,166
blow up the power plant.

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,750
Don’t leave the Communist bandits

35
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,541
even a trace of light.

36
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,541
The workers seem to have been influenced.

37
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:18,791
They're hard to deal with.

38
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,208
If persuasion doesn't work,

39
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,458
we'll use force.

40
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,458
If we can't blow up everything,

41
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,625
then destroy part of it.

42
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,208
Which part should we blow up?

43
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,083
The key components of the power plant

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,916
are the boiler,

45
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,750
the turbine,

46
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,750
the circulation pump,

47
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,000
and the generator.

48
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,166
Destroy any one of them,

49
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,125
and the Communist forces

50
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,750
will face

51
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,833
a pitch-dark Nanjing.

52
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,625
First, break the workers' spirit.

53
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,500
Clear the way.

54
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,375
It's up to you now.

55
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:20,625
Hurry up.

56
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,291
Move quickly.

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:21,875
Go.

58
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:26,791
What are you looking at?

59
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,041
Move.

60
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:33,750
It seems

61
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,375
we can't avoid today's fight.

62
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,625
If we don't teach the Bureau a lesson,

63
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,750
the other factories will be at a disadvantage.

64
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,500
Let's settle it here.

65
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,875
I'm innocent, please let me go.

66
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,250
You're innocent?

67
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,250
We're the ones who got screwed by you.

68
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,333
I don't know anything.

69
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,958
Why did you tie me up?

70
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,125
You know nothing?

71
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,583
You think I'm stupid?

72
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,083
Who did it?

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,750
Speak.

74
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:25,791
Where did it come from?

75
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:26,416
I don't know.

76
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,541
You.

77
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,166
Are you going to talk or not?

78
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,958
We swear we really don't know.

79
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,458
You guys,

80
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,250
who's in charge?

81
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,375
Speak up.

82
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,333
What's going on?

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,125
Explosives in the factory—

84
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,375
what are you trying to do?

85
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:21,958
Miss Xia.

86
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,916
I didn't expect

87
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,666
we'd meet again like this.

88
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,625
Miss Xia.

89
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,541
Hope you've been well.

90
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,166
You knew from the very beginning.

91
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,333
Ever since I got off the train,

92
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,916
you've been following me.

93
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,291
Then why didn't you act sooner?

94
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,208
Actually,

95
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,958
being a university professor really suits you.

96
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,625
Then why did you

97
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,916
not act sooner?

98
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,791
Anyone who dares to sabotage the factory

99
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,875
is taking away the workers' livelihoods.

100
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,500
Anyone who opposes the workers

101
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,166
is opposing the people.

102
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,208
The people

103
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,583
will never accept that.

104
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,125
I'm asking you,

105
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,750
why didn't you act earlier?

106
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,291
Miss Xia

107
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,541
Miss Xia

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,750
Miss Xia

109
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,416
Miss Xia

110
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:15,833
Miss Xia

111
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:16,875
Miss Xia

112
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:18,916
Chase!

113
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:19,375
After them!
