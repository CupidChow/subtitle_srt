1
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,083
Stop!

2
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,416
I didn't get on the train.

3
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,750
I don't want to go to Taiwan, China.

4
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,125
I want to stay with the workers.

5
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,416
Either

6
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,625
go to Taiwan, China

7
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,166
or

8
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,166
go to heaven.

9
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,833
This girl is pretty good.

10
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,291
Hey.

11
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:24,750
This one's nice.

12
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,375
Yeah.

13
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:27,083
Let's go.

14
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:32,666
Stop.

15
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,083
What are you doing?

16
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,375
Sir.

17
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,583
I'm a merchant. What's wrong?

18
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:39,791
A merchant.

19
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,791
Everyone's resisting the communists now.

20
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,500
Business? Who cares about business now?

21
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:48,833
Sir.

22
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,583
Even during war,

23
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,291
ordinary people still need to eat, right?

24
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,500
Enough talk.

25
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,500
Open the box.

26
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,625
Don't touch my box.

27
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
There's nothing inside, sir.

28
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:03,500
Captain.

29
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,458
Nothing here.

30
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,708
Search him.

31
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,708
I'm really just a merchant.

32
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,500
Sir, see? There's nothing.

33
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,083
Can I go now?

34
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,875
Sir.

35
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,791
I'm truly a merchant, sir.

36
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,083
Hey!

37
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,958
This is for my mother's life.

38
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,541
Sir.

39
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,541
That's valuable.

40
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,375
It's for my mother's life, sir.

41
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,708
Please, don't take it.

42
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:40,916
Sir.

43
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,083
Please, don't.

44
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,500
Smuggling scarce supplies.

45
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,500
Take him to build fortifications by the river.

46
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,125
Sir.

47
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:47,833
Move.

48
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,583
Let me go.

49
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:49,791
Let me go.

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,333
Wait.

51
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:51,833
Let me go.

52
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,208
Hold on.

53
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:54,833
Let me go.

54
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,041
What's going on?

55
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:58,750
Sir.

56
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,750
Someone at home is sick.

57
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,625
I need to hurry home to save a life, sir.

58
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,833
What kind of business do you do?

59
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,083
I sell some local produce.

60
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,500
Just a small business.

61
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,833
Show me your hands.

62
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,375
You're not a merchant at all.

63
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,500
You're playing tricks.

64
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,250
Sir, you've misunderstood. I wouldn't dare.

65
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,500
Hey, what do you do?

66
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,416
Hey, what do you do?

67
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,291
I'm from the Ministry of Transportation.

68
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,458
I suspect this person is involved in the power sabotage case.

69
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:44,833
I need to take him away.

70
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,375
Here, take him.

71
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,041
Thank you, sir.

72
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,708
Such bad luck.

73
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:17,833
Ministry of Transportation.

74
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:20,875
Go, go, go.

75
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,875
Follow that car.

76
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,333
There are eyes everywhere.

77
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,791
You might be under surveillance.

78
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,500
With you, the chief, here,

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let them watch.

80
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,500
There's nothing to be afraid of.

81
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,208
Jiaqi,

82
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,375
Welcome to Nanjing.

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,250
The teacher asked us to take good care of you.

84
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,750
If you need anything, just say it.

85
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,375
Sorry about today.

86
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,625
Sorry for startling you, brother.

87
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,958
I'll treat you tonight.

88
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,125
A welcome dinner to calm your nerves.

89
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,333
Actually,

90
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,041
I do have something to ask you.

91
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,083
We're like family.

92
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,000
Just tell me what you need.

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,083
This time,

94
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,916
I want to acquire a machinery factory in Nanjing.

95
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,041
Times are chaotic right now.

96
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,125
But I think it's an opportunity.

97
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,375
I'll keep an eye out for you.

98
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,125
Factories in Nanjing are cheap now.

99
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:02,916
They're all very affordable.

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,541
That's easy.

101
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:05,500
Well then,

102
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,375
I'll trouble you, old friend.

103
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:08,541
Don't mention it.

104
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,041
Here.

105
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,291
Room key.

106
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,333
You'll stay here tonight.

107
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:01,708
Take a rest first.

108
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,541
I'll pick you up for dinner tonight.

109
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:04,500
Okay.

110
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,375
You can go back now.

111
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,375
Welcome, sir.

112
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,458
Hello.

113
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,333
Alright, please follow me.

114
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,125
Okay, thank you.

115
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:23,708
You're welcome.

116
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,541
Welcome.

117
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,333
Sorry, excuse me.

118
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,000
Miss, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

119
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:53,833
It's okay.
