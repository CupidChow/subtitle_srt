1
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:26,500
Everyone,

2
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,625
The tide has turned.

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,333
We must plan ahead.

4
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,541
Is it really this serious?

5
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,583
Rumors disturbing the troops.

6
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,958
Where did they come from?

7
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:42,750
Hmm.

8
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,291
The Commander is very angry now.

9
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,291
Everyone knows.

10
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,875
If we don't get to the bottom of this,

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,875
no one leaves.

12
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:20,833
Don't move.

13
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,208
Stay still.

14
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:23,791
Put down your gun.

15
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,625
Put down your gun.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,125
My own child.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,416
It's not your place to act out here.

18
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,166
Commander Wang.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,458
As long as the leader isn't corrupt, the ranks won't be either.

20
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,333
Then I have an explanation.

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,041
Director Deng, please

22
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,166
rest in the VIP room.

23
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,583
Please.

24
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:10,625
Let's go.

25
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,500
Everyone here

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,750
is a brother who has fought life and death with me.

27
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,250
You all know

28
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,500
the leader and the Party and the Nation have treated us well.

29
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:28,666
Speak up.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,291
What is this all about today?

31
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,208
The Commander personally raised me.

32
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,583
You can execute me today.

33
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:40,916
The game is up.

34
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,666
This is all out in the open.

35
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,083
If we don't plan ahead,

36
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,750
who will?

37
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:49,958
Go to Taiwan, China.

38
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,208
What can we do there?

39
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,791
What about our wives and children?

40
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,250
Brothers,

41
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,333
since fighting against the Japanese invaders, we've risked our lives together.

42
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,625
Though I'm your Commander,

43
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,416
I'm also your elder brother.

44
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,166
Today I've made a decision.

45
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,083
The 79th Division will revolt.

46
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,166
We'll join the Communist side.

47
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:25,541
We'll abandon darkness for light.

48
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:35,833
Commander.

49
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,250
If we defect to the Communists,

50
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,041
will they even accept us?

51
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,000
We're soldiers of the Kuomintang.

52
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,333
How can we join the Communist side?

53
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,625
I know what everyone's concerns are.

54
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,333
But the Party and the Nation have lost their power, brothers.

55
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,625
I can't drag you all into the fire.

56
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,541
If we don't join the Communists,

57
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,625
we'll all have to go to Taiwan, China.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,916
I know the Party and the Nation's military strength.

59
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,041
The Chief and General Sun Li-jen don't get along.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,833
What about the others?

61
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,291
Useless officials.

62
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,625
If we

63
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,625
really go to Taiwan, China,

64
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,250
I'm afraid in our lifetime

65
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:34,000
we'll never return.

66
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,083
It's not that I'm ungrateful.

67
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,708
It's the Party and the Nation—

68
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,291
it's truly finished.

69
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,583
I won't force anyone.

70
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,166
Those willing to follow me,

71
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:03,791
take up your weapons.

72
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:05,833
Those unwilling,

73
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:07,958
put down your weapons.

74
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,708
or go home and farm,

75
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,250
or join another unit.

76
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,333
If anyone thinks I

77
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,541
don't deserve to live,

78
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,333
you may kill me right here.

79
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,458
I won't object.

80
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,166
If now

81
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,541
someone really shoots me here,

82
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,041
listen up,

83
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:37,500
don't stop them.

84
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:40,791
Let him go.

85
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:54,083
Wait.

86
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,666
Go to the supply office

87
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,083
and draw some travel expenses.

88
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,291
They won't make things difficult for you.

89
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,791
From now on,

90
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,500
we are true brothers.

91
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,333
Go back and get ready now.

92
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,125
We revolt and cross the river tonight.

93
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,333
Yes.

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,208
The brothers from our three regiments

95
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,416
will abandon darkness for light.

96
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,958
We cross the river tonight.

97
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,583
What about the other three regiments?

98
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,125
Will they cause trouble?

99
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,125
Trouble is inevitable.

100
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,541
To be safe,

101
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,333
we act now.

102
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,416
Since you joined us,

103
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,125
it's like adding wings to a tiger.

104
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,041
But for now,

105
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,208
on Director Deng's side,

106
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,500
he might not let us go.

107
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,041
That scum

108
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,916
preys on the people.

109
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,625
Let's deal with him before we cross the river.

110
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,166
This will be his burial ground.

111
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,583
Commander Wang,

112
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,791
is it the leader that's crooked

113
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,708
or the ranks below?

114
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,083
If the leader isn't crooked,

115
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,625
the ranks won't be crooked either.

116
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,666
You're the one who's crooked.

117
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,250
You want to rebel.
