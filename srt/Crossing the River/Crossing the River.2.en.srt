1
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,875
Sir, are you here for a checkup?

2
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,791
Is the doctor in?

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,916
I'm here to see the doctor.

4
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,083
Sir, please come with me.

5
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:58,791
Please have a seat.

6
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,250
Where are you feeling unwell?

7
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,666
My stomach hurts every night lately.

8
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,375
Did you eat something unusual?

9
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,208
Steamed pufferfish, fragrant and tender,

10
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:21,875
Its liver lingers like amber’s glow.

11
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,625
Jiaqi reporting to the organization.

12
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,416
The dragon has landed.

13
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,375
Operation Dawn is officially underway.

14
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,333
Sit.

15
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:43,791
Alright.

16
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,500
By the way,

17
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,583
Was your journey here smooth?

18
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,833
Security checks were strict all the way.

19
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,541
That's a good thing.

20
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,333
Why?

21
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,041
It means the enemy

22
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:03,875
is afraid of us now.

23
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,333
Makes sense.

24
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,375
Oh.

25
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,416
This is what the higher-ups asked me to give you.

26
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,833
What happened?

27
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:22,541
Ah.

28
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,250
We were ambushed.

29
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,583
Brother Dong.

30
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,208
He was killed.

31
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,291
The operative file was stolen too.

32
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:34,916
Who did it?

33
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,416
Huojinshan.

34
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,500
Him again.

35
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,583
Quick, come with me.

36
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,625
Hurry!

37
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,583
Careful, careful.

38
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,375
This is bad.

39
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,708
That file contains the names of over a hundred operatives.

40
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:13,958
And more than twenty

41
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,583
substation hideouts.

42
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,500
What do we do now?

43
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,791
Who is this person?

44
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,791
A key member of the Bureau of Secrets Jiangbei Liaison Office.

45
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,916
He’s committed many crimes.

46
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,583
He’s harmed many of our operatives.

47
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:36,416
In that case,

48
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:37,958
Operation Dawn

49
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,250
will start with him.

50
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:40,625
Alright.

51
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,208

Brother Jinshan.

65
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:14,958
Stop!

66
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,500
Don’t run!

67
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,875
Stop! Stop!

68
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:19,666
Stop!

69
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:22,708
Don’t run!

70
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,250
Stop!

71
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:30,541
Don’t run!

72
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,166
Stop!

73
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,541
Why are you running?

74
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:43,583
Ah.

75
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:45,833
Gentlemen.

76
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:46,958
Brother.

77
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,166
Officer.

78
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,416
You’ve got the wrong person, haven’t you?

79
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,333
How could that be?

80
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,041
Director Deng.

81
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,833
Director Deng sent us to pick you up.

82
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:57,625
This time,

83
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,291
you’ve done a great service.

84
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,041
Director Deng.

85
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:05,666
Listen to me, hey—

86
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,083
Don’t be like that.

87
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:07,666
Don’t grip so tight.

88
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:08,166
Hurry up.

89
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:08,791
I’ll talk, I’ll talk.

90
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:09,958
Alright, alright.

91
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:10,916
Everyone.

92
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,125
Slow down.

93
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,375
Where are we going?

94
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,000
This—

95
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:15,541
This—

96
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:02,666
Brother Jinshan

97
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:07,583
Brother Jinshan

98
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,000
You'll know once you go in.

99
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,333
Brother Jinshan,

100
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:21,541
Mm.

101
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,166
Don't be nervous.

102
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:23,541
Mm.

103
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,041
Here,

104
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,083
this is our place.

105
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,500
It's absolutely safe.

106
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,041
Just wait a bit.

107
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,333
Director Deng

108
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,416
He'll be here soon.

109
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,791
Director Deng

110
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,125
Yes.

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,875
Director Deng Fengsheng from the Bureau of Secrets.

112
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,833
Of course.

113
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,083
From our Bureau of Secrets.

114
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:43,791
That Deng Fengsheng.

115
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,333
Director Deng.

116
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,083
Who else would it be?

117
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,000
Come, come.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sit, sit, sit.

119
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,666
I've heard of him too.

120
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,541
I'm just a low-level operative.

121
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,000
I've always been stationed in Jiangbei.

122
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,125
How could I know such a high-ranking officer?

123
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:07,875
Brother Jinshan,

124
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,458
Mm.

125
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,041
Today, you've done a great service for the Party and the Nation.

126
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,208
You've made a major contribution.

127
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,958
When Director Deng arrives,

128
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,083
he'll surely reward you.

129
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,458
Don't worry.

130
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:17,791
Right.

131
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,083
You won't be left out.

132
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:19,541
Ah.

133
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,458
You won't be left out.

134
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,833
Why did you run just now?

135
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,625
How would I know?

136
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,583
I didn't know you were Director Deng's people.

137
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,375
Sorry if I offended you earlier.

138
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,833
Brother Jinshan, please forgive me.

139
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:39,666
Here, have a cigarette.

140
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,125
Please have some tea.

141
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,166
Let me light it for you.

142
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,125
Brother Jinshan,

143
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:55,625
Oh.

144
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,791
Section Chief Huo

145
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,833
From now on,

146
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,333
please look after me.

147
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,916
Please look after me.

148
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,666
Of course.

149
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,833
Even among our own people,

150
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,833
we still have to follow the rules.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,375
Right?

152
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,083
Yes.

153
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,625
You called out "Brother Jinshan" as soon as you arrived.

154
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,625
How could I not bolt?

155
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,833
We agreed on

156
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,041
two whistles and two shouts.

157
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,958
But you didn't do any.

158
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,791
Things are so tense now.

159
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,458
How could I dare, right?

160
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,583
Section Chief Huo,

161
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,541
This is our first time handling something this big.

162
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,083
We got nervous and forgot everything.

163
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,833
Forgot it all, totally forgot.

164
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,125
No need to be nervous.

165
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,875
You'll have me from now on.

166
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,500
Of course, of course.

167
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:41,666
I'll take care of you.

168
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,333
Thank you in advance, Section Chief Huo.

169
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:44,833
Thank you, Section Chief Huo.

170
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,250
Sit, sit.

171
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,250
Have some tea.

172
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,125
Sit, sit.

173
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,166
I know them all.

174
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,041
Just introduce them one by one.

175
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:00,541
Director Deng

176
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,125
Hello.

177
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,625
I'm Huojinshan.

178
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,875
Stationed in Shatou Town.

179
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,166
Intelligence operative.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,875
Oh.

181
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,500
Please sit.

182
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,500
Brother Jinshan

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,416
Thank you for your hard work.

184
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,583
Not at all.

185
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,666
I just heard the news myself.

186
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,208
You did an excellent job this time.

187
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,625
The higher-ups have given orders.

188
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,208
You are appointed Deputy Section Chief of Action Division Two.

189
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,208
Four gold bars as a reward.

190
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,791
Thank you for your patronage, Director Deng.

191
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,875
I will remain loyal to the Party and the Nation.

192
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,166
Where are the items?

193
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,000
The items?

194
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,333
Such valuable items,

195
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,416
How could I possibly

196
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,541
carry them with me?

197
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,541
I kept them at my house.

198
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,083
Everything is well arranged.

199
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:50,875
Or,

200
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,000
I can bring them to you now.

201
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,791
Everyone is hunting you right now.

202
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,500
It's not safe for you to go.

203
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,041
Let them go instead.

204
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,458
That's fine.

205
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,375
Recently, my wife and kids

206
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,166
have been staying in the countryside.

207
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,083
No one is at home.

208
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:05,541
And the items?

209
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,791
They're in my backyard.

210
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,000
Inside the hidden compartment in the wardrobe.

211
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,250
Just open the wardrobe,

212
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,458
count from the bottom,

213
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,625
the eighth compartment.

214
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,041
You'll see it.

215
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,458
Have a seat.

216
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,666
Brother Jinshan,

217
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,041
Is this intelligence reliable?

218
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,458
Where did you get it?

219
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,583
No one else has seen it, right?

220
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,375
This is no small matter.

221
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,541
Once the military moves,

222
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,458
if the intelligence is wrong,

223
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,333
it'll be a big problem.

224
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:55,625
Director Deng,

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,291
I risked my life to get this.

226
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,041
I even killed a Communist for it.

227
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,333
I guarantee

228
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,541
this intelligence is absolutely accurate.

229
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,541
If it's false,

230
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:07,958
you

231
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,000
can execute me on the spot.

232
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,500
Have some water first.

233
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,875
Take a rest.

234
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,541
We'll move you to a safer place tonight.

235
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,541
I'd better not drink.

236
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:34,666
Jiaqi,

237
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,250
Did you find the items?

238
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,041
Yes, I found them.

239
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,208
I've checked everything.

240
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:42,791
No problems.

241
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:44,833
Everything's here.

242
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,541
Yes, that's right.

243
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,000
Thank you, Director Deng, for your patronage.
