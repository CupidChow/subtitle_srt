1
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,166
Madam

2
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,416
Where are you going again?

3
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,083
I'm not going anywhere.

4
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,916
I was just checking if Madam was back.

5
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,625
Back yet? Back yet?

6
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,291
What kind of Commander are you?

7
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:38,625
Look at this, just look.

8
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,458
There are eyes everywhere.

9
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,416
How am I supposed to live like this?

10
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,541
The fighting in the north is getting intense.

11
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,875
The Communist Army will cross the river any day now.

12
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:40,916
People in the Nanjing Government are anxious.

13
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,791
That anxiety follows us too.

14
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:46,875
Isn't that right?

15
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,625
Are they going to send us to Taiwan, China?

16
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,041
No.

17
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,333
No.

18
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,958
Taiwan, China is such a tiny place.

19
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:56,833
What could we do there?

20
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,416
We're not going anywhere.

21
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,333
Let's wait and see.

22
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,416
Whether we go or not,

23
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,375
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

24
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:18,333
Welcome to both of you.

25
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello, hello.

26
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:22,541
This is my wife.

27
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,583
Nice to meet you, Madam.

28
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:24,541
Nice to meet you both.

29
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:26,583
I'm not sure

30
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,791
how I should address you.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,791
Mr. Zhao or Boss Zhao?

32
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,291
You're too kind.

33
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:32,708
How about this—

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,083
You're five years older than me.

35
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,125
I think

36
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,416
you should call me younger brother.

37
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:40,791
A few days ago,

38
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,708
I had the honor of meeting your party's

39
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,458
main leader in the Nanjing Municipal Committee.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,875
They mentioned you to me.

41
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,458
It's a pleasure to meet you today.

42
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:48,416
Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,083
As for me,

44
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,250
I specially brought you

45
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,500
this northeastern ginseng

46
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,583
and wild deer antler.

47
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,041
I also prepared for Madam

48
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,166
a black pearl necklace from earlier years.

49
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,458
It's just a small token of respect.

50
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,166
Boss Zhao,

51
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,750
you're too generous.

52
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,000
Please, have a seat.

53
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:05,791
Thank you, after you.

54
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,583
Commander Wang,

55
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,791
you're a very busy man.

56
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,041
I've wanted to visit you for a long time.

57
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:20,416
But you see,

58
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,000
it's been delayed until today.

59
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,791
I'm truly sorry.

60
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,166
Usually it's fine,

61
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,291
but lately there's been a lot going on.

62
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,083
Meetings at the Ministry of National Defense,

63
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,541
meetings at the Garrison Command,

64
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,250
and meetings at the Defense Command too.

65
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,625
All these meetings,

66
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,041
it's always about the same things.

67
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,333
Commander Wang

68
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,875
has been thinking about Boss Zhao for a long time.

69
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,791
Boss Zhao

70
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,833
has also wanted to visit Commander Wang for ages.

71
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,000
Right now,

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,416
the two of them are truly

73
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,791
heroes meeting,

74
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,333
admiring each other.

75
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,500
Mingyu, I must say,

76
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,250
this is all your fault.

77
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,291
Why didn't you introduce us sooner?

78
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:03,666
Brother Zhao,

79
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,333
now is just right.

80
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,375
Everything has worked out for the best.

81
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:28,041
The situation on the battlefield between the Nationalists and Communists is now clear.

82
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,250
This war is close to ending.

83
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,458
It won't be much longer.

84
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,041
Commander Wang,

85
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:37,750
Zhao Jiaqi

86
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,000
has always been on the front lines.

87
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,083
He is very experienced.

88
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,458
He came today

89
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,291
to discuss your next steps.

90
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:44,583
The goal

91
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,166
is to cooperate with your work.

92
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,583
Actually, I've thought about this before.

93
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,083
Right now,

94
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,666
the Nationalist Army leadership is preparing their escape routes.

95
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,000
Some want to go to Taiwan, China.

96
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,166
Some want to go to the United States.

97
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,125
Or Hong Kong, China.

98
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,541
Military ships and vehicles

99
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,916
have become their personal tools.

100
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:13,916
Jiaqi,

101
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,500
Commander Wang,

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,708
I have two concerns now.

103
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,625
First,

104
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,666
I've followed Chiang for many years.

105
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,416
I still feel grateful for Chiang's recognition.

106
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,166
Second,

107
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,625
I'm unsure about your side's policies.

108
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,875
I'm not certain about them yet.

109
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:30,625
Commander Wang,

110
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,250
Allow me to speak frankly.

111
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,083
The Nationalist Party is

112
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:35,916
demoralized,

113
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,250
and the government is corrupt.

114
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,458
Only by overthrowing this government

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,375
can our nation have hope.

116
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,750
Commander Wang, rest assured.

117
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,166
Our Party will remember

118
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,208
those who contribute to our country and people.

119
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,250
Of course,

120
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,333
we also hope you,

121
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,666
can switch sides.

122
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,958
Join us in building a new China.

123
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,875
Your 79th Division

124
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,875
if it joins the People's Liberation Army,

125
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,166
it will be a great contribution to the millions in Nanjing

126
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,166
and to the entire Chinese nation.

127
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,791
The Commander of the East China Field Army has repeatedly asked us

128
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,541
to do our utmost

129
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,666
to minimize damage to Nanjing

130
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,333
and reduce civilian and soldier casualties.

131
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,833
To avoid unnecessary suffering.

132
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,208
Meeting you today,

133
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,000
I am here on the commander's orders

134
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,291
to cooperate

135
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,250
and assist with your next steps.

136
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,125
Sincerely,

137
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,916
we welcome you to join us.

138
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,083
Although I am a soldier,

139
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,333
I love peace even more.

140
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,083
I hope these days will end soon.

141
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,041
Come,

142
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,166
I propose

143
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:17,833
we

144
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:18,708
use water instead of wine

145
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,041
to wish for the early liberation of Nanjing and all of China.

146
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,041
Cheers!

147
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:26,625
Cheers!

148
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,458
Wait, wait.

149
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:41,333
Hey!

150
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,458
I'm not dead yet.

151
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,166
What are you doing?

152
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:51,791
Are you trying to rebel?

153
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,166
Excuse me, you two,

154
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:02,666
please come with me.

155
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:05,458
Please.
