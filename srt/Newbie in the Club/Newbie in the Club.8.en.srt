00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,705
Hello Netflix Club members,
how has your week been?

3
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,576
Each week, I observe clubs
with the eyes of a bird.

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,479
I'm Defconn,
the newbie who's crazy about clubs.

5
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,581
The club I'll be observing today is

6
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,817
a club that dedicates
up to 72 hours to succeed just once.

7
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,354
They're a club that works
on patience together.

8
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,524
I invited a newbie to join me again today.

9
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,059
He used to do hip-hop,

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,761
but he doesn't do it anymore, either.

11
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,696
Welcome, Nucksal!

12
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,131
Nucksal!

13
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,365
-Hello.
-Hi.

14
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,967
-Hey, "Cut Cut Cut."
-Hello.

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,168
Yes, hello.

16
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,237
I'm Nucksal and
I'll be the newbie for the day.

17
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,371
Yes, it's good to see you.

18
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,440
-I heard you love games.
-I do.

19
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,609
I play console games and board games.

20
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:43,910
-Let me ask you something.
-Yes.

21
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,113
Do you have a fiery personality
or a cool personality?

22
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,782
I've been told it's bad.

23
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,151
-Then, it'll come out today.
-Why?

24
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,386
-You'll be working on your patience a lot.
-Right.

25
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,454
That's right.

26
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,523
Now, let's go meet the trick shot club.

27
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,891
Let's go this way!

28
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:58,958
MEMBERS ON STANDBY

29
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,460
-They're here. They were watching.
-Hi.

30
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,063
-Hello!
-Hello!

31
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,497
I'm on Netflix!

32
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,698
ENERGETIC FROM THE START

33
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,233
-Oh, yeah!
-We made it!

34
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,302
Please introduce your club to us.

35
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,704
-We're a club called TricKOR.
-TricKOR.

36
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,406
We combined "trick shot" and "Korea."

37
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,941
-Trick shot and Korea.
-That's right.

38
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,310
Let me briefly explain
what a trick shot is.

39
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,814
We map out complicated plans
of various sports

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,117
and make the goals as we planned.
That's what we call trick shots.

41
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,119
TRICK SHOT: SUCCEEDING
IN A TOUGH MISSION

42
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,987
USING UNIQUE SKILLS
AND CREATIVE METHODS

43
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,523
-Can the leader introduce himself?
-Yes.

44
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,791
-May I stand up?
-Yes.

45
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,259
-You're standing up?
-Why?

46
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,229
Hello, Netflix viewers around the world.

47
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,297
SITS DOWN AGAIN

48
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,633
I'm in charge of TricKOR
and my name is Park Min-sik.

49
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,268
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, Min-sik.

50
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,436
I'll go.

51
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,737
Hello.

52
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,039
Why are you all standing up?

53
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,207
Our leader tricked me

54
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,476
into shooting and editing videos
for seven years.

55
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,977
My name is Ahn Chi-hyuk.

56
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,879
-For seven years.
-You're the big shot here.

57
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,148
-You said the leader tricked you.
-Yes.

58
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,316
How were you tricked?

59
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,320
I was told that I would
only shoot and edit the videos.

60
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,421
After I joined,

61
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,289
he said I should throw as well.

62
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,024
Chi-hyuk has to travel the furthest

63
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,459
-to come here.
-From where?

64
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,027
-He comes from Cheongju.
-What?

65
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,263
-You commute from Cheongju right now?
-For seven years.

66
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,331
-From Cheongju?
-Yes.

67
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,099
Why are you living like this?

68
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,167
You see,

69
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,668
I just started, but then…

70
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:16,803
-I feel like I'm the bad guy here.
-Oh, hold on.

71
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,871
May I complain a bit?

72
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:22,208
I wanted to quit after a while,
but when I saw them succeed,

73
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,444
-I started being drawn in.
-It's thrilling.

74
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,045
-You got excited.
-Yes.

75
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,113
I've been hooked since.

76
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,681
-You got addicted to it.
-Yes.

77
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,251
I'm Kim Sol-ji
and I'm the brain of this team.

78
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,653
I'm Park Dong-guk
and I'm the oldest in the club.

79
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,721
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

80
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,190
I'm Yoo Kil-hyun
and I'm the good-looking, youngest one.

81
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,558
-You're the youngest?
-Yes.

82
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,959
-He's the youngest.
-For real?

83
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,027
I was born in 1992.

84
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,228
-Really?
-Yes, the year of the Monkey.

85
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,197
How did the five of you get together?

86
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,066
Actually, all five of us
are professional dancers.

87
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,535
All of us are dancers.

88
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,602
-Really?
-Yes.

89
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,104
Who did you work with?

90
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,207
We toured the world
with BTS for about six months.

91
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,975
-Really?
-With BTS?

92
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,279
And most recently,
we've been performing at g.o.d's concerts

93
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,880
from two years ago until now.

94
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,882
-Wow.
-We did that.

95
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,717
You guys are huge in this industry.

96
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,052
You must be really busy,

97
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,555
so it can't be easy
to bounce a ping-pong ball around.

98
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,025
Initially, we thought of creating
dance videos on YouTube,

99
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,560
but I happened to come across

100
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,795
a video of a really awesome shot
with a ping-pong ball.

101
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,230
We decided to give it a try
because it looked easy.

102
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,199
After seeing a trick shot from overseas,

103
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,600
you thought you could do it.

104
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,703
But we couldn't go home
until we succeeded.

105
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,438
-Us too?
-You don't let them go?

106
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,806
-You can't go until you succeed.
-You must succeed.

107
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,107
While we're on the subject,

108
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,510
what's the longest you've ever spent
making a shot?

109
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,578
About three days?

110
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,679
-Three days.
-Darn it.

111
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,647
-Three days?
-We stayed together.

112
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,216
None of you have kids, do you?

113
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,717
-No.
-Of course not.

114
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,885
That's why you can
stay out for three days.

115
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,953
-Nucksal.
-This is…

116
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,355
I feel like you're secretly smiling.

117
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,657
-You get to play.
-How long did you book this place for?

118
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,627
-Bring some board games from the car.
-Okay.

119
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,096
-He likes board games.
-Can I get an ashtray and some alcohol?

120
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,831
Let's have some fun today.

121
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,899
Not a bad idea.

122
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,834
Can you show us a trick shot?

123
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,070
We prepared one as an opening performance.

124
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,638
-You have an opening performance?
-Yes.

125
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,740
Also, let me ask you for a favor.

126
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,742
Please succeed quickly, if you can.

127
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,246
-Your back is burning.
-The sun is burning us from behind.

128
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,313
-Sure. You got it.
-Listen, Defconn.

129
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,082
-This is called the "no look shot."
-"No look shot"?

130
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,317
We throw the ball
into the cup without looking.

131
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,953
No need to practice?
You're just going for it?

132
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,022
-No need to practice.
-He's the leader after all.

133
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,324
-He's our leader.
-I can succeed in one shot.

134
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,726
You know what, everybody?

135
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,361
There are a lot of balls.

136
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,096
-You know…
-A lot.

137
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,064
I've never seen this many ping-pong balls.

138
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,066
Let me take off my ring.

139
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,134
PUTTING IT AWAY

140
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,269
You must be nervous.

141
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,336
You must be nervous.

142
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,704
-That ring is quite heavy.
-Okay.

143
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,041
Usually, how many attempts
does it take for you to succeed?

144
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,709
We don't keep count.

145
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,544
-We measure with time.
-We measure with time.

146
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,712
Not the number of attempts?

147
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,080
No, we measure with time.

148
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,715
If you miss, I'll be the leader.

149
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,250
HIS LEADERSHIP IS AT STAKE

150
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,252
-That was good.
-A little to the left.

151
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,654
So you let him know what to do.

152
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,456
-They're like the spotters for a sniper.
-Exactly.

153
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,592
-That's it.
-Oh, no.

154
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,693
A little further.

155
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,795
That was too far.

156
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,530
SO CLOSE

157
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,598
A little to the left.

158
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,534
The nasi goreng looked good
at that place down there.

159
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,835
It was a Vietnamese restaurant.

160
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,903
-That's right.
-Yes.

161
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,038
LEADER QUIETLY KEEPS TRYING

162
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,205
Hey! That was good.

163
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,273
It hit the table again.

164
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,009
-The camera.
-Don't hit the camera.

165
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,979
To be honest,
what matters is that we tried a lot.

166
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,881
It's not that we're very skilled.

167
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:15,948
NEVER SAID WE'RE GOOD AT THIS

168
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,817
Come on. That was way off.

169
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,086
What do you mean it was way off?

170
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,390
SUCCEEDS ON HIS 18TH ATTEMPT

171
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,994
IT TOOK ONLY 1 MINUTE

172
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,595
-That was super quick.
-It was.

173
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,697
See. I knew it.

174
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,031
I knew the leader could do it.

175
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,000
This time, I'll use a ping-pong ball

176
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,302
to bounce on cups, and then, make a goal.

177
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,305
DONG-GUK'S SPECIALTY:
BOUNCING A PING-PONG BALL ON CUPS

178
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,873
Is this how it will go?

179
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,408
-That's right.
-Yes.

180
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,378
-It looks tough.
-Gosh, this is impossible.

181
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,547
-It's impossible.
-I'll try.

182
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,715
It's impossible.

183
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,550
NEWBIE TRIES

184
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,984
I'll try three times.

185
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,755
That wasn't even close.

186
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,823
How was it?

187
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,625
I just want to go home.

188
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,993
LAUGHING DESPONDENTLY

189
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,328
This is impossible.

190
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,396
COUNTING ON DONG-GUK

191
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,264
-Here I go. Let me try…
-Okay.

192
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,033
-This is Chrome Hearts.
-Oh, boy.

193
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,069
THE SOURCE OF HIS CONFIDENCE
SHINES FROM HIS WRIST

194
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,137
It's Chrome Hearts.

195
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,538
He dressed up today.

196
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,807
Let's not groan at one another's failure.

197
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,576
Okay.

198
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,643
NO MORE GROANING

199
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,380
Okay. I think I got a feel for it.

200
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,081
You're wearing that bracelet. You should.

201
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,950
You need to give it your all.

202
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,551
Does it not look like he is?

203
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,953
He wasn't just now.

204
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,155
-I'm doing it for real now.
-It's time.

205
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,593
HE SAID HE WOULD AND HE DID

206
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,660
What the heck?

207
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,798
SUCCESS

208
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,133
Do you have more cups?

209
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,267
BOLDER AFTER SUCCEEDING

210
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,635
-Get more cups.
-Shall we go for it?

211
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,737
You can set up dozens more.

212
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,406
What's our schedule today, President?

213
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,974
-We have three steps prepared.
-Okay.

214
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,041
First,

215
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,710
we are going to do
the "water bottle flip."

216
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,778
Second,

217
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,614
we are going to each use
a fork to move around a piece of fruit.

218
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,618
Third, we are going to simultaneously
throw 10 ping-pong balls into cups.

219
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,219
Let's succeed as quickly as we can.

220
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,521
Going home is our goal.

221
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,722
Do you have a chant?

222
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,856
We do have a chant.

223
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,924
-Tell us.
-Ours?

224
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,460
-"We are TricKOR." That's what we do.
-TricKOR!

225
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,529
-Here we go.
-One, two, three.

226
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,798
-We are TricKOR!
-We are TricKOR!

227
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:12,899
Let's go!

228
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,801
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
14:30 DOING TRICK SHOTS

229
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,836
We'll flip the water bottles in a relay.

230
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,371
We have to flip the bottles in order.

231
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,406
At the end,
we have do it again at the same time.

232
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,707
We can't go home then.

233
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,810
This is too much for us.

234
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,278
Can you please drink some water

235
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,746
from the bottles before you

236
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,815
and leave about three
to four spaces at the top?

237
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,883
Technically speaking,
about one-third is good.

238
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,118
-About a third?
-Yes.

239
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,453
-One moment.
-It stands well.

240
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,223
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

241
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,627
PREPARING THE EQUIPMENT

242
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,530
-You have to drink a lot.
-Yes, you do.

243
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,699
Who should start first?

244
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,034
How should the order go?

245
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,303
The person who is not good at it
should go first.

246
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,038
Then, you should go first.

247
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,040
-Can I go first?
-Okay. That's fine.

248
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,641
-The leader should be second.
-Okay.

249
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,809
Build up expectations.

250
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,211
It's like a penalty shoot-out.

251
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,278
That's right.

252
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,280
-Does my hand go like this?
-Here I go.

253
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,115
I'll go again.

254
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,818
THE FIRST WATER BOTTLE
IS SO DIFFICULT

255
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,587
I think you've done this a lot.

256
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,026
SIGHING

257
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,197
FEELING AWKWARD

258
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,599
Listen. I'm sorry.

259
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,267
But you're so bad at it.

260
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,536
-But…
-He's so bad at it.

261
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,439
-I'll take it easy.
-You're the only one who should.

262
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,573
Take it easy.

263
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,641
Okay.

264
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,643
Yes!

265
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,711
FAIL

266
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,679
-Come on, man.
-Don't do that.

267
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,747
I'll do it.

268
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,349
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

269
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,717
You're going to go third.

270
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,086
It's because he's feeling very burdened.

271
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,187
I'm scared.

272
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,321
Do you feel burdened?

273
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,456
-Do you?
-Yes.

274
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,524
I'm scared now.

275
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,058
-No criticizing.
-No criticizing.

276
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,294
I'm sorry, but that's how
we get footage for the show.

277
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:49,829
I'm doing it on purpose.

278
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,132
Defconn, we can't call each other
names for three to four hours.

279
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,334
You need pressure to perform well.

280
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,402
-That's true.
-All right.

281
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,470
Criticize each other.

282
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,538
-We will.
-Good. Let's go.

283
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,740
Okay.

284
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,174
FAIL

285
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,544
-Why you little…
-Damn it.

286
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,012
-That's too much.
-That's not right.

287
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,380
-You told us to.
-Not like that.

288
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,781
-He told us to.
-Listen, Kil-hyun.

289
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,249
-You told us to.
-Kil-hyun.

290
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,385
Criticism and profanity are different.

291
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,619
SWAP ORDER TO SHIELD PLAYERS

292
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,921
Take your time.

293
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,356
SUCCESS

294
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,692
FIRST TIME FEELING PRESSURE

295
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,394
-Hey, man!
-Damn.

296
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,461
Our rising star.

297
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,529
-That's it!
-Wow!

298
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,831
That's it!

299
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,400
SUCCESS

300
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,871
IF THE LAST MEMBER,
SOL-JI, SUCCEEDS…

301
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,340
FAIL

302
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,641
OH, MY GOSH!

303
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,710
BOTTLE FELL AND THE OLDEST,
DONG-GUK, FELL TOO

304
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,313
What have you done? We're doomed!

305
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,148
We're doomed because of him!

306
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,183
Sol-ji! Come on, man!

307
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,718
Excuse me. You have to do a headspin.

308
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,353
THE REASON WHY IS HE TELLING HIM
TO DO A HEADSPIN IS…

309
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,622
WHILE SHOWING OFF
HIS BREAKDANCING SKILLS

310
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,125
THE SOUND OF HIS SHOULDER
BREAKING WHILE DANCING

311
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,760
ACTING LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED

312
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,195
Is your shoulder okay?

313
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,863
Bump into it again.

314
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,632
Just break the floor!

315
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,700
We were almost there.

316
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,767
THE LAST ONE MUST ACCEPT CRITICISM

317
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:02,835
Then,

318
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,004
-let's swap the order again.
-Okay.

319
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,472
NEWBIE TAKES THE LAST SPOT

320
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,341
-Show us how it's done.
-I will.

321
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,442
Stay calm, Nucksal.

322
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,843
-Nice.
-Good job.

323
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,511
Okay. Nice.

324
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,613
Come on. That's it.

325
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,314
-That's it.
-The fifth.

FAIL

327
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,151
Sol-ji, are you kidding me?

328
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,419
SOL-JI MESSED UP AGAIN

329
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,822
He's the weakest link!

330
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,290
Let me see how you use your hand. Show me.

331
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,891
UP CLOSE INSTRUCTION

332
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,526
Look. This is what you do.

333
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,162
You need to pull it towards yourself.

334
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,263
You need to pull it.

335
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,365
-That's it!
-Okay!

336
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,666
No more messing around.

337
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,900
-Okay.
-Be serious.

338
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,404
SERIOUSLY TRYING AGAIN

339
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,605
DOESN'T WANT TO STAND

340
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,673
It's okay.

341
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,174
You're really bad at this.

342
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,609
You can't get it to stand.

343
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,346
What are you insinuating?

344
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,382
IN SHOCK

345
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,017
You can't get it to stand.

346
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,284
I have a child.

347
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,020
I can get it to stand.

348
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,087
He meant this.

349
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,289
-He meant the water bottle.
-The water bottle.

350
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,357
PRIDE AT STAKE NOW

351
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,426
-Okay. Go.
-That's it.

352
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,495
All right. There you go.

353
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,562
NO ISSUES SO FAR

354
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,532
Gosh, darn it.

355
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,601
NOT THEIR PROBLEM

356
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,069
Go!

357
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,570
FAIL

358
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,638
Come on!

359
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,973
I quit! I quit!

360
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,042
-What did you say to me earlier?
-You can't get it to stand?

361
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,677
What did you say earlier?

362
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,479
-If he wasn't my immediate senior…
-All right.

363
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,448
-I would've said something.
-Everyone.

364
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,250
-Calm down.
-Okay.

365
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,552
I really feel the pressure of this spot.

366
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,721
You have to overcome it.

367
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,156
LOST TRACK OF ATTEMPT NUMBER

368
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,223
Okay.

369
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:33,926
FLOP DOWN

370
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,094
No, don't criticize him.

371
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,395
Don't say anything to him.

372
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,664
HE WAS THE ONE
WHO CRITICIZED HIM THE MOST

373
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,533
Don't say anything to our Sol-ji!

374
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,600
Don't say a word.

375
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,536
He was the one
who criticized him the most.

376
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,371
The pressure from this is really intense.

377
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,140
You have to go through it to understand.

378
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,842
HEY HEY

379
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,910
Experience it yourself.

380
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,044
-Defconn.
-Okay. Nice.

381
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,212
RECOMMENDS THE PRESSURE SPOT

382
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,347
Shall we start from here now?

383
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,116
-Shall we start from there?
-From there?

384
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,184
Start from there?

385
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,885
Was this a scenery change?

386
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:00,953
Just for scenery's sake?

387
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,888
Okay. No more joking around from now on.

388
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,658
RESTART WITH THE INITIAL STARTER,
NUCKSAL

389
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,526
Oh, no!

390
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,562
What was that sound?

391
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,363
What the heck?

392
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,399
I don't know
who the weakest link is anymore.

393
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,467
That's it.

394
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,235
Nice.

395
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,903
I knew it.

396
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,372
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO SUCCEED ANYWAY

397
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,041
Oh, okay.

398
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,210
Defconn has made
the atmosphere very scary,

399
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,078
so I feel pressured.

400
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,947
I think that was the issue.

401
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,782
-That's it.
-Good.

402
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,117
Good.

403
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,485
This is nerve-racking.

404
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,957
IF THE LEADER SUCCEEDS!

405
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,024
-Okay!
-Wait!

406
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,427
-Okay!
-Wait!

407
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,595
-Make way.
-All together.

408
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,896
-All together.
-All together.

409
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,631
-Let's do it all together.
-All together.

410
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,832
I'll count to three.

411
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,501
One, two, three.

412
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,670
FAIL, FAIL, FAIL

413
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,639
Who was it? Whose is it?

414
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,674
The leader, me, and Nucksal.

415
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,510
-Then, we failed.
-We did well.

416
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,912
What if only one person fails?

417
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,648
If just one person fails…

418
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,517
-What are we?
-We are one.

419
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,452
One, two, three.

420
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,287
THEY ATTEMPT WITH ONE MIND

421
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,523
Whose is it?

422
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,525
-You guys.
-It's the three of us.

423
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,827
-I'm sorry.
-To be honest,

424
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,762
-do you know what I was thinking?
-That was close.

425
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,330
I hoped that I wouldn't fail alone.

426
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,332
-Right.
-Yeah.

427
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,400
I hoped that we would fail together.

428
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,468
Maybe about two or three.

429
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,636
-That's it.
-Please.

430
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,538
One, two, three.

431
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,674
HE FAILED ALONE

432
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,742
WAIT FOR ME

433
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,810
Thank goodness!

434
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,245
I'm so relieved. I'm so relieved.

435
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,313
Thank you so much!

436
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,414
-So relieved.
-Thanks.

437
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,749
-Good job.
-Thank you.

438
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,117
"MUTUAL SALVATION"

439
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,185
Let's try again now.

440
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,486
One, two, three.

441
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,592
THEY SUCCEEDED IN FLIPPING
THE BOTTLES SIMULTANEOUSLY!

442
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,127
THE SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT

443
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,895
AFTER ALL THE TRIALS
AND HARDSHIPS

444
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,864
-Gosh!
-That was a piece of cake!

445
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,132
It was nothing.

446
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,533
-It was nothing.
-Wow!

447
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,869
Come on. That was a piece of cake.

448
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:57,937
NONCHALANT TOSS

449
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,004
A PRO AFTER IT'S OVER

450
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,372
-What?
-Nice.

451
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,374
-You've gotten better.
-Go up there and do it.

452
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,210
-On the floor.
-Of course.

453
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,277
HUGE PROGRESS IN FLIPPING

454
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,612
How about that?

455
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,947
I got chills after doing it!

456
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,248
I got chills after doing it!

457
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,550
It's so exciting when you succeed.

458
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,619
That's why we do it.

459
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,821
When we all did it at the end,

460
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,889
it was like "Wow!"

461
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,023
I got goose bumps.

462
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,092
My gosh. The feeling you get…

463
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,128
I keep wanting to attempt it
because of that feeling.

464
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:28,300
2ND LEVEL:
FORK IN HALLABONG CHALLENGE

465
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,304
-Let's go for it.
-Right away?

466
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,472
-I'm nervous.
-Let's go.

467
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,573
THRILLING NEW CHALLENGE

468
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,041
We are

469
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,010
-TricKOR!
-KOR!

470
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,179
No, it's "Trick Shot Korea!"

471
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,247
It's "We are TricKOR."

472
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,314
Yes, it's that.

473
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,382
Come on, man.

474
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,817
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HIS OWN TEAM'S CHANT

475
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,951
He's unbelievable.

476
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,721
You haven't been here in a long time.

477
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,123
-He just came up with that.
-That's true.

478
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,958
Let's do it in one try, okay?

479
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,126
-Let's do it in one attempt.
-One, two…

480
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,227
One, two, three.

481
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,795
SUCCEEDS

482
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,297
Oh, boy.

483
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,834
-Gosh, it got on my face.
-It's a facial mist.

484
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,102
It's a hallabong mist.

485
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,505
ALL-NATURAL FACIAL MIST

486
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,108
I could see it just now
because of the sunlight.

487
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,644
I saw a rainbow just now.

488
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,312
All right. One, two, three. Get ready.

489
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,147
PASS

490
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,548
OH?

491
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,952
THE JUICE SPRAYS EVERYWHERE

492
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,087
This one is especially juicy.

493
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,722
It's quite juicy.

494
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,825
We can do it, right?

495
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,527
-We're Trick…
-Trick…

496
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,596
IT'S "WE ARE TRICKOR"

497
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,765
It's "We're" in English, Defconn.

498
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,832
It's "We are."

499
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,567
You can't start with Korean.

500
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,303
Let's go. One, two, three.

501
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,772
EASY

502
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,440

NICE

506
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,212
THEY MIGHT SUCCEED AT THIS RATE?

507
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,681
HEAVE-HO

508
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,350
FAILED THE 3RD ATTEMPT
REASON: THE YOUNGEST

509

What are you doing?

510
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,386
He threw it badly.

511
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,255
-Pass it well.
-This was planned.

512
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,157
The thrill…

513
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,325
It was so thrilling.

514
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,993
It was flying back and forth before me.

515
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,862
The thrill I just felt was like

516
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:08,100
the thrill I felt when Ok-sun
confessed her feelings on I am Solo.

517
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,301
That's how thrilled I was.

518
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,536
This one is fun.

519
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,603
This one's fun.

520
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,405
It's very exciting.

521
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,606
Gosh, it's exciting.

522
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,674

-Darn.

531
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,024
The fork?

532
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,361
What? You caught the fork?

533
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,830
-How did that get stuck there?
-What's this?

534
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,198
How did that happen?

535
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,666
That's incredible.

536
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,967
Ready.

537
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,702
LEADER'S QUICK SUCCESS

538
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,870
PASS

539
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:45,938
HEAVE-HO

540
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006
NICE

541
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,073
PASS

542
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,808
HERE YOU GO, OUR YOUNGEST!

543
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,744
WILL HE FAIL AGAIN?

544
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,179
HE FINALLY SUCCEEDS

545
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,749
IF HE CATCHES THIS,
THEY SUCCEED!

546
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,751
DONE

547
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,522
THEY SUCCEED IN THE FORK
IN HALLABONG CHALLENGE!

548
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,424
My goodness! It's beautiful!

549
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,292
THE 7 FORKS STABBED IT PERFECTLY

550
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,294
-Shall we take a photo to commemorate it?
-Yes.

551
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,631
-We are TricKOR!
-TricKOR!

552
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,968
WE DELICIOUSLY TOOK CARE
OF THE HALLABONG

553
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,903
The third level involves a ping-pong ball.

554
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,139
-Only one person among us has to succeed.
-Okay!

555
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,407
-That's better.
-We can do it.

556
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,775
-Make someone a hero.
-Yes.

557
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:27,679
3RD LEVEL:
10 PING-PONG BALL CHALLENGE

558
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,215
IT EVEN TOOK TRICKOR 2 WEEKS
TO COMPLETE THIS TRICK SHOT

559
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,953
WHO WILL BE THE HERO TODAY?

560
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,123
Just one person needs to complete this.

561
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,958
-Yes.
-That's right.

562
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,094
It makes sense to just have one person.

563
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,196
Why don't you give it a shot?

564
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,831
Our brave Chrome Hearts will try.

565
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,435
It's leaning.

566
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,203
How many? Three?

567
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,504
You did very badly.

568
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,839
"You did very badly."

569
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,140
DISAPPOINTING RESULTS

570
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,010
How can the demonstrator
only get three balls in?

571
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,978
Okay, I'll give it a shot first.

572
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,814
You can just end the challenge.

573
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,283
LIFT

574
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,585
I can tell that he isn't going to make it.

575
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,454
I don't have to look
to know that he'll fail.

576
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,827
ONLY THE ECHOING SOUND
OF BOUNCING PING-PONG BALLS

577
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,628
-I can't do it.
-Defconn.

578
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,530
You see…

579
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,132
MUST EXPERIENCE IT TO KNOW

580
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,134
Give it a shot, Nucksal. It isn't easy.

581
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,936
BENDING OVER

582
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,037
GETTING THE ANGLE RIGHT

583
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,338
-Nice. Very nice.
-Nice.

584
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,973
-The calculating man.
-Zero.

585
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,808
SHOUT!

586
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,212
NUCKSAL FAILS AT HIS ATTEMPT

587
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,114
You end up looking like
a dummy, don't you?

588
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,615
Didn't I look really dumb?

589
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,851
I have to spill it, like you said.

590
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,786
One, two, three.

591
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,355
I thought you'd make it.

592
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,990
He's from Cheongju all right.

593
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,058
-How many?
-Hardly any.

594
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,126
It isn't possible.

595
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,427
He's attempting from afar.

596
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,230
Focused as if he were writing
his dissertation.

597
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:55,534
THEY KEEP FAILING AND FAILING

598
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,670
SCREAMING

599
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,738
Darn it!

600
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,240
RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE

601
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,608
It doesn't make any sense.

602
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,210
It doesn't make sense
to try to get all 10 balls into the cups.

603
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,479
Our performance
doesn't really guarantee anything,

604
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,848
so I wonder if we'll be
able to do it today.

605
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,884
Gosh, we definitely can't do it.

606
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,919
It isn't a mission
that can end in a short time.

607
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,788
Should I tell my wife that
I won't be coming home today?

608
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,491
RE-RE-RE-RE-RETRY

609
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,962
You know what? I'm starting to wonder,
"Why am I even doing this?"

610
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,697
All of a sudden, I started wondering that.

611
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,667
The fact that you're doing this
feels like a dream.

612
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,903
THE CRUEL REALITY IS THAT
THEY MUST SUCCEED TO GO HOME

613
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,070
My eyes will be closed.

614
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,639
WHAT FOR?

615
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,842
You should have kept them open.

616
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,410
I should've kept them open.

617
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,478
Should've been open.

618
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,079
It was a good attempt though.

619
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,581
-You looked cool.
-Yes.

620
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,049
Who will become the hero?

621
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,385
I hope it's me. I hope I become the hero.

622
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,220
What if I end it now?

623
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,156
Everybody is thinking that.

624
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,025
-I hope I'm the hero.
-Me.

625
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,259
I'm the hero.

626
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,327
Do it.

627
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,463
It wasn't close at all.

628
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,531
It wasn't close.

629
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,266
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO REGRET

630
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,601
Hey.

631
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,136
That was wrong.

632
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,671
That was wrong, man!

633
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,306
-Come on.
-Our screen time.

634
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,574
He's taking our screen time.

635
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,943
I was trying to pick up the balls.

636
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,010
BRAVE GUY IS READY

637
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,179
He's trying to make it look cool.

638
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,181
Make an arc. Go.

639
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,325
EVEN IN REPLAY,
THAT WAS A CLEAN SHOT

640
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,928
THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THEIR EYES

641
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,431
BRAVE DONG-GUK
IS SURPRISED AS WELL

642
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,199
EYES WIDE OPEN

643
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,201
-How did he do that?
-Dong-guk!

644
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,003
-I got chills!
-Victory toss.

645
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,271
Toss him into the air.

646
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,472
TIME FOR A VICTORY TOSS

647
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,474
Go down.

648
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,976
TOSS THIS

649
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,813
TODAY'S HERO, THE BRAVE DONG-GUK

650
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,715
We succeeded much faster than I expected.

651
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,285
I remember succeeding after two days,

652
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,954
but I am amazed
at how quickly I succeeded today.

653
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,092
-My hero.
-Thank you.

654
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,560
I love you.

655
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,230
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
16:30 WRAP-UP GATHERING

656
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,100
-Park Dong-guk is paying!
-Yeah!

657
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,268
Enjoy the food.

658
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,404
THIS MEAL WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IF HE DID NOT SUCCEED

659
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,772
Wait, one moment.

660
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,073
Dong-guk should go first.

661
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,809
Pour him a drink.

662
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:18,877
-Dong-guk.
-It's okay.

663
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,379
You should eat first.

664
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:21,980
THE HERO EATS FIRST

665
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,148
Very nice!

666
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,650
-That looked sexy too.
-How is it?

667
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,319
Are there other trick-shot clubs in Korea?

668
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,787
-I think there were some.
-We shall see.

669
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:29,855
-Not many.
-None.

670
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,924
There were some
that attempted to have one,

671
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,526
-but they gave up…
-Not anymore.

672
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,594
…after they got tired.

673
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,062
-It takes too long.
-Right.

674
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,964
You said it was difficult.

675
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,199
No matter how close you are
with your club members,

676
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,868
I wonder if you ever fought.

677
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,804
We used to egg each other on and stuff.

678
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,906
But we found that some words
should be banned

679
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,274
as we spent time working together.

680
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,676
Really? What words are banned?

681
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,977
No egging each other on?

682
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,946
For example,
when I was flipping the bottle,

683
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,448
-you did this, Defconn.
-Like this.

684
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,816
You can't do that.

685
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,051
You can't touch.

686
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,253
-When you told me what to do--
-Touching your hand?

687
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,321
If I had known…

688
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,989
You went too far. Apologize to him.

689
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,258
-Hold hands.
-You should hold hands.

690
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,659
USE YOUR HAND TO RECONCILE TOO

691
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,163
I'm really sorry,
but I really wanted to teach you earlier.

692
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,332
To be honest.

693
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,599
That's how I felt.

694
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,535
-Anyway, be good.
-Okay.

695
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,636
COUNSELED WITH HELD HANDS

696
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,105
In the end, you need to do better.

697
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,808
Anyway, have you ever gotten hurt?

698
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,810
Dong-guk got hurt a lot.

699
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,278
While we were doing jegichagi,

700
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,215
we had one attempt to kick it
into a goal very far away.

701
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,516
We had to put weight on it,

702
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,985
so we added some coins
and other stuff to it.

703
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:38,123
The top of my foot
started throbbing little by little.

704
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,191
For a few days--

705
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,093
Why did you have to do it?

706
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,160
AN INNOCENT QUESTION

707
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,395
Why did you have to do it?

708
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,364
I'm sure many people are wondering that.

709
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,133
-I think it is a battle against myself.
-That's it.

710
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,801
It's like beating

711
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,269
-the challenges of life.
-Right.

712
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,439
-That's right.
-I must beat it to level up.

713
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,641
-You do it for that reason.
-That's right.

714
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,745
What is most memorable in trick shots
is when we succeed.

715
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:03,081
The moment when the ping-pong ball
hits the water as we expected.

716
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,083
That scene hits us very strongly.

717
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,419
And even in that same moment,
each one of us feels

718
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,087
a different level of excitement

719
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,256
and we differ in what thrills us.

720
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,791
It's my first time doing trick shots.

721
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,226
Do you know what I'm thinking now?

722
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,194
-Stab this…
-Me too.

723
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,562
-I was going to--
-Stab this

724
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,464
and throw it into that cup over there.

725
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,733
-Yes, I was thinking that too.
-Stab it and throw it.

726
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,235
I keep thinking like that.

727
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,403
I wasn't the only one.

728
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,104
You've become like us.

729
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,773
-You're into trick shots now.
-I know.

730
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,574
It wasn't just me. You were like that too.

731
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,278
When you succeed
after multiple failed attempts,

732
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,280
you get dangerously excited.

733
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,716
The fact that we can beat the odds
and make the shot.

734
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,251
That is what's alluring about it.

735
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,318
It's thrilling.

736
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,087
It feels like you won the lottery.

737
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,522
Though I've never won.

738
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,890
The sense of accomplishment

739
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,525
and the close bond is amazing.

740
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,627
It's very difficult to do,

741
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:52,097
but in the end, you'll remember
the moments when you succeeded.

742
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,366
I think that is
what's most alluring about it.
