00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,179
Hello, Netflix Club members!

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,415
Each week, with the eyes of a bird,

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,818
I check out the best clubs in Korea.

8
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,653
I'm the newbie who's crazy about clubs.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,423
This is Defconn of Newbie in the Club.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,725
The club that I am visiting today

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,661
has a huge amount of members
who have joined.

12
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,729
It's a futsal club.

13
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:30,797
THE MOST POPULAR SPORTS ACTIVITY

14
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,032
Where's the president?

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,833
-Oh, that would be me.
-Are you the president?

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,468
KIM DONG-MIN, CLUB PRESIDENT

17
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,736
Please introduce your club.

18
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:40,273
-We are Longkick United.
-Yes.

19
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,842
Our goal is not to get injured
and play for a long time.

20
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,278
We have a little over 190 members.

21
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,980
-Over 190 members?
-Yes.

22
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,049
Who has been a member for the longest?

23
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,184
-Among us, perhaps it's Gun-ho.
-Among you.

24
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,086
-It's Hee-kyoung.
-The two of us.

25
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,121
-It's these two.
-We joined at the same time.

26
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,222
You joined by yourself?

27
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,357
No, with my husband.

28
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,492
-With your husband?
-Yes.

29
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,795
Our club mostly consists
of married couples.

30
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:02,862
They're married.

31
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,497
-Are you two married?
-Yes, we are.

32
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,433
-These two are married too.
-Wow!

33
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:07,834
-They're brothers.
-The three.

34
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,935
The three brothers.

35
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,136
-Really?
-Yes.

36
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,472
Family members usually
don't enjoy the same hobbies together.

37
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,340
It isn't easy for married couples.

38
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,575
What about your wife?

39
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,545
My wife is waiting for me
in that place over there.

40
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,712
Honey!

41
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,015
Oh, my. I am sorry.

42
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,316
He should be calling you that.

43
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,384
PRESIDENT'S HONEY

44
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,652
Shouldn't she join us?

45
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,053
Rather than play with us,

46
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,955
she supports us by washing our vests.

47
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,023
That's right.

48
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,291
APPLAUDING HER HARD WORK

49
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,992
-She washes your vests?
-Yes.

50
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,294
Are you a student?

51
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,396
SMILING FROM EAR TO EAR

52
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,198
-What is it?
-She was born in 1998.

53
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,466
-She's married.
-She is.

54
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,867
-Already?
-She's married.

55
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,302
-Her husband is a member too.
-Where?

56
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,369
-Today…
-He didn't come today.

57
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,437
-He didn't?
-No.

58
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,239
My gosh. This place is…

59
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,808
-Do you all look young because of futsal?
-That's right.

60
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,944
You look like you're in your mid-twenties.

61
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,979
-I'm 33 years old.
-You are?

62
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,948
-What about your wife?
-I'm a year younger.

63
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,149
Weren't you in your twenties?

64
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,017
Right? Because we stay so active,

65
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,120
I think it has a youthful effect on us.

66
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,188
In the case of married couples,

67
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,990
do you ever say after a match together,

68
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,592
"Why did you do that earlier?"

69
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,193
I get scolded a lot on our way home.

70
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,928
How does she scold you?

71
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,531
She'd scold me for passing the ball badly.

72
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,665
Do you guys not fight?

73
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,967
-We fight.
-How?

74
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,935
If we get into a fight,

75
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,570
we ask Dong-min to split us up.

76
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,706
They contact me personally.

77
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,274
"Please split us up this week."

78
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,342
IMMEDIATE PETITION

79
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,010
-They fought.
-I can tell right away.

80
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,412
I wish they would reconcile
when they get here.

81
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,815
Firstly, I would message Dong-min

82
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,283
to ask him to split us up.

83
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,419
Then, we would play rough
on opposing teams.

84
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,222
I would make a powerful shot
against my husband.

85
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,057
Then, he would come to his senses.

86
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,628
We go in when they are done, don't we?

87
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,795
-That's right.
-Right?

88
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,566
How many times do you play in a week?

89
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,302
As for me, I play
around four to five times.

90
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,171
But some play more often than me.

91
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,338
How many times a week?

92
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,974
-Really?
-She plays all week.

93
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,476
-All week?
-Almost every day.

94
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,312
Then, do you
get together almost every day?

95
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,514
We play on Fridays,
Saturdays, and Sundays.

96
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,249
-Is there another team?
-Yes.

97
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,450
You play in two different teams.

98
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,653
What do you do for work?

99
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,989
I used to be a developer at an IT company

100
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,724
and gave lectures as well,

101
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,493
but I have started an academy now.

102
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,361
When you're self-employed,

103
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,596
you have more time.

104
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,997
Her time is used for herself.

105
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,833
-Nice!
-Director of an academy! Nice!

106
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,901
I MAKE MY OWN TIME FOR FUTSAL

107
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,104
After I started playing futsal,
I came to love it.

108
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,641
When I found out that the games
are scheduled on any day of the week,

109
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,712
I wanted to find a job
where I could freely adjust my schedule,

110
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,614
so I decided to start an academy.

111
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,649
Since I can adjust my time at the academy,

112
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,385
I can play futsal whenever I want.

113
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,553
SHE STARTED AN ACADEMY
TO PLAY FUTSAL

114
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,788
Who's this guy?

115
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,256
He's my son.

116
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,325
-She's your mom?
-Yes.

117
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,559
-Really?
-He's a member.

118
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,694
-Really?
-He plays too.

119
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,096
-How old are you?
-I'm in ninth grade.

120
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,698
-Third year?
-He's 16.

121
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,701
Did you want to play
or were you forced to play?

122
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,470
-Well, I play because I want to.
-Really?

123
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,005
How long have you been married?

124
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,074
We've been married for three years.

125
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,542
-Three years?
-Yes.

126
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,377
How did you end up playing together?

127
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,613
I didn't have any hobbies,

128
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,682
so we didn't
get along that well in the beginning.

129
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,451
-Because you had no hobby?
-Yes.

130
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:15,722
But I think it's nice to
go along with the person who has a hobby.

131
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,590
You were already playing futsal?

132
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,459
-Yes, I had been playing it.
-And then?

133
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,461
As I accompanied him,

134
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,263
I started playing with him.

135
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,231
We used to have nothing to talk about.

136
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,299
Exactly.

137
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,067
But now, on our way home,

138
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,837
I can say things like,
"Why didn't you pass me the ball?"

139
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,839
Even when we get into a fight,

140
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,041
I feel all better

141
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,243
when he assists me with a goal. Really.

142
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:42,148
-I was hoping that my wife would enjoy it.
-That's right.

143
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,417
I kind of support her a lot
during the game.

144
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,219
If I linger in front of the goal post,

145
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,321
he'd bounced it off my leg
to set me up for the goal.

146
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,024
He wanted me to know
what scoring a goal felt like.

147
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,059
-Isn't that right?
-Yes.

148
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,096
-Your husband is the club's president.
-Yes.

149
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,931
He keeps going to play futsal.

150
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,266
How does that seem to you?

151
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,334
WHAT IS IT LIKE?

152
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,569
-I like that he is very passionate, but…
-But?

153
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,906
I always tell single people

154
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,175
that they should marry someone
with no hobby.

155
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,810
DRIBBLING DOWN

156
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,278
He spit it out.

157
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,579
His reaction is real.

158
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,183
Listen, that is so hilarious.

159
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,085
She is right, you know.

160
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,720
Meet a man with no hobby.

161
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,356
Why don't you play futsal?

162
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,391
I don't know why I have to run around.

163
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,360
That is how she feels.

164
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,028
How did you two get married?

165
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,130
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

166
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,567
How did you end up marrying him
if you didn't love him?

167
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,235
HE ASKS AFTER HER ICY COLD REPLY

168
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,372
The two of you are so different,

169
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,140
so how did you end up marrying him?

170
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,377
The fact that he has
so much passion for something…

171
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,713
How should I put it?

172
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,780
Were you tricked?

173
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,015
No, I wasn't tricked.

174
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,618
It wasn't terribly hard for me
or anything like that.

175
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,686
I see.

176
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,954
THANKFULLY, IT ENDS NICELY

177
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,057
She may speak coldly about him,

178
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,592
but she does love him.

179
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,695
-It's time for us to go.
-Go where?

180
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,397
-We need to play.
-We have to play.

181
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,532
-You go ahead.
-We aren't at a café.

182
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,434
-I'll see you later.
-No. You have to come.

183
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,635
TIME TO ENJOY FUTSAL

184
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,137

THE PRESIDENT IS THE WHISTLE

191
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,683
-Kick it up.
-Nice.

192
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,785
Defconn, get ready to advance.

193
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,820
Wait. Block him. What are you doing?

194
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,422
Mine!

195
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,057
That was close.

196
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,458
-Nice!
-Nice!

197
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,026
-Nice.
-Nice.

198
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,129
-Defend this. At the corner.
-Defense.

199
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,265
-Nice cut.
-Okay.

200
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,334
-Good job.
-Good.

201
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,404
Wait. Why are you guys so fast?

202
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,471
SHOWERED WITH PRAISE
FOR EVERY MOVE

203
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,672
PRESIDENT KIM'S SHOT

204
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,807
BLUE TEAM'S CUT

205
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,108
Nice, Doo-roo.

206
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,244
-Defconn.
-Defconn.

207
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,179
Get it. Hurry!

208
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,614
SHOOTS RIGHT AWAY

209
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,681
NEWBIE SHOOTS

210
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,783
That's it!

211
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,687
NEWBIE AND HEE-KYOUNG'S TEAMWORK
LED TO THE GOAL

212
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,089
NEWBIE'S SURPRISE ASSIST

213
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,324
-You assisted!
-Let's go!

214
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,994
Honey!

215
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,362
WHO'S HIS HONEY?

216
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,164
HEE-KYOUNG'S CONCENTRATION
PAYS OFF WITH A GOAL

217
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,632
Great positioning, Hee-kyoung.

218
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,835
BREATHING HEAVILY

219
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,136
ONE GOAL AND HE'S DRAINED

220
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,204
You guys are running too fast.

221
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,539
You're doing so great!

222
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,441
-The ball is too fast.
-Doing great.

223
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,909
THEY SHUT THE NEWBIE UP
WITH PRAISES

224
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:23,976
UNLIKE NEWBIE, THEY'RE FIRED UP

225
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,212
-Hee-kyoung.
-Wow! Nice.

226
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,914
Good.

227
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,449
Nice. Good job!

228
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,917
Nice!

229
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,053
DESPITE BEING OUT OF BREATH,
THEY KEEP THE ENERGY UP

230
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,621
DOO-ROO

231
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,790
-Nice!
-Nice, Doo-roo!

232
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,025
GUARDING

233
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,860
Hey, Doo-roo!

234
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:41,928
AMAZED BY DOO-ROO'S FOOTWORK

235
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,096
Doo-roo is off the charts right now!

236
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,998
-Nice, Doo-roo.
-That was insane, Doo-roo.

237
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,099
INSANE DOO-ROO

238
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,167
Run, Doo-roo!

239
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,368
-There's nobody?
-No.

240
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,570
DOO-ROO CONSISTENTLY
STEALS THE BALL

241
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,637
-Go.
-Shoot, Doo-roo!

242
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:52,705
Nice!

243
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,773
GOOD DEFENSE

244
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,841
-Nice!
-Nice!

245
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,276
ANOTHER GOOD DEFENSE

246
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,545
-Nice!
-Yu Tak-o is awesome!

247
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,646
Oh, no.

248
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,747
Tak-o!

249
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,050
TAK-O BLOCKS ALL THE SHOTS

250
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,117
Tak-o!

251
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,586
Nice, Tak-o!

252
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,787
Yu Tak-o!

253
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,522
You're the best, Tak-o!

254
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,057
Well done, honey!

255
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,426
THANKS TO THE OTHERS,
NEWBIE GETS TO TAKE A BREAK

256
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,761
-Go on the offense, Defconn.
-Offense?

257
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,129
-Go on the offense.
-Right here. Come on!

258
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,197
Defconn!

259
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,832
Okay. Let's go.

260
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,401
PLODDING ALONG

261
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,104
Good!

262
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,608
Mine. It's mine.

263
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,543
-Nice!
-Sorry.

264
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,011
-Handling.
-Handling.

265
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,246
Let's play from there.

266
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,814
I'll kick.

267
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,948
I'm tired so I'll kick.

268
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,483
SNEAKING IN A BREAK

269
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,185
Where? Here?

270
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,020
Do we do free kicks?

271
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,688
-He's making rules.
-Since when?

272
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,023
He's making rules.

273
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,359
THEY LET NEWBIE DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS

274
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,060
-Can I kick it up?
-Yes, you can.

275
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,196
Nice!

276
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,264
BALL LANDS NEAR THE GOAL

277
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,331
He knows how to do it.

278
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,738
SOMEHOW,
HE ASSISTED ANOTHER GOAL

279
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,308
That was my second assist!

280
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,176
Nice, Tak-o!

281
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,646
-Very good.
-Nice assist!

282
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,781
He's good at assists.

283
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,016
-I am.
-You're good.

284
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,717
-When I assist, it works out.
-Your footwork's really sharp!

285
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,085
CONFIDENCE FULLY CHARGED

286
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,954
-You are so good at assisting.
-Okay.

287
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,656
-He assisted Hyung-don well too.
-Right.

288
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,492
I'm exhausted.

289
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,094
-I'm exhausted!
-They are tired.

290
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,529
We're tired too.

291
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,103
PRESIDENT'S SURPRISE
MEDIUM-RANGE GOAL

292
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,439
I knew it. I knew he was exceptional.

293
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,741
HE SHOWS RESPECT FOR

294
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,144
THE PRESIDENT'S SKILL
BY BOWING HIS HEAD

295
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,347
Hey, Dong-min's good.

296
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,983
Hey, Dong-min's good.

297
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,117
He's good.

298
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,253
HE SNEAKILY SITS DOWN
WHILE PRAISING THE PRESIDENT

299
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,288
We're playing really well.

300
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,656
-Did you see?
-We're the best.

301
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,459
HE CAN BARELY STAND HIMSELF UP

302
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,027
-You got this!
-How much time left?

303
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,095
Two minutes!

304
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,163
GAME ENDS IN 2 MINUTES

305
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,565
Over here. Over here.

306
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,567
Go, go, go.

307
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,735
NEWBIE'S LAST SPURT

308
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,437
Here he goes. He's running.

309
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,105
WATCHING NEWBIE RUN FOR A CHANGE

310
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,513
NEWBIE GETS A CHANCE

311
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,250
-Here comes the ball!
-He got it. Shoot!

312
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,488
GOAL!

313
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,290
Shoot.

314
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,325
HOW COULD THIS BE?

315
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,562
-Good job!
-Great assist!

316
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,597
He did it!

317
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,965
SUCCESS DESPITE LOW STAMINA

318
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,302
BIRD GOAL CELEBRATION

319
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,538
RING GOAL CELEBRATION
WITHOUT A RING

320
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,442
-That was a great way to end.
-Good assist.

321
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,144
Gosh. What was that?

322
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,013
-Why is he so good?
-He did it.

323
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,080
That was practice.

324
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,649
BLUE TEAM GOT
DESTROYED BY NEWBIE

325
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,417
Well done!

326
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,485
NEWBIE'S TEAM WINS 4:0

327
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,552
Nice!

328
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,954
-Is it over?
-It's over.

329
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,956
-His debut goal.
-His debut goal.

330
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,225
You passed the test.

331
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,461
HE WALKS ON ALL FOURS IN THE END

332
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,729
-Was I good?
-So good.

333
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,031
THEY PRAISE HIM TO THE END

334
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,133
High five.

335
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,801
EXHAUSTED ALL
HIS ENERGY FOR TODAY

336
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,338
WHEN THINGS ARE TOUGH,
LOOK UP TO THE SKY

337
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,173
He seems a bit weak.

338
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,241
HOW WAS THE NEWBIE?

339
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,043
He's talented,

340
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,612
but I think he has pretty low stamina.

341
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,747
At first, I wanted to be on his team,

342
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,049
but after the first game,

343
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,818
I realized that I would
have to run twice as much

344
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,420
if we were on the same team.

345
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,788
You all did so well.

346
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,289
IT'S FINALLY BREAK TIME

347
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,457
Wait.

348
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:32,992
-Are you two dating?
-They are married.

349
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,360
Oh, you guys are married?

350
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,695
So many married couples here.

351
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,530
-Are you two married?
-No way.

352
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,964
-You aren't?
-No, we aren't.

353
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,132
He just takes a guess.

354
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,436
-He asks, "Are you married?"
-Come on. Don't be too upset.

355
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,371
-They're both in relationships.
-They are.

356
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,039
-Are you seeing someone?
-Yes.

357
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,308
Oh, you're seeing someone? I see.

358
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,210
These two have been married
for less than a year.

359
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,379
-Are you newlyweds?
-Yes, for seven months.

360
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:54,980
How nice.

361
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,148
When you got married,

362
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,685
what was the one trait you looked for
in one another?

363
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,786
-In one another?
-Yes.

364
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,555
You know what?

365
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,789
They are

366
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,858
clearly different from Dong-min's family.

367
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,026
You guys are so lovely.

368
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,661
I was like that too.

369
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,030
Don't they seem different to you?

370
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,098
I only asked a question, and…

371
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,466
SMILING OVER EVERY LITTLE THING

372
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,067
They communicate with their eyes.

373
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,402
-What did you see in her?
-So…

374
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,572
It was things like
sharing a hobby together.

375
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,907
I think that is what I saw in her.

376
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,410
What are the pros and cons
of a married couple

377
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,312
doing this together?

378
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,648
When I don't give her the ball,
we don't fight, but I do get scolded.

379
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,584
-We're the same.
-I see.

380
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,385
-Every couple is the same.
-Yes.

381
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,888
-Do you get upset?
-Come on. Yes.

382
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:37,823
YOU'RE IN THAT HAPPY BUBBLE

383
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,891
You get disappointed.

384
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,860
How long did you date
before getting married?

385
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,961
We dated for two years.

386
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,863
Two years? You dated for a long time.

387
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,865
What about you, Dong-min?

388
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,533
We dated for six years and…

389
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,002
it's our 10th anniversary.

390
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,504
You were together for 16 years.

391
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,972
You must've been young.

392
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,974
When I was in my early twenties,

393
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,610
that lady seduced me.

394
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,547
-She seduced you?
-Not kidding. It's true.

395
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,116
-How did she do it?
-I was in college back then.

396
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,618
And she was making money.

397
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,019
-Is she older?
-Yes.

398
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,189
I left a secret message
in the visitor log of her page on Cyworld.

399
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,091
I wrote, "Treat me to a meal one day."

400
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,194
She lured me in with good food,
but she took me to a private DVD room.

401
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,262
SHE TOOK ME TO A DVD ROOM

402
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,798
SHE WAS WILD BACK THEN

403
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,834
I asked, "What tastes good here?"

404
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,136
HE LOVES STORIES LIKE THIS

405
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,572
COVER YOUR EARS, SON

406
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,940
Did you watch Titanic?

407
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,475
I can't… We didn't really watch the movie.

408
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,010
How can you pay attention?

409
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,378
We couldn't watch it.

410
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,113
The DVD room. That's hilarious.

411
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,881
THE LOVE STORY THAT STARTED
IN A DVD ROOM - THE END

412
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,717
Would you like to get
your boyfriend into the futsal club?

413
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,554
-He already joined.
-He did? Is he here right now?

414
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,189
-He didn't come today.
-He's not here today.

415
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,192
Basically, everyone joins
as a couple here.

416
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,894
When we were first accepting members

417
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,529
and said it was coed,

418
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,031
we got a lot of requests

419
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,400
from people who wanted to join each day,

420
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,534
so we decided

421
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,304
to be a little selective
by accepting only couples

422
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,572
to have an even gender ratio.

423
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,639
But…

424
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,242
I'm sorry. You see,

425
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,477
I host a lot of exciting dating shows.

426
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,279
That's right.

427
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,114
WHAT IS HE TRYING TO ASK?

428
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,482
This is what I want to know.

429
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,319
-Was there ever a couple that joined…
-Yes.

430
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,255
…but got interested in other people?

431
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,090
STARTLED BY THE SPICY QUESTION

432
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,393
NEWBIE IS GOING CRAZY
WITH EXCITEMENT

433
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,195
-That hasn't happened yet.
-It hasn't?

434
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,030
-Not yet.
-Not yet?

435
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,665
You see, what if

436
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,870
a significant other
of the other team plays better?

437
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,204
Have you ever thought about that?

438
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,739
Yes, many times.

439
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,141
COVER YOUR EARS AGAIN, SON

440
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,209
Really?

441
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,379
While playing with your husband,
you want that other guy.

442
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,449
You want that guy to be on your team.

443
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,617
Many times.

444
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,086
Really? That is too funny.

445
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,188
You strongly denied dating her earlier.

446
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,323
The guy wearing
the Manchester United gloves.

447
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,659
I can tell that he's good.

448
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,294
-He's really good.
-He's great.

449
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,829
How did you end up joining?

450
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:02,167
I wanted to join another futsal club, but
the older men in their forties scolded me.

451
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,270
-Really?
-He's right.

452
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,473
If you don't play their way,
the experienced players will scold you.

453
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,310
I've been to two other clubs and
got scolded, so with those hurt feelings,

454
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,345
-I decided to try one last time.
-I'm glad.

455
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,581
Everyone was so nice here.

456
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,083
You went to other clubs and got hurt,

457
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,852
but you recovered when you came here.

458
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,754
He recovers with traditional Korean music.

459
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,223
-He majored in gayageum.
-I did.

460
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,625
He has two older sisters
and the three of them

461
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,693
all majored in gayageum.

462
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,495
Really? Are your sisters married?

463
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,829
GLARING

464
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,132
One is married,
and my second sister isn't married.

465
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,833
Really? I see.

466
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,135
Are you my brother-in-law?

467
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,736
KIM TAE-WAN,
HAS BROTHER-IN-LAW FIGURE

468
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:38,871
Can you make

469
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,606
the gayageum sound with your mouth?

470
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,209
DING DING DING DONG DING

471
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,879
WHY ARE YOU GOOD AT THIS?

472
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,282
Maybe it's because you think of me
as your brother-in-law.

473
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,051
You're doing everything I ask.

474
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,118
SO ACCOMMODATING

475
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,553
Let's play and be safe!

476
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,088
-Let's play!
-Let's go!

477
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,957
-Let's go.
-All right, let's go.

478
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,458
THE NEXT MATCH BEGINS

479
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,526
-Nice!
-Good.

480
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,061
NEWBIE GUARDS THE GOAL POST

481
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,362
Is he the goalkeeper?

482
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,064
-It'll be very painful.
-It will.

483
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,532
Geez, I can finally relax.

484
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,336
Yeah, let me rest here for a bit.

485
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,804
I can't run from the start.

486
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,939
It's too hard.

487
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,007
Nice!

488
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,542
ORANGE TEAM APPROACHES
THE GOAL POST

489
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,043
ALERT TO THE MAX

490
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,713
Goal!

491
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,515
CONCEDES A GOAL
WITHIN A MINUTE OF STARTING

492
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,486
HE TRIED TO GET SOME REST,
BUT IT WON'T BE THAT EASY

493
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,522
-Our national wrestling team player.
-She's on the national team.

494
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,624
-The wrestling team?
-Yes, the women's team.

495
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,792
JO SU-BEEN,
FORMER NATIONAL WRESTLING TEAM

496
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:34,994
BACKING AWAY AT HER APPEARANCE

497
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,762
-The ball slipped off.
-It's okay.

498
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,797
-You got this!
-You got this!

499
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,299
CHEERING NEWBIE ON
TO ENCOURAGE HIM

500
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,934
SHE APPROACHES AGAIN

501
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,569
No, don't kick too hard.

502
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,604
Nice move!

503
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,039
WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO SHOOT

504
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,108
No, don't pass it to her.

505
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,543
No, please don't kick it hard.

506
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,112
IMPLORING HER NOT TO KICK HARD

507
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,382
NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER
SCORES ANOTHER GOAL

508
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,549
SWIFTLY CONCEDES TWO GOALS

509
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,451
-That was a tough one.
-Nice.

510
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,686
He has to play offense.

511
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,954
He should just enjoy it.

512
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,822
She is so good.

513
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,191
FANCY FOOTWORK

514
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,794
HE STILL HAS ENERGY
LEFT TO TAUNT THEM

515
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,062
ENDS UP LOSING THE BALL

516
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,597
-Nice!
-Go up!

517
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:12,698
Shoot from afar!

518
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,366
OUR NEWBIE HAS CHANGED

519
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,036
HE EVEN PASSES EASILY

520
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,904
Oh, no.

521
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,039
Nice.

522
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,907
BREATHING HEAVILY

523
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,175
-You got this.
-The goal…

524
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,943
We're almost done.

525
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,278
I'm out of it again.

526
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,615
AS IT'S THE SECOND MATCH,
HIS ENERGY DROPS DOUBLY FAST

527
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,016
Get behind Dong-min!

528
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,085
HIS LACK OF ENERGY
MAKES HIM MISS A PASS

529
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,153
That was close!

530
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,688
-Oh, my.
-You have to run.

531
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,625
THEY HECKLE HIM
FOR LOSING ENERGY SO QUICKLY

532
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,427
He isn't running hard enough.

533
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,163
He has to run over here and over there,

534
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,632
but he just stays in that one spot.

535
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,333
ALWAYS NEAR THE GOAL POST

536
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,769
He's like instant curry.
Done in three minutes.

537
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,038
MR. INSTANT CURRY

538
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,106
That was close.

539
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,076
Stand up! Stand up!

540
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,711
THE ENERGETIC MEMBERS
WON'T LET HIM STAY DOWN

541
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,081
-Here it comes. You can do it!
-Get close!

542
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,449
HE JUST PLODS ALONG
LIKE A ZOMBIE

543
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,516
To your right!

544
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,022
Okay, Defconn! You got this!

545
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,090
ROLLS AFTER SHOOTING

546
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,524
-Good job!
-Good job!

547
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,725
I'm sorry.

548
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,793
My gosh.

549
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,096
Go ahead!

550
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,263
NEWBIE GETS A SECOND CHANCE

551
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,865
FALLS BACKWARDS

552
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,968
IT'S AMAZING THAT
HE CAN EVEN WALK

553
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,304
-Time-out!
-We did it!

554
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,438
So close!

555
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,773
It was so close.

556
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,208
THE CROWD BEGINS TO STIR

557
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,275
What's going on?

558
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,377
Shouldn't they
just make him the goalkeeper?

559
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,445
JUST FEELING SORRY FOR HIM

560
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,380
-Good game!
-Nice game!

561
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,116
THANKFULLY, THE MATCH HAS ENDED

562
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,787
HE CAN LIE DOWN
AS MUCH AS HE WANTS NOW

563
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,422
The newbie!

564
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,490
Take care of him!

565
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,425
-Are you okay?
-Hang in there!

566
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,493
THEY COME TO CHECK HIM OUT

567
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,061
He's drained.

568
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,662
NEWBIE'S PERSPECTIVE

569
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,897
This is too exhausting.

570
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,399
-How was it?
-What?

571
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,667
-How was it?
-Listen…

572
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,735
It's exhausting.

573
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,104
-You played so well.
-Well done.

574
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,305
-We're the best.
-Newbie!

575
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,607
Yours was the golden goal.

576
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,408
THEY CODDLE HIM TO THE END

577
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,043
A round of applause for Newbie!

578
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,211
Hurray!

579
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,314
Good job, everyone.

580
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,317
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
16:30 WRAP-UP GATHERING

581
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,919
Good job, everybody.

582
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,187
APPLAUDING THEM
FOR PLAYING WITH HIM

583
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,455
-Good job.
-It was fun!

584
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,689
-Nice.
-Let's eat.

585
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:21,260
By the way, your husband is really good.

586
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,995
I fell for him all over again today.

587
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,663
I'm serious.

588
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,132
-I fell for him today.
-I fell for him too.

589
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,168
Also, want to know something else?

590
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,204
I noticed that
a lot of husbands play as the goalkeeper,

591
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,505
while the wives play offense.

592
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,040
That's right.

593
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,308
-They're being considerate.
-Yes.

594
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,376
How considerate.

595
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,777
I noticed that right away.

596
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,845
Is that love?

597
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,549
That's why when she can't come,

598
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,284
he insists on playing offense.

599
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,953
-I came by myself.
-I could tell.

600
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,155
He smiles from ear to ear
when he comes alone.

601
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,857
-I know.
-"This is so fun, Dong-min!"

602
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,991
SPLASHES COLD WATER

603
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,793
While we're eating together,

604
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,628
this would be a good time to talk.

605
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,199
Are you all satisfied with your president?

606
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,969
He is much younger than me,

607
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,039
but I often tell him that I respect him.

608
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,106
-Really?
-Yes.

609
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,108
Every morning and evening,

610
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,376
he has to wash the vests.

611
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,713
He gets water for all of us every day.

612
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,248
-He even has to pick us up.
-What?

613
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,416
Yes, even that.

614
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,684
-He even picks us up.
-How?

615
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,719
There are those without cars,

616
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,287
-so I go and pick them up.
-We all come here together.

617
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,289
-You even do that?
-Yes.

618
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,291
To be honest,

619
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,994
I spend a lot of my own money
while running this club.

620
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,130
But I enjoy running this club,

621
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,734
so I consider it an expense
for my own happiness.

622
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,936
No one else could do what Dong-min does.

623
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,204
Don't get sick.

624
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,773
-Don't get sick.
-Be well and stay healthy.

625
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,475
Honestly, I came here thinking

626
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,379
that all I had to do in futsal
was run around a little,

627
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,114
since it isn't soccer.

628
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,985
I thought I could run around
and have a good laugh with you guys.

629
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,620
But I couldn't laugh.

630
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:59,324
I was planning on just laughing around,
but I couldn't laugh.

631
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,860
I felt like a cat on a cat wheel.

632
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,330
NEWBIE'S DAY KEPT
GOING ROUND AND ROUND

633
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,066
It was tough, but it was so much fun.

634
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,635
This team would say

635
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,838
that you're doing a good job,

636
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,374
even if you just touch the ball.

637
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,609
I just run after the ball,

638
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,444
but it's so fun.

639
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,179
As it is a coed team,

640
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,581
they are very considerate.

641
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,716
That's why you could gain confidence

642
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,018
in playing coed futsal.

643
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,687
"Sweat together and have a good time."

644
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,255
That's their motto.

645
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:34,293
Men and women who want to try futsal,
feel free to join this club.

646
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,360
It's so nice.
