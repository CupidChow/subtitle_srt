00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,205
Hello, Netflix Club members,

3
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,740
how has your week been?

4
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:10,210
Each week, I observe clubs
with the eyes of a bird.

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,946
I'm Defconn, the newbie
who's crazy about clubs. Good to see you.

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,981
The club I'll visit today is

7
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,950
a club that lets your whole body

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,352
experience freedom
with just a thin piece of cloth.

9
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,389
I'll be visiting a flying yoga club.

10
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,492
The newbie that will join me today
is exercise-obsessed.

11
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,360
TSUKI of the group Billie!

12
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,962
WOW

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,064
Hello, I'm TSUKI.

14
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,132
Looking forward to this.

15
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,967
-Nice to meet you, TSUKI.
-Nice to meet you.

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,035
TSUKI!

17
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,137
-It has been so long.
-It has been so long.

18
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,105
-Is it the first time since Zombieverse?
-It is!

19
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,173
Have you been doing well?

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,241
-TSUKI.
-Yes.

21
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,743
-Aren't you obsessed with exercise?
-Yes, I am.

22
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,179
I typically work out at gyms though.

23
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,914
Can you do something like this?

24
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,315
Something like that? Let me see.

25
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,551
-Like this?
-That's good enough.

26
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,652
I'm the problem.

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,188
I wonder if I can really do flying yoga.

28
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,423
-Let's go…
-Okay.

29
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,491
-…and meet the club members.
-Okay!

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,260
Where are you, members?

31
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,761
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

32
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:02,862
-Hi.
-You came from there.

33
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,500
FOR SOME REASON, THEY SAY HELLO
WITH STRANGE HAND GESTURES

34
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,135
Who is the president?

35
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,837
-That would be me.
-Nice to meet you.

36
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,338
YANG HA-JEONG, CLUB PRESIDENT

37
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,973
Our club is

38
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,178
called Nabi because we'd like to
be able to fly elegantly like butterflies.

39
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,214
So when did you start doing flying yoga?

40
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,951
-I've been doing yoga for 20 years…
-Okay.

41
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,953
…and flying yoga for over 10 years.

42
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,354
30 YEARS OF YOGA EXPERIENCE

43
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,522
How awesome.

44
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,758
I'm Kim Ga-hyeon of Nabi.

45
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,026
Hello, Ga-hyeon.

46
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,396
When my child hit puberty,

47
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,264
I ran 100 laps at the park,

48
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,401
but I wanted to do
something more effective.

49
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,169
If your child is in puberty…

50
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,238
I've been a mom for 20 years.

51
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,639
Your child must be in college now.

52
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,707
In fourth grade.

53
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,175
-Fourth year of college?
-No.

54
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,710
-He's retrying for next year.
-High school…

55
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,545
KIM GA-HYEON
MOM OF SUPER SENIOR STUDENT

56
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,680
Fourth year of high school?

57
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,747
Yes, fourth year.

58
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,350
It's a tough time for me,
so I do flying yoga all the time.

59
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:02,088
The reason why I started flying yoga is
because I'd like to have many children.

60
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,823
How many children do you want?

61
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,126
I'd like to have three.

62
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,528
-But she doesn't have a boyfriend yet…
-I want three too.

63
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,063
…so her uterus is just being built up.

64
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,464
What are you saying right now?

65
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,032
RAMBUNCTIOUS MOMS AND MOMS-TO-BE

66
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,636
I would like to become an actress.

67
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,938
While I was pursuing that dream,

68
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,074
I started flying yoga to find some relief.

69
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,675
Aren't you curious, TSUKI?

70
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,444
-About what?
-Her acting.

71
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,045
TURNING AWAY

72
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,247
I'm so curious.

73
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,048
We're so curious.

74
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,383
NABI CLAPS

75
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,318
Who knows? Someone may see this.

76
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,721
Life is all about that one chance.

77
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,991
FINALLY, SHE TRIES TO
GET INTO CHARACTER

78
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,559
Mom.

79
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,529
HER ACTING ENDED
AS SOON AS IT BEGAN

80
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,164
Were you sending a video message?

81
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,533
How could she not be nervous?

82
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,667
To your mom.

83
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,736
Mom!

84
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,337
SO BRIGHT

85
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,774
You know what?
My parents happen to be in Korea today.

86
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,843
-Really?
-Yes.

87
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,513
Mom, you must be eating
somewhere right now.

88
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,482
Have fun sightseeing

89
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,050
and go back to Japan.

90
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,153
Mom! TSUKI is making money like this.

91
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,322
HANG IN THERE, TSUKI!

92
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,690
Well, I followed

93
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,559
my mom here.

94
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,060
-Your mom?
-I followed my mom.

95
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,128
HUH YUN-JEONG
YOUNGEST, FOLLOWED MOM

96
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,930
-Mom? Really?
-Yes, my mom.

97
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,599
She was busy today so she couldn't come,
but she's a member too.

98
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,167
-Really?
-Your mom as well?

99
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,235
Mother and daughter.

100
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,603
-How nice.
-Yes.

101
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,271
I was wondering,

102
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,073
is it always this dark in here?

103
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,409
-Is it dark?
-Even the ceiling.

104
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,211
-Do you see the toe marks there?
-This?

105
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,812
-You're right.
-There are footprints.

106
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,880
Are these footprints?

107
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,348
Yes, they are toe prints.

108
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,516
These are footprints?

109
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,985
If I saw this without knowing that,
it would look scary.

110
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,053
-So horrifying.
-For real.

111
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,554
-Like a haunted house.
-Yes.

112
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,089
I was so surprised.

113
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,157
Let me show you.

114
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225
DEMONSTRATING FOOTPRINTS

115
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,227
Like this.

116
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,294
You go up.

117
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,362
STRETCH

118
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,863
You keep going up.

119
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,365
You wrap around again? I see.

120
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,768
You keep going up, like crazy.

121
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,338
You step on it like this.

122
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,572
THE CEILING IS HER FLOOR

123
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,008
NEWBIES IN AWE

124
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,109
That was truly amazing.

125
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,944
Wasn't it so beautiful? How was it, TSUKI?

126
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,280
I think I'll just watch.

127
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,649
SHE DOESN'T FEEL CONFIDENT

128
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,819
How many years does it take to do that?

129
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,988
If you want to do it,
we can make it happen.

130
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,356
IT'S POSSIBLE TODAY

131
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,523
If you want to do it,

132
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,158
if it's okay for your flesh to tear…

133
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,660
Oh, no.

134
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,128
Shall we get into position and start?

135
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,329
Okay!

136
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,632
This is the signature pose.

137
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,467
-It's called Monkey Pose.
-Monkey?

138
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,602
-Monkey Pose?
-You hang backward like a monkey.

139
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,104
-I've heard about that a lot.
-Let me show you.

140
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,171
Excuse me,

141
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,207
can you demonstrate it for me?

142
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,341
MADE EYE CONTACT WITH NEWBIE

143
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,409
-All right.
-Try it.

144
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,778
-She's our newest member.
-Come over here.

145
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:39,846
Come here.

146
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,481
-Try the Monkey Pose.
-Our new member.

147
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,549
You have to stand in front of it.

148
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,585
-You have to stand in front.
-Yes.

149
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,120
-I just needed to check.
-Okay.

150
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,055
She dreams of having many children.

151
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,990
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

152
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,058
LET'S SEE HOW GOOD SHE IS

153
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,126
Are you nervous?

154
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,460
-Monkey Pose.
-Monkey.

155
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,528
CONFIDENT TO START

156
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,596
Go up.

157
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,332
-It looks like you're struggling.
-No.

158
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,566
FLAILING

159
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,968
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS

160
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,636
It looks like you're struggling a lot.

161
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,771
SCREAMING

162
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,041
Okay. From here, grab one ankle.

163
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,209
AFTER STRUGGLING TO CLIMB

164
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,477
Okay. Oh, my.

165
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,147
-Like this.
-Like this? She has to come up.

166
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,481
Okay, you can do it.

167
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,849
You can do it!

168
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,052
Let's meet an awesome guy through Netflix.

169
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,119
She's going up.

170
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,521
She's going up. She's got this.

171
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,256
She's got this!

172
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,390
To your future honey,

173
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,426
tell him you love him! One, two, three.

174
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,027
I love you, honey!

175
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,796
How adorable.

176
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,131
-You can do it!
-She's so cute.

177
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,200
Shall we try hanging first?

178
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,635
-Hanging? Okay.
-Yes.

179
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,870
Slowly lean back

180
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,439
and spread your legs.

181
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,606
Move your hands.

182
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,874
Spread your legs!

183
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,176
That's it.

184
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,012
-Wrap the top of your feet around.
-Wrap it for me.

185
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,281
Let go and clasp your hands
behind your head.

186
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,615
Wait, I might fall.

187
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,683
I'm scared, Miss.

188
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,151
Did you call me "Miss"?

189
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,486
I'm sorry.

190
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,555
Hold on…

191
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,856
-All right.
-My thighs.

192
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,324
That hurts. Damn it!

193
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,392
CUSSING IN SACRED STUDIO

194
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,295
It hurts! Damn it!

195
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,763
-It hurts!
-Hold his hand, please.

196
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,765
Gosh! It hurts. Damn.

197
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,066
Let's pray.

198
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,168
All right. Pray.

199
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,170
You're okay, aren't you?

200
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,572
PRAYING FOR THE POSSESSED NEWBIE

201
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,607
Hang there for a while like a monkey.

202
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,675
Okay.

203
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,009
I'm going to check on TSUKI.

204
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,077
You're going to TSUKI?

205
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,479
-Okay.
-Your legs.

206
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,247
THIS SIDE IS PEACEFUL

207
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,715
BREATHING HEAVILY

208
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,183
Hurry up, TSUKI.

209
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,120
-Clasp your hands behind your head.
-Yes.

210
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,488
TSUKI WAS ABLE TO DO IT QUICKLY

211
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,555
Lower your heels.

212
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,757
Want to try going up more?

213
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:31,824
-Yes!
-No, I can't.

214
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,893
Hold the hammock between your thighs.

215
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,261
-My thighs?
-Good job.

216
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,296
Use your toes to grab the hammock.

217
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,031
-Like this?
-Hold it with your knees.

218
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,834
LAUGHING LIKE A MANIAC

219
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,636
Let go. Go ahead and let go.

220
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,704
ACTUAL TORTURE

221
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,339
It hurts. My knees!

222
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,741
-Move your hands higher.
-Let go.

223
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,077
CAN'T STOP LAUGHING

224
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,211
-Defconn!
-Let go.

225
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,647
Why don't you come down?

226
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,449
-It hurts! It hurts!
-Okay.

227
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,718
I can't get married! It hurts.

228
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,788
Just go down!

229
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,489
-Come on up.
-Come up.

230
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,124
HE GETS OFF
THE HAMMOCK IN THE END

231
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:09,228
HIS ENERGY IS DEPLETED
AFTER DOING ONE BASIC POSE

232
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,296
-Fold.
-Fold.

233
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,364
-Fold your knees.
-Fold.

234
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,432
-Fold. Good.
-Foot too.

235
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,499
-Like this?
-Wrap it around.

236
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,134
-Your feet are dirty, by the way.
-That's it.

237
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,204
-That's how you do it.
-A round of applause.

238
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,272
TWO SUCCESSFUL MONKEYS

239
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,773
It's because of you!

240
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,242
I was waiting for you!

241
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,644
I'm sorry.

242
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,546
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

243
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,448
Don't do flying yoga.

244
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,349
It's very difficult.

245
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,454
I felt like my life was in danger.

246
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,923
It isn't something a normal person can do.

247
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,460
If you're trying it for the first time,

248
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,727
it isn't an exaggeration.

249
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,096
It would have really hurt.

250
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,933
I'm just glad that he didn't say
anything worse.

251
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,936
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
12:00 FILMING A CHALLENGE

252
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,371
People shoot a lot of reels of flying yoga

253
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,439
-these days.
-Yes.

254
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,807
Do you shoot reels?

255
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,843
Yes, we shoot a lot.

256
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,446
THE CHALLENGES THAT THE MEMBERS
DID TOGETHER

257
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,548
One, two, three.

258
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,116
One, two, three.

259
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,819
We'll shoot a reel doing flying yoga.

260
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,321
-Sounds good!
-Do you think we can?

261
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,589
Whatever it takes.

262
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,756
-Really?
-Of course.

263
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,824
SHAKING

264
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,493
-All right, then.
-Let's follow along.

265
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,596
-We got this.
-For three people, there's Ladder Pose.

266
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,663
3-PERSON CHALLENGE: LADDER

267
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,234
You hang the hammock in the front
and you climb it. That's the pose.

268
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,702
Assistant, please demonstrate.

269
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,472
KI-YEON DEMONSTRATES AGAIN

270
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,940
She's the demonstrating lady.

271
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,643
Stand behind the hammock
and grab it from the middle.

272
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,944
Lift your heels high.

273
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,280
Your heels.

274
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,182
Were you a bit annoyed just now?

275
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,451
It sounded like you were annoyed.

276
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,519
"Your heels."

277
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,753
Are you tired?

278
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,054
SAYING NO IN FEAR

279
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,322
We're done talking.

280
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,857
She said they're done talking.

281
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,093
Wrap the top of your feet
around the hammock.

282
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,728
That's what's hard, you know.

283
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,230
Trust yourself.
Use your toes to grab the hammock.

284
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,865
Do it while smiling. Go up.

285
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,166
SMILING FAINTLY

286
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,535
You're happy.

287
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,603
Even I'm smiling.

288
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,704
LAUGHING INNOCENTLY

289
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,139
You should do it while smiling.

290
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,908
Insert your knees.

291
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,577
Use one hand at a time to go up.

292
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,113
It's hard, isn't it?

293
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,415
The dark circles
under her eyes have spread.

294
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,850
Spread your arms out to the side.

295
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:11,918
SUCCESSFUL "FRONT BELT"

296
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,152
Like so.

297
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,755
That's my future.

298
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,257
-Don't relax your arms yet.
-Okay.

299
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,325
Keep them straight.

300
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,493
-I'll lift your legs.
-Okay.

301
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,561
TSUKI, you go first.

302
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,095
LIFTING UP HIGH

303
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,898
SHE FIGURED IT WILL BE EASIER TO
LIFT THEM THAN MAKE HIM DO IT

304
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,601
Can you cross your arms
over your chest now?

305
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,303
I don't think so.

306
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,706
HE KNOWS HIMSELF WELL

307
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,609
THE MEMBERS DO IT
WELL ON THEIR OWN

308
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,512
EXCEPT KI-YEON

309
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,947
Your feet should point downwards.

310
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,282
-Not bad, right?
-Lower it?

311
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,917
-Like this?
-Yes.

312
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,652
Smile and do it happily.

313
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,221
That's it.

314
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,524
From here, you have to come up.

315
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,160
Spread your legs wide to the side.

316
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,597
Then, wrap your feet around the hammock
from the outside to the inside.

317
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,664
That's it.

318
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,201
SHE'S ALSO A NEWBIE BUT
SHE YIELDS A DIFFERENT RESULT

319
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,137
Now, look at your belly button.

320
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,372
Give me your hands.

321
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,641
I can't. I can't do that.

322
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,910
I won't be able to do that.

323
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,211
Grab the hammock.

324
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,412
Stay there for a moment.

325
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,314
I can't give you my hands.

326
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,483
IF YOU CAN'T AVOID IT,
POSTPONE IT - PRESIDENT

327
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,718
Just come up now.

328
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,219
THE PRESIDENT'S SANCTUARY

329
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,287
More.

330
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,856
It's going to wrap around
the upper part of your thighs.

331
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,424
Hold it high and straighten your knees.

332
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,560
-Give me your hands.
-I can't do that.

333
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,229
Use your toes to grab the hammock.

334
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,633
THE MEMBERS WATCH
AS THEY HANG PEACEFULLY

335
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,835
Come up. Come on up.

336
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,169
What do you want me to do?

337
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,238
NEVER HAD A MEMBER
LIKE HIM BEFORE

338
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,740
Go up.

339
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,642
PRACTICING HIS VOCALS
AT A YOGA STUDIO

340
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,777
That's it. Go up.

341
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,112
I give up.

342
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,480
I give up. Oh, my gosh.

343
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,648
Give me your hand.

344
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,149
Give it. Okay.

345
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,317
GROANING

346
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,253
Wait, what's going on?

347
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,055
What's happening? Hang on.

348
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,591
Can you do something about this?

349
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,659
Oh, my gosh.

350
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,726
HE CAN'T GO

351
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,595
Stay like that for a moment.

352
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,030
What am I supposed to do?

353
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,698
ABANDONED AGAIN WHILE TIED UP

354
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,301
Okay. Use your hands
to grab the hammock by your sides.

355
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,836
Okay, give it a bounce.

356
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,438
Through the hammock between the knees.

357
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,906
Your head goes up.

358
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:14,974
That's it.

359
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,208
Gosh, Ms. Yang.

360
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,610
Do I just go over?

361
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,112
KI-YEON IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN'T GO OVER

362
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,981
Go through.

363
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,051
She's like me. My comrade.

364
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,118
My friend!

365
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,219
I can't do it.

366
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,287
My friend!

367
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,456
You're almost there. Stay like that.

368
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,692
Stay like that. Just stay like that.

369
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,493
SHE DECIDES TO FOLLOW
THE NEWBIE'S EXAMPLE

370
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,561
IT'S NOT IN MIRROR MODE

371
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,296
You can just stay like this
if it's too difficult.

372
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,464
This means you're giving up.

373
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,499
I was always the one who fell behind,

374
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,101
but now that there's someone else…

375
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,737
I've regained my confidence
through Defconn

376
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,505
and I can enjoy it even more now.

377
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,675
-Okay, shall we give Ladder Pose a shot?
-Yes.

378
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,911
Slowly bend forward.

379
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,613
Spread your legs
and hook the top of your feet on it.

380
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,249
What would I have done without TSUKI?

381
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,317
Good job.

382
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,685
One, two, three.

383
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,587
-That's it.
-Good.

384
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,090
Now, hook your ankle securely around it.

385
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,458
Hook it.

386
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,132
THEY SUCCESSFULLY DID
THE 3-PERSON LADDER CHALLENGE!

387
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,501
All right.
Now, what comes after three people?

388
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,970
-Four people?
-The four-person heart.

389
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,171
Making a heart.

390
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,340
4-PERSON CHALLENGE: HEART

391
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,576
Push your knees in

392
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:24,643
and come up.

393
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,545
It's done when you've
worn the straps like underwear.

394
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,613
BASIC "HEART" POSE:
TWO MONKEY STRAP

395
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,081
Spread your legs to the side

396
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,449
and come down again.

397
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,251
You're getting better at this.

398
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,319
I can do it up to this step.

399
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,487
Okay. Hands.

400
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:38,057
We're going to go up
and wrap around it once more.

401
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,459
Grab the hammock between your thighs.

402
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,961
WRAPPING THE HAMMOCK
AROUND AGAIN

403
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,262
TO MAKE THE TWO MONKEY POSE

404
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,231
Okay, use one hand at a time. Go up.

405
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,332
REPEATING THE SAME MISTAKE

406
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,634
It hurts again!

407
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,202
Go up just once.

408
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,270
I want to go up too.

409
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,706
But I can't help that I can't do it.

410
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,041
Can you hold the other side?

411
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,143
Let's go.

412
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,078
-Let's do this.
-One, two, three.

413
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,146
SCREAMING

414
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,247
Got it. One, two, three.

415
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,715
SCREAMING IN PAIN

416
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,484
USING HER ENERGY
THE MOST RIGHT NOW

417
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,986
TSUKI IS RECRUITED TOO

418
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,053
Hurry!

419
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,956
We can do it. We can do it!

420
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,391
Someone help us.

421
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,059
Here?

422
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,494
HYE-EUN AND YUN-JEONG JOIN TOO

423
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,363
NOT EVEN MOVING AN INCH

424
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,899
SHE ISN'T COMING DOWN
BECAUSE IT WAS SO HARD TO GO UP

425
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:25,805
5 PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER
BUT THEY COULDN'T LIFT HIM UP

426
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,906
I can't do it.

427
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,574
I can't do it.

428
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,976
Come here. Come here and wait.

429
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,646
But I was waiting for him.

430
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,347
Do you want to be a gorilla or Tarzan?

431
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,349
JUST A YOGA STUDIO'S MONKEY

432
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,651
I can't do it.

433
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,654
Of my 10 years doing flying yoga,
today was the toughest.

434
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,988
It was harder than flying yoga.

435
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:44,924
I knew I couldn't.

436
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,192
Shall we try just one more time?

437
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,259
TRYING AGAIN

438
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,327
-Shall we try?
-Let's try.

439
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,029
-Let's give it a try.
-Let's try.

440
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,197
One, two, three.

441
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,932
6 OF THEM WORK TOGETHER

442
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,000
BUT THE SCREAMS ONLY GET LOUDER

443
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,235
Straighten your legs.

444
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,469
Put your hands in.

445
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,571
DETERMINED TO PUSH HIM UP

446
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,039
-It hurts.
-That's it. Almost there.

447
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,106
That hurts!

448
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,008
BUT THEY FAIL AGAIN

449
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,777
It hurts. I can't do it.

450
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,645
-Lift your head.
-Lift my head.

451
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,080
-Unwind your legs.
-Unwind them.

452
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,017
IT'S HARD FOR HIM
TO EVEN GET OFF THE HAMMOCK

453
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,652
He turned pale.

454
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,922
-I can't do it.
-He turned pale.

455
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,357
I look pale, don't I?

456
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,592
Everybody,

457
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,027
do you have distracting thoughts

458
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,029
or are you very stressed?

459
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,664
Do flying yoga.

460
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,068
You won't be able to think of anything.

461
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,436
Your mind will go blank.

462
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,405
TSUKI and Defconn, put your feet

463
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,874
-on the floor.
-On the floor.

464
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,809
Keep your feet in position
and lower yourself.

465
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,110
All right.

466
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,013
-Here?
-You have to hold on very tightly.

467
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,648
-Hold tight?
-If you let go,

468
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,083
-she'll fall backward.
-Really?

469
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,718
-Okay, I'll hold tight.
-Okay.

470
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,987
-Don't press my calves.
-But she told me to.

471
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,255
Don't press my calves.

472
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,522
Don't press her calves.

473
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,258
I'm sorry. Gosh.

474
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,526
I just held tight because you told me to.

475
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,428
The ones on the top
can slowly bend backward.

476
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,664
Hold hands.

477
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,466
Lower your pelvis.

478
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,034
Good! Stay still.

479
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,502
-Stay still.
-Out of the way.

480
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,337
It looks so pretty.

481
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,074
Okay. Three, two, one. Let go.

482
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,043
DIES IN ACTION
AFTER MAKING THE HEART

483
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,111
-Are you okay?
-Yes!

484
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,212
You're okay? Good.

485
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,281
ALL FOR THE SAKE OF REELS

486
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:21,253
THEY SUCCESSFULLY DID
THE 4-PERSON HEART CHALLENGE

487
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,488
Now, let us--

488
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,390
Now, let's please stop.

489
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,792
How long are you going to keep going?

490
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,227
Since we have six people…

491
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,595
Are we doing a six-person one?

492
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,432
6-PERSON CHALLENGE: MAPLE

493
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,434
Who were the ones that went up just now?

494
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,635
These two.

495
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,971
I think TSUKI can do my part well.

496
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,105
Going up?

497
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,241
Hang on.

498
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,244
-She's just like me.
-Then…

499
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,913
Put your right foot forward.

500
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,316
-Remember swinging your foot around?
-Yes.

501
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,383
Let me hold your foot.

502
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,985
One, two, three. Lift your leg up.

503
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,587
-That's it.
-You're good, TSUKI. You're good.

504
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,089
I wish she'd join us.

505
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,691
Now, let's do--

506
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,793
-What's wrong?
-Right here.

507
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,561
It hurts? I know how that feels.

508
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,797
-I was like that.
-It's insane!

509
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,098
I know.

510
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,267
Then let's hook
your other foot around first.

511
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,335
-Okay.
-Okay.

512
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,769
-Your other foot.
-The other foot.

513
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,037
Hook the top of your foot.

514
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,340
-That's it. Very good.
-Very good.

515
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,875
One, two, three. Straighten your left leg.

516
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,510
That's it. You're in position.

517
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,578
Again.

518
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,646
Right here.

519
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,014
I know.

520
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,549
I know how it feels.

521
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,117
SCREAMING

522
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,752
Just endure it for a little bit.

523
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:28,821
Ki-yeon.

524
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,056
-Ki-yeon.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

525
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,124
WOW

526
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,993
I'm so sorry.

527
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,062
Then I think we have to change positions.

528
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,365
It was so tough. You should really try it.

529
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,935
Humans live on the ground, right?

530
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,771
There's a reason for that.

531
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,174
-First of all, can you come here, TSUKI?
-Yes.

532
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,510
Hook the top of your foot here.

533
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,345
Use your hand to grab here.

534
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,714
Keep this wrapped
around the top of your foot.

535
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,283
All right. Give me your hand.

536
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,351
Right here.

537
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,452
As high as possible.

538
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,553
-There.
-Here?

539
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,355
One, two, three.

540
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,028
LASTING ONLY 1 SECOND

541
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,262
NO ARM STRENGTH LEFT

542
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,497
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

543
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,631
That was dangerous.

544
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,699
Seriously.

545
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,334
That was dangerous.

546
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,902
BUT THE PRESIDENT
COULD DO IT EASILY

547
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,937
All right. Get ready, TSUKI.

548
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,372
-Get ready, TSUKI.
-Yes.

549
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,275
BREATHING HEAVILY

550
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,343
Defconn,

551
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,778
-please get ready.
-What?

552
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,679
-Get ready.
-Get ready?

553
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:28,747
You're feeling it.

554
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,750
You need to hurry up.
She asked me to get ready right now.

555
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,118
She asked me to get ready.

556
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,186
PLEASE HURRY UP

557
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,254
She asked me.

558
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,321
PAINFULLY GETS READY

559
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,157
Okay, she asked me to get ready.

560
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,658
-Good.
-Go.

561
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,726
That's it.

562
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,794
MUST LAST 3 SECONDS

563
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,462
Come on. One, two,

564
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,097
-three.
-Maple.

565
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,332
-One.
-Come on, Ms. Yang!

566
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,400
-Two.
-Ms. Yang!

567
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,903
Three. Come down.

568
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,970
Did we do it?

569
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,072
It's over!

570
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,611
THEY SUCCESSFULLY DID
THE 6-PERSON MAPLE CHALLENGE!

571
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,614
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
15:00 WRAP-UP GATHERING

572
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,516
TSUKI, how was today?

573
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,486
It was my first time,
but I had so much fun.

574
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,354
-You were having fun.
-Yes, I was.

575
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,789
It was tough but so fun.

576
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,890
-Isn't she talented?
-Yes.

577
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,492
-Really?
-Yes, you have potential.

578
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,927
You did so well.

579
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,128
-You did so well.
-So well.

580
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,398
Can each of you tell me
what appeals to you about flying yoga?

581
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,935
First of all, the swelling in your legs
goes down really well.

582
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,604
Your lymph nodes get massaged

583
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,239
and your swelling goes down.

584
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,742
It's amazing that you can
feel your lymph nodes being massaged.

585
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,377
I felt like someone was sawing me.

586
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,813
I feel like someone is sawing me now too.

587
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,782
Were you able to withstand that?

588
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,350
-I feel totally at ease.
-Now,

589
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,652
when I see someone who's in pain,

590
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,920
I wonder why it hurts.

591
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,223
-It feels as natural as putting on pants.
-Yes.

592
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,924
The best part is that it's pretty.

593
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,827
It's so pretty when you complete it.

594
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,295
It was so pretty.

595
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,997
When you finish a pose,

596
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,165
you feel exhilarated.

597
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,566
Yes, exactly.

598
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,870
The fact that we are doing an exercise

599
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,238
-you don't encounter often.
-Yes.

600
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,639
I definitely agree with that.

601
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,042
I feel proud about that.

602
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,712
-I'm going to brag about today as well.
-Yes.

603
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,914
-You can brag. You did so well.
-I'm so proud.

604
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,416
I would sometimes
come across Instagram posts

605
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,851
where someone is hanging

606
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,187
-while they flap their wings and pose.
-Yes.

607
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,889
-It looked so pretty.
-Yes.

608
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,424
But on the other hand,
I wondered if that really was

609
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,393
effective exercise.

610
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,462
-But when I tried it out today…
-It was intense.

611
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,665
-Oh, my goodness.
-It was the best exercise. For real.

612
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,636
When you see the pose, you could think,
"All you have to do is hang,"

613
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,639
or think "So what if you
wrapped it around your leg?"

614
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,841
But once you give it a try,

615
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,011
you'll realize that it is
exceptionally difficult.

616
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,078
I know.

617
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,314
-If they want really intense exercise…
-Yes.

618
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,550
…I'd like to recommend this to them.

619
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,619
I thought I was pretty athletic before,

620
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,555
-but after I started flying yoga…
-Of course.

621
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,891
…I realized that
I wasn't really working out

622
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,193
-until now.
-I totally agree

623
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,961
as a fellow athletic person.

624
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,530
You know those people
who are often described as athletic?

625
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,333
Those who receive that compliment
should try this.

626
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,901
-They should try flying yoga.
-Just try.

627
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:07,573
If they join,
they'll realize in just one hour.

628
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,275
I found out
how helpless I was against gravity.

629
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,610
-How pathetic I was.
-Really?

630
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,678
I realized that today.

631
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,745
A HUMBLING EXERCISE

632
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,348
I consider myself to be pretty athletic,

633
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,850
but I experienced a limit
to my physical ability.

634
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,987
It was my first time experiencing it
since starting Newbie in the Club.

635
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,690
Once I tried it, it was so much fun.

636
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:28,994
It felt so good
that it became a little addictive.

637
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,896
To complete one pose,

638
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,433
we continuously communicate
and use our body to exercise,

639
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,902
so you can acquire newly found energy.

640
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,337
That's what I love about it.

641
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,505
NABI
