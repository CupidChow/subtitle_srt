LOCATION: YEONGHEUNG-DO, INCHEON
TIME: 10 A.M.

00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,742
Hello, Netflix Club members
around the world. How have you been?

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,044
Each week, I observe clubs
with the eyes of a bird.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,679
I'm the newbie who's crazy about clubs.

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,414
This is Defconn of Newbie in the Club.

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,249
Everyone, the season

7
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,617
of growth has come!

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,452
Spring is here!

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,355
I've come to a coastal foraging club

10
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,325
to forage for small octopuses
and top shells for spring.

11
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:29,295
You must be the members
of the club I'll be joining today.

12
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,798
First, please introduce your club.

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,602
When you catch seafood
straight from the ocean, it's fresh.

14
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,537
We call ourselves
Sing Sing Haerujil Club.

15
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,205
How long have you been doing this?

16
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,107
-It has been four years.
-Four years?

17
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,542
I'm called Poseidon.

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,577
WHAT A POWERFUL NICKNAME

19
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,280
You don't even go into the ocean. So why?

20
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,116
I chose Poseidon
because I want to catch them like a god.

21
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,852
-You want to catch them like a god?
-Yes.

22
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,487
-Are you from Seoul?
-No.

23
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,289
-I'm from Samcheonpo.
-Samcheonpo?

24
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,224
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes.

25
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,292
I'm from Jeonju.

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,627
-He's from Jeonju.
-Okay.

27
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,030
-I'm a member who goes by Jun-woo.
-Oh, Jun-woo.

28
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,131
How long has it been?

29
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,666
I've been foraging for six years.

30
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,168
Four years for him and six for you,

31
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,836
-but he's the president?
-Yes.

32
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,638
-He's crazier, isn't he?
-That's right.

33
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,640
He's very skilled.

34
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,842
Our president catches one
every 20 seconds.

35
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,943
One every 20 seconds?

36
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,611
He catches a tremendous amount.

37
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,214
-He catches a whole sack.
-He's a machine.

38
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,850
-For real?
-His nickname is Poseidon for a reason.

39
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,219
He's so fast you can't see his shovel.

40
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,088
He doesn't seem ordinary either. Hello.

41
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,489
Oh, hello!

42
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,491
SO BUBBLY

43
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,393
-Three-month-old forager--
-Wait.

44
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,595
-Yes?
-I'm not going to interview you.

45
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,431
HE WANTS TO TEASE THIS GUY
AS SOON AS HE SEES HIM

46
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,899
-What were you about to say?
-Hello.

47
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,469
I'm Fun Fun Guy
who has been a member for three months.

48
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,770
FUN FUN GUY / 3-MONTH-OLD NEWBIE

49
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,406
You clearly look like
you've been doing this for 30 years.

50
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,707
That's how you look.

51
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,510
You've been a member for three months.
What made you join this club?

52
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,746
This is a foraging club
and Fun Fun Guy wants

53
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,348
-to have some fun.
-Yes.

54
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,183
-But there wasn't much to do.
-Hang on.

55
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,852
Let me check your breath for alcohol.

56
00:01:58,918 --> 00:01:59,919
Blow into it.

57
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,521
WONDERING WHERE HE GETS
HIS VIGOR FROM

58
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,022
What do you currently do for work?

59
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,557
I sell buttons at Dongdaemun.

60
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,625
It has been 25 years.

61
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,694
If you've been selling
buttons for 25 years,

62
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,496
he's basically an expert.

63
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,064
How much does a wooden button go for?

64
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,266
-Well…
-Yes.

65
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,667
-What is that?
-Wood.

66
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,537
-Oh, we don't use wood these days.
-You don't?

67
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,073
Wooden buttons are
trending again these days.

68
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,141
-Really?
-Yes.

69
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,375
I'll look into it.

70
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,676
SO POSITIVE

71
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,379
What is the trendiest button
in your opinion?

72
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,914
-Well--
-You're getting a call.

73
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,582
Sorry, but can you answer it over there?

74
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,317
We aren't done with the interview.

75
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,622
HE APPROACHES THE CAMERA
FOR SOME REASON

76
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,724
Can you set this…

77
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,792
Can you set it to vibrate?

78
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,762
To vibrate. I shouldn't answer
any phone calls.

79
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,631
I see.

80
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,132
What are you doing right now?

81
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,635
Oh, he couldn't press it?

82
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,537
He couldn't tap the phone.

83
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,272
-Did you answer the call?
-No.

84
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,373
-What was it?
-Nothing.

85
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,208
-It was nothing?
-Well, I have…

86
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,576
MIGHT AS WELL INTRODUCE MYSELF

87
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,312
-…done this for just over two years.
-I see.

88
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,713
My nickname is Haru.

89
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,615
-Oh, Haru. Nice to meet you.
-Yes.

90
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,818
Wait. What's going on?
The president has a shovel.

91
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:06,886
He has a stick.

92
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,154
-You just need a shovel.
-Shovel.

93
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,222
But the newbie

94
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,824
has all these things.
What is this military bag for?

95
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,928
Don't you use these
to subdue armed enemies?

96
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,629
I use it to catch spoonworms.

97
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,897
Spoon worms? What's this?

98
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,866
Fishermen use these.

99
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,334
-The spoonworms go in it.
-I see.

100
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,802
I put the caught spoonworms in it.

101
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,737
There's something in here too.

102
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,340
-There's a hammer in there.
-This is…

103
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,541
You know what?

104
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,310
You are the pack mule in the group.

105
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,778
HOW DID HE KNOW?

106
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,680
They gave all of it to the newbie

107
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,448
because they didn't want to themselves.

108
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,784
Fun Fun Guy is good at cleaning the fish.

109
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,652
-You're being used. You're clueless.
-No.

110
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,987
You're just clueless about it.

111
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,989
Have you ever been scammed in your life?

112
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,524
-Many times.
-Gosh.

113
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,160
-See?
-Please contact me.

114
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,228
OBVIOUSLY SCAMMED A LOT

115
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,462
What's up with the stick?

116
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,397
The stick is important.

117
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,399
-Isn't this used on fish cakes?
-Yes.

118
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,768
The fish cake store owner
at Bangsan Market

119
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,271
-supplied these for us.
-Okay.

120
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,273
-When you hit it like this…
-Yes.

121
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,908
…you see the purple butter clam hole.

122
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,910
When you see the hole, you stab it in.

123
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,511
SNAP

124
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,914
It broke.

125
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,782
Sorry, Mr. Fish Cake Store Owner.

126
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,986
-Does foraging require a lot of equipment?
-Yes, it does.

127
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,754
-It's very costly.
-It is?

128
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,989
How much did it cost?

129
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,957
I spent about four million won.

130
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,259
-Four million?
-Yes.

131
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,228
You see, these aren't
your ordinary rubber gloves.

132
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,930
You can already see the difference.

133
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,998
You're right.

134
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,066
-How much is it?
-I paid 30,000 won on Coupang.

135
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,768
You paid 30,000 won on Coupang.

136
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,670
Would these be less than 10,000 won?

137
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,272
-Maybe about 9,000 won?
-9,000 won?

138
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,173
Buy those, instead of three of these.

139
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,175
I don't use what others use.

140
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,610
But you are using what others use.

141
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,245
MATCHING GLOVES

142
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,980
How much did you spend on equipment?

143
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,016
On equipment, I spent…

144
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,917
Everything you're wearing now
would be two million.

145
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,687
-About 70,000 won?
-70,000 won?

146
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,088
It's less than 100,000 won.

147
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,657
But you have a shovel.

148
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,659
-The shovel is very cheap.
-How much is it?

149
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,260
-It's 15,000 won.
-That's cheap.

150
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,162
If you buy a cheap one…

151
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,563
He's the equipment guy.

152
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,999
If you buy a cheap one,
it'll break like this.

153
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,201
Look at this shovel. It'll break today.

154
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,970
It'll definitely break today.

155
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,205
-The schedule for today is…
-Yes.

156
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,075
Firstly, we are going to go far on foot.

157
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,476
Will we find other things?

158
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,744
-You'll see blue crabs.
-What?

159
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,879
You'll see blue crabs.

160
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,682
We'll catch some blue crabs
and get some spoonworms on the way back.

161
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,684
-Do you know what spoonworms are?
-Yes, I do.

162
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,186
-And why is it dog ball in Korean?
-I don't know.

163
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,156
They're called that
because they look like a dog's balls.

164
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,525
-Then, the dog's--
-Also,

165
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,261
the seafoods that
have the word "gae" in it

166
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,762
are terribly difficult to catch.

167
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,897
-Really?
-Yes.

168
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,465
You'll have to shovel a lot today.

169
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,000
-The water went out a lot now.
-Yes.

170
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,368
-We should hurry.
-Shall we go?

171
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,036
-Let's take a photo.
-Why?

172
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,038
We take photos whenever we go foraging.

173
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,506
-Don't you take it afterward?
-No.

174
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,409
We take a photo when we still look fresh.

175
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,044
-Stick your foot out.
-Foot out.

176
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,447
-Stick your hand out.
-Hand out.

177
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,048
-This is the group photo?
-Yes.

178
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,451
This is what Gen Zs do.

179
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:52,985
You don't know Gen Z, do you?

180
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,053
LOOKING AWKWARD

181
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,555
LAUGHING AWKWARDLY

182
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,990
-Fresh Coastal Foraging.
-Fresh Coastal Foraging.

183
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,494
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
10:30 BEGIN COASTAL FORAGING

184
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,996
So we're going
all the way out there, aren't we?

185
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,331
We'll go past the sand hill.

186
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,967
How many kilometers would that be?

187
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,802
-Maybe about five kilometers.
-Five?

188
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,337
You may fall in if you go that way.

189
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,040
Really? There's a trick for this as well.

190
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,709
How often do you go coastal foraging?

191
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,178
In a month, during the spring tide,

192
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,148
-I go for about 12 days.
-He's immersed in it.

193
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,583
-Twelve days in a month?
-Yes.

194
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,717
He'd go every other day.

195
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,886
But it feels like
he's out there for 30 days.

196
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,554
-Thirty days?
-Yes.

197
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,323
He practically lives out here.

198
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,225
How is his marriage?

199
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,726
How is it?

200
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,995
Good. It's good.

201
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,631
-How is it?
-It's good.

202
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,166
Are the two of you happy?

203
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,334
HESITATES

204
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,169
What is it? What's going on?

205
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,439
You know, while they are doing
the interview with me,

206
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,875
their eyes are pinned to the ground.
Is it a foraging habit?

207
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,343
SEASONED FORAGERS
HAVE EYES ON THE GROUND

208
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,678
UGH

209
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,313
WALKING IN A MUDFLAT
FOR 30 MINUTES

210
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,882
-Are you tired?
-Yes.

211
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,717
Look over here.

212
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,785
Look at the water.

213
00:06:58,851 --> 00:06:59,852
FINALLY ARRIVED

214
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,255
Let's go. Are the blue crabs
in these holes?

215
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,224
They hide under the sand mounds.

216
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,292
They hide under here?

217
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,494
Yes, if you check the sand mounds,

218
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,029
-it feels different.
-I see.

219
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,698
Oh, yeah! I caught a blue crab!

220
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,167
Hey, he said he caught one!

221
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,835
Wow! He really caught one!

222
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,537
You can catch them like this,

223
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,672
but you should let these ones go.

224
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,973
It's too small. Let it go.

225
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,309
-We have to let this go as it's too small?
-Yes.

226
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,911
I'm going to catch one. A blue crab!

227
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,446
It's a blue--

228
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,513
NOTHING

229
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,581
-Nothing?
-It's nothing.

230
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,116
He has bad eyesight.

231
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,251
It's my first time.

232
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,586
There's a blue crab here too.

233
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,987
Where?

234
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,323
You just dug it up
and there's a blue crab.

235
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,859
BLUE CRAB + 1

236
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,160
This one's big.

237
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,228
Here.

238
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,498
-Poseidon is on a different level.
-Here's another.

239
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,633
ONE BLUE CRAB

240
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,002
PER ONE SHOVEL SCOOP

241
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,537
-You caught another one?
-He did.

242
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,006
He catches one every 20 seconds.

243
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,908
How do you spot them?

244
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,511
Where are the blue crabs?

245
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,914
They hide in the sand.

246
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,450
When you look at the sand,
you'll see something like a mound.

247
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,319
This one's a blue crab too.

248
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,054
Like this.

249
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,524
FINDS A BLUE CRAB
DURING THE INTERVIEW

250
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,758
It looks like a mound.

251
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,160
POSEIDON KEEPS SHOVELING

252
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,995
We caught a bucketful, but there's more.

253
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,764
Our containers are full.

254
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,966
Tell me how I can find them.

255
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,100
How can I find them?

256
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,369
-This is the shape of their legs.
-What?

257
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,971
What is the shape of their legs?

258
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,739
That is 99 percent a blue crab.

259
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,840
Look carefully.

260
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,909
You should be good
at finding the hidden picture.

261
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,210
Look over here.

262
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,278
Here.

263
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,114
This one looks good.
Take a good shot of this one.

264
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,149
Bring the camera over here.

265
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,384
Bring the camera here.

266
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,419
Take a good shot of this one.

267
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,121
-You'll see a shape.
-Oh, the shape.

268
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,422
You're right.

269
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,557
THE SILHOUETTE IS KEY!

270
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,126
Oh, you can see the shape.

271
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,494
Can I dig it up? Can I?

272
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,562
Lightly. Yes.

273
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,864
That's it. Now you can get a feel for it.

274
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,966
LEARNING ALONGSIDE HIM

275
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,034
There it is.

276
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,235
There it is. Oh, my!

277
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,370
You got a taste of it.

278
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,972
Now, you are going to go crazy.

279
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,107
Oh, my gosh.

280
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,075
I got it. I know the shape now.

281
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,176
Here!

282
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,344
There's definitely one here.

283
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,046
This one right here. It's moving.

284
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,114
NEWBIE FOUND ONE TOO!

285
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,149
FUN FUN GUY

286
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,819
WHILE NEWBIE IMPROVES,
HE EXPLORES THE OCEAN BY HIMSELF

287
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,856
AS EXPECTED,
HE DOESN'T FOLLOW THE CROWD

288
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,091
Fun Fun Guy, come here and catch this.

289
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,893
-Is this your first?
-Yes.

290
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,162
-Can't you spot them?
-I can't spot blue crabs well.

291
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,430
-You can't?
-No.

292
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,665
Dig it up. Do you see it?

293
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,732
You see? It's there.

294
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,100
Try feeling it.

295
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,735
I have to catch a male crab.

296
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,437
That looks big.

297
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,340
-Nice.
-I know how to find them now.

298
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,608
You know how to find them now.

299
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,476
-You can catch your breath now.
-I caught one.

300
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,611
ENVIOUS

301
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,880
WANDERING AROUND

302
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,983
What's going on?

303
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,618
Even the way he shovels is different.

304
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,886
Yes, it's different.

305
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,754
What's up? What got into him?

306
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,989
Spoonworm.

307
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,057
Because of a spoonworm?

308
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,892
What? What is this?

309
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,026
-A spoonworm.
-Wow!

310
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,328
HE REMAINS NONCHALANT

311
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,762
SEASONED MEMBER LOOKS SO COOL

312
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:57,897
Wow!

313
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,066
I JUST CAME ACROSS IT

314
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,400
Here's a fresh spoonworm.

315
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,668
It looks fresh.

316
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,403
I've never seen someone catch one before.

317
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,505
Is this how deep I have to dig?

318
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,108
-That was fast. We have to dig 10 times.
-Really?

319
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,410
He only has to dig three to four times.

320
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,813
-I could tell that he was different.
-Yes.

321
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,016
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT PRAISE,
HE JUST LOOKS FOR THE NEXT TARGET

322
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,424
Poseidon found a blue crab!
No, he found a spoonworm.

323
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,127
IN A TRANCE

324
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,595
THE SPOONWORM GUY
OWNS THE OCEAN

325
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,796
Here it is!

326
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,867
-It's been cut.
-This one got cut by the shovel.

327
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,203
-Yes, but you can still eat it.
-Can we?

328
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,571
FAR AWAY

329
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,539
First of all, I don't like spoonworms

330
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,375
because they look kind of hideous.

331
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,977
These blue crabs are cute.

332
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,412
Aren't they cute?

333
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,780
Isn't this so cute?

334
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,181
It looks so cute.

335
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,884
Looking at it makes me feel like
I have the whole world to myself.

336
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,919
How can they be so cute?

337
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,088
My gosh, how adorable.

338
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,924
You can cut it and eat it as is.

339
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,226
-What?
-Do you want it?

340
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,761
No, I can't eat it.

341
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,462
-Let's eat it together.
-No, thanks.

342
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,597
You see,

343
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,465
I've never had spoonworms before.

344
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,300
Fun Fun Guy, give me the scissors.

345
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,468
-Scissors?
-Yes.

346
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,536
Give me the scissors.

347
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,838
You do carry everything for them.

348
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,707
DELIVERED THE SCISSORS
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING

349
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,075
You do carry everything for them.

350
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,143
CLEANS IT ON THE SPOT

351
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,445
We aren't close
to the seafood market or anything.

352
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,814
You really just catch it
and eat it right on the spot.

353
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,817
TASTING THE FRESHLY CAUGHT
SPOONWORM

354
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,986
-How much do spoonworms cost?
-The market price?

355
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,454
It's about 30,000 won for three.

356
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,822
Three for 30,000 won?

357
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,692
-Give me some.
-Forget about it.

358
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,160
It's very sweet.

359
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,227
It's very sweet.

360
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,362
TRIES IT SINCE IT'S PRICEY

361
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,464
-I told you it's good.
-It's so sweet.

362
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,434
It's good. Yes.

363
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,403
How can I find spoonworms, Poseidon?

364
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,605
You'll see three of these protruding.

365
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,673
Holes like these.

366
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,176
If you see three holes like these,
it's a spoonworm's hole.

367
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,478
-It's in a triangle.
-A triangle.

368
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,381
If the holes form a triangle,
it's a spoonworm.

369
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,017
FUN FUN GUY TRIES
CATCHING A SPOONWORM TOO

370
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,552
I can't dig it up.

371
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,689
Dig some more over here. There was a hole.

372
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,091
But there's nothing here.

373
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:10,896
Besides President Poseidon,
the rest of us have a long way to go.

374
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,165
We don't know even when we dig it up.

375
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,002
We don't know if it's a spoonworm hole
or a hole where the water goes out.

376
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,070
We don't know.

377
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,273
SNIFFLING

378
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,508
Hey, wait.

379
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,910
Poseidon, over here. I think it's here.

380
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,312
-You're right.
-It could be here.

381
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,379
It could be here, right?

382
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,315
Don't come here! Do not approach.

383
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,751
You have to be fast. Hurry!

384
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,452
-You got it.
-I got it!

385
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,855
I got it! I got it!

386
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,623
Oh, my gosh! I got it!

387
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,691
Come out.

388
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,559
Hang on. There's a blue crab here.

389
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,661
There's a blue crab here.

390
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,399
HE CAUGHT A GIANT SPOONWORM

391
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,834
It's huge! I caught it!

392
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,570
-So long!
-So long! You got a huge one!

393
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,671
Let's do it together.

394
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,006
-So long!
-So long!

395
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,475
-He caught one after shoveling once.
-Geez.

396
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,544
I think it was planted there.

397
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,247
I can do better than him.

398
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,748
I'm going to catch one soon.

399
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,150
I'm just saving my energy.

400
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,320
HE ISN'T SULKING,
HE IS JUST SAVING ENERGY

401
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,889
I hope that

402
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,391
Fun Fun Guy can catch a spoonworm.

403
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,026
Come over here.

404
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,494
I'll give you a chance. Come here.

405
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,562
Right here.

406
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,266
MEANWHILE,
SPOONWORM GUY IS SHOVELING HARD

407
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,334
-Right here. Here.
-Where?

408
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,936
Right here, Fun Fun Guy.

409
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,237
I'll give you a chance.

410
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,239
-Here I go.
-Don't shovel like--

411
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,741
You have to do it quickly.

412
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,743
You have to get one
for the first time ever.

413
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,545
BENDING

414
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,613
Wait, your shovel is broken.

415
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,682
Is it broken? Just throw it away.

416
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,552
Why did you bring a shovel like that?
You're so frustrating.

417
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,619
-Use this one.
-Yes.

418
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:41,854
-My shovel broke.
-Yes.

419
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,290
I'm amazed that it lasted until today.

420
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,725
-There was a hole here.
-Yes, keep going.

421
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,793
Yes. Keep going.

422
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,961
Keep going. It's there.

423
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,196
SHOVEL MAY NOT BE THE ISSUE

424
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,631
You might catch
a small octopus at this rate.

425
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,266
STUMBLING

426
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,368
Gosh, this shovel is…

427
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,370
Gosh, let's stop.

428
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,872
-Stop.
-Let's take a break.

429
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,273
A break?

430
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,542
You didn't even dig for that long.

431
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,411
You got it.

432
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,246
-I didn't even know that.
-He got it.

433
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,781
He didn't even know he caught it.

434
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,849
It already came out.

435
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,483
When did it come out?

436
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,219
-It should've told me.
-Change your shovel.

437
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,622
MEANWHILE,
SPOONWORM GUY DOESN'T TIRE OUT

438
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,624
HE CATCHES

439
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,758
Here it is.

440
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,794
AND HE CATCHES

441
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,095
He caught it in the end.

442
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,163
Here it is.

443
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,232
EVERY TIME HE DIGS A SPOT,
HE CATCHES ONE

444
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,234
-He is Poseidon.
-Got it.

445
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,402
-He really is Poseidon.
-Do you agree?

446
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,304
He has an insane amount of energy.

447
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,840
Someone like him has to be the president.

448
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:35,941
His energy is just…

449
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,010
And he treats people like… Wait.

450
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,751
FOUND A SPOONWORM SPOT

451
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,519
What was your question earlier?

452
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,255
Hang on a moment.

453
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,423
NEWBIE IS BECOMING
LIKE THE PRESIDENT

454
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:52,925
There!

455
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,563
Look. Take a look.

456
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,298
Look at it. Come and take a look.

457
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,201
HE KEEPS INSISTING ON US LOOKING
AT IT, SO WE ARE LOOKING AT IT

458
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,437
We don't have time
to interview me right now.

459
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,639
HOW IS THE NEWBIE DOING?

460
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,207
He's good at spotting them.

461
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,209
I told him once
and he was able to spot them.

462
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,877
He's teaching the other members.

463
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,381
WHO'S BETTER,
FUN FUN GUY OR NEWBIE?

464
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,416
Defconn is much better than him.

465
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,419
-They're everywhere here.
-They are.

466
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,754
-They're everywhere.
-Really?

467
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,422
-They are really everywhere.
-Yes.

468
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,859
THEY START SHOVELING ANEW

469
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,395
Geez. My shovel is destroyed.

470
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,963
SHOVEL LOST ITS FUNCTION
A WHILE AGO

471
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,298
My shovel is dead.

472
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,133
The water isn't coming in.

473
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,200
SNAP

474
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,937
-No way.
-The shovel finally broke.

475
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,004
Applause.

476
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,239
It broke.

477
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,774
It didn't last the day.

478
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,375
The spoonworms seem

479
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,078
-to move faster underneath than we think.
-Yes.

480
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,146
They're fast,

481
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,981
so you have to move fast
when you see the hole.

482
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,317
-To be honest, your shovel is too short.
-What?

483
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,551
-It's too short.
-It is?

484
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,653
It should be about 40 cm.

485
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,455
You brought that shovel, knowing that?

486
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,390
EMBARRASSED

487
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,626
I saw a spoonworm hole.

488
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,062
-No, you can't do it there.
-What?

489
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,196
There's a hole.

490
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,231
-Try digging again.
-What?

491
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,400
HANDS OVER THE SHOVEL

492
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,736
SNAPS AGAIN

493
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,938
He ruined it!

494
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,674
That was my shovel, man!

495
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:16,842
THE DESTROYER STRIKES AGAIN

496
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,777
How am I supposed to catch anything?

497
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,479
I quit! Geez!

498
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,147
Whatever, man!

499
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,016
-Whatever!
-Hey.

500
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,517
Come to Dongdaemun.

501
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,520
Why did you bring a shovel like this?

502
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,489
That's not the point.
You don't know how to use it!

503
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,392
You weren't happy about breaking yours,
so you broke mine as well?

504
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,727
President Poseidon,

505
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,096
he broke my shovel.

506
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,697
NOT INTERESTED

507
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,232
ALWAYS STAYS ON COURSE

508
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,267
How can you break it like this?

509
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,502
Come over here.

510
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,371
A moment of silence for the broken shovel.

511
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,605
We don't have time for that.

512
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,574
We have to dig while the water comes in.

513
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,109
NO TIME
MUST CATCH SPOONWORMS

514
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,910
A moment of silence for the broken shovel.

515
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,479
-A moment of silence.
-Let's do it.

516
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,047
-Thank you.
-Just one more.

517
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,016
-You worked hard.
-Yes.

518
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,952
I hope you come back as a gaff
in your next life.

519
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,287
What can you do?

520
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,490
Shovels tend to break

521
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,358
when they get soaked.

522
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,829
AFTER TODAY, DO YOU HAVE THE
DESIRE TO GET BETTER EQUIPMENT?

523
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:11,897
What?

524
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,099
ARE YOU OKAY?

525
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,935
Look. I'm sorry, but you see,

526
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,504
all I see are triangular holes.

527
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,606
My nose keeps running.

528
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,142
I'm cold, hungry, and tired,

529
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,945
but all I can see are the holes
in the shape of a triangle.

530
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,815
I am going to dream
about those holes tonight.

531
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,883
HE'LL SEE THE HOLES
IN HIS DREAM

532
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,886
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
15:00 LUNCH

533
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,288
What is this car? Tell me.

534
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,557
-Is this the camper you mentioned before?
-The camper.

535
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,758
-Is this it?
-Yes.

536
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,794
I slept here a few times as well.

537
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,228
I'm a certified carpenter.

538
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,563
-You're a carpenter?
-Yes.

539
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,065
DECORATED EVERY CORNER HIMSELF

540
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,033
You can watch Netflix and everything.

541
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,103
So you've combined
camping, coastal foraging,

542
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,471
-and fishing.
-Like…

543
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,573
-Like peanut butter and jelly.
-Right.

544
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,009
My house is packed with camping equipment.

545
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,644
I have about six tents at home.

546
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,878
-You're a camper.
-Yes.

547
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,280
-I have about six burners.
-Yes.

548
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,248
You must not have a lot in savings.

549
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,819
The people who took my money,
please call me.

550
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:07,886
TODAY'S CATCH

551
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,421
-Look at the blue crabs.
-Applause.

552
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,423
-Gosh. Look at it.
-Applause.

553
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,325
-They're so fresh.
-They are.

554
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,961
-We only caught the big ones.
-Yes, we did.

555
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,830
Do we eat what we caught?

556
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,565
Are we going to taste them now?

557
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:20,799
CLEANS THE SPOONWORMS FIRST

558
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,601
-My goodness.
-Try some.

559
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,503
-It has a chewy texture.
-Chewy.

560
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,338
IMMEDIATELY TAKES A BITE

561
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,506
How is it?

562
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,740
Isn't it amazing?

563
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,742
Isn't the texture great?

564
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,878
My gosh!

565
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,680
It's so sweet.

566
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,348
-Have some.
-Go ahead.

567
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,283
-I can't eat those.
-You can't?

568
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,219
-It's too gross for him.
-Why can't you eat it?

569
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,688
-I've never had them.
-Really?

570
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,124
-It has a strong ocean smell, right?
-It is.

571
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,226
You've never had it, so how do you know?

572
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,827
-You've never had any.
-You see,

573
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,963
freshly caught ones
have a strong ocean smell.

574
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,598
It's so nice.

575
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,600
-Let's eat the next one.
-All right.

576
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,767
-Blue crab ramyeon.
-Yes.

577
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,102
Let's try the blue crab ramyeon.

578
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,805
THE MAIN CHEF

579
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,941
HE PUT A GENEROUS AMOUNT
OF TODAY'S CATCH

580
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,144
-Gosh, that was quick.
-Try some.

581
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,245
CRAB AND OCTOPUS RAMYEON

582
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,846
Thank you so much.

583
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,582
-Defconn gets a whole webfoot octopus…
-Yes.

584
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,650
…as he's our guest.

585
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,985
-Cut it up some more.
-No.

586
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,386
NEWBIE GETS THE ONLY OCTOPUS

587
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,021
I really like webfoot octopus.

588
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,422
My goodness.

589
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,628
Oh, my!

590
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,730
IT TASTES BETTER
AS THEY CAUGHT THEM THEMSELVES

591
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:25,831
It tastes better.

592
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,699
It's better.

593
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,967
A BITE OF PRECIOUS WEBFOOT OCTOPUS

594
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,336
Only the one who shoveled hard
deserves the webfoot octopus.

595
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,941
SUCKING ON THE BLUE CRAB

596
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,912
THE BLUE CRAB
SOAKED IN RAMYEON SOUP

597
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:40,979
Gosh.

598
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,448
How is it so tender?

599
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,621
-It tastes better because it's fresh.
-Yes.

600
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,990
I really love blue crab.

601
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,427
The blue crab broth is amazing as well.

602
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,429
WHILE THEY ARE BUSY EATING

603
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,165
THE PRESIDENT CLEANS
THE PURPLE BUTTER CLAM

604
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,935
HE ADDS IT AND SEA SNAILS
TO THE SPICY NOODLES

605
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,939
POSEIDON'S SPECIALTY,
SPICY CLAM NOODLES

606
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,574
HE PROMPTLY SERVES THE SECOND DISH

607
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,309
A round of applause.

608
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,376
Very nice.

609
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,844
Have a bite.

610
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,450
I should take off my gloves.

611
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,486
-I'll add some of this.
-Gosh.

612
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,288
Why is it sweet?

613
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,090
-It's amazing.
-Yes.

614
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,825
Wow! Look at the purple butter clam.

615
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,161
Zoom in.

616
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,165
NEWBIE'S FIRST-EVER
PURPLE BUTTER CLAM

617
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,001
So this is
what the purple butter clam tastes like.

618
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,102
It's damn good.

619
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,307
Do you remember when you were
the most excited while coastal foraging?

620
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,209
You got totally excited because of it.

621
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,912
-When I came for the second time…
-Yes.

622
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,414
…I went to a mudflat oyster spot.

623
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,317
Everyone who went there
was unsuccessful that day,

624
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,385
but I kept finding them.

625
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,453
-The oysters?
-Yes.

626
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,122
Others couldn't find any.
I was the only one who could spot them.

627
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,690
-I caught those oysters.
-How awesome.

628
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,593
I caught about 40 kg of mudflat oysters.

629
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,162
-Forty kilograms of oysters?
-Yes.

630
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,298
While I was walking
from back there to here,

631
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,366
my back was…

632
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,433
It hurt so much?

633
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,235
HAHA

634
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,104
-But you felt?
-I felt…

635
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,905
I was smiling from ear to ear.

636
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,708
Is it difficult to catch mudflat oysters?

637
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,810
Those are pretty easy.

638
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,313
EXCITEMENT RUINED

639
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,415
He was talking
as if it was some legendary story,

640
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,117
-so I looked over and he seemed…
-Wait.

641
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,552
AWKWARD SMILE

642
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,321
It felt like he thought,
"You're still a newbie."

643
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,123
It's easy to catch mudflat oysters,

644
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,424
but it's hard to carry them.

645
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,892
-Because they're heavy.
-Yes.

646
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,328
-But they were like treasure to you.
-Yes, they were.

647
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,630
-You went out and caught them.
-Yes.

648
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,366
I think coastal foraging is like a picnic.

649
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,869
-You're happy when you go on a picnic.
-Yes.

650
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,837
After coastal foraging,

651
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,707
I can stay happy
even during a hectic work week.

652
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,776
I was physically tired, but it was so fun.

653
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,779
I was so into it.
I kept going around like this.

654
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:57,416
Coastal foraging is fun, relaxing,

655
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,752
and you acquire something at the end.

656
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,621
I think that's what's alluring about it.

657
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:07,025
I think the best part of it
is that you get to enjoy nature.

658
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,727
