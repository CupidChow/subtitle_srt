LOCATION: SUWON, GYEONGGI-DO
TIME: 11 A.M.

00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,940
Hello, Netflix Club members,
how has your week been?

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,908
I observe clubs with the eyes of a bird.

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,210
I'm Defconn,

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:13,913
the newbie who's crazy about clubs.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,949
The club that I'll be meeting today

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,553
uses their whole body
to express nature and love to a rhythm.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,090
I'm visiting a Hula club!

9
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,593
Let me introduce the newbie
who will be joining me today.

10
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,661
This person has a lot of energy
and great reactions.

11
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,431
She fought zombies with me
not too long ago.

12
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,067
It's Patricia!

13
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,070
-Hello.
-Wow!

14
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,206
Hello, I'm the newbie
who's crazy about having fun.

15
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,475
Patricia, have you been doing well?

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,346
-Aloha.
-Hello. Aloha.

17
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,847
Anyway, how have you been doing?

18
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,283
-I've been trying a bit of this and that.
-Trying?

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,786
You see, I don't speak English that well.

20
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,254
-Can you speak English?
-No.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,256
-What's your name?
-My name is Patricia.

22
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,957
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Congo.

23
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,359
Please do a dance from Congo.

24
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,094
I don't know any.

25
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,563
THE ENGLISH CONVERSATION
ENDS IN 10 SECONDS

26
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,632
Shall we meet the members now?

27
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:08,334
Where are you, Hula club members?

28
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,536
Aloha.

29
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,671
-Aloha.
-Aloha.

30
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,906
-Oh, my gosh.
-Aloha.

31
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,909
HAWAIIAN-VIBE GREETINGS FROM THE SENIORS

32
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,278
WELCOME TO HAWAII

33
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,712
Is this how you usually do it?

34
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,347
IN HAWAII, GYEONGGI-DO RIGHT NOW

35
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,149
Oh, my. Aloha.

36
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,186
As a way of welcoming you to Hawaii,

37
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,788
we wanted to pass on
our warm feelings to you.

38
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,690
-That's why you hug each other.
-That's right.

39
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,358
Please introduce your club to us.

40
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:37,097
It started off as a small group
that formed at our apartment complex.

41
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,232
-Then, it got bigger.
-Oh, my.

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,469
That's how we ended up dancing
the beautiful Hawaiian dance together.

43
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,270
-Have you been to Hawaii?
-No.

44
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,171
-You haven't?
-No.

45
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,540
But you're still doing the Hula dance?

46
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,776
Hawaii hasn't called me yet.

47
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,178
What do you mean?
You need to go with your own money.

48
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,013
There's a saying.

49
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,282
"I will go when it calls me."

50
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,017
Has anyone lived in Hawaii?

51
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,553
-I stayed there for about a month.
-A month?

52
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,855
Yes, I lived there for a month.

53
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,523
-Living in Hawaii for a month.
-Yes.

54
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,159
It wasn't intentional,
but we three have been there.

55
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,660
And they will go in the future.

56
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,395
That's how we're standing right now.

57
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,763
The shrimp truck is famous there.

58
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,465
-Have you heard of it?
-That's right.

59
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,400
I've tried it in Korea.

60
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,069
-Hawaiian shrimp truck in Korea?
-Yes.

61
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,471
Not from the shrimp truck,
but I've had shrimp.

62
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,706
SHE JUST HAD SHRIMP BEFORE

63
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,907
What are you talking about?

64
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,942
Please introduce yourselves.

65
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,410
I'm Han Hyo-jin.

66
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,080
I've been doing Hula
for about eight years.

67
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,116
I want to continue doing it
because I love the Hula dance,

68
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,986
and I want others to know about it.

69
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,021
President Han has so much love for Hula.

70
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,557
-I do.
-Give her a round of applause.

71
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,025
Hello, I'm Lee Bo-yeong,

72
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,427
and I'm in charge of
Moana's general affairs for 2025.

73
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,362
Bo-yeong.

74
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,030
Do you like drawings?

75
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,131
Yes, I do.

76
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,699
-It's a Hula dancer.
-That's so cool!

77
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,067
-A Hula dancer.
-It's so pretty.

78
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,536
That's awesome. Look at the bay leaf.

79
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,638
You can only do Hula if you have these.

80
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,473
-The others don't have any.
-They will soon.

81
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,608
The ones who study abroad get them.

82
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,776
But she's never been, and she has them.

83
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,911
She'll be going.

84
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,379
-She hasn't gone yet.
-Someday.

85
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,782
I used to be a professional surfer.

86
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,485
I went to Hawaii to surf,

87
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,855
but I fell in love with Hula
when I saw a performance.

88
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,858
So I said to myself, "Starting today,
my dream is to be a Hula dancer."

89
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,928
And that's how I changed my job to this.

90
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,729
I really like surfing.

91
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,565
-Have you tried it?
-Once.

92
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,567
CONFIDENT

93
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,969
-You say you like it, but you did it once?
-I really like it.

94
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,204
-Do you really?
-I do.

95
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,840
Hello, I'm Kim Hyo-young,
and I've been a member for two years.

96
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,743
-I'm also a mental health nurse.
-I see.

97
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,445
-I've noticed on TV
-Yes.

98
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,147
that you're addicted to dopamine.

99
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,250
Yes, those are the types of shows I host.

100
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,485
I think it'd be nice
if you experience a serotonin boost

101
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,254
while you dance.

102
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,456
I can't help that they're fun shows.

103
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,490
Do you not watch them?

104
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,026
I do watch them.

105
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,728
-You can balance it out.
-Balance.

106
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,696
-Good point.
-Balance.

107
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,565
I'm Lee Hui-hwa,
and I've been a member for eight months.

108
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,234
She's an eight-month-old newbie.

109
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,134
HAPPY TO SEE A NEWBIE

110
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,402
She's a school teacher.

111
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,805
-While she teaches at the school--
-Middle school?

112
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,473
Yes, I'm a middle school teacher.

113
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,909
I'm a college friend of Hyo-jin.

114
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,578
-When I was in a tough and painful time,
-Yes?

115
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,348
I saw our president dance.

116
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,150
-She looked so happy and beautiful.
-Right.

117
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,952
I thought I could be happy too,

118
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,754
so I came here to find happiness.

119
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,323
-You followed your friend.
-To find happiness.

120
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,424
I'm Mahina Kim Gyeong-mi,

121
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,426
and I've been doing Hula for four years.

122
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,728
Nice to meet you.

123
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,895
Is Mahina your name?

124
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,564
It's my Hawaiian Hula name.

125
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:25,732
But you haven't been before.

126
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,100
-No.
-Mahina.

127
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,736
-Yet you have a Hawaiian name.
-But she'll go one day.

128
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,171
Mahina, who thinks a lot about Hawaii.

129
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,641
-She thinks a lot about going.
-Exactly.

130
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,876
-Shouldn't we see their Hula dance?
-We should.

131
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,777
-Shall we?
-Yes.

132
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,112
Give them a round of applause!

133
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,179
THE SENIORS' HULA DEMONSTRATION

134
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,515
The song that we will dance to is called

135
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,317
"Mohala Ka Hinano."

136
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,288
It means,
"the hinano flower has fully bloomed."

137
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,822
-Nice. Give them a big hand!
-Nice.

138
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,127
A SONG WRITTEN BY JOHNNY LUM HO

139
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,229
Smile.

140
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,700
THEY START WITH A SMILE

141
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:09,809
THE HINANO FLOWER THAT BLOOMED ON KEHENA

142
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:16,582
AS THE HALA TREE GROWS,
IT EMITS A GENTLE FRAGRANCE

143
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,685
-Their facial expressions are amazing.
-I know.

144
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,420
-They look peaceful.
-They do.

145
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,623
I briefly felt so relaxed.

146
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,458
DOPAMINE DETOX, SEROTONIN TIME

147
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,360
-It's so nice.
-Look at their hands.

148
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:32,665
OH, THE SWEET FRAGRANCE
OF THE FLOWER I LOVE

149
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,766
The flower.

150
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,907
Oh, look. It's a flower.

151
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,310
THE HINANO FLOWER BLOOMS
IN THE SILENCE OF PUNA

152
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,713
STRUGGLING TO FOLLOW

153
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,016
GLANCING OVER

154
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,886
THE NEWBIES' EYES MOVE FAST AS WELL

155
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,989
IT ENDS PEACEFULLY WITH A SMILE

156
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:57,990
It's over.

157
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,462
Wow! That was so awesome!

158
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,864
That was so cool!

159
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,368
-Everyone's expression looked so peaceful.
-Right.

160
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,669
-Like this.
-Yes.

161
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,170
-That's too dispirited.
-Well…

162
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,172
-You look like you're drunk.
-Come on.

163
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,609
You look like a drunk person
in Hannam-dong on the weekend.

164
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,844
Was I like that?

165
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,613
And I could tell

166
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,748
that you definitely

167
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,317
-are new to this.
-Yes.

168
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,986
THE 8-MONTH-OLD MEMBER
ONLY KNEW HOW TO SMILE

169
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,688
You caught me.

170
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,390
When I saw their faces,

171
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,457
I knew.

172
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,092
I knew that it'd be relaxing.

173
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,664
The facial expression.
I'd like to learn that.

174
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,667
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
12:00 LEARNING THE BASIC DANCE MOVES

175
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,036
-Let's learn the posture and steps.
-Okay.

176
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:44,937
Wait.

177
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,939
She has the flower on her right.
Are you single?

178
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:47,840
Yes.

179
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,142
THE ONE SINGLE MEMBER

180
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,144
The singles wear it on the right

181
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,845
and married people
wear it on the left, right?

182
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,147
Pardon me,

183
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,483
but why is your heart rate
at 122 right now?

184
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,619
Her heart rate is at 122.

185
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,320
We haven't even started. What's going on?

186
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,189
It's 125.

187
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,891
-What's going on?
-What's wrong, Sister?

188
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,093
It's saying it's too loud in here.

189
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,328
The decibel was too high.

190
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,031
Let's learn the basic step
called the ka'o.

191
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,167
Push your hip to the left.

192
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,668
To the left. That's it.

193
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,271
Now, push it to the right.

194
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,306
-One.
-Step and push.

195
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,541
-Two.
-Two.

196
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,043
It shouldn't be so sensuous.

197
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,579
You aren't trying to seduce me.

198
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,880
PATRICIA WAS JUST BORN SEXY

199
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
-Three.
-One, two.

200
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,751
-One, two.
-One, two.

201
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,352
BEHIND HER, THERE'S A CREAKING HIP

202
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,420
Is this right?

203
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,223
I can't tell what's wrong.

204
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,992
FROM HEAD TO TOE

205
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,794
-Use your core muscles.
-My core?

206
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,095
Don't move your shoulders.

207
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,133
HE MOVES ARE GETTING STRANGER

208
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,769
The next step is called the kaholo.

209
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,840
Move two steps to the right
and two steps to the left.

210
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,942
One, two.

211
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:59,345
HER HIPS SWAY WITHOUT FAIL

212
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,514
That's sexy. Why do you look so sexy?

213
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,819
Stretch your right arm out
to the right for the kaholo.

214
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,654
Stretch your right arm out
to the right for the kaholo.

215
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,556
Don't follow me. Go that way.

216
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,691
THE ONLY ONE IN MIRROR MODE

217
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,592
Ma'am!

218
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,526
MOVING IN CONFUSION

219
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,628
-Kaholo is this way.
-Don't follow me.

220
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,165
From here, we're going to do the hela.

221
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,200
The right foot goes forward.

222
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,002
Bring it back.

223
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,171
The left foot goes to your 11 o'clock.

224
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,439
Is that your left foot?

225
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,641
IT WASN'T, BUT IT LOOKED RIGHT

226
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,709
NOT GOOD WITH DIRECTIONS

227
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,511
I'm all over the place.

228
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,513
You keep going in this squatted position.

229
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,514
-In a squat position?
-Yes.

230
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,515
Stick your foot out,
bring it back, and bend.

231
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,450
Straighten your core.

232
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,718
-Like this?
-Yes.

233
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,553
Don't come this way.

234
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,787
Stay in place.

235
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,489
-I don't move?
-You don't move.

236
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,791
-Hela, hela.
-Hela, hela.

237
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,692
Don't come to me.

238
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,362
-Hela, hela.
-But I'm not moving forward.

239
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,797
-Hela, hela.
-Hela, hela.

240
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,798
Don't go backward.

241
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,034
Who moves forward like that?

242
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,702
It's my first time.

243
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,638
THE NEWBIE IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO LETS HIM DO IT

244
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,406
-Hela, hela.
-Hela, hela.

245
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,842
Those were the basic steps.

246
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,043
-All right.
-My thighs are burning up.

247
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,312
-Now, the ai ha'a. Hands on your hips.
-Ai ha'a.

248
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,147
Let's start with the ka'o.

249
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,949
Send your hips to the left.

250
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,551
No.

251
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,653
OOPS

252
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,354
You looked angry just now.

253
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,556
When my right foot moved,

254
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,057
-you said, "No."
-No.

255
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,292
You have to try to keep up.

256
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,493
Do you have a dog?

257
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,494
NO ONE IS INHERENTLY BAD

258
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,995
-"No!" It sounded like that.
-"No."

259
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,197
-We'll try the hand gestures now.
-Hand gestures?

260
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,900
First of all, think of someone

261
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,503
and try to express
your love to that person with your face.

262
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,971
-Who will you think about?
-What?

263
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,773
-Isn't it Jonathan for you?
-Jonathan.

264
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,907
Jonathan?

265
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,442
-He's your brother.
-Ma'am.

266
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,477
-He crossed the line.
-He's teasing me.

267
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,845
Is there a celebrity you like?

268
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,715
I like Cha Eun-woo.

269
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,418
-Cha Eun-woo?
-Yes.

270
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,886
You like Cha Eun-woo these days?

271
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,255
He's so handsome
that I thought I was going to pass out.

272
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,524
Let's do that
along with the hand gestures.

273
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,993
Place your left hand
in front of the left side of your chest.

274
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,396
Spin your right hand around it
to express how you feel.

275
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,699
You're saying, "I love you."

276
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,567
Think about Cha Eun-woo as you do it.

277
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,004
Aloha.

278
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,339
TO CHA EUN-WOO

279
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,174
You look a bit scary.

280
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,809
She looks a bit scary.

281
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,677
Again.

282
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,581
HER EYES LOOK SLIGHTLY CRAZY
AND HER SMILE IS TOO BIG

283
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,784
Next, you're expressing how much fun
you're having and how happy you are.

284
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,419
Which happy thought comes to mind?

285
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,722
I had some jokbal and soju last night.

286
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,223
-That sounds so good.
-I was so happy.

287
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,625
-Of course.
-Yes.

288
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,326
I was happy.

289
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,761
Who were you with?

290
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,396
-With my husband.
-I see.

291
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,131
I love you, honey.

292
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,034
For the flower, you press both hands down,

293
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,770
and then, you bring your fingers together

294
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,738
as you flip them over.

295
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,206
Mandu.

296
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,676
-Mandu, mandu.
-I knew you'd do that.

297
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,412
This is how you would gesture a dumpling.

298
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,747
You don't know what this is, do you?

299
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,681
What is it?

300
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,949
She doesn't know.

301
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,183
-That's why she did that.
-This isn't dumpling.

302
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,752
-You do it like this.
-That's right.

303
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,321
-Mandu, mandu, mandu.
-Mandu, mandu, mandu.

304
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,522
Wait.

305
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,723
-Gyeong-mi.
-What?

306
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,991
Yes, Defconn?

307
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,092
You smell like alcohol.

308
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,428
I didn't drink that much!

309
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,597
How many bottles did you have?

310
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,298
-One bottle.
-One bottle?

311
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,967
That's not too much?

312
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,636
Who drinks a whole bottle
the night before filming?

313
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,605
For rainbow, you lower your arm

314
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,607
and make a rainbow like this.

315
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,841
Make a round rainbow.

316
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,710
-It's almost like sign language.
-Right?

317
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,578
-It's like a language.
-Yes.

318
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,347
Hula is sometimes called sign language

319
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,082
as it's a language
spoken through the use of hands.

320
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,283
Patricia, do "backyard."

321
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,818
Backyard.

322
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,919
SUDDEN GAME OF CHARADES

323
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,054
Back…

324
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,923
Is that for backyard?

325
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,258
Backs together? Is that it?

326
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,959
LITERALLY DESCRIBES "BACK" AND "YARD"

327
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,828
Do you even know what a backyard is?

328
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,797
She's so creative.

329
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,765
Backyard?

330
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,935
Shall we learn how to Hula for real?

331
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,137
Okay, let's do it.

332
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,441
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
13:00 HULA DANCING

333
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,709
Let's do the first verse.

334
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,143
-The first verse.
-We'll do that.

335
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:58,217
THE HINANO FLOWER THAT BLOOMED ON KEHENA

336
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:05,191
KEY POINT: THE HINANO FLOWER BLOOMS
AND EMITS FRAGRANCE

337
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,659
-Go on.
-In that verse…

338
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,761
The hinano flower
appears in the first verse.

339
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,963
The hinano flower blooms.

340
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,531
-It blooms.
-Where does it bloom?

341
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,534
-It bloomed on the beach.
-It bloomed on the beach.

342
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,069
-It bloomed again.
-Yes.

343
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,205
But the forest

344
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,239
is expressed with trees.

345
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,507
Do you see the trees?

346
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,042
It's turning into a tree, isn't it?

347
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,310
-A tree.
-A tree.

348
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,745
-And it's pretty.
-It's pretty.

349
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,046
-It's pretty.
-It's pretty.

350
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:27,980
-It's pretty.
-Go.

351
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:28,881
-Is it pretty?
-It is.

352
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,784
-It even smells nice.
-Oh, my.

353
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,918
-Floral.
-That's it.

354
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,221
Hey, it's pretty simple.

355
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,989
THEY PRACTICE WITH THE MUSIC

356
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,324
Use your core muscles.

357
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,127
One, two, now! Twice!

358
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,062
Three times to the left.

359
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,397
THE BEGINNING IS SMOOTH SAILING

360
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,632
The flower blooms.

361
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,870
THE MEMBERS' FLOWERS BLOOM BEAUTIFULLY

362
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,373
THE MUTANT FLOWER BLOOMS STRANGELY

363
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,708
-It's pretty.
-It is.

364
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,942
It even smells good.

365
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,211
Twice to the right.

366
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,514
Geez, this man.

367
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,481
Three times.

368
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,783
UNAWARE THAT HE INVADED HER SPACE

369
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,485
You got it? That's it.

370
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,386
That's it.

371
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,621
I think we can go to Hawaii.

372
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,022
Yes, you did well.

373
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:17,096
OH, THE SWEET FRAGRANCE
OF THE FLOWER I LOVE

374
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:30,042
KEY POINT: SMELL THE SWEET FRAGRANCE
OF THE FLOWER

375
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,944
In the second verse,
holding out is important.

376
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:32,845
-Holding out?
-Sweet.

377
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:33,879
-The fragrance is…
-Sweet.

378
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,082
Oh, sweet

379
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,051
-You're holding out for too long.
-You have to.

380
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,922
In the first verse,
the fragrance is very gentle,

381
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,658
so you express
that gentle fragrance in a subtle way.

382
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,593
During the "Oh, sweet"
in the second verse,

383
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,329
the fragrance hits us very strongly.

384
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,264
THE SECOND VERSE
NEEDS TO BE MORE EXPRESSIVE

385
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,366
-It's different with the music.
-Okay.

386
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,035
-With more feeling.
-From "Oh, sweet."

387
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,804
-Oh, sweet
-That's it. Go deep.

388
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,606
Smell the fragrance and express it.

389
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,575
EXHALING

390
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:03,909
It shouldn't look dirty.

391
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,444
"OH, SWEET" FOCUS

392
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,514
-Oh, sweet
-Oh, sweet

393
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,351
OVERDOSING ON SWEETNESS

394
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,119
-His lips.
-The flower.

395
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,688
SHE CAN'T BEAR TO SEE THE NEWBIE'S FACE

396
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:16,722
Make the flower.

397
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,357
OH!

398
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,892
HE SOUNDS SPOOKY RATHER THAN SWEET

399
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,060
Not yet.

400
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,332
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED
BY THE NEWBIE

401
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:27,867
Now.

402
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,568
EXPRESSIVENESS SUFFOCATES THE ONLOOKERS

403
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,669
Make the flower.

404
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,804
Got it? Is it better?

405
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,673
SINGING THE MELODY

406
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,475
He's really into it.

407
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,711
-I love this song.
-It has that effect on you.

408
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,212
I love this song.

409
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,247
It's addicting.

410
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,948
It's crazy.
I want to keep listening to it.

411
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:49,355
I WEAVE A HAT WITH MANY TWIGS

412
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:55,961
KEY POINT: WEAVE A HAT USING THE LEAVES

413
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,730
-Weave.
-Weave.

414
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,198
-Weave.
-Yes, weave.

415
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,967
Turn around and put the hat on.

416
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,535
-Put the hat on.
-Put the hat on.

417
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,505
-Like a queen. I'm a queen.
-Put it on like a hat.

418
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,407
After wearing the hat,

419
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,441
look to the right.

420
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,843
LOOK TO THE RIGHT AND TURN

421
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,578
-Put the hat on.
-Yes.

422
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,846
-Put it on.
-Look to the right.

423
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,314
-Look to the right.
-Yes.

424
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,482
-Look.
-Okay.

425
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,084
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT SHE DIDN'T GET IT

426
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,252
She struggles with directions.

427
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,220
Yes, I do.

428
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,688
HASN'T GAINED HER SENSE OF DIRECTION

429
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,590
-That's an unexpected obstacle.
-Yes.

430
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,591
Turn to your right.

431
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,059
Turn to my right!

432
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,093
Turn to your left.

433
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,495
Turn to my left!

434
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:30,996
Good job.

435
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,498
PATRICIA ONLY KNOWS HOW TO TURN LEFT

436
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,566
You did well. You got your left and right.

437
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,802
Then, let's start from the top
and go through it

438
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,871
with the members one last time.

439
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,105
Sounds good. Let's do it.

440
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,874
You can do it.

441
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,108
Make sure to smile.

442
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,312
Twice. Twice to the right.

443
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,379
Three times to the left.

444
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,048
WHAT'S UP WITH HIS FACE?
Three times to the left.

445
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,316
Make the flower.

446
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,517
Ka pua.

447
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,086
THE HINANO FLOWER THAT BLOOMED ON KEHENA

448
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,989
-Where did it bloom?
-On the beach.

449
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,494
Now, the forest. The tree. Let's go.

450
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,830
It's tall and pretty.

451
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,699
It's pretty to look at

452
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,200
-and it even smells nice.
-It's pretty.

453
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,602
Twice to the right.

454
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,138
Three times to the left.

455
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,075
THE NEWBIES ARE IMMERSED
IN THE PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE

456
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,811
THE "OH, SWEET" PART

457
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,914
HOW LOW ARE YOU GOING?

458
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:28,187
OH, THE SWEET FRAGRANCE
OF THE FLOWER I LOVE

459
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,489
WHAT'S WITH HIS MOUTH?

460
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,025
THE FRUIT THAT GROWS FROM THE FLOWER
IS TRULY BEAUTIFUL

461
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,259
Look to the right.

462
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,996
-The tree.
-The big flower.

463
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,697
FANCY FOOTWORK

464
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,133
Sew.

465
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,301
Sew.

466
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,269
Uwehe. Ami.

467
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,170
WOVEN INTO AN ORNAMENTAL WREATH

468
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,939
Turn.

469
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,173
ONLY ONE LOOKING BACK

470
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,174
He's so funny.

471
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,010
Where are you, Defconn?

472
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,612
You can do it. Focus!

473
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,581
All right. It's "Oh, sweet." Go deep.

474
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,050
OH, SWEET

475
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,487
SMELLING THE FRAGRANCE
IS MAKING HIM SCREECH

476
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,522
The flower. The flower at the end.

477
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,591
Smile.

478
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,559
THEY END IT WITH A BLOOMING FLOWER

479
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,296
CLOSED FOR THE DAY
AS THEY USED UP ALL THEIR ENERGY

480
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,665
-Good job.
-Good job.

481
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,100
-Good job.
-Good job.

482
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,802
My shoulder is killing me.

483
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,437
-I'm so exhausted too.
-You did well.

484
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,772
This is really tough.

485
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,807
Only the ones
who went abroad learned this.

486
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,475
-What?
-We learned this in Hawaii.

487
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,543
-In Hawaii?
-Yes.

488
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,878
-Doesn't it…
-That's why it wasn't easy.

489
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:26,879
Doesn't your shoulders hurt?

490
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,680
-My whole body is aching.
-That's normal.

491
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,183
It looked really easy at first.

492
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,520
I came here thinking that all I had to do
was shake my butt a few times, but wow!

493
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,989
It's no joke. It's a great workout.

494
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,757
Gosh, this isn't easy, you guys.

495
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,392
I just thought…

496
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,228
it would end with waving
my hands a little bit,

497
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,930
but you get a whole-body workout.

498
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,165
It was so tough.

499
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,168
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
14:30 WRAP-UP GATHERING

500
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,471
Look at all this.
Isn't this Hawaiian food?

501
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,139
Did you make these musubis?

502
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,108
-Mahina made them.
-Mahina!

503
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,777
MADE BY MAHINA

504
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:04,183
Musubis serve as a symbol
of new encounters.

505
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,519
So I prepared them
because of that hidden meaning.

506
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,921
A close encounter.

507
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,056
Wait, that's not what I meant.

508
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,024
We've gotten close.

509
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,026
-So a close encounter.
-Right.

510
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,896
-Have you performed with your members?
-Yes.

511
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,631
We performed in Hawaii as well.

512
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,632
Really?

513
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,735
So in front of the Hawaiians?

514
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,304
-We danced with them.
-We danced together.

515
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,572
-You collaborated with them?
-Yes.

516
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,907
When I saw myself in the mirror earlier
doing the Hula dance,

517
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,743
I thought I looked kind of cool.

518
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,779
-That's how I felt.
-Me too.

519
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,148
But you've all
experienced that too, right?

520
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,182
It isn't just me, is it?

521
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,018
Sometimes, there are certain dances
that are easier than others.

522
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,987
Simply because my body
just works that way.

523
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,822
-Right.
-I can do it without trying.

524
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,757
-Like the backbend.
-The backbend.

525
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,226
-That's right.

526
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,061
I didn't have to put much effort into it.

527
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,162
I could just do it.

528
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,897
Show us.

529
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,098

SCREAMING

THREE SENIORS TRYING TO SAVE PATRICIA

545
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,060
She didn't do a backbend.

546
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,729
-What was that?
-I'm so embarrassed!

547
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,664
Can anyone else do a backbend?

PLOPS DOWN

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,405
She was a fellow newbie today.

552
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,175
-I was comforted because of her.
-That was so mean.

553
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,409

whether you're heavy or light.

566
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,904
The dances look good regardless.

567
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,005
Your size doesn't matter.

568
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,307

571
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,045
-just to do the exercise.
-Not at all.

572

-You do it just as you are.
-Just as you are.

573
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,714
-Just as you are.
-Yes.

574
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,649
How were we as new members?

-Patricia's expressions made me happy.
-Yes, I agree.

576
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,721
So sweet.

Can you do "Oh, sweet"?

581
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,497
-Can you do it?
-I can't.

582
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,666
What if you do it
as you come back up from a backbend?

583
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,703
Do the backbend and on your way up,

584
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,071
-you say, "Oh, sweet."
-Oh, sweet.

585
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,940
Can you do it?
Why don't you do it for our ending?

586
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,909

Oh, sweet

590
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,626
The music itself has a healing effect.

591
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,829
Even in my daily life,
I just look happier.

592
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,566
It felt like my life
became more at ease and brighter.

593
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,236
Their faces show that they're truly happy.
