1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,205
AT THE CRACK OF DAWN,
BEFORE THE SUN FULLY RISES

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,407
Newbie in the club.

3
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,476
BUILDING UP THE EXCITEMENT

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:14,014
Hello, Netflix Club members.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,053
Every week, we can observe, enjoy,
and feel the clubs of Korea

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,921
on Newbie in the Club.

7
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,257
The newbie who is mad about clubs.

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,792
Newbie in the Club.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,260
I am Defconn. Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,662
Every week, with the eyes of a bird,

11
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,732
I will penetrate deep into Korean clubs

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,268
and do my best to introduce them to you.

13
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:36,870
You can look forward to it.

14
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:40,473
The club that I will be observing
with the eyes of a bird

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,075
is none other than…

16
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,410
Take a look.

17
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:44,844
Badminton, baby.

18
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,112
Shuttlecock, baby.

19
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,415
It's a badminton club.

20
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:53,520
There are three million members
of badminton clubs in Korea.

21
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,722
Let's explore what people love
about clubs in Korea!

22
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,090
Newbie in the Club!

23
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,692
LET'S MEET THE MEMBERS
WHO ARE MAD FOR BADMINTON

24
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,595
How could they play sports at this hour?

25
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,064
SUWON, GYEONGGI-DO
7 A.M.

26
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,365
-Go!
-Good job.

27
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,800
BURNING PASSION
FROM THE EARLY MORNING

28
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,971
FOCUSED HEADS
MOVING BACK AND FORTH

29
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,874
Wow! So many people are playing
this early in the morning.

30
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,042
It must be him.

31
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,478
-Isn't that him?
-Yes, I think it's him.

32
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,180
Hello, there.

33
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,114
Hello.

34
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,982
-Oh, my. Long time no see.
-Yes, hello.

35
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,486
NOT "LONG TIME NO SEE,"
THIS IS THEIR FIRST MEETING

36
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,455
It feels like he's always been
a member of our club.

37
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,489
Sukji!

38
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,124
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes, Sukji.

39
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,559
Oh, yes.

40
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,727
THEY DO NOT CARE THAT
A NEWBIE SHOWED UP

41
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,795
THEY KEEP PLAYING

42
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,197
-Hello, sirs.
-Hello.

43
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,299
-You lost weight.
-He's like our member already.

44
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,433
But wait…

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,769
He brought some Bacchus energy drinks.

46
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,404
-What's that?
-You brought those drinks.

47
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,540
-First of all, are you the president?
-Yes.

48
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,541
NO

49
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,476
I'm the president.

50
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,244
You're the president? I see.

51
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,378
Nice to meet you, sir.

52
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,447
-Well…
-Wait a minute.

53
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,882
-How did you get so slim?
-Pardon?

54
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,783
You've gotten so slim.

55
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,917
I lost weight.

56
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,452
-Seriously.
-Right?

57
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,187
His face looks slim.

58
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,089
Did I just hear a gunshot?

59
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,124
-All right.
-Come here.

60
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,158
-Our guest is here.
-They just keep playing.

61
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:09,762
-Gosh, everyone is so passionate here.
-They don't listen.

62
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,730
Sir.

63
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,831
Welcome.

64
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,267
-Welcome.
-Thank you. Nice to meet you.

65
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,636
-First of all, please have a drink.
-Thanks.

66
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,972
We should be giving you a welcome drink.

67
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,607
I am the newbie.

68
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,375
He knows how things work.

69
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,211
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
7:15 SUBMIT APPLICATION

70
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,814
-I brought the application for the club.
-Give him a round of applause.

71
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,983
We have a newbie
in the Sukji Badminton Club.

72
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,217
-Let's applaud!
-Let's applaud!

73
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,285
Welcome.

74
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,353
Stop.

75
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,488
Can you introduce
Sukji Badminton Club for us?

76
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,892
It started with a tent
in the park at Sukji Mountain,

77
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,493
and it has been going for 33 years.

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,696
We have about 220 members now.

79
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,166
We are the only club
that is surviving in Suwon.

80
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,301
-We are a small group within that.
-Small group?

81
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,402
White Wings.

82
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,436
What is that?

83
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,604
White Wings.

84
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,805
Is it the seniors' club?

85
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,607
All the seniors seem to be there.

86
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,075
Kind of like an elderly club.

87
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,311
Aren't you all like Gandalf?

88
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,481
There is a team called White Wings
within Sukji Badminton Club.

89
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,448
-Yes.
-A small group.

90
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,186
At first, we named it White Wings
because of the feathers.

91
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,554
You're obviously White Wings.

92
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,355
THEIR HAIRSTYLES MATCH
THE GROUP'S NAME

93
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,759
-It is perfect.
-Also, we have seven pastors on our team.

94
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,427
So it should feel like you're with angels,

95
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,996
but I don't quite think it is.

96
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,731
-Are you guys Christian pastors?
-Yes, we are.

97
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,466
Shalom.

98
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,768
Welcome.

99
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,970
My mother is a deaconess.

100
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,539
My father is an elder.

101
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,441
My dad goes to Presbyterian church…

102
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,876
-I see.
-Yes.

103
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,211
Who are the pastors?

104
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,912
-You're a pastor?
-We all are.

105
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,814
-Nice to meet you.
-He's a pastor too.

106
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,316
All of us are pastors.

107
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,318
You don't look like a pastor.

108
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,886
UNEXPECTED DARK-HAIRED PASTOR
IN WHITE WINGS

109
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,087
He's a pastor at our church.

110
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,189
Don't you own
an eyeglass store at Paldal-gu?

111
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,591
He's a pastor at our church.

112
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,226
What a coincidence.

113
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,261
That is why the atmosphere is so nice.

114
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,729
The games can get rough though.

115
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,731
We put our jobs aside during the game,

116
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,766
We fight a lot over whether the
shuttlecock landed in or out of bounds.

117
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,501
In other words, we play like
we have nothing to lose.

118
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,370
You aren't a pastor?

119
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,972
HE OBVIOUSLY IS NOT

120
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,041
Just by his tone,
I could tell he is not a pastor.

121
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,210
"In other words, we play like
we have nothing to lose."

122
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,412
Shouldn't you interview the top player?

123
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,480
Who is the top player?

124
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,582
He claims to be the best.

125
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,217
I am called "Invincible."

126
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,088
Then, first of all,
can you introduce yourselves?

127
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,390
-Also, Mr. Invincible.
-Yes?

128
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,559
-I think you need nipple covers.
-Really?

129
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,893
-They're poking through.
-Oh, really?

130
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,995
They're invincible.

131
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,429
You see?

132
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,664
They are invincible.

133
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,699
My goodness.

134
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,901
They look like
they could penetrate your shirt.

135
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,738
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
7:30 SELF INTRODUCTION

136
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,140
Let me introduce myself first.

137
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,242
Hello, everyone.

138
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,111
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

139
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:42,215
I played badminton when I was young,
but I have not played as an adult.

140
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,883
I am Defconn. Nice to meet you.

141
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,385
DEFCONN, NEWBIE IN THE CLUB

142
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,120
-Defco?
-Defconn.

143
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,087
A dummy phone?

144
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,689
Defconn.

145
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,758
-Not a dummy phone.
-Okay.

146
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,526
-Defcong?
-Yes.

147
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,894
Next up.

148
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,562
The owner of an eyeglass store.

149
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,631
JOB: PASTOR

150
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,433
-What's your nickname?
-It is…

151
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,901
The others call me Cannon.

152
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,069
-Cannon?
-Yes.

153
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,405
His shots are extremely powerful.

154
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,507
You know, he kind of looks like me.

155
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,909
I was just thinking the same thing…

156
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,078
-We don't look alike.
-Stand next to him.

157
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,781
-Why don't we swap glasses?
-Try swapping glasses.

158
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:15,982
Try mine.

159
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,319
A PASTOR WHO LOOKS LIKE DEFCONN?

160
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,453
You look alike.

161
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,954
He has really bad vision.

162
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,256
Mr. Invincible.

163
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,658
Hello. Nice to meet you.

164
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,592
INVINCIBLE

165
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,795
I am a recognized top player
of White Wings.

166
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,463
-What?
-No way!

167
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,831
-No!
-No!

168
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,334
About ten people said, "No."

169
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,669
The strength of White Wings is that,

170
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,372
you may not see it
if you see us for a short period,

171
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,174
but if you join us…

172
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,042
Yes.

173
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,677
ATTEMPTS TO VANISH THE INVINCIBLE NIPPLES

174
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,881
You will find out how friendly we are
when we play together.

175
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,850
You know what's driving me crazy?

176
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,719
They keep looking at me.

177
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:53,853
EXTRA EXTROVERTED INVINCIBLE NIPPLES

178
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,356
They keep staring at me.

179
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,790
Say hello to Netflix members.

180
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,759
BECOMES SHY AGAIN

181
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,127
It's all right.

182
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,695
-Can I jump in here?
-Sure.

183
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,596
Go ahead.

184
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,932
As for me,

185
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,168
I am an original member
who is precious and beautiful.

186
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,403
An original member.

187
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,638
And what I do for work is…

188
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,174
-Landlord.
-…I rent out a small building.

189
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,676
-You own a building.
-Yes.

190
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,146
That is why you are standing
rather arrogantly.

191
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,882
You could say that
I am the most arrogant here.

192
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,951
-A landlord.
-He owns a happy products store.

193
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,120
What is a happy products store?

194
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,622
What is a happy products store?

195
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,424
-Ask me again.
-Your side job is…

196
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,526
Ask you again? I am asking you now.

197
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,128
I own an adult products store.

198
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,028
HAPPY

199
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,764
It is a store that gives happiness.

200
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,334
If things aren't working with your wife,
come to my store and--

201
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,869
Sorry, but I am not even married.

202
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,505
-Exactly.
-Why are you talking about marriage to me?

203
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,340
-He brought you a gift.
-The gift…

204
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,775
What gift?

205
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,010
These guys are driving me crazy!

206
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,178
GRINNING

207
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,614
He would look attractive wearing this.

208
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,515
WHAT IS THE GIFT?

209
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,582
It will be romantic.

210
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,151
Don't be ridiculous.

211
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,685
I don't need that kind of stuff yet.

212
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,220
-But…
-Are you refusing it?

213
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,322
…should I at least ask him what it is?

214
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,091
And my name is

215
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,193
Kang An-gu.

216
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,495
-Some people do call me Jang An-gu.
-Jang An-gu?

217
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,531
Yes, I am Kang An-gu.

218
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,232
We are pastors.

219
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,301
-But he sells love products.
-Yes.

220
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,838
We want to pursue love as well,
so we get along well.

221
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,006
You should stop.

222
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,340
HE SEEMS TO HAVE
A REAL NEED TO TELL JOKES

223
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,675
Listen, Pastor.

224
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,043
You need to stop.

225
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,278
Could you please introduce yourself?

226
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,548
Hello, I'm Max Jung-sik.

227
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,316
Is it like Max Chang-min of TVXQ?

228
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,984
That is where I got it from.

229
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,353
FOR ONE NIGHT, CAN I LAY…

230
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,354
I can't sing that.

231
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,456
That was weird.

232
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,591
The happy products store owner is
beside me. That's why.

233
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,293
"For one night"? I can't say that.

234
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,961
-Have some confidence.
-Okay.

235
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,931
It's not that I lack confidence.

236
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,366
Come on. I don't lack confidence.

237
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,035
Don't lower your head.

238
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,236
Come on.

239
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,404
Keep going.

240
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,805
Hello.

241
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,275
I am Lee Sang-seok,
and I am a property developer.

242
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,910
I'm MD, Master of Defense.

243
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,246
-He's the master of defense. I see.
-Yes, the master of defense.

244
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,249
Because you were
going to be on television,

245
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,319
did you get eyebrow tattoos in a rush?

246
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,789
These are about two years old.

247
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,690
Two years?

248
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,291
They are so nice and dark.

249
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,192
They are?

250
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,193
Yes, they look nice.

251
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,028
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes, okay.

252
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,499
Sang-seok, don't be nervous.

253
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,734
-He looks so nervous.
-I'm surprised.

254
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,202
CLANG

255
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,937
He's nervous.

256
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,838
Okay. Let's applaud him.

257
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,206
ENDS THE INTERVIEW
DUE TO HIS ANXIETY

258
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,042
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
8:30 LEVEL TEST

259
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,044
I'll start with an easy one.

260
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,212
Hit it back to me.

261
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,313
All right. Understood.

262
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,381
Relax.

263
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,084
SURPRISED

264
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,385
COME ON

265
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,153
It's because of the light.

266
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,922
MEMBER TYPES BASED ON THEIR REACTIONS

267
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,290
Good job!

268
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,192
Nice!

269
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,460
1. PRAISING TYPE

270
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,628
Good shot!

271
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,830
-Turn your body!
-Relax!

272
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:51,764
2. ADVISING TYPE

273
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,599
Relax. You can't tense your body.

274
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,902
Newbies are allowed to play
however they want.

275
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,169
Just let him play.

276
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,337
3. FREE-REIN TYPE

277
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,739
He's pretty fit.

278
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,806
How old is he?

279
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,408
He looks like he's over 50.

280
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,076
-You can look that up online?
-Of course.

281
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,144
He isn't 50 yet.

282
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,178
4. STRONG INTEREST IN HEALTH

283
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,180
This is good enough
to pass the level test.

284
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,081
-Pass.
-Pass.

285
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,917
-I passed?
-Yes.

286
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,518
Give him a round of applause.

287
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,720
5. THE "JUST WANT TO PLAY" TYPE

288
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,689
Wasn't that a bit of a rush?

289
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:17,790
Let's applaud!

290
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,691
LET'S JUST PLAY

291
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,126
-Then…
-Yes.

292
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,596
…how good am I for a newbie?

293
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,698
You are at the bottom of newbies.

294
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,933
-The bottom?
-Yes.

295
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,402
There were many people
who came for the level test

296
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,271
and left crying because they didn't pass.

297
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,507
You can't simply just come here and join?

298
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,209
You can only join after you pass the test?

299
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,312
-There's a cut-off line.
-For White Wings only.

300
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,381
We are like the special forces
of Sukji Badminton Club.

301
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,516
We're the best players.

302
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,518
Please have a seat.

303
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,819
Shall we sit down?

304
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:52,024
Like always, the team
that gets seven wins first is the winner.

305
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,859
Then, is it doubles?

306
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,795
Amateurs don't play singles.

307
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,196
Amateurs don't play singles?

308
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,264
I see.

309
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,233
We'll start by collecting
cases of cocks each.

310
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,236
The winning team will get all 14 cases.

311
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,205
Wait, do you mean shuttlecocks?

312
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,807
You must bet the whole case

313
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,609
-instead of one shuttlecock.
-A case?

314
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,277
-Winner takes it all?
-Yes.

315
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,946
Yes, the winning team takes it all.

316
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,615
You guys bet something here too?

317
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,750
We won't play if we don't bet.

318
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,251
-Hang on.
-It's no fun.

319
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,755
Pastor, "We won't play if we don't bet"?
What do you mean?

320
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,156
We won't play if we don't bet.

321
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,791
-You must bet something?
-Yes.

322
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,960
Pastor Byung-ho, you've been corrupted.

323
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,829
PASTOR IS CORRUPTED BY BETS

324
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,130
How much is a case?

325
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,798
It's 21,000 won now.

326
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:33,966
-What?
-21,000 won.

327
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,901
It's 21,000 won? It went up a lot.

328
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,136
-Yes, it got really pricey.
-The price jumped.

329
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,740
We used to bet on a case quite easily,
but now…

330
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,576
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
9:00 ACTUAL MATCH

331
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,577
Your first partner.

332
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,845
-My first game?
-Yes.

333
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,912
-With them?
-Yes.

334
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,348
-I'm Jeongseon's Iron Wall.
-Yes.

335
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,550
I can block all of their attacks.

336
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,352
But that means
there's no one to attack them.

337
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,022
You're an iron wall,
but you have to attack too.

338
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,156
Come on, Defconn.

339
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,992
Honestly, I thought this was a chance.

340
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,728
I will be the first one on TV today.

341
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,597
THE "NOT INTERESTED IN WINNING" TYPE

342
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,665
AND THE NEWBIE,

343
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,767
HOW WILL THEY DO IN THEIR FIRST MATCH?

344
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,839
RECEIVES THE SERVE WELL

345
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:14,874
Nice!

346
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:17,977
Nice.

347
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:19,879
Hit it!

348
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,580
Why aren't you playing? Come on!

349
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,749
Nice. Good!

350
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,018
HIS CONSTANT SHOUTS FILL THE SPACE

351
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:26,919
Come on!

352
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,354
What is so good about this?

353
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,422
Good!

354
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,258
-It went over!
-It went…

355
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,626
THE NEWBIE ENDED UP LOSING THE POINT

356
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,194
What's up with this guy?

357
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,396
All he did was saying, "Good!"

358
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,465
All he did was shouting at me,
and I was the only one playing.

359
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,434
My heart rate is at 140.

360
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,235
You can't do that as a partner.

361
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,236
Good!

362
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,672
Good! Good!

363
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,707
Hit it!

364
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:48,841
TRAINING NEWBIE THE HARD WAY

365
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:49,742
Good!

366
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,045
HEARING "GOOD"
DOESN'T MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD

367
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,747
Nice job, Defconn!

368
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:55,915
You have to play with me this time.

369
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,583
-What?
-You have another match.

370
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,785
-Right now?
-Yes.

371
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,853
When you play with me,

372
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,755
just stay in the front
if you're feeling tired.

373
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,989
Just assume that

374
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,192
I will cover the back,
so don't even look back.

375
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,526
I'll hit all of them.

376
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,795
Gosh, this is incredibly tiring.

377
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,197
SECOND MATCH WITH
THE CARING CLUB PRESIDENT

378
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,164
Go in front!

379
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,866
Go in and take a seat.

380
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,000
Just sit down.

381
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,268
NOTHING TO DO FOR NEWBIE

382
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,169
Sit down. Take a break.

383
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,572
ONLY HIS EYES MOVE AROUND

384
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,874
Let's go!

385
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,008
I got this. Stay where you are.

386
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,478
Nice. That was great.

387
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,513
-Good. Wow!
-Let's go!

388
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,516
-My goodness, President.
-Let's continue.

389
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,118
You're on another level.

390
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,953
Go and have some water.

391
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,088
Like this. Hang on.

392
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,523
I am all right.

393
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,859
-My goodness.
-Put that there.

394
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,826
Gosh.

395
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,130
-Here, put this under your head.
-Yes.

396
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,332
The first match was okay,

397
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,534
but as you could see,
the second match was…

398
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,169
It was tough.

399
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,871
This is tough for a newbie.

400
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,306
I haven't touched a racket in 20 years--

401
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,942
The thing is, Defconn has been

402
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,312
playing with the best players
of Sukji Badminton Club.

403
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,614
It's my interview.

404
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,282
-Oh, I see.
-Pastor.

405
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,618
I get that it is your job. I understand.

406
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:10,956
This guy likes to give a lot of advice.

407
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:11,857
FINALLY INTERVIEWING HIM

408
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,359
How many matches do you play?

409
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,996
There are people
in their 70s and 80s over there.

410
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,732
They play at least 5 to 6 games a day.

411
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,467
And the court fee is cheap.

412
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,568
-1,200 won. Yes.
-Per person?

413
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,503
-It's so cheap.
-And you can even shower here.

414
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,538
It's cheaper than a cup of coffee.

415
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,872
Let's take a shower after.

416
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:27,940
No thanks.

417
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:28,874
I DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE
TO CROSS THAT LINE

418
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,309
I can't show you.

419
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,378
Many people used to come
to play golf here.

420
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,312
KEEPS ON PRAISING BADMINTON

421
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,547
-But it costs a lot.
-Yes.

422
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,848
And they say it is not fun.

423
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,783
With soccer, you have to run around.

424
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,919
Then, you'd only cheer
if you get one goal in.

425
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,321
But with badminton, whenever you hit it,

426
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:46,458
dopamine is released
every 10 seconds like this.

427
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,761
Every 10 seconds, you're hitting my ears.

428
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,662
Really?

429
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:50,930
HE CAN'T RESIST THE URGE TO PREACH

430
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,832
He keeps giving me a sermon.

431
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,067
He gave me a sermon on badminton.

432
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,871
Also, we play every Tuesday and Thursday,

433
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,308
so we would sleep in separate rooms
from our wives the night before.

434
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:03,843
That's how serious we are.

435
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,579
THE PASTOR'S JOKE
CROSSES THE LINE, AT LAST

436
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:07,847
What are you talking about?

437
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,115
The others said that it affected the game.

438
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,116
What the…

439
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:16,121
-You use separate rooms for this club?
-That is how serious we are about it.

440
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,656
Don't use separate rooms for this club.

441
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,792
Just speak to Mr. Happy.

442
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,826
All right?

443
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:21,727
If you ask him…

444
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:22,995
This won't go on TV, right?

445
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,697
What? They are filming all of this.

446
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,131
What do you mean it won't go on TV?

447
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,400
-They're filming everything.
-Really?

448
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,768
I shouldn't have said it.

449
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,903
This is too funny.

450
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,205
You're determined to be
my co-host, aren't you?

451
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,874
No, that is not what I'm doing.

452
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,543
-You are hilarious.
-I feel at ease here.

453
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,644
This is the fun part.

454
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,279
This is the fun part.

455
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,815
He won't stop trying to charm me.

456
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,217
Why? Because he wants to
be on camera for a bit longer.

457
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,286
I think that is adorable.

458
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,320
Look.

459
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,456
We met for the first time,

460
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,691
but he is hovering around me
like a satellite.

461
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,929
You are very athletic, Defconn.

462
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,098
We were about go easy on you
because you are a newbie,

463
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,233
but you are good.

464
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,502
I told you it's my interview time.

465
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,907
Why do you keep stealing
my time to be interviewed?

466
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,743
Why do you crave so much attention?

467
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,212
Why are you so eager to be on TV?

468
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,080
DESPITE THE NOISE,
THE MATCH IS STILL IN PROGRESS

469
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,515
-Wait.
-Out.

470
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,083
-Again.
-Is it out?

471
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,552
Hey.

472
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,923
THE SHUTTLECOCK HITS THE NET AND DROPS

473
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,991
-It went over.
-No, it didn't.

474
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,227
-It didn't go over.
-Yes, it did.

475
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,662
-It went over.
-It did not go over.

476
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,196
THE REFREE'S CALL IS FOR YELLOW TEAM

477
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,799
-It went over. It really did go over.
-It didn't.

478
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,634
-There's a camera right there.
-It doesn't count.

479
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,736
Check the camera footage.

480
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,172
-Let's check the footage.
-Can you show us?

481
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,874
Can we check the replay?

482
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,242
There's something going on.

483
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,576
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON

484
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,445
They fight over whether it's in or out.

485
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,114
The pastors become something else
during a match.

486
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,517
They talk about
generosity and mercy at church,

487
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,219
but I think they release
all that stress here.

488
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,388
We were the last ones to hit it.

489
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,991
We saw it touched the net and went over.

490
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,626
But the other team says it didn't.

491
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,428
Come on. It really didn't go over.

492
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,362
Let's hear him out.

493
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,530
-Wait.
-For 30 years…

494
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,565
He is a director of an academy.
He teaches students.

495
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,734
-As an educator of 30 years…
-That's right.

496
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,704
It definitely went over,
literally right before my eyes.

497
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,005
The referee said it didn't.

498
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,039
-Wait.
-Hold on.

499
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,775
You're not supposed to do that
as a director of an academy.

500
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,143
-You teach kids!
-As a son of two…

501
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,044
I mean, as a father…

502
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,047
Did you film that or not?

503
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,017
Let's replay it. If it went over,
I'll give you three cases of shuttles.

504
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,185
If not, give me two.

505
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,152
I'm calling the bet.

506
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,221
Referee! Sang-seok can be the referee.

507
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,091
-Did it go over or not?
-Here's our referee.

508
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,993
Have a seat!

509
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,862
-Listen, I'm just not capable of lying.
-Exactly.

510
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,331
It clearly flew beyond the line.

511
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,734
He must be lying.
That's what property developers do.

512
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,936
-I meant it didn't go over.
-It went over.

513
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,071
Then, let's bet three cases.

514
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,573
-All right. Three cases.
-Yes.

515
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,707
I'll bet three too.

516
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,909
These guys always fight over this.

517
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,711
-They fight all the time.
-No, no.

518
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,279
-That is not what's important.
-This isn't about…

519
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,647
You bet three cases.

520
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,849
That's what I said.

521
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,117
-Three cases?
-Okay.

522
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,985
-It did not go over.
-All right.

523
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,887
Stop recording for a second.
Let's check the footage.

524
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,362
IT WENT OVER
AS GREEN TEAM SAID

525
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,832
I usually get a signature
before I do this,

526
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,467
but I'll do this as a favor.

527
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,602
IT ENDS WITH A SMILE

528
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,705
All right. Defconn's team is winning!

529
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,974
Happy!

530
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,875
Happy!

531
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,611
THE NEXT PARTNER IS MR. HAPPY

532
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,313
This is like our mantra.

533
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,051
That guy's serve is so high.

534
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:33,986
You got it.

535
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,187
Gosh. How can I hit that?

536
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,422
THE SHUTTLE NEARLY TOUCHED THE CEILING

537
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,224
Gosh, how am I supposed to hit that?

538
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:40,959
It's going out.

539
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,062
THE SHUTTLECOCK
FLIES HIGH IN THE SKY

540
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,797
Geez. I'm getting dizzy!

541
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,265
I'm getting dizzy.

542
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,601
STARING AT THE CEILING FOR TOO LONG
CAUSED HIM TO SUFFER FROM DIZZINESS

543
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,305
-There's no stopping him!
-Geez!

544
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,873
One more time. Again!

545
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,774
STUMBLES

546
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,676
NEWBIE FINALLY COLLAPSES

547
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,511
My goodness.

548
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,747
Come on. Defconn won't
get to eat at this rate.

549
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,182
WORRIED THAT YELLOW TEAM MIGHT LOSE

550
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,185
I didn't look at the sky this much
even when I was in school.

551
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,320
I've never put in this much effort before.

552
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,489
SORRY

553
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,757
Okay.

554
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,826
Can you give me a massage here?

555
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:14,726
My neck hurts.

556
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,928
This side.

557
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,963
-Does it feel good?
-Yes.

558
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,932
Do you like it? Do you like it?

559
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,533
Wait…

560
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,835
You need more. Bent over.

561
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,869
An-gu.

562
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,771
Please don't ask me if I like it.

563
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,806
You own an adult products store.

564
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,808
You should secretly come by
in the evening.

565
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,210
To where?

566
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,445
He kept asking if I liked it
during the massage.

567
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,748
It felt weird.
An-gu is an interesting guy.

568
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,183
He wants to give me something.

569
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,119
HE SECRETLY LOOKS FORWARD TO IT

570
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,487
Good job.

571
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,088
WITH DEFCONN'S TEAM'S LOSS,
BACK TO SQUARE ONE

572
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,124
Wait, is it the finals now?

573
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,024
Yes, it is.

574
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,961
From what I can tell,
we're at an advantage.

575
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,263
He is excellent in defense.

576
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,231
-He's brilliant.
-Yes.

577
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,632
I can tell by his warm-ups.

578
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,000
He's good at defense.

579
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,635
THE MATCH OF
THE SENIOR PLAYERS BEGINS

580
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,070
Play defense! Hit it!

581
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,305
-Good shot.
-Good.

582
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,306
COMMENTATOR AND SPORTSCASTER

583
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,774
-Good rally.
-Nice.

584
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:03,942
Smash it.

585
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,644
It's the match of the aces.

586
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,545
-My goodness.
-Nice one.

587
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,679
A TIGHT MATCH, AS EXPECTED OF A FINALS

588
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,981
-He goes for a smash.
-Good.

589
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,582
But he received with a strike.

590
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,583
He received it well.

591
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,851
-Cut it off.
-Here, you…

592
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,319
MISTAKE BY YELLOW TEAM

593
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,954
Oh, my goodness.

594
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,689
You can't rush it.

595
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,924
Don't rush it.

596
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,059
I can tell that
the two of you are too worked up.

597
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,995
Your nipples are showing too much.

598
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,130
You're too worked up.

599
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,398
Please calm down.

600
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,534
Relax, guys. Relax.

601
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,002
Relax. Take it slowly.

602
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,370
He got a call.

603
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,338
Hello.

604
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,241
When the members get a call
in the middle of the game, they answer it.

605
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,376
He has to.

606
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:41,079
It is about a contract
with his building construction.

607
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,682
He must be happy
because someone wants to sell their land.

608
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,317
THE MATCH RESUMES

609
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,319
Nice.

610
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,620
MASTER OF DEFENSE SCORES
AFTER HIS CALL

611
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,722
So, are they selling the land?

612
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,623
-What?
-Are they?

613
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,624
They'll sign later.

614
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,026
They must sign later.

615
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,061
He's on a roll after the call.

616
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,529
They must sign a contract.

617
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,530
Okay.

618
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,166
GREEN TEAM GIVES AWAY A POINT

619
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:03,869
One more.

620
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,770
YELLOW TEAM IS ONE POINT AWAY

621
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,538
Calm down.

622
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,739
Your eyes are so red.

623
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,708
-They're bloodshot.
-Right.

624
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,743
It's a burst vein in my eye.

625
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,712
If I lose this, another one will burst.

626
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,547
You're bursting with dopamine right now.

627
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,516
A true match of the aces.

628
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,084
Defense, once more.

629
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,919
Nice. It came over.

630
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,289
Oh, my. Sang-seok.

631
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,891
Nice.

632
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:31,096
YELLOW TEAM IS THE FINAL WINNER

633
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,637
We will present the award.

634
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,871
The award presentation.

635
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,074
Thank you very much.

636
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,377
-We won!
-Yes!

637
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,347
One, two, three.

638
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,314
We got this!

639
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,483
-White Wings!
-Let's go!

640
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,417
WHITE WINGS, LET'S GO

641
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,889
It's nothing special.

642
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,591
I should've brought something nicer.

643
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,492
What a shame.

644
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,028
Is this something you sell at your store?

645
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,763
It's your best product? Really?

646
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,466
What is this?

647
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,167
Why do I need this?

648
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,769
LOOKS SEXY EVEN AT A GLANCE

649
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,271
It's a pheromone cologne.

650
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,573
If you spritz it,
you'll attract them like a magnet.

651
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,707
Are you sure?

652
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,808
SPRITZING

653
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,211
Why are you spritzing so much?

654
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,946
-So you can get married.
-Really?

655
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,382
I even got a pheromone cologne.

656
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,916
Yes.

657
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,753
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
12:00 WRAP-UP GATHERING

658
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:32,491
Now that I am having a team meal
with all of you,

659
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,993
I really feel like a member of your club.

660
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,195
Also, you all look so nice and clean now.

661
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,230
It's because we won.

662
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,131
Look. They're dark.

663
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,466
It's gloomy over there.

664
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,901
STANDS UP

665
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,704
Do you mind if we offer a prayer?

666
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:46,705
-Pray for us?
-Yes.

667
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,639
You must.

668
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,740
WHITE WINGS PRAY BEFORE MEALS

669
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,941
Who will pray today?

670
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,576
-Pastor Ra will pray.
-Okay.

671
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,278
-The oldest will pray.
-Let us pray.

672
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,580
Yes. Gosh, this is different.

673
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,482
Thank you, God.

674
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,919
Thank you for letting us
get together to play sports.

675
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,022
Please kindly guide Defconn
who joined us today

676
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,758
so that things will go well for him.

677
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,696
Especially, please be with Netflix
while they prepare for this show

678
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:15,701
and offer them your huge help
so that it will become a huge success.

679
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,402
-Amen.
-Amen.

680
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,771
We eat this precious food
as we show faith to you.

681
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,373
In Jesus' name we pray.

682
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,407
-Amen.
-Amen.

683
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,276
-Hallelujah!
-Thank you!

684
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,945
LET US PRAY

685
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:31,350
THEY CONNECTED THROUGH THE HYMN

686
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,186
-Thank you for this food.
-Thank you.

687
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,754
-How do I eat this?
-You mix it in.

688
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,523
Do you usually come here after you play?

689
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,658
-Yes.
-We come often.

690
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,393
-There are a few restaurants.
-I see.

691
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,763
Club members would
drink makgeolli together afterwards.

692
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,165
-But you don't do that.
-We do not do that.

693
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,300
No drinking or smoking.

694
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,368
How wholesome.

695
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,402
So wholesome.

696
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,238
By the way, how old are you?

697
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,873
I am in my late 40s.

698
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,074
You should get married.

699
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,943
Your parents must be very worried.

700
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,278
Is that why you gave me
those adult stockings?

701
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,914
I didn't know if you would like it or not.

702
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,416
I love it.

703
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,484
I should've gotten you a better present.

704
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,452
-What is the better one?
-I have many.

705
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,087
I wanted to, but…

706
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,456
Let me ask you something.

707
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:15,160
Now that you played badminton,
can you give us your assessment?

708
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,795
-It is a full-body exercise.
-And?

709
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,064
As you said earlier,
you get a dopamine hit.

710
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,233
My opponent was standing here,

711
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,901
so when the shuttle fell over there,

712
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,102
I felt a thrill.

713
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,538
NEWBIE LEARNED
THE BEAUTY OF BADMINTON

714
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,340
-Give him a round of applause.
-Really.

715
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,409
He truly felt it.

716
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,010
I was in the zone.

717
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,178
That is why you play.

718
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,212
Block it and hit it.

719
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:39,484
By the way, how was I as a new member?

720
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,719
You aren't qualified.

721
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:41,820
Sadly…

722
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,488
It is truly sad.

723
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,557
TOO BIG OF A RISK
FOR THE ACES OF WHITE WINGS

724
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,559
No one will want to play with you.

725
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,128
Then, as I'm Newbie in the Club

726
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,298
and three million people
play badminton in Korea,

727
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,834
there must be
other clubs out there, right?

728
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,769
I will join other clubs,

729
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,005
and I'll return to break White Wings.

730
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,373
All right. Very nice.

731
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,241
I'll join another club.

732
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,310
I'll go to that club

733
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,980
and bring the members
to have a competition.

734
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,215
That is so like you.

735
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:14,419
I will break White Wings and dye it pink.
That's what I'm saying.

736
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,520
Please do that.

737
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,389
Now we're talking.

738
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,591
I got rejected as a member.

739
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,462
They are merciless.

740
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,264
I thought they would let me join,
but they said no.

741
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:31,436
You know, I'm going to
fill out many applications

742
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,639
and meet with people from other
badminton clubs when I have the time.

743
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,042
Then, I'll have
my revenge match with them.

744
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,009
WHO DO YOU RECOMMEND?

745
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:42,047
I recommend this to office workers
who don't have enough time to exercise.

746
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:45,784
If you just play
30 to 40 minutes after work,

747
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,386
you will complete a full-body workout.

748
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:52,390
What's good about badminton is
that you sweat a lot.

749
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,293
You can enjoy badminton
during every season of the year.

750
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,063
You can play in the winter and
there's AC in the summer.

751
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,498
Join Sukji Badminton Club.

752
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,932
Join them, everybody.

753
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,068
If you come and meet these people,

754
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,870
you'll improve in no time.

755
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,137
I am telling you.

756
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,973
SUKJI BADMINTON CLUB, WHITE WINGS
SUWON, GYEONGGI-DO

757
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,574
1. HALF OF THEM ARE PASTORS

758
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,142
2. SERIOUS ABOUT BETTING
3. EAGER TO BE ON TV

759
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:15,146
