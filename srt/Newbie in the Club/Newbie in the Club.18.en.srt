LOCATION: GWANGJIN-GU, SEOUL
TIME: 7 A.M.

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,405
Netflix Club members,
I hope you had a good week.

3
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,507
Each week, I observe clubs
with the eyes of a bird.

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,543
I'm Defconn,
the newbie who's crazy about clubs.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,078
The club that I'm visiting today

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,581
used to be the top choice
for our aged parents,

7
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:19,285
but it has revamped itself into
becoming the newbie club for Gen MZ.

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,988
It's a hiking club!

9
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,957
-Hello.
-Hi. Wait.

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,025
HIKING CLUB MEMBERS

11
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,326
Hello.

12
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,560
Oh, hi.

13
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,062
Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,664
Hello, we're a club called Bluejean.now.

15
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,367
It's a club that was created in 2020

16
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:38,304
as a means for friends
to just enjoy hiking without any frills.

17
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,340
I'm Sohn Da-ae,
the president of Bluejean.now.

18
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,908
I have the blood of mountaineers.

19
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,111
Do you mean that
your parents own a mountain?

20
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,179
I didn't mean that.

21
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:51,651
My uncle and my aunt were
all presidents of mountaineering clubs.

22
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,553
-Mountaineering club presidents.
-Mountaineering?

23
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,988
You have hikers in your family.

24
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,457
Hello, I'm the vice president
of Bluejean.now.

25
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,792
and the president's cousin.

26
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,493
My name is Ko Jun-young.

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,030
You know,
it isn't easy to recruit your cousin.

28
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,298
You must be close.

29
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,467
She asked me
if I wanted to go hiking with her

30
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,669
and I ended up really enjoying it.

31
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,438
-What is this?
-Well,

32
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,173
it's a collection of all the peaks.

33
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,674
-There's such a thing?
-Yes.

34
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,842
Since I love mountains,

35
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,678
people give me presents like this
on my birthday.

36
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,715
I'm known as the guy
who is crazy about mountains in our club.

37
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,085
The two of you seem to be

38
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,620
similar yet different as relatives.

39
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,123
The only thing we have in common
is that we like mountains.

40
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,291
-Just liking mountains?
-Yes.

41
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,059
DISTANCING HIMSELF

42
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,762
I'm Andrew, a supporter of Bluejean.now.

43
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,830
What is a supporter?

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,833
-I prepare the food…
-Food? Oh.

45
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,868
…and the coffee as well.

46
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,570
-He's in charge of the snacks.
-Yes, snacks.

47
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,238
I'm from the United States.

48
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,306
-From the States?
-Yes.

49
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,740
How long have you lived in Korea?

50
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,043
I have lived here for eight years.

51
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,978
How did you end up joining this club?

52
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,149
At the peak of Bukhansan Mountain,
Da-ae asked me…

53
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,217
-Scout.
-Recruit.

54
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,852
-She recruited me.
-Recruited you?

55
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,654
He looked so awesome
when we went up there for the sunrise.

56
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,722
-Andrew was?
-Yes.

57
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,424
I thought, "This is no ordinary man,"

58
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,026
-so I was determined to recruit him.
-My gosh.

59
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,796
It isn't easy to get a foreigner to join.

60
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,064
Good job recruiting him.

61
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,032
I'm Da-ae's high school friend,

62
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,568
and I'm in charge of general affairs.
My name is Kim Yun-ju.

63
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,669
ANOTHER ACQUAINTANCE

64
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:17,737
-The manager.
-So,

65
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,339
our membership fee is 40,000 won.

66
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,641
You can wire the money as well.

67
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,977
-You're so intimidating.
-Am I?

68
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,478
She's determined to get the fee.

69
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,646
By the way,

70
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,815
it costs 40,000 won? It's very expensive.

71
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,383
When you pay that fee,

72
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,252
we provide a T-shirt and a towel.

73
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,586
What if I don't accept those?

74
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,821
It's still 40,000 won.

75
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,357
-Whether or not…
-Also…

76
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,525
-…I accept them.
-You're good.

77
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,859
Even if you don't want to join,

78
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,494
-you may have to pay the fee.
-Really?

79
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,263
-Because of Da-ae's business acumen.
-I see.

80
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,665
-Da-ae is very good at luring people in.
-Yes.

81
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,769
From her cousin,
the foreigner who was at the peak,

82
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,638
to her high school friend.

83
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,907
Perhaps that guy at the end
is her boyfriend.

84
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,909
No, I'm actually married.

85
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,110
-What?
-I'm married.

86
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,611
-You're married?
-Yes.

87
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,181
I'm the disciplinarian of Bluejean.now,

88
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,550
and my name is Choi Tae-bang.

89
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,552
-And I am married.
-You're married.

90
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,753
-That's most important.
-Yes.

91
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,488
Your wife doesn't join these hikes?

92
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,822
My wife is a child. Wait, no.

93
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,158
-She's a child?
-No, she's with child.

94
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,660
-She's pregnant.
-Everyone,

95
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,395
-look at that over there.
-Yes.

96
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,564
Is it because you have
grenades around your ankle?

97
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,566
They aren't grenades. They're sand bags.

98
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:20,633
Oh, sand bags.

99
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,235
I always wear these when I hike.

100
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,303
-Really?
-Yes.

101
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,073
Then, what is the schedule
for the club Bluejean.now?

102
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,975
-We'll start at Oullim Plaza.
-Okay.

103
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,343
We'll pass boru one.

104
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,680
Then, we'll pass Goguryeojeong
to go to the summit.

105
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,049
After that, we'll descend.

106
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,118
I'm worried that I'm a hiking novice.

107
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,855
I don't even have
any basic knowledge of hiking.

108
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,924
I've only gone hiking as a punishment.

109
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,026
Will I be able to enjoy hiking?

110
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,194
Of course,

111
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,863
the scenery and the breeze are so nice.
Why wouldn't you?

112
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,865
-There's no reason to dislike it.
-I see.

113
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,803
On a variety show that I was on before,
I often had to go hiking as a punishment.

114
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,938
So I have this trauma
that hiking means punishment.

115
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,341
I'd like to overcome that trauma today.

116
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,177
He's a hiking novice,
but I'm a novice too,

117
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,979
so I can help him out as we go.

118
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,514
I think he won't have
any problem reaching the summit.

119
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,517
He has to pass this trial hike
in order to become a new member.

120
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,219
Then, I can get the membership fee.

121
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,455
So I'll work hard to make it happen.

122
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,925
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
7:30 HIKING ACHASAN MOUNTAIN

123
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,761
-Are we heading up now?
-It's the entrance.

124
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,730
They did a good job with this place.

125
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,432
Korea is such a great country.
It looks so nice here.

126
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:30,003
Many people who live locally
come here for a stroll as well.

127
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,039
I know. People who live close
to Walkerhill must come here for a stroll.

128
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,874
What is the beauty of Achasan Mountain?

129
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,876
It's a wheezy mountain.

130
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,111
-Wheezy?
-Easy mountain.

131
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,178
-Easy mountain.
-I see.

132
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,148
It's an easy mountain,
so we can finish hiking quickly

133
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,817
and eat a lot of delicious food.
There are many good restaurants.

134
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,486
-Lots of good restaurants?
-Lots.

135
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,553
-Really?
-That's one.

136
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,922
It also has an outstanding view
in the evening.

137
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,558
The sunset and nightscape are pretty.

138
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,695
-We usually hike up here for sunsets.
-Sunsets?

139
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,964
-After you finish work?
-That's right.

140
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,432
The places with good nightscapes

141
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,467
-are Achasan, Yongmasan.
-Inwangsan Mountain.

142
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,669
-Inwangsan too.
-Inwangsan?

143
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,805
Rather than viewing it from the ground,
it feels so much nicer

144
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,007
when you make the effort
to go up at night.

145
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,843
What is fun about climbing mountains?

146
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,745
When you have a hobby,

147
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,548
there aren't that many
that satisfy all five senses.

148
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,085
But in the mountains,
it smells nice, it looks nice,

149
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,386
the sound of water is nice too.

150
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,121
You can satisfy all five senses.

151
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,058
THE BEAUTY OF HIKING IS THAT
YOU CAN ENJOY NATURE WITH YOUR WHOLE BODY

152
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,859
You should be more alert from now on.

153
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,561
-Why?
-When we go there…

154
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,662
Look ahead.

155
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,632
There are people who go up there?

156
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,700
That's us.

157
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,001
-From here?
-That would be us.

158
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:40,707
WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF HIKING,
THEY ENCOUNTER A ROCKY INCLINE

159
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,141
It's slippery, though.

160
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,444
Defconn, it's okay. It isn't that bad.

161
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,813
Don't stand upright. Lower your body.

162
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,781
-Give me the camera.
-Give the camera to someone.

163
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,418
If you try to stand upright, you'll slip.

164
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,854
Make sure you don't step on a branch.

165
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,656
I'm holding onto a branch right now.

166
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,591
-A branch?
-Is this someone's arm or a branch?

167
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,659
A moving branch.

168
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,561
Look at them holding hands.

169
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,629
-This is ridiculous.
-So what?

170
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,365
Neither one of us is married.

171
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,599
We're only young once!

172
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,767
She's getting married soon.

173
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,968
Really? I'm sorry.

174
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,505
-With whom?
-I'm married, so hold my hand.

175
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,540
-All right. Come here.
-I'm married.

176
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,675
NEWBIE NEEDS A CARETAKER

177
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,310
You're lighter than I thought.

178
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,112
Yes. I lost some weight.

179
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,580
Look at that incline.

180
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,048
-It isn't that bad.
-Really?

181
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,183
-Do you come here in the winter, too?
-Of course.

182
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,685
You should come in the winter, too.

183
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,320
-My gosh.
-Enjoy the smell.

184
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,856
-The water and the green.
-It does smell nice.

185
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,157
-Isn't it so nice?
-It's nice.

186
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,792
MANIPULATED INTO SATISFYING HIS SENSES

187
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,860
Jeez.

188
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,362
These guys are trying
so hard to sell this.

189
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,266
Whenever I think
that this hiking club is too tough,

190
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,035
they keep telling me…

191
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,204
Look at that steep incline!
Look, everyone!

192
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,106
-No, it isn't.
-What? Come on.

193
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,008
-It isn't that bad at all.
-Jeez.

194
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,145
All of you have excellent stamina.

195
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,847
-Well, it's the easiest.
-This is the easiest mountain in Seoul.

196
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,516
-This is an easy one?
-Of course.

197
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,017
How difficult is Bukhansan Mountain?

198
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,753
-Bukhansan Mountain is a bit tough.
-Really?

199
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,054
A BIT TOUGH(?) BUKHANSAN MOUNTAIN

200
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,323
Hikers really have good stamina.

201
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,659
-We would run up a mountain like this.
-What?

202
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,795
-If it wasn't for you, we'd run up there.
-Wait.

203
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,630
Wait.

204
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,865
-He's in charge of photos.
-Let's take a photo.

205
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,067
This is your only time
to catch your breath.

206
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,936
One, two, three.

207
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,871
This is the only time
I can catch my breath?

208
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
PHOTO IS JUST AN EXCUSE

209
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,376
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT
TO ANALYZE THE MEMBERS OF BLUEJEAN.NOW

210
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,678
Wait. Wait a second.

211
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,547
TAKING A PHOTO

212
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,815
Everybody. One more time.

213
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,716
PHOTOS ARE WHAT MATTERS!
PHOTOGRAPHER ANDREW

214
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,151
Hold my hand.

215
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,553
It's slippery.

216
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,954
Let's wait a moment.

217
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,189
THE SWEET BOSS WHO CARES FOR EVERYONE

218
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,356
Stay alert.

219
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,826
You can do it, Defconn. What's wrong?

220
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,695
CARROT AND STICK! DISCIPLINARIAN TAE-BANG

221
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,765
AND THE TYPE THAT STRUGGLES WITH HIKING

222
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,634
Listen. Go ahead.

223
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,570
Go on. I'll go down after I take a break.

224
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,071
-No, you can't.
-Jeez.

225
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,207
-We don't let anyone go by themselves.
-Never.

226
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,541
It's dangerous for a newbie.

227
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:59,545
HIS LEGS MOVE
AGAINST HIS WILL

228
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,080
-You got this.
-You got this.

229
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,381
TAKES A PHOTO OF EVEN THAT

230
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,084
A HANDCUFF RATHER THAN A HELPING HAND

231
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,053
We've arrived at our first lookout point.

232
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,120
That's Goguryeojeong.

233
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,956
-Goguryeo?
-The first lookout point.

234
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,357
-Let's drink some water.
-Okay.

235
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,425
Sounds good.

236
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,293
-Did you bring a drink?
-What?

237
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,263
Take what you want from my bag.

238
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,432
Drink them up so I can lighten my load.

239
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,934
-Have some cucumber.
-Cucumber? Awesome.

240
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,402
Cucumbers are the best.

241
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,372
Is the hike usually this r-r-r-r-rough?

242
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,274
-This is a really easy course.
-What?

243
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,710
But it's so steep.

244
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,245
But there aren't any dangers here.

245
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,380
There are wild boats
in Songnisan Mountain.

246
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,815
-You mean, wild boars.
-Yes.

247
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,083
I saw them.

248
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,584
They're very dangerous.

249
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,887
Andrew, say hi to my friends.

250
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,722
I am so jealous of them.

251
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,190
They can just fly up here.

252
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,325
-Shall we take a selfie?
-Again?

253
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,127
A selfie? Okay.

254
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,130
You'll get at least three more members
because of this photo with me.

255
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,599
NEWBIE CAUGHT IN A PHOTO

256
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,801
You've cleared the first hurdle.

257
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,069
-The first?
-The first.

258
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,805
How is it?
Aren't you starting to like mountains?

259
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,742
-Don't you love it?
-Listen, your eyes are scaring me.

260
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,144
You asked me that question
with such big, round eyes.

261
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,280
What do you like about hiking together?

262
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,449
It's dangerous to be on your phone
while you're hiking.

263
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,185
-So it's nice that we can talk together.
-You're right.

264
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:17,189
When you're hiking a tough course,
you may want to quit.

265
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,860
But when you're with people, they help you
finish the course no matter what.

266
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,429
You guys have hiked most mountains,

267
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,098
so you must seek out tougher mountains.

268
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,634
-We climb one after another.
-One after another?

269
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,103
-We would hike up five mountains.
-Really?

270
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,906
You guys have
definitely inherited the genes

271
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,308
from your parents, haven't you?

272
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,977
Jun-young still goes
hiking with his parents.

273
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,445
What a good son you are.

274
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,247
This is the second one.

275
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,950
If you go up a little more,
the view behind you will be spectacular.

276
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,252
HIS ENERGY IS ALREADY DEPLETED

277
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,553
-From here.
-Where?

278
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,021
Look behind you from here.

279
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,823
Look behind you. One, two, three.

280
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,159
-Ta-da.
-Gosh.

281
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,794
-Isn't it amazing?
-It's nice.

282
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,861
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE VIEW

283
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,430
-You have to look longer.
-Longer?

284
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,098
-You have to enjoy it.
-Take the view in.

285
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,766
Defconn, what do you think?

286
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,402
I can see everything.
The weather is beautiful today.

287
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,770
You can see everything.

288
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,405
-There's Lotte Tower.
-That's Songpa-gu.

289
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,442
You guys, the view is really nice.

290
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,677
Hang on. Let me take a photo.

291
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,245
-Another one?
-It's a lookout point.

292
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,447
One, two, three.

293
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,215
UNCONDITIONED REFLEX

294
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,150
-Bluejean.now.
-Bluejean.now.

295
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,652
A GOOD LOOKOUT POINT IS A GOOD PHOTO POINT

296
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:24,056
Since you guys work,
you go hiking at night after work?

297
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,193
-To be honest, it must be so hard.
-It isn't easy.

298
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,529
But it's really cool that you guys
overcome that difficulty and still do it.

299
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,031
You know that it's cool.

300
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,532
Of course I do.

301
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,436
I'm experiencing firsthand
how difficult hiking is.

302
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,939
HE ALSO REALIZES
THE ISSUE WITH HIS ENERGY LEVEL

303
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,108
We're almost there. Achasan's boru one.

304
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,810
-How many are we going to?
-We're going up to boru three.

305
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,179
I don't think I can make it to the peak.

306
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,016
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO

307
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,551
To the right.

308
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,222
When people are going in both directions,
you must stick to the right.

309
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,090
People are smiling as they descend.

310
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,893
-Gosh.
-It's possible when you descend.

311
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,596
I can't believe that
this is the novice course.

312
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,132
-Defconn, look to your right.
-Where?

313
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,467
Even the weather is nice
because you're here.

314
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,602
You're the weather fairy.

315
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,304
-It's awesome today.
-The light is amazing.

316
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,407
-The heavens are blessing us.
-Right?

317
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,876
-What are you doing?
-Let me take a picture of you.

318
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,046
-But I'm so exhausted.
-These will all be lasting memories.

319
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,481
-Nice expression. Really great.
-Looking good.

320
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,950
I look like I'm climbing the Himalayas.

321
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,552
It came out nicely.

322
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,320
#NOT_THE_HIMALAYAS
#ONLY_250M_ABOVE_SEA_LEVEL

323
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,389
Who on earth would become a sherpa?

324
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,291
Sherpas, man.
Have you been to the Himalayas?

325
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,826
-Her.
-I've been to Mount Kilimanjaro.

326
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,462
For real?
Why did you go to Mount Kilimanjaro?

327
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,530
Everyone has a lot

328
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,165
-on their minds in their 20s.
-Of course.

329
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,333
When I turned 30,

330
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,104
I wanted to challenge myself
with something that could push my limit.

331
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:49,075
I heard that hikers
experience a sort of mental clarity.

332
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,243
-That's right.
-Everyone has various

333
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,713
-concerns and causes for stress, right?
-Yes.

334
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,549
But I heard that all of those disappear
when you go hiking.

335
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,351
-Are your stresses going away, too?
-Do you feel the clarity?

336
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,586
-All of a sudden?
-Suddenly?

337
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,821
He got tired all of a sudden.

338
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,022
-You see--
-All of a sudden?

339
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,790
-We're on a plateau right now.
-Yes.

340
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,560
-You feel better?
-I feel so happy now.

341
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,261
-Da-ae.
-Yes?

342
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,564
Tell me your love story.

343
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,734
Our love story has
nothing to do with mountains.

344
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,169
-Even so, I want to hear your love story.
-Yeah.

345
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,571
Her love story is very important.

346
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,905
I want to get married too.

347
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,807
-Do you know why it's important?
-Why?

348
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,976
-Because Yun-ju introduced us.
-Really?

349
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,878
Did you introduce your colleague to her?

350
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:30,182
Yun-ju has a senior colleague
that she really respects.

351
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,951
She said it was a friend of that colleague

352
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,086
-whom they respect as well.
-That's so nice.

353
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,555
-I met him once, but he was really nice.
-My goodness.

354
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,623
So you went for him.

355
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,691
I lured him in.

356
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,326
THE PRESIDENT
EVEN LURES IN LOVE

357
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,194
-She lured him in.
-She lured him.

358
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,429
ANOTHER INCLINE APPEARS

359
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,797
Just a little bit more.

360
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,865
There's spring water.

361
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,199
-No.
-No, come to your senses!

362
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,534
-No.
-Not spring water?

363
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,569
HE'S LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS

364
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,705
It's the moment you see
that ground covering.

365
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,440
We'll be there just after climbing that.

366
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,676
I mean it. It's nothing.
We're close to the peak.

367
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,746
-Look at this angle, everyone.
-You got this!

368
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,548
We're really almost there.

369
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,151
I'm not kidding. Trust me.

370
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,521
-Good job. Just a bit more.
-We're almost there.

371
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,656
-My thighs are burning up.
-It has to burn up more.

372
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,057
Burn those thighs up more!

373
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,994
-Guys, let's take a photo.
-Guys, photo time.

374
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,163
-One, two, three.
-Okay.

375
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,264
Bluejean.now.

376
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,935
Whenever we get tired,

377
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,838
-Andrew would say, "Let's take a photo."
-Isn't it nice?

378
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,306
-You're forced to smile.
-It's fun.

379
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,977
ANDREW'S PHOTO TIME MAKES EVERYONE SMILE

380
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,147
-We're at Achasan Mountain's summit!
-Really?

381
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,582
I told you so.

382
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,783
NEWBIE'S TOUGH JOURNEY

383
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,418
-Good job.
-Good job.

384
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,153
-Good job.
-Good job.

385
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,988
Hurray!

386
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,824
-It was that hard?
-I did it!

387
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,060
Finally, I have arrived at the summit

388
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,062
of Achasan Mountain!

389
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,730
You'd think we're at Seoraksan Mountain.

390
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,866
-Let's take a few photos at the summit.
-Okay.

391
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,167
Aren't we going to do this?

392
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,703
-Oh, that's right. Hang on.
-What is it?

393
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,272
You have this. I see. I've seen these.

394
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,674
This is what makes a club!

395
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,975
One, two, three.

396
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,311
-We're only young once!
-We're only young once!

397
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,414
Nice. You have to do this.

398
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,716
Oh, my goodness. What is all this, Andrew?

399
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,551
What is this? Did you make it?

400
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,386
-I made it last night.
-Last night?

401
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:19,124
Normally, he would make these
only when we go up a very high mountain.

402
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,993
OUR NEWBIE IS PRECIOUS

403
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,161
-It's sugar-free?
-Yes.

404
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,097
IMMEDIATELY TAKES A BITE
OF THE BANANA BREAD

405
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,398
How is it?

406
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,775
The banana and cinnamon
go so well together.

407
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,043
-It's so good!
-Isn't it?

408
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,679
Also, if you eat it
while enjoying the view there,

409
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,348
it's better than any café out there.

410
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,383
-You can't beat that.
-You're right, cousin.

411
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,218
You are this team's mascot.

412
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,653
-Really?
-Yeah.

413
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,622
You are like Kumdori,
the mascot of Daejeon Expo.

414
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,689
BLUEJEAN.NOW'S DREW-DORI

415
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,757
You're Kumdori.

416
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,792
He is our forever friend now.

417
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,628
He can only leave in a coffin.

418
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:56,829
Did you hear what she said?

419
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,130
Not really.

420
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,365
-You didn't?
-It was too fast.

421
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,566
You know what a coffin is?

422
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,368
-It's the vampire's bed.
-Vampire?

423
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,802
Die, die, die.

424
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,471
Andrew, until you die.

425
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,805
What is he saying?

426
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,073
-That's so wrong.
-No.

427
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,441
Don't go that far.

428
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,576
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT, SORRY

429
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,412
-How are American mountains…
-Yes.

430
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,514
…and Korean mountains different?

431
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,850
You need a lot of time
to climb an American mountain.

432
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,920
-They're so big, so it's very tough.
-Really?

433
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,087
Aren't Korean ones steep?

434
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,222
Very steep,

435
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,157
but the rocks are really beautiful.

436
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,325
The rocks.

437
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,661
Then, American mountains
versus Korean mountains,

438
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,630
which one do you like?
Which one do you like more?

439
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,799
I like them both,

440
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,235
-so I can't choose.
-American ones versus Korean ones.

441
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,203
American mountains
and Korean mountains are

442
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,572
-like mother and father.
-That's right.

443
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,208
HE SORTS THAT OUT WITH BASIC-LEVEL ENGLISH

444
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,077
LISTEN AND REPEAT

445
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,712
American ones are dads.

446
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,414
American ones are dads?

447
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,615
That sounds weird.

448
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,584
-Hang on.
-Is it made in Korea?

449
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,054
American ones are dads
and Korean ones are moms.

450
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,623
That sounds so weird, Andrew!

451
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,258
It sounds too weird.

452
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,326
I'm sorry.

453
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,228
American mountains and Korean mountains

454
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,730
are like mom and dad.

455
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,365
All right! He did it.

456
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,766
-I'm so glad.
-Good job.

457
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,635
What is the most memorable mountain?

458
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,870
-It would be Bukhansan Mountain for me.
-Why?

459
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,906
That's where I met my wife.

460
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,541
He's getting some brownie points.

461
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,643
How exactly did you meet her?

462
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,746
I went hiking on Christmas.

463
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,982
My wife was on her way down from the peak

464
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,416
-and I was heading up.
-And?

465
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,419
She looked very unsteady
when she was coming down.

466
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
She had no spikes.

467
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,022
-She looked unsteady.
-Yes.

468
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,858
-So I kept thinking about her.
-Because you were nervous.

469
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,061
-So I went up and descended very quickly.
-Okay.

470
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,629
I found her taking a break.

471
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,798
I gave her one side of my spikes.

472
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,066
THEY DESCENDED TOGETHER, SHARING SPIKES

473
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,634
Then, we descended together.

474
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,103
The spikes brought you together.

475
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,704
-Yes, that's right.
-Because of that.

476
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,772
How romantic.

477
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,407
What's yours, Yun-ju?

478
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,809
Do you know Machu Picchu in Peru?

479
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,712
Most people enjoy
the view from Machu Picchu.

480
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,914
-They do.
-But a limited number of people

481
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,317
can get tickets
to a place called Huayna Picchu.

482
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,353
You can hike up the mountain
to overlook Machu Picchu.

483
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,022
-There's a place like that?
-Yes.

484
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,091
You can go up there
and look over the ancient civilization.

485
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,760
I really enjoyed that.

486
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:11,130
Then, which mountain was very difficult?

487
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,034
As you hike along the ridge
of Sobaeksan Mountain,

488
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,237
the wind is so strong.

489
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,539
It was winter at that time,

490
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:26,011
our eyelashes froze
and our hair turned totally white.

491
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,815
I went on a no-sleep hike
with our president.

492
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,951
We thought it wouldn't be cold
so we wore short sleeves and shorts.

493
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,254
But it rained so much,

494
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,156
-so I fell down on my bottom…
-Oh, my.

495
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,724
…we got hypothermia,

496
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,793
-and we wrung out our clothes.
-You could've died.

497
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,860
-We couldn't rest.
-No.

498
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,797
If we stopped in the pouring rain,
it would be too cold.

499
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,166
You should have descended quickly instead.

500
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,767
-Once you start…
-We had to finish.

501
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,569
-…you have to reach the summit.
-You have to?

502
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,038
Going down was fine
when we went to Seoraksan Mountain.

503
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,107
The weather cleared up, so it was fine.

504
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:59,144
Gongnyongneungseon Ridge,
that we all went to, was the hardest.

505
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,613
How hard is Gongnyongneungseon Ridge?

506
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,015
There's a hellish place there.

507
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,817
It's like a hell that never ends.

508
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,985
How is it? Is it very steep like this?

509
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,887
-Going up and down?
-Yes.

510
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:12,191
There were many off-road trails,
and it was very long.

511
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,592
How many hours does it take?

512
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,494
-I think it took us about 11 hours.
-What?

513
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:19,431
As you saw, we take a lot of photos,
but we only had two or three.

514
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,868
Gosh. It was so hard that you didn't
even feel like taking photos.

515
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,470
-Yes.
-That's Gongnyongneungseon Ridge

516
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,537
-of Seoraksan?
-Yes.

517
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,006
Gosh, this reminds me
of a tough mountain I climbed.

518
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,675
Achasan Mountain.

519
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,810
AWKWARD LAUGH

520
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,379
Let's descend and get some delicious food.

521
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,447
Sounds good.

522
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,649
It feels so nice to go down.

523
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,420
What a great feeling it is to descend.
I'm so happy.

524
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,522
What should we eat when we go down?

525
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,790
Tofu is famous around here.

526
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,858
-Tofu is famous?
-Yes.

527
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,893
-I like acorn jelly.
-Oh, my.

528
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,495
Acorn jelly, makgeolli,

529
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,163
-and spicy stir-fried pork.
-Yes, makgeolli.

530
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,699
-Isn't that what we live for?
-It sure is.

531
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,468
It smells even better on the way down.

532
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,303
My goodness. The view is stunning.

533
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,438
Did we come here earlier?

534
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,506
FINALLY ENJOYS THE VIEW

535
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,175
It's even nicer
now that the weather cleared up.

536
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:07,112
Hiking is fun because of
how nice it is when you descend.

537
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,680
-It distorts your memory.
-What?

538
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,983
-It distorts your memory.
-Yes, you forget everything.

539
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,084
ALREADY FORGOT GOING UP

540
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,886
This is the last stopping point.

541
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,354
Good job, everyone.

542
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,488
Good job.

543
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,223
We did it!

544
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,691
We conquered Chiaksan Mountain.

545
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,093
-No, Achasan Mountain.
-Oh, yeah.

546
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,227
Chiaksan Mountain?

547
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,629
-Oh, right.
-Was it that scary?

548
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,430
Oops, it was Achasan Mountain.

549
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,833
I really do feel like
I accomplished something.

550
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,536
It was tough going up,
but going down was so fun.

551
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,137
This is why people go hiking.

552
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,740
It was great.
It's the perfect beginner's course.

553
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,777
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
10:00 WRAP-UP GATHERING

554
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,513
JANGSOO HANDMADE TOFU

555
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,748
Should we toast?

556
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,816
-All right. Bluejean.now!
-Good job.

557
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:45,984
-Hang on.
-Good job.

558
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,252
-We have a slogan.
-Really?

559
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,621
When I say, "We're only,"
you say, "Young once!"

560
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,156
A TYPICAL OLD-TIMER TOAST

561
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,925
He's scoffing at us.

562
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,960
Middle-aged men don't even do that.

563
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,297
-We don't do a lot, so this is okay.
-All right.

564
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,364
We're only…

565
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,999
-Young once!
-Young once!

566
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,006
-A new flavor.
-Wow.

567
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,876
Do you feel dopamine in the mountains?

568
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,479
Have you ever felt a thrill
while you were on a hike?

569
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,881
-The sunrise.
-Yeah, he's right.

570
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,150
-It was the sunrise. Yes.
-During sunrise?

571
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,486
Among the sunrises, there's this thing
called "hunting for a sea of clouds."

572
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,955
-Clouds?
-Yes, clouds.

573
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,890
You can't see it just because you want to.

574
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,326
They say, three generations
must do good deeds to see it.

575
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,794
It is truly a spectacular view.

576
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,597
I hope that everyone can see it
at least once in their lifetime.

577
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,633
-Those steps that seem endless.
-Yes.

578
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,969
When I went up those stairs
without taking any breaks,

579
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,504
-I felt like my thighs were tearing apart.
-Right.

580
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,340
Despite that, I kept going up.

581
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,344
When I reached the top,
that's when you get that rush.

582
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,146
If I had met you all sooner,

583
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,082
I may have met someone in the mountains.

584
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:54,186
I could have put spikes on my shoes
and found someone.

585
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,088
It isn't too late. You have this winter.

586
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,322
Christmas.

587
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,091
CHRISTMAS, HIKING, MEET CUTIE, MARRIAGE

588
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,293
Aren't those keywords so romantic?

589
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,295
Another friend is
getting married next month.

590
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,430
He's getting married
after lending his spikes, too.

591
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,698
I NEED TO GET SPIKES IMMEDIATELY

592
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,066
They went hiking in the winter.

593
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,534
-Get spikes.
-I freaking started it.

594
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,036
Can you say that more politely?

595
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,871
-I was the one who started it.
-Yes.

596
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,407
Then, can each of you say something

597
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,310
about the beauty of hiking
for novice hikers?

598
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,746
-Hiking is curiosity.
-Curiosity?

599
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,382
It's because each mountain
has its own beautiful view

600
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,884
-and difficulty.
-Yes.

601
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,919
So I think it's "curiosity."

602
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,488
-That's what I think.
-Curiosity.

603
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,523
To me, it's like an air vent.

604
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,227
When I feel frustrated
in my life because of work,

605
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:40,098
I would go to the mountains
and get some fresh air.

606
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:45,003
It is so refreshing and I'm able to start
the following week energetically.

607
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,272
Are you stressed out at work?

608
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,508
Do you have some bad memories
you'd like to forget?

609
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,877
For people like that, just go hiking.

610
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,979
First of all, my health improved a lot.

611
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,981
You gain confidence
that you can do it too.

612
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,116
Those are the things that changed.

613
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:02,454
Since I did something so tough,
there's nothing I can't do when I descend.

614
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,023
I've become more positive
and willing to take on challenges.

615
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,494
If you're bored
with doing indoor exercises,

616
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,096
I recommend hiking mountains

617
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,566
which has different scenery
throughout the four seasons.

NEWBIE'S JOURNEY OF FOLLOWING
THOSE MANY CLUB MEMBERS

622
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,578
HAS COME TO AN END

623
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,747
WHICH CLUB WOULD YOU LIKE TO SETTLE ON?

624
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,148
I like all of them,

625
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,984
but tennis was kind of fun.

626
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,621
Dragon boating too.

627
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,791
All the other clubs were very fun too,

628
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,195
but the most memorable ones
are the ones I've done recently.

629
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,063
HOW WAS YOUR JOURNEY AS NEWBIE?

630
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,301
When I was observing and participating
in all the club activities,

631
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,571
I realized that there are so many who live

632
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,475
such great, energetic
and cool lives in Korea.

633
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,377
There were so many fields
I didn't know about,

634
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,878
so I enjoyed learning about them.

635
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,048
Most importantly,
I really realized that it is

636
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,317
so much fun
to do things with other people.

637
