00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,236
LOCATION: NAMYANGJU, GYEONGGIDO
TIME: 11 A.M.

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,739
Hello, Netflix Club members.
How has your week been?

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:09,175
I'm Defconn,
the newbie who's crazy about clubs.

4
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,211
The sport we'll be introduced to today

5
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,746
is the "wannabe sport" of Gen Zs.

6
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,849
I'll be visiting the tennis club.

7
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,752
The newbie that will be joining me today

8
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,887
is none other than Park Jenny!

9
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,155
-Hello.
-Hey.

10
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,223
What's going on?

11
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,691
Say hello. Where are you going?

12
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:28,661
Hello, I'm Park Jenny,
the newbie who's crazy about trends.

13
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,497
You look so cute today.

14
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,332
I need to take photos for my Instagram

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,401
-and take selfies too.
-Right.

16
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,969
You're not wearing tennis shoes though.
Will you be okay?

17
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,670
-I'll be fine. I look cute.
-Really?

18
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,006
-Selfies are what matters, so I'm okay.
-Yeah?

19
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,541
Got it. You must do it for fashion.

20
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,777
What kind of sport do you usually like?

21
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,145
I've been a tennis newbie lately.

22
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,980
-I'm playing tennis.
-Really?

23
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,381
How long has it been?

24
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,383
-One month?
-You must be good then.

25
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,285
What sport did you like before that?

26
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,887
-Weight training.
-Weights.

27
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,989
-Lately, I've picked up boxing.
-Boxing?

28
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,424
Yes, and I do taekwondo as well.

29
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,925
-Not for long, right?
-No.

30
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,162
Gen Z's interests don't tend to last long.

31
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,064
-We try out a variety of things.
-Right.

32
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,232
Doing some kind of sport
is better than doing nothing.

33
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,434
-Exactly.
-Very good.

34
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,501
-Come on out.
-Hello!

35
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,637
-Nice to meet you!
-Hello.

36
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,641
I'm Cho Dae-chi,
the patriarch of Happy Net Tennis Club.

37
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,009
-Patriarch?
-Yes.

38
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,244
We're like a family.

39
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,446
Is it that bad?

40
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,215
-Yes, we're like a family.
-A family.

41
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,950
Careful with what you say.

42
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:24,984
Please introduce your club.

43
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:29,222
When I first tried to join a tennis club,

44
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:33,426
there were too many talented members
and long-term members,

45
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,262
-so it was rather difficult to get in.
-I see.

46
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,468
That's how I ended up starting this club
where even tennis newbies

47
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,370
can feel free to happily enjoy the sport.

48
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,706
Now, can you please introduce yourselves?

49
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,342
I'm the MC and game boy of Happy Net.
My name is Jung Kwang-hyun.

50
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,844
Game boy.

51
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,378
-Are you in charge of entertainment?
-I am.

52
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,380
I plan games like wake-up games,
the "Guess Who?" game,

53
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,382
or guessing the title of a song.

54
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,685
Wait, this isn't a variety show, is it?

55
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,221
We would do friendship-building activities
on our outings.

56
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,556
We can't just play tennis
all day long, right?

57
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,657
So you're the entertainment guy.

58
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,025
-So is this the MC's bag?
-Yes.

59
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,328
I look more natural
holding this toy hammer

60
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,929
-than a tennis racket.
-What?

61
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,732
-Isn't this supposed to be a tennis club?
-I know.

62
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,201
I just have a few basic items
like this large yutnori set.

63
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,103
-Things like this.
-We're used to this.

64
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,138
Isn't that a pillow?

65
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,440
Get an insert shot of this.

66
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,609
-He put his hand behind the object.
-Yes.

67
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,277
-This is a long jump rope.
-What?

68
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,079
-It's for the group.
-You jump rope together?

69
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
You have to wear acupressure slippers

70
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,948
-while jumping.
-As a penalty?

71
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,083
I have a jegi too.

72
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,352
I have a breathing exerciser too.

73
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,587
This is the "Guess Who?" game.

74
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,356
We can't sleep if he starts this.

75
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,891
-Patriarch Cho.
-Yes?

76
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,193
Are you just going to watch him
do these things?

77
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,261
-He makes me do it.
-Seriously.

78
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,396
It's to promote a family-like environment.

79
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,698
This feels like a variety show
that airs on the weekend.

80
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:50,103
I'm a choreographer at 1MILLION
and the mascot of Happy Net.

81
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,671
My name is Cho A-ra.

82
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,774
-I know her.
-1MILLION? Do you mean the dance crew?

83
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,911
-Yes.
-Weren't they on Street Woman Fighter?

84
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,479
She's a dancer.

85
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,748
I see. How did you join this club?

86
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,850
My husband
suggested playing tennis together.

87
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,318
-He's your husband?
-Yes.

88
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,387
I heard she has
some hot celebration moves.

89
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,189
-Because she's in 1MILLION.
-Exactly.

90
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,258
When you serve,
there's this thing called double fault.

91
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,661
-It's when you make two serve mistakes.
-You concede a point.

92
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,362
This is what I do.

93
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,897
CELEBRATION "POISON" DANCE

94
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,033
Nice. Can your husband
do the "Poison" dance too?

95
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,868
COUPLE "POISON" DANCE

96
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,369
-Is this the right beat?
-The beat?

97
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,637
-Something's off.
-We're offbeat.

98
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,073
-That's how couples are.
-This one's more Gen Z.

99
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,308
It's called "down the line."

100
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,644
It's a shot
where you hit the ball along the line.

101
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,279
When I succeed in doing that,

102
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,882
I dab and go down.

103
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,417
-Can you do it, Jenny?
-That's cool.

104
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,651
Oh, nice.

105
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,719
IMMEDIATELY LEARNS

106
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,089
If you want her to join your club,
just show her cool things.

107
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,157
HOW TO RECRUIT A GEN Z 101

108
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225
She's drawn to those things.

109
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,060
-That's correct.
-Right?

110
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,262
I'm the husband of the mascot,

111
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,531
and I play tennis with fancy gear
and textbook knowledge.

112
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,533
-My name is Choi Hyun-soo.
-Nice to meet you.

113
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,902
-You're clad in Wilson gear.
-He loves his gear.

114
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,970
Let me show you.

115
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,404
-Go right ahead.
-I'll show you.

116
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,441
I'm seeing a lot of "What's in my bag?"

117
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,909
They prepared a lot.

118
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,945
-He's always like that.
-He's like this all the time.

119
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,314
-Oh, my! Look at that!
-A suitcase?

120
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,749
-That's his signature sound.
-What's that for?

121
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,851
-What is that?
-Hyun-soo's here.

122
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,987
-Hyun-soo's here.
-When you hear that, he's here.

123
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,421
-Hyun-soo's here.
-Oh, my gosh.

124
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,390
I think you can go on a four-day trip.

125
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,359
TWO RACKETS

126
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,761
-You have two tennis rackets?
-I wish that were true.

127
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,996
-You have more?
-Custom-made.

128
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,832
You customized this
into a more classic look?

129
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,401
It has a nice grip.
It clings to your hand like gum.

130
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,902
Since you brought it up,

131
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,437
this is the Hermes of grips.

132
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,373
You should give that to Andre Agassi.

133
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,109
Since you brought him up,
this is Andre Agassi's hat.

134
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,478
WHATEVER GEAR YOU NAME, HE HAS IT

135
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,646
This is an old model.

136
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,981
I have all kinds of
protective gear and strings.

137
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,350
And this little guy
measures the tension of the strings.

138
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,185
Do you need this much gear?

139
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,387
-No.
-I see.

140
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,621
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
HE'S THE KING OF TENNIS GEAR

141
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,257
I'm the director of matches of Happy Net.

142
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,393
What does the director of matches do?

143
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,761
I keep track of
whose turn it is to play in a match,

144
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,596
when it's time to wrap up,
who goes in and out, and more.

145
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,565
Do you have a bag for matches
or a director's bag?

146
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,934
I don't have to carry anything
because she has everything.

147
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,603
-Can I show you everything I have?
-Sure.

148
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,104
-Please show us.
-One moment.

149
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,606
Did you see that, Director Chan-gyu?

150
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,374
Did you see that?

151
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,676
Should I do something about this court?

152
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,244
Go and get a mop or something.

153
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,646
I have all kinds of
necessary things in here.

154
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,948
I can stay out overnight today
with all this.

155
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,418
-You can't leave out the snacks.
-You even have snacks.

156
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,186
When anybody tries to eat these,

157
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,287
do you make them feel guilty or not?

158
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,955
-I feel so happy.
-That's what matters.

159
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,757
Actually, I don't like sweets.

160
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,159
-She doesn't eat any.
-She doesn't eat them.

161
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,493
-She doesn't?
-It's for others.

162
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,128
-She's like a mom to us.
-Yes, she is.

163
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,196
-She's the mom.
-Mom.

164
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,964
Dae-chi, what's our schedule for today?

165
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,901
We're going to test
how well the two of you play.

166
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,036
But we just got here.

167
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,171
No need to feel nervous.

168
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,340
Just as our club name implies,
we're really like a family.

169
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,508
-We'll have a good time.
-Okay.

170
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,944
Then, Jenny and I will have
our tennis skills assessed.

171
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,145
-Let's do it.
-A skills test.

172
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,347
Just relax.

173
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,615
THE TENNIS NEWBIE ATTEMPTS TO RECEIVE

174
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,784
Good job. That's in.

175
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,685
You pass.

176
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,988
SHE MISSED

177
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:56,889
You pass.

178
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,292
-Now, you're up.
-Okay.

179
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,793
Have you ever played before?

180
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,161
Briefly, when I was young.

181
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,229
-Briefly?
-Yes.

182
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,001
That was good,
but don't swing from down to up.

183
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,636
-Try to swing forward.
-Okay.

184
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,207
THUMBS-UP

185
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,976
I can do it thanks to your coaching.

186
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,578
COMPLIMENTS MAKE THE NEWBIE SWING IN FULL

187
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,613
-Let me add one more thing.
-What is it?

188
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,814
Your ready position is important.

189
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,183
CHAN-GYU'S POSITION LESSON

190
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,485
-Bounce lightly.
-Like this?

191
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,321
-Think, "I can move whenever I want."
-Okay.

192
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,922
Step forward

193
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:30,990
and slap.

194
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,158
-Slap.
-Slap.

195
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,092
We also need to

196
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,061
-look like we're skilled while we play.
-Of course.

197
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,163
-I have to post it on my Instagram story.
-Yeah.

198
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,798
-I have to post it.
-Yeah.

199
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,266
-These are miscellaneous skills.
-Got it.

200
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,635
Do this nonchalantly.

201
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,170
SLICK BALL PICKUP MOVE

202
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,239
Let's say you're playing
with a guy you're into.

203
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,040
"Hang on. I'll get the ball for you."

204
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,609
-That's it!
-I'll get it.

205
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,676
You almost had it.

206
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,844
You're so cool.

207
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,912
I'll get it.

208
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,148
-Get it for me.
-I want to go out with you!

209
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,649
I want to go out with you!

210
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,717
THE FLING ENDS

211
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,152
How do you like it, Jenny?

212
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,421
It's fun. I want to rally with someone.

213
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,488
You do?

214
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,056
-You can definitely do it.
-Rallying?

215
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,059
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
12:00 TEAM MATCH

216
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,661
There's a total of three rounds.

217
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,263
The first is "Lose the Racket."

218
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,198
-We'll play four-on-four.
-Okay.

219
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,534
If the ball goes out
or is caught on the net,

220
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,402
one of the players will lose a racket.

221
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,705
Then, the four players must use
three rackets to continue playing.

222
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,275
The team that runs out of rackets

223
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,676
-is the team that loses.
-I see.

224
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,144
-Is this an existing game?
-Yes.

225
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,679
-It's a game played by everyone.
-Really?

226
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,080
All right. "Lose the Racket."

227
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,017
-Losers get bonked with the toy hammer.
-The toy hammer?

228
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,854
-We are Trendy Newbie.
-Newbie!

229
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,255
TEAM TRENDY NEWBIE
CHAN-GYU, A-RA, KWANG-HYUN, JENNY

230
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,125
-Newbie!
-Newbie!

231
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,193
TEAM NEWBIE
JI-HYE, DAE-CHI, HYUN-SOO, DEFCONN

232
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,461
Let's start.

233
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,062
THE MATCH BEGINS

234
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,130
QUICK POSITION CHANGE IS KEY

235
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,232
-Nice!
-Go. Good.

236
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,733
-Watch out.
-Oh, no.

237
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,036
THE BALL DIDN'T GO OVER THE NET

238
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,541
Lose the racket.

239
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,043
Okay. Am I up?

240
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,377
JENNY'S SERVE

241
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,445
Nice! Now, move.

242
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,247
-You have to hit it.
-You got this!

243
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,315
HOME RUN

244
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,618
BOTH TEAMS START OFF BY LOSING A RACKET

245
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,986
Just like that, huh?

246
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,254
TEAM NEWBIE IS 1 RACKET DOWN

247
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,525
OUT OF BOUNDS

248
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,061
TEAM NEWBIE HAS 2 RACKETS LEFT

249
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,729
BALL GOES TO THE SIDE

250
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,964
That's how they're playing?

251
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,765
Oh, no!

252
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,134
PATRIARCH CHO COULDN'T
GET THE BALL OVER THE NET

253
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,669
Wait a second. He's the patriarch.

254
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,071
Shouldn't he get it over the net?

255
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,139
I must be nervous.

256
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,774
-One?
-One.

257
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,177
-One?
-But we will perform a miracle.

258
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,245
Let's beat your wife!

259
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,980
Come on. Go now.

260
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,548
You have to receive it immediately.

261
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,616
Right now.

262
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,884
Hey, where are you going?

263
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,152
Hey, how could you let that happen?

264
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,220
-Hey!
-No…

265
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,189
-It's too far.
-It's too far.

266
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,590
PATRIARCH'S 2ND MISS, THEY LOSE ROUND 1

267
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,225
-You should've followed me.
-But…

268
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,293
I'm sorry.

269
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,461
Why can't you receive that?

270
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,696
-I did my best to receive it.
-He did, but…

271
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,099
-That's not the issue.
-You should've passed it immediately.

272
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,002
Haven't you seen Andre Agassi do it?
You should have given the racket…

273
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,537
They're fighting.

274
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,604
They're fighting!

275
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,307
Please enjoy the family-like environment.

276
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,509
Patriarch Cho. Come on.

277
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,877
It's all his fault.

278
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,647
If he had received well, we would've won.

279
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,283
He's the patriarch.
I expected much from him.

280
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,884
Don't they look nice?

281
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,155
TIME FOR THE TOY HAMMER

282
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,690
Wait. It's bent.

283
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,058
Did you hit him with a racket?

284
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,060
Just like a real family!

285
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,863
I'm curious.

286
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,831
How did he become the patriarch?

287
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,103
I think you need to give that title
to someone else.

288
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,471
Today is his last day.

289
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,507
Today is the day
I pass it on to someone else.

290
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,476
It isn't that I played badly.

291
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,911
It was the situation.

292
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,346
They were tough balls to receive.

293
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,483
-The second game is "Hit the Target."
-Hit the Target.

294
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,486
You have to hit the cone
with the ball you serve.

295
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,622
The team that hits the most cones wins.

296
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,923
Each person gets five chances.

297
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,592
Five chances per person.

298
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,094
A-RA FROM TEAM TRENDY NEWBIE

299
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,897
SO CLOSE

300
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,799
-She was so close to hitting it.
-Listen.

301
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,801
-She missed because of her form.
-Really?

302
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,103
FOCUSED MORE ON HER FORM THAN THE TARGET

303
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,938
She hits it up in the air, no matter what!

304
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,139
It's so noisy in here.

305
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,075
-It's all about the form for her.
-It is.

306
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,010
-Tennis is all about how it looks.
-Exactly.

307
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,545
Did she get it?

308
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,613
HITS 0 BUT IN GOOD FORM

309
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,814
It was so close though.

310
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,816
Her husband is up. Our team's hope.

311
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,519
You're trying to look cool too.

312
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,787
You got me.

313
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,523
THIS COUPLE IS ALL ABOUT LOOKING COOL

314
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:25,925
You see?

315
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,761
You came forward to look cool on TV.

316
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,463
It's too late to look cool now.

317
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,099
BUMMER

318
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,167
-You got this!
-You got this!

319
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,602
JENNY IS UP NEXT

320
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,471
She said she played tennis yesterday.

321
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,007
What?

322
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,409
THE BALL DOESN'T EVEN GET CLOSE
TO THE TARGET

323
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,710
Just off by a centimeter.

324
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,479
CHANGES HER FORM

325
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,314
Wait. Is there a mosquito somewhere?

326
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,149
A mosquito?

327
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,484
DREAM: CONE KILLER
REALITY: MOSQUITO KILLER

328
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,385
Lightly.

329
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,453
This is really hard!

330
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,522
This is really hard!

331
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,290
NEWBIE IS UP

332
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,393
-I know how you feel.
-You got this!

333
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,794
One moment.

334
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,963
CHECKING THE STRINGS

335
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,065
-He's seen that somewhere.
-Definitely.

336
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,600
You got this.

337
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,202
BOUNCE, BOUNCE

338
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,571
Are you trying to bounce the ball
to hit the cone?

339
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,839
I don't use bounces.

340
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,608
My ball goes up in the air,
no matter what.

341
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,411
BUT IT FALLS TOO SOON

342
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,712
Nice try.

343
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,247
HE CHANGES FORM AND TRIES AGAIN

344
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,315
CLOSE

345
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,550
OH, MAN!

346
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,085
That was really close!

347
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,187
I think it may have been too difficult.

348
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,022
Let's try it again after adjusting them.

349
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,457
-Like bowling pins.
-Yes.

350
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,958
Let's go by how many we hit.

351
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,194
MISSES TARGET

352
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,063
MISSES TARGET AGAIN

353
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,464
It's far.

354
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,598
THEY KEEP FAILING

355
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,101
Isn't it a trick shot at this point?

356
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,070
Let's go, Patriarch Cho!

357
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,873
Why is he the patriarch of Happy Net?

358
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,675
-Show us.
-Here he comes.

359
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,010
DESPERATE TO RESTORE HIS HONOR

360
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,611
THE FAMILY GROANS

361
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,647
Can't you cheer for me?

362
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,715
HA!

363
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,783
ROOTS FOR HIMSELF BY GRUNTING

364
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,085
His grunt was too weak.

365
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,753
Take that!

366
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,188
GOES RIGHT IN BETWEEN

367
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,257
-Keep that up.
-That was excellent.

368
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,392
You got this!

369
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,793
ONE LAST CHANCE

370
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,096
-You got this.
-Hang on.

371
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,530
He's nervous now.

372
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,898
I'm getting nervous too.

373
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,770
IT GOES BETWEEN THE CONES AGAIN…

374
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,406
IN THE END, EVEN PATRIARCH CHO FAILED

375
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,841
TEAM TRENDY NEWBIE'S KWANG-HYUN

376
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,908
He's about form too.

377
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,210
-I knew it.
-Yes.

378
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,277
GRUNTING

379
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,079
-That's the sound they make at Wimbledon.
-Exactly.

380
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,180
The "Ah!"

381
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,548
They say you hit the ball better.

382
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,217
Everyone is good at acting like pros.

383
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,785
GRUNTING

384
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,721
Your direction is completely off.

385
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,790
HE CALMLY TRIES WITHOUT GRUNTING THIS TIME

386
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,525
You got it.

387
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,127
MISSES THE TARGET

388
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,895
It's because he didn't grunt.

389
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,397
GRUNTING

390
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,533
BULLSEYE

391
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,101
HITS TWO CONES WITH ONE BALL

392
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,169
THE ONLY ONE WHO SUCCEEDED

393
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,737
You hit two!

394
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:52,805
Two!

395
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:57,276
-We are Trendy Newbie.
-Newbie.

396
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,012
I'm a master at serving.

397
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,114
I did my job as the master server.

398
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,582
I failed again.

399
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,385
Am I willing to pass on my position?
Oh, well.

400
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,654
I can definitely pass it on

401
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,856
since we're family.

402
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,260
But I'd like to remind you
that you shouldn't covet this position.

403
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,528
Hello, Patriarch Jung.

404
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,996
-You're here.
-Yes. Hello.

405
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,230
What do you want to be?

406
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,466
-Want to be the vice president?
-Yes, I'd like that.

407
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,735
FEELING THE STING

408
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,604
JUDGMENT TIME HAS COME AGAIN

409
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,206
CLENCHING HIS TEETH

410
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,841
You hit him using the side.

411
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,109
Okay, so that's how it is.

412
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,877
Please give me a snack later.

413
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,113
Okay!

414
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,614
No more snacks for you guys.

415
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,884
This time, let's do four bonks
with the toy hammer.

416
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,452
Four bonks? All right.

417
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,121
The third and final round

418
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,723
-is a doubles match.
-Doubles. Okay.

419
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,526
-Whoever gets 15 points first wins.
-Okay.

420
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,930
-You can freely switch partners.
-Got it.

421
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,631
Tennis is a gentleman's sport,

422
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,400
-so we begin with a greeting.
-Really?

423
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,801
-Hello.
-Hello.

424
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,269
Hello.

425
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,038
JUNG KWANG-HYUN, PARK JENNY

426
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,806
CHO DAE-CHI &amp; DEFCONN
VS JUNG KWANG-HYUN &amp; PARK JENNY

427
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,374
KWANG-HYUN'S SERVE

428
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,309
Here it comes.

429
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,910
Nice.

430
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,780
Hit it. Thank you.

431
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,048
KWANG-HYUN COVERS THE BALL JENNY MISSED

432
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,417
Nice!

433
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,586
-Nice shot! He's playing so well.
-He's so good.

434
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,222
RALLY RIDES ON THE NEWBIE'S STRONG PLAY

435
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,790
-Nice!
-Nice!

436
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,759
TEAM TRENDY NEWBIE
CONCEDES THE FIRST POINT

437
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,762
AN UNEXPECTED WIN

438
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,700
-Defconn is playing so well!
-Why did he act like he wasn't good at it?

439
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,667
This is nothing.

440
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,102
Bring it on.

441
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,437
Here it comes.

442
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,441
-Nice!
-Nice!

443
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,342
Out.

444
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,676
CONCEDES ANOTHER POINT

445
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,012
-That's it. Jenny!

CONCEDES 3 POINTS IN NO TIME

447
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,983
-So close.
-Switch partners.

448
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,317
Am I the dead weight in this game?

449
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,719
No, you're not.

450
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,420
-Not at all.
-Not at all.

451
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,523
NEWBIE SERVES THIS TIME

452
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,591
SURPRISINGLY POWERFUL SERVE

453
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,525
-What?
-It's in.

454
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,793
He's so good.

455
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,362
Why is he so good?

456
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,531
What on earth?

457
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,900
-No way!
-He got it.

458
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:01,967
HIS SERVE STARTLES THE MEMBERS

459
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:02,902
That was awesome!

460
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:07,006
HE SUDDENLY EXCELS IN THE 3RD ROUND

461
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,474
What's up with his serve?

462
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,409
You lied about how powerful your serve is!

463
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,913
We're the ones who are good at tennis
in the tennis club.

464
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,314
THE MEMBERS ARE FAILING IN THE ACTUAL GAME

465
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,682
We're good at the actual game.

466
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,050
The patriarch and vice patriarch!

467
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,218
I'm the vice patriarch.

468
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,352
Go, Vice Patriarch!

469
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:21,987
Here it comes!

470
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:22,922
THE MATCH RESUMES

471
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:23,789
FLINCHES

472
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,057
-Hit it.
-Wait a second.

473
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,125
FAKES OUT HIS OWN TEAM

474
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,059
Come on, man.

475
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,529
TEAM TRENDY NEWBIE FINALLY SCORES A POINT!

476
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,697
-Defconn.
-How did you miss?

477
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,765
What was that?

478
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,000
It was too long for me to hit it.

479
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,368
-Am I wrong?
-Right.

480
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,770
He acted like he'd hit it,

481
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,472
but he passed it on to me
when it was too difficult for him.

482
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,408
I was slightly disappointed by that,

483
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,678
but a patriarch
must be considerate and patient.

484
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,279
Those people can't do it.

485
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,782
Well done, guys.

486
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,817
-You got this.
-You got this.

487
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,118
-Which side do you want?
-Where will you stand, Hyun-soo?

488
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,287
-I'll stand opposite A-ra.
-Okay, go ahead.

489
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,422
A couple's showdown.

490
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,991
Nice serve.

491
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,093
-What the heck?
-It's in.

492
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,095
RETURNING IT WITH A POWERFUL RECEIVE

493
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,229
A LONGER RALLY THAN THE NEWBIES'

494
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,331
Nice!

495
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,234
-Up.
-It's yours. Sorry.

496
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,437
-Yours.
-It's out.

497
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,072
-It went out.
-Out.

498
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,907
A-RA CONCEDES THE FIRST POINT

499
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,275
Good shot.

500
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,510
A-RA'S SERVE

501
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,379
Nice. Very nice.

502
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,815
-Out!
-Out.

503
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,718
TEAM TRENDY NEWBIE GAINS MOMENTUM

504
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,253
SCORES CONSECUTIVELY

505
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,756
How dare you attempt a down the line?

506
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,257
Let me change my racket.

507
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,926
He's switching his racket.

508
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,195
-Change your racket.
-I have to.

509
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,797
His serve is the strongest against me.

510
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,001
Check out how different it is.

511
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,203
Will he play better
now that he changed his racket?

512
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,672
RESOLUTELY PREPARES TO SERVE
WITH A NEW RACKET

513
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,242
You see that?

514
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,877
Nice serve!

515
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,545
Why didn't you use that from the start?

516
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,115
He served it with all his might.

517
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,349
He'll be in trouble at home.

518
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,917
We'll see.

519
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,253
You two play well as a team, right?

520
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,689
-Yes, we did competitions together.
-You're partners?

521
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,857
-Yes, in competitions.
-Nice.

522
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,692
-Let's beat the competition partners.
-Let's do this!

523
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,694
-Yours.
-That's it.

524
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,195
THEY SKILLFULLY CALL OUT SHOTS

525
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,164
Yours.

526
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,966
THE COMPETITION PARTNERS PLAY HARMONIOUSLY

527
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:14,933
Yours, Jenny!

528
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,869
Nice!

529
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,570
OUT

530
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,705
Good shot.

531
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,673
-You got this.
-You got this.

532
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,908
Here it comes.

533
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,512
-She did it.
-Nice! Good job!

534
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,980
-She did it.
-Once more!

535
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,681
-Once more.
-Once more.

536
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,450
SWING AND MISS

537
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,652
Is there only a point left now?

538
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,887
There's only one point left.

539
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,822
-Let's put in our ace player.
-Okay.

540
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,891
-You got this.
-You got this.

541
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,060
-Out.
-So close.

542
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,661
THE MATCH ENDS WITH A LOST POINT

543
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,930
With a score of 15 to 10,

544
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,933
-Team Newbie won!
-Hurray!

545
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,002
THEY FINALLY WON IN THE LAST ROUND

546
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,337
We did it!

547
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,140
-Good job.
-Good job.

548
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,408
Where's the toy hammer?

549
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,177
NO MERCY, THE PENALTY MUST BE GIVEN

550
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,378
Four bonks each.

551
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,546
So this is what it feels like.

552
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,749
-Honey.
-"Honey."

553
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,651
-Do you want someone else to do it?
-Someone else?

554
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,486
-I can be that someone else.
-No, I'll do it.

555
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,288
HE'S DETERMINED

556
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,323
A chance like this won't come again.

557
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,858
Yesterday, in the car.

558
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,359
Yesterday, in the car?

559
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,196
-The other day, in the kitchen.
-What else?

560
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,497
A week ago, in the bathroom.

561
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,165
-The bathroom?
-Hang on.

562
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,601
-The bathroom?
-The bathroom? What do you mean?

563
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,736
Well, she told me
to clean up the dog's pee.

564
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,138
OH OKAY, OKAY

565
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,506
Two weeks ago, in bed.

566
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,142
-Nice.
-He's all better now.

567
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,144
-Is it me?
-You're up.

568
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,880
-Yeah, Patriarch Cho!
-It's from the patriarch.

569
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,982
-Go ahead.
-Will you join our club?

570
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,718
Will you join our club?

571
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,652
GAUGING POWER

572
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,787
Do you not like him?

573
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,623
If it's in Seoul,
I may be interested in joining.

574
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,159
I don't have a car,
so it'll be difficult for me to come here.

575
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,394
What? That's it?

576
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,830
-Since she has to join.
-Because she has to join.

577
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,332
ENDING ON A LOVING FAMILY-LIKE VIBE

578
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,167
A family-like vibe.

579
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,170
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
14:00 WRAP-UP GATHERING

580
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,506
Do you usually eat together too?

581
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,275
Yes, we almost always eat together.

582
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,611
Since we go to tennis courts
that are in the suburbs,

583
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,148
it's fun to visit
nice restaurants after we play.

584
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,917
Why did you decide to play tennis, Jenny?

585
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,453
First of all,
I see it a lot on social media.

586
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,255
That's actually the biggest reason.

587
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,523
-Social media addict.
-She's Gen Z.

588
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,590
Yes.

589
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,059
You took so many videos for TikTok.

590
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:25,030
-How many followers do you have?
-I have about 1.4 million followers now.

591
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,398
HIS EYES WIDEN

592
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,800
Let me take a selfie with you
so I can gain more followers.

593
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,436
NEWBIE DREAMS OF BECOMING
A BELATED INFLUENCER

594
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,505
-Do you want to take it like a Gen Z?
-Yes, I do.

595
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,973
-I just need my face to be in it.
-Okay.

596
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,375
Shouldn't you take it from above?

597
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,609
-From above?
-I'll do that.

598
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,712
GEN ZS DON'T LOOK AT THE SCREEN
TO TAKE A SELFIE

599
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,347
LIKE THIS?

600
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,716
Look here.

601
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,552
OH?

602
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,321
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE NEWBIE VIBE, GET OUT

603
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,191
How far have you gone
to improve your tennis skills?

604
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,860
-I had a competition the next day,
-Okay.

605
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,996
so I practiced my serves
until 10 p.m. the night before

606
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,531
-to play better.
-What?

607
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,799
But I dislocated my shoulder.

608
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,434
Yeah, I heard about that.

609
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,036
He called me after he dislocated it

610
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,805
and said sobbingly,
"I was just trying to play well."

611
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,273
-He cried?
-He cried.

612
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,341
MY SHOULDER GOT DISLOCATED

613
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,109
Do you want to play
even if you're injured?

614
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,311
Is it like an addiction?

615
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,048
When Chan-gyu dislocated his shoulder,
he came with a cast

616
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,917
-and played with his left arm.
-What?

617
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,153
-That is what it takes…
-What?

618
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,554
to be the director of matches.

619
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,223
That is what it takes.

620
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,325
-When I walk my dog,
-Yes.

621
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,026
my other hand gets bored.

622
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,394
I hold the leash with one hand

623
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,330
-and take my racket with me.
-What?

624
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,831
I let my dog take its walk.

625
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,900
That's such a strange combination.

626
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,436
And I practice my swings.

627
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,137
-That's like an illness.
-Yes.

628
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,606
They're serious about it.

629
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,074
I even quit my job.

630
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,875
-What are you saying?
-I wanted to play well.

631
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,644
-What?
-I left my job and…

632
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,748
-What did you do?
-I was planning on switching companies,

633
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:54,052
but I thought I'd take a break to practice
playing tennis before doing so.

634
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,922
You wanted to focus on tennis,
so you quit your job.

635
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,490
Your passion is admirable.

636
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:02,361
Can you summarize what you find
appealing about tennis in one sentence?

637
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,529
Tennis is like studying for a degree.

638
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,465
That's what a professor would say.

639
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,532
PROFESSOR OF COMPUTER SCIENCE

640
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,967
I'm getting sleepy.

641
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,236
HIS WORDS TURNED THE LAWN
INTO A LECTURE HALL

642
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,705
Why is he talking about studying? Jeez.

643
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,408
As we told you, it's a difficult sport,

644
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,644
so it can be exhausting and stressful.

645
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,847
But as you continue with the course,
you'll find yourself improving.

646
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,449
And you'll have moments
where your dopamine explodes.

647
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,251
That's why you'll find it thrilling,

648
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,653
just like studying for a degree.

649
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,255
It's that sense of accomplishment,
isn't it?

650
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:31,990
What about you, Jenny?

651
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,558
-I think…
-Yes.

652
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,861
-tennis is
-Yes.

653
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,496
the best place for selfies.

654
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,398
It really hit me today.

655
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,167
-You have a clear concept, don't you?
-It really did.

656
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:46,071
YOU CAN GET THE BEST PHOTOS
ON THE PRIMARY-COLORED COURT

657
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,940
I recommend this to people who want to
dress nicely and take pictures

658
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:53,245
or those who have to
change their profile photos.

659
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,646
I recommend this to anyone

660
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:58,917
who wants to be absorbed in something
without any distractions.

661
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,652
I want to keep playing.

662
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,921
The vibration you feel
is like electricity.

663
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,956
It's amazing, guys.

664
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,593
There are moments
when the ball hits right in the middle.

665
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,064
Those moments are unforgettable.

666
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,132
And that's why I play tennis.

667
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,801
