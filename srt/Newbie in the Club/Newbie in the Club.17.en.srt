LOCATION: YEONGDEUNGPO-GU, SEOUL
TIME: 8 A.M.

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,305
Hello, Netflix Club members,
how has your week been?

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,907
Each week, I observe clubs
with the eyes of a bird.

4
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,943
I'm Defconn,
the newbie who's crazy about clubs.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,678
The club I'm visiting today

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,247
is a club that
fiercely glides over a river.

7
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,883
It's a dragon boating club!

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,919
After trying rowing
on Infinite Challenge in 2011,

9
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,957
14 years have passed
since I have been back on a boat.

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,492
Captain, where are you?

11
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,093
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,895
Please introduce your club to us.

13
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,398
I'm Choi Joong-keun, the captain
of the dragon boating club, Harang.

14
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,900
We're a club that rows
a dragon-shaped boat on the Hangang River.

15
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,937
Our club is made up of about 30 members.

16
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,006
Then is it different from rowing?

17
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,509
Firstly, on a dragon boat,
we sit on both sides of the boat.

18
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,511
-And the oar is a bit short.
-Okay.

19
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,578
You have oars on both sides, right?

20
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:46,913
It's on one side.

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,716
Rowing requires bigger movements
and you go like this.

22
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,084
Do not insult rowing.

23
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,353
-Oh, sorry.
-Listen, I heard what you said.

24
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,254
Let me see your hand.

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,356
No calluses! There's nothing!

26
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,424
Let me see.

27
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,491
Not tanned at all!

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,493
-The season just started.
-My goodness.

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,495
-We're much faster than rowing.
-Much faster.

30
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,297
-Our paddling is much faster.
-Really?

31
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,932
You got us beat on that.

32
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,500
You have to row in sync.

33
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,736
Please introduce yourselves.

34
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,538
-I'm the coach.
-Okay.

35
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,306
-The coach?
-Yes.

36
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,241
HMMM

37
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,511
You can't have a body like this in rowing.

38
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,313
-You see, the season just started.
-I see.

39
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,514
-It just started.
-Yes.

40
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,650
In Harang, I make up one of

41
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,685
the members of Davichi.

42
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,421
-Davichi?
-Why are you ashamed of it?

43
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,589
It's the two of us.

44
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,690
-You as well?
-Yes.

45
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,758
THE FEMALE DUO OF HARANG

46
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,393
-Couldn't you tell? I'm Kang Min-kyung.
-What?

47
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,894
What do you mean? I just met you.

48
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,229
We just met.

49
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,698
I play the older member of Davichi.

50
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,833
-The older member.
-Yes.

51
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,702
I'm Park Hyeon-seon, and I've been
dragon boating for three years.

52
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,905
I play the role of
Davichi's Kang Min-kyung in Harang.

53
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,173
My name is Park Jae-eun.

54
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,975
-I've been doing this for nine years.
-I see.

55
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,544
-Since the two of you are Davichi,
-Oh, no.

56
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,713
-please sing a song for us.
-What?

57
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,949
Here. Sing a song for us.

58
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,251
We aren't Davichi
because we're good at singing.

59
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,920
The two of us were already good friends.

60
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,388
-Outside of this club?
-Yes.

61
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,723
-You were already friends.
-Yes.

62
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,024
CALLED DAVICHI BECAUSE THEY'RE CLOSE

63
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,693
I'm the semi-attention seeker of Harang,

64
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,761
-third-year boater, Choi Ha-kyung.
-"Semi"?

65
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,163
What's a semi-attention seeker?

66
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,132
-Usually, she's very quiet.
-Right.

67
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,600
But once she starts drinking…

68
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,335
-She gets drunk.
-…another person appears.

69
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,270
BECOMES AN ATTENTION-SEEKER
WHEN ALCOHOL IS CONSUMED

70
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,239
She seeks attention
when her liver is active.

71
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,740
You call that a liver seeker.

72
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,975
-Liver seeker.
-You're right.

73
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,110
You're a semi-liver seeker.

74
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,779
I'm Kim Woo-jung, Harang's romancist,

75
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,281
and I've been boating for three years.

76
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,517
You're a "romancist," not a romantic?

77
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,651
AWKWARD LAUGH

78
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,752
I misspoke.

79
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,487
Why are you a romantic?

80
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,122
-While I was in this club,
-Yes.

81
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,724
-I found love…
-Oh?

82
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,758
…and left the country.

83
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,759
I'm a romancist.

84
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,162
-A romantic.
-Oh, I meant a romantic.

85
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,863
Maybe he's not fully awake yet.

86
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,899
Then does your girlfriend live abroad?

87
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,333
-She's in Malaysia.
-Malaysia?

88
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,601
-How did you meet?
-At a competition.

89
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,669
-Overseas competition.
-Competition?

90
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,204
She was the Korean team's manager.

91
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,639
She was our team's manager.

92
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,842
While you were trying to advance
in an international competition,

93
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,711
-he was looking for love.
-That's right.

94
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,480
You're a "romancist" indeed.

95
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,849
Very nice. Anyway, congratulations.

96
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,853
I'm Choi Hyuk-jun, Harang's entertainer,
and I've been a member for three years.

97
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,123
Besides any major family events,
I come to training every weekend.

98
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,926
I'm Lee Yu-jin, the king of attendance,
and I've been a member for three years.

99
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,962
I'm Ryu Jeong-in, the youngest of Harang,
and I've been a member for three years.

100
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,064
-Nice to meet you.
-She's the strongest in our club.

101
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,832
She's the youngest,
but she's better than us.

102
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,501
-Her physique?
-She has a good physique.

103
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,871
I'm curious about what kind of equipment
you need for dragon boating.

104
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,140
It's a very cost-effective sport.

105
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,509
You can do it anytime
if you have a carbon fiber paddle.

106
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,577
What about the boat?

107
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,845
-We rent it.
-I see. Is there one here?

108
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:33,947
-Yes.
-At the Hangang River.

109
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,548
-You can rent one here?
-Yes.

110
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,383
So you can do it anytime
as long as you have a paddle.

111
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,919
Even if you don't have one,
you can rent one here.

112
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,222
-You can rent it out to try it.
-Yes.

113
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,225
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
8:30 LEARNING THE BASIC POSITION

114
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,461
Let's try with the machine
before we go on the dragon boat.

115
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,963
This is different from what I know.

116
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,798
I don't think this moves back and forth.

117
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,865
It's fixed.

118
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,334
-Yes, it's fixed.
-You use your arms.

119
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,835
Only your arms?

120
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,704
-You can start in this position.
-Okay.

121
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,539
Put your left leg forward.

122
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,808
-Left leg goes forward?
-Because you're on the left side.

123
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,443
-Ready.
-Ready.

124
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,245
-Attention.
-Attention.

125
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,879
-When I say "go," you can go.
-Go.

126
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,682
Copy me. Go like this.

127
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,118
BREATHING HEAVILY

128
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,186
That's too much.

129
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,287
You look so scary.

130
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,424
IT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO FACE HIM

131
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,493
ALREADY TIRED

132
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,362
I only did this for a short while,

133
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,063
but I'm reminded
of the nightmare at Misari.

134
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,199
When I was training
at Misari Boat Race Course,

135
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,469
my mom told me
that I would do this in my sleep.

136
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,536
For real.

137
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,604
-Oh, no.
-I really did.

138
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,439
-You'll do this in your sleep tomorrow.
-What?

139
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,408
HE'LL DEFINITELY HAVE NIGHTMARES

140
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,477
Those in the higher level

141
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,979
are the captain and Ha-kyung.

142
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,215
They'll ride together
and aim to go 300 meters.

143
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,750
Ready.

144
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,885
Attention. Go!

145
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,290
THE IMMENSE POWER MOVES THE MACHINE

146
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,259
HOLDING ON TIGHT

147
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,594
Is this a race?

148
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,995
Why are you going so fast?

149
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,564
You have 200 meters left.

150
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,733
Are you relieving
your stress from parenting?

151
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,670
HE MUST BE STRESSED OUT DURING THE WEEK

152
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,904
Paddle harder!

153
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,006
-I ate too much yesterday.
-Keep going.

154
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,008
-Don't eat.
-You have 50 m left.

155
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,178
That's it!

156
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,980
CAPTAIN FINISHED
300 M IN 1:21:24

157
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,782
-You're almost there.
-Almost there.

158
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,016
HA-KYUNG TRIES HER BEST UNTIL THE END

159
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,651
-Done!
-Good job.

160
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,253
That was 1 minute and 46 seconds.

161
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,754
Our captain got 1 minute and 21 seconds.

162
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,656
Twenty seconds is pretty close.

163
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,825
The higher level finishes
in less than two minutes.

164
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,593
What about the lower class?

165
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,429
We'll find out when you try it.

166
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,164
CLOSING HIS EYES TIGHTLY

167
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,198
Show him the young power.

168
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,966
AGAINST THE POWERFUL YOUNGEST

169
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,169
Look. She took off her shoes.

170
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,405
The youngest member
is determined to teach me a lesson.

171
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,308
I have plantar fasciitis on my right side,
so it hurts here.

172
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,277
Plantar fasciitis should be on your foot.

173
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,678
But you're holding your shoulder.

174
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,747
You're pretty sharp.

175
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,582
Romantics are different after all.

176
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,384
Are you a physical therapist?

177
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,285
KNOWLEDGEABLE ROMANTIC

178
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,619
You seem to know a lot.

179
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,388
-Ready.
-Is he good?

180
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,690
-Attention.
-I'm nervous.

181
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,092
Go!

182
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,159
THEY COMPETE FOR THEIR PRIDE

183
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,427
Nice.

184
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,395
Good.

185
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,864
-Keep going.
-Breathe.

186
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,165
SCREAMS

187
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,300
THINKING OF MISARI DAYS

188
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,469
-You can do it!
-All right. You're at 10 m.

189
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,271
Gosh, Jeong-in, are you sure about this?

190
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,540
Hey, are you going to be okay?

191
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,875
I don't know.

192
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,345
THE DISTANCE IS REDUCING RAPIDLY

193
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,513
190 m left.

194
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,681
185 m left.

195
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,549
-They're going at a similar pace.
-Are they?

196
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,550
Yes.

197
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,586
-150!
-150.

198
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,421
150 m left over here too.

199
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,956
GOSH

200
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,226
HE STRUGGLES WITH SURGING PAIN

201
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,495
I'm getting tired.

202
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,864
-Oh, jeez!
-You can do it!

203
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,966
-You can do it!
-Keep going!

204
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,769
Don't stop!

205
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,103
Don't stop!

206
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,172
BREATHING HEAVILY

207
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,240
WHAT DEATH FEELS LIKE!

208
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,575
-You're almost there.
-Forty!

209
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,445
-You're almost there.
-Twenty.

210
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,080
-Twenty.
-Come on.

211
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,449
-Paddle more powerfully!
-Keep it up!

212
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,951
-You got this!
-Twenty meters. Hang in there!

213
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,553
Come on.

214
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,989
AFTER A CLOSE MATCH, NEWBIE FINISHES FIRST

215
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:07,393
HE FINISHED THE 300-METER COURSE!

216
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,430
He got 1 minute and 41 seconds.

217
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,832
-What about Jeong-in?
-1 minute and 50 seconds.

218
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,034
Jeong-in got 1 minute and 50 seconds.

219
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,637
-He won.
-It's nothing.

220
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,205
NEWBIE MAKES A SURPRISING COMEBACK

221
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,176
She acted like she was a big shot.

222
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,745
She's nothing.

223
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,647
I'm done for now.

224
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,348
I'm out of energy for today.

225
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,484
Can I keep up with them until the end?

226
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,352
I'm already out of energy.

227
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:35,922
NEXT UP IS TEAMWORK TRAINING

228
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,490
-Is there more training?
-Yes.

229
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,793
There's a tug-of-war type game
in dragon boating.

230
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,395
-Tug of war?
-It's called "Push Away."

231
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,031
From either end, you paddle
towards each other for a minute.

232
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,166
The winner is decided by who pulled more.

233
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,768
-Okay.
-First place

234
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,069
-doesn't have to pay for lunch.
-Okay.

235
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,938
How about the losing team
gets flogged with the paddle?

236
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:52,839
Sounds good.

237
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,274
Winners are exempt from paying
and losers get flogged.

238
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,376
We can't come in last.

239
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,111
-Let's win.
-Let's win.

240
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,613
It'd be shameful if we lost.

241
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,548
-We should lose.
-What?

242
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,650
-We have to win.
-It'd be embarrassing.

243
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,085
For the first match,

244
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,421
Defconn and Ha-kyung
will go against Hyeon-seon and Hyuk-jun.

245
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,022
HA-KYUNG, DEFCONN VS HYUK-JUN, HYEON-SEON

246
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,457
-Do we ride this?
-Yes.

247
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,959
So this is the dragon boat.

248
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,294
I had the opportunity to experience
my past life not too long ago,

249
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,663
and I found out I was a Viking.

250
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,765
HE WAS ONE WITH BOATS IN HIS PAST LIFE

251
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,033
SHAKING

252
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,602
Don't do that.

253
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,670
A VIKING WHO'S AFRAID OF WATER
HAS REINCARNATED

254
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,671
You got this!

255
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,306
-Let's go, Team Beauty and the Beast!
-Let's go!

256
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,309
-Let's go, Team Beauty and the Beast!
-Let's go!

257
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,279
Davichi! Davichi! Yeah! Yeah! Damn it.

258
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,982
-Davichi! Davichi!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

259
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,617
All right, here we go.

260
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,551
Ready.

261
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,186
Attention.

262
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,220
Go!

263
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,222
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST VS DAVICHI

264
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,124
MIDPOINT

265
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,260
One, two.

266
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,095
DAVICHI PADDLES IN SYNC

267
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,899
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST DO NOT PADDLE IN SYNC

268
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,736
WITH THE POWER OF IN-SYNC PADDLING,
DAVICHI ADVANCES

269
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,205
-Faster!
-You got this!

270
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,240
SURPRISINGLY, THEY'RE NECK AND NECK

271
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,543
SHE SLIPS

272
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,979
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST GAINS MOMENTUM

273
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,749
BUT THEY PERFECTLY MAINTAIN THEIR TEAMWORK

274
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,718
ARE YOU TWO ON DIFFERENT BOATS?

275
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,220
You have to paddle in sync!

276
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,888
Paddle in sync!

277
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:20,726
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
ARE PUSHED BACK TOO FAR

278
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,028
SHOUTING

279
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,095
SHOUTING

280
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,032
Stop!

281
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,934
Hyuk-jun and Hyeon-seon won!

282
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,769
DAVICHI ADVANCES TO THE FINAL!

283
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,471
I was paddling in sync
with that team's count.

284
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,974
I was going, "One, two, one two."

285
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,877
-That was very thrilling though.
-Wasn't it?

286
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,245
Isn't it awesome?

287
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,714
The boat kept swaying the whole time.

288
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,950
Next up is match two.

289
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,052
-Match two.
-We're Team UJ!

290
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,253
-UJ?
-UJ.

291
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,689
U is from Yu-jin, and J is from Jae-eun.
We're Team UJ.

292
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,357
That's so boring.

293
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,658
BOO

294
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,927
-We're Beauty and the Beast!
-The Beast.

295
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:55,995
STILL OUT OF SYNC

296
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,264
-What about this team?
-We're Team JeongJung.

297
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,865
It means "polite," so we're planning on
politely sending them home.

298
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,400
-It's from Jeong-in and Woo-jung.
-Derived from our names.

299
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,302
That's boring. Boo.

300
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,705
We're Beauty and the Beast!

301
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,673
Want to follow my lead?

302
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,075
I'll follow you.

303
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,476
Ready.

304
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,012
Attention. Go.

305
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,315
UJ PADDLE ACCORDING TO YU-JIN'S COMMAND

306
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,619
THE YOUNGEST KEEPS HER EYES ON WOO-JUNG

307
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,686
AUDITORY VS VISUAL
TEAMWORK MATCH

308
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,254
-They won't budge.
-One, two.

309
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,889
-It's neck and neck.
-One, two.

310
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,859
He's splashing water
into the boat, isn't he?

311
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,929
Yu-jin is just splashing
water into the boat.

312
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,332
MEANWHILE, JEONGJUNG ADVANCES

313
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,034
They're getting pushed a lot.

314
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,137
EYES FIXED ON HIM

315
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,374
WITHOUT THE COMMAND,
THEY SLOWLY FALL OUT OF SYNC

316
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,942
They're getting pushed a lot.

317
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,277
-Stop!
-Stop.

318
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,545
We lost.

319
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,015
JEONGJUNG ADVANCES TO THE FINAL!

320
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,816
Team JeongJung won.

321
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,219
CELEBRATES BY SPLASHING WATER AT THEM

322
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,488
He must've lost his mind!

323
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,823
-We'll move on to the final.
-The final.

324
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,592
What do you expect to achieve?

325
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,061
I'll make them live in the Hangang River.
They won't get out.

326
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,663
-You'll push them in?
-Push them in?

327
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,964
What about you?

328
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,066
I'll shut them up.

329
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,467
You'll shut them up? All right.

330
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,869
-The final.
-Ready.

331
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,671
-Ready!
-Attention.

332
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,406
-Go.
-All right!

333
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,676
DAVICHI USES THEIR LOUD COMMANDS AGAIN

334
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:20,346
JEONGJUNG KEEPS THEIR EYES FOCUSED AGAIN

335
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,849
JEONGJUNG PADDLES WITH GREAT SPEED
IN SILENCE

336
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,718
They're winning by a landslide.

337
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,853
Team JeongJung is doing great.

338
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,855
-One, two.
-Team JeongJung.

339
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,891
Hang in there, Davichi!

340
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,826
-One, two.
-Team JeongJung.

341
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,928
-Oh, my goodness!
-Stop!

342
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,797
Oh, my gosh! They're so powerful!

343
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,132
Team JeongJung won the final!

344
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,267
They won!

345
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,401
Gosh, Team JeongJung.

346
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,837
You didn't even get to take a break
and you won.

347
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,373
All right, come on out first,
Team JeongJung.

348
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,775
Honey, come here.
Let's race for third place.

349
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,911
-Race for third place?
-I like that.

350
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,913
The losing team will get flogged.

351
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,347
I feel like we'll lose.

352
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,882
I don't want to get flogged.

353
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,984
Me neither, but I think we'll lose.

354
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,885
Ready.

355
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,555
Attention. Go.

356
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,691
-One, two.
-One, two.

357
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,326
THE RACE IS CLOSE

358
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,397
-It's neck and neck.
-What's going on?!

359
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,166
ROWING IN SYNC WITH THE COMMAND THIS TIME

360
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,369
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ARE DOING WELL

361
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,207
-They're winning.
-Come on, Davichi!

362
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,376
BUT THEY HAVEN'T LOST THEIR RHYTHM

363
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,178
One, two!

364
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,981
One, two. One…

365
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,516
He's tired.

366
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,917
You're right.

367
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,119
TEAM UJ QUICKLY ADVANCES

368
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,155
-You have 30 seconds left!
-Come on!

369
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,191
THIS TEAM PRACTICALLY GAVE UP PADDLING

370
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,026
-This isn't how it's supposed to go.
-Stop.

371
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,429
Stop. That's enough.

372
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,497
-Did we win?
-We did.

373
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,198
We won? We did?

374
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,267
THE VIKING IS WIPED OUT

375
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,435
You guys get the flogging!

376
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,171
-Honey!
-I'm sorry.

377
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,506
What were you doing?

378
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,442
It felt like I was the only one paddling.

379
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,844
You see what happens?
You start blaming the other person.

380
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,279
Teamwork is important.

381
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,614
I'm all wet.

382
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,515
CLAIMS BAD TEAMWORK

383
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,783
I'm all wet.

384
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,486
My honey and I were not paddling in sync.

385
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,121
But I bet

386
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,290
they were pretty impressed.

387
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,759
I have the blood of a rower
flowing through my veins.

388
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,561
The rhythm, you know?

389
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,695
The paddling rhythm.

390
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,900
The sweat and tears from Misari
definitely paid off.

391
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,134
BUT THEY LOST

392
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,369
What do you want?

393
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,472
HE WAS THE ONE
WHO SUGGESTED GETTING FLOGGED

394
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,439
Here it comes.

395
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,409
SHAKING

396
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,144
SLAP!

397
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,479
SELF-INFLICTED PUNISHMENT

398
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,613
Does it hurt?

399
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,783
-She really hit him.
-She really did it.

400
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,885
I thought she'd hit harder.
She went easy on him.

401
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,288
Where did you go, honey? Come here.

402
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,355
What are you doing there?

403
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,390
ATTEMPT AT HIDING FAILED

404
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,292
YU-JIN STEPS UP

405
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,526
How am I going to do this?

406
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,662
Let's conquer other teams nationwide.

407
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,130
TAP!

408
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:52,965
How kind.

409
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:53,999
ENDS WITH A LIGHT TAP

410
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,568
That was fun.

411
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,571
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
11:00 PADDLING ON AN ACTUAL BOAT

412
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,806
-All right. Let's go!
-Let's go.

413
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,241
TIME TO RIDE ON THE HANGANG RIVER

414
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,776
Let's head out there!

415
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,078
Woo-jung and Defconn can sit in the front.

416
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,047
JAE-EUN TAKES THE DRUM SEAT

417
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:08,948
Hey.

418
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,549
Are you going to drum?

419
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,184
-I'm the drummer.
-The drummer?

420
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,385
You have to listen to her.

421
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,353
I see.

422
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,623
You have to paddle
to the beat of the drum.

423
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,991
Someone is in the back too.

424
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,059
I'm the steersperson.

425
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,026
What's that?

426
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,995
A steersperson guides the direction.

427
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,730
-Oh, so you steer us.
-Yes.

428
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,232
-We have to turn and stuff.
-Right.

429
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,867
The drummer and the steersperson.

430
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,168
And we're slaves.

431
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,369
NODDING?

432
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,338
-We're the crewmen.
-The crewmen.

433
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,039
I see. Okay, got it.

434
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,042
-Captain, what's our course today?
-Oh, our course.

435
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,978
We'll pass Yanghwa Bridge,

436
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,114
go around Seonyudo, and come back.

437
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,649
Let's give it a shot. Are you ready?

438
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,084
-Yes!
-Yes!

439
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,619
You have to cheer like this.

440
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,221
THE MEMBERS KINDLY GO ALONG
WITH EXCITED NEWBIE

441
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,156
You know, I used to be a Viking.

442
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,792
Since I was a Viking,
I'm very excited about this.

443
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,994
Can you push us away?

444
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,128
Pushing the boat away.

445
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,229
Oh, my. We're floating.

446
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,430
We're floating.

447
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,567
We can't fall in.
We'll catch a cold and die.

448
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,836
-Down paddling.
-Down paddling.

449
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,872
OFF TO THE REAL HANGANG RIVER!

450
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,808
-One, two.
-Two.

451
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,310
One.

452
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,078
-Two.
-Two. The rhythm.

453
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,446
-One.
-Three.

454
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,115
Four. We're moving.

455
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,884
THE FORMER VIKING IS AMAZED BY EVERYTHING

456
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,453
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

457
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,821
It's like we're entering a battle.

458
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,759
Everybody, charge!

459
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,395
Increase the speed!

460
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,629
-No, not yet.
-Not yet?

461
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,031
-Not yet? Okay.
-Not yet.

462
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,133
The bridge you see ahead
is Yanghwa Bridge.

463
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,935
Let's take it slowly to Yanghwa Bridge.

464
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,270
-Four, five,
-Four, five,

465
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,973
-six, seven,
-six, seven,

466
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,208
-eight, nine…
-eight, nine…

467
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,977
Compared to rowing,

468
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,079
dragon boating is like--

469
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,048
The paddling must be in sync
on either side.

470
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,316
Keep it in sync up there.

471
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,817
You two must be in sync.

472
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,419
Oh, we're in the front, aren't we?

473
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,689
The first row has to do well.

474
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,424
The front row has to do it the best.

475
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,491
-We do?
-Yes.

476
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,026
We follow your lead.

477
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,127
-Oh, you are?
-Yes.

478
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,730
-If we stop, the boat stops.
-Okay.

479
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,966
-One, two.
-One, two.

480
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,401
ADJUSTING THE SPEED
TO THE BEAT OF THE DRUM

481
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,005
-Five, six, seven…
-Five, six, seven…

482
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,306
-Ten.
-Ten.

483
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,876
THE BOAT ADVANCES SMOOTHLY

484
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,846
All right. We're perfectly in sync!

485
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,348
Newbie is doing well too.

486
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,816
Make some noise!

487
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,851
HE GETS EXCITED AFTER THE COMPLIMENT

488
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,853
-Stop.
-Stop.

489
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,221
YANGHWA BRIDGE

490
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,923
Listen carefully, everybody.

491
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,458
Don't use your arms to paddle.

492
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,425
NEWBIE LECTURES THE SENIORS

493
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,393
Use your back.

494
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,861
You must not be tired right now.

495
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,229
You're talking a lot.

496
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,565
We should go full speed.

497
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,800
We need to show him what it's really like.

498
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,635
Let's paddle like we're competing.

499
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,337
-We'll do it for real.
-Really?

500
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,106
Like we're competing?

501
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,042
-Do you see Seonyu Bridge up ahead?
-Yes.

502
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,677
We'll go all the way there nonstop.

503
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,779
-Attention!
-Attention.

504
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,749
-Go!
-One, two.

505
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:57,716
Three!

506
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,952
-Four!
-The right and left must be in sync!

507
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,287
PADDLING AT FULL SPEED
AS SOON AS THEY START

508
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,091
THE BOAT GOES FASTER
AS THEIR PADDLING BECOMES MORE IN SYNC

509
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,293
Eight, nine, ten.

510
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,862
One, two.

511
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:10,996
We're moving fast!

512
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,598
Let's go!

513
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,900
DOPAMINE EXPLOSION

514
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,469
DRAGON AT FULL SPEED

515
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,238
KEEP GOING

516
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,139
GROANING

517
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,974
GROANING

518
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,675
You're getting tired!

519
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,943
We're only halfway there!

520
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,612
You got this, Defconn!

521
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,846
-You got this!
-You got this!

522
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,348
Let's go, Defconn!

523
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,816
Let's go!

524
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,684
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

525
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,520
WHILE EVERYONE IS ROOTING FOR NEWBIE

526
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,155
Don't rest your arms!

527
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,923
Don't stop!

528
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,726
THE YOUNGEST MEMBER
TRAINS NEWBIE LIKE A SPARTAN

529
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,329
BUT HE CAN'T HEAR THE CHEERS OR CHIDES

530
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,100
THE MEMBERS SHOW HIM
WHAT DRAGON BOATING IS REALLY LIKE

531
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,837
-Seven, eight, nine, ten!
-Seven, eight, nine, ten!

532
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,973
-One, two, three, four.
-We got this!

533
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,109
THEY'RE ALMOST AT SEONYU BRIDGE

534
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,210
-Seven.
-Don't get tired!

535
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,212
Eight, nine…

536
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,848
HE LOST THE ABILITY
TO SPEAK THE HUMAN LANGUAGE

537
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,583
-Count to ten once more! One,
-One,

538
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,319
-two, three, four,
-two, three, four,

539
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,222
-five, six, seven,
-five, six, seven,

540
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,058
-eight, nine, ten.
-eight, nine, ten.

541
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,526
Stop.

542
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,396
-Paddle close to your side.
-Paddle close to your side.

543
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,730
Oh, my gosh!

544
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,132
That was so tough.

545
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,200
I'm drooling.

546
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,535
FRONT ROW FOR HIS DROOL

547
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,004
We'll do down paddling
and take a break after we go around.

548
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,306
HIS PADDLE IS ON PAUSE

549
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,208
-You can't stop paddling.
-Okay.

550
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,876
You can't do that.

551
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,010
DAVICHI KEEPS AN EYE ON HIM

552
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,846
Paddle close to your side.

553
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,749
Come on!

554
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,152
I'm so exhausted!
It's because I'm exhausted.

555
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,854
It's because I'm exhausted.

556
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,456
-This is Seonyudo.
-Seonyudo?

557
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,524
HALFWAY POINT BREAK

558
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,992
Let's take a break here.

559
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,560
Let's take a brief break!

560
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,562
It's cold. Let's warm up our bodies.

561
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,264
Would you like a cup of hot coffee?

562
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,365
How can we drink coffee here?

563
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,000
We call it Davichi Coffee.

564
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,001
Davichi Coffee?

565
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,903
-You drink coffee on this too?
-Of course.

566
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,838
-We even have birthday parties.
-You do?

567
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,739
How?

568
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,608
Whoever has the birthday sits there.

569
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,309
Then we sing the birthday song for them.

570
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,544
-Really?
-Yes.

571
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,946
All of a sudden,
the drum turned into a table.

572
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,816
Let's have a cup of coffee on the boat.

573
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,684
-Have a cup.
-You can't have any if it falls.

574
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,819
Be careful, please.

575
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,089
NATURE'S FLAVOR OF COFFEE MIXED WITH RAIN

576
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,624
I can't believe this worked!

577
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,691
It worked!

578
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,293
OH, MAN

579
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,729
That's so nice.

580
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,197
I'm feeling warm already.

581
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,433
-That's warm.
-Since we have a newbie with us,

582
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,504
-let's hear his impression of this.
-My impression?

583
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,374
-Do it standing up!
-Stand up.

584
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,708
-Stand up.
-Stand up.

585
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,912
NEVER EXPERIENCED HAZING ON A BOAT BEFORE

586
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,380
At first,

587
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,616
I thought this was
nothing more than a leisure sport.

588
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,086
I thought it wouldn't be
too physically demanding.

589
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,089
But when I paddled full speed
along with you all,

590
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,759
it finally felt like I was rowing.

591
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,461
Depending on how fast I go,

592
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,998
I realize it can either be
a leisure sport or a tough sport.

593
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,167
That's right!

594
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,335
All right.

595
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,503
Let us now

596
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,105
return home!

597
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,808
-Charge!
-Charge!

598
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,310
THEN WHERE IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?

599
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,644
Let's go back!

600
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,112
GOING BACK TO THE STARTING POINT

601
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,414
At this point,

602
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,551
if there's someone you have feelings for,

603
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,053
yell, "So-and-so, I love you!"

604
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,354
WITH LOVE, FROM DRAGON BOAT

605
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,655
Tell them how you feel!

606
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,691
Honey, I'm sorry!

607
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,627
Kids, I love you!

608
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,362
What about your wife?

609
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,931
To my wife, get some rest!

610
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,800
I'll take care of the kids.

611
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,869
THE ROMANCIST IS TOUCHED

612
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,072
OUT OF ENERGY

613
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,340
Don't stop!

614
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,542
-Don't stop.
-Why are you taking a break?

615
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,544
"Don't stop. Don't stop."

616
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,614
Look over there!

617
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,515
-Don't stop!
-Don't stop!

618
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,284
THE MEMBERS CAN'T STAND A RESTING PADDLE

619
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,286
Don't stop? My gosh.

620
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,221
Wave to those people.

621
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,390
-Don't stop!
-Don't stop!

622
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,658
"Don't stop."

623
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:00,959
I saw you.

624
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,327
You saw me.

625
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,129
I'm watching you.

626
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:05,897
We're doing well.

627
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,133
I saw that.

628
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,501
We're doing well.

629
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,669
Is your dopamine exploding?

630
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,671
It's not my dopamine that's exploding.

631
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,139
My arm muscles are exploding.

632
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,408
We're almost there.

633
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,378
-I see our home up ahead!
-One!

634
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:20,979
The last spurt!

635
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,181
-Let's go!
-Charge!

636
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,017
SCREAMING

637
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,952
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

638
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,020
PADDLES WITH ALL HIS MIGHT

639
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,521
I think I'm going to vomit.

640
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,589
Stop.

641
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,158
-We've arrived.
-We're back.

642
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,326
COMPLETELY DRAINED

643
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,627
Well done.

644
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,965
Great work, everybody.

645
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,535
Let's never meet again.

646
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,203
You said you'd do it again.

647
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,406
My body aches too much.

648
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,507
LET'S NOT MEET AGAIN

649
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,342
It's a combination of the two.

650
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,778
It's a repeat of fun and exhaustion.

651
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:53,879
It's different.

652
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,480
It's the same Hangang River you see,

653
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,783
but it feels different
when you're paddling on it.

654
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,586
Can you imagine how awesome
it would be on a nice day in the summer?

655
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,056
You should try dragon boating.

656
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,059
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
12:00 WRAP-UP GATHERING

657
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,828
I can't turn my neck right now.

658
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,264
I can't

659
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,166
turn my neck right now.

660
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,901
I can't turn it.

661
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,002
It was fun.

662
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,172
I haven't rowed in over 10 years.

663
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,042
-You definitely get a burst of dopamine.
-Right?

664
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,244
When you enter a competition,

665
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,779
you get an even bigger burst, don't you?

666
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,247
-It's awesome.
-Right?

667
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,883
Before the race,
when they say, "Ready, attention,"

668
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,352
we're all tensed up.

669
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,320
-Your heart races like crazy.
-I know the feeling.

670
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,788
Everybody gets super quiet.

671
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,889
Yeah, it does.

672
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:38,957
THE TENSE STARTING MOMENT

673
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,125
-Are you ready?
-Paddles in.

674
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,626
-Paddles in!
-In!

675
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,228
Attention!

676
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,262
TENSE

677
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,697
That tension is the best part.

678
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,765
-It is.
-Of course.

679
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,633
While Joong-keun
works as the steersperson,

680
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,001
he'd say, "You got this!" to me.

681
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,169
-Then I'd become more alert.
-Yeah.

682
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,005
-We'd paddle harder.
-He'd root for the others too.

683
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,707
I saw footage of our race.

684
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,076
-We had started off in third place.
-Okay.

685
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,412
But we started closing the gap

686
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,215
and the moment we passed them
was caught on video.

687
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,951
I still watch that clip.

688
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:06,985
-I get chills even now.
-It was insane.

689
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,322
HARANG'S BOAT WAS IN 3RD PLACE

690
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,990
Let's go!

691
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,692
3RD PLACE

692
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,594
2ND PLACE

693
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,231
WITH THE CHEERING, THEY SUDDENLY SPEED UP

694
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,732
1ST PLACE

695
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,234
Just a little more, Harang!

696
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,337
CHEERING

697
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,339
Wow! We're in first place!

698
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,141
There's a pretty big gap.

699
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,044
CROSSING THE FINISH LINE

700
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,312
THEIR COME-FROM-BEHIND WIN!

701
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,548
When the dragon's head
passes the finish line,

702
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,884
the gap between the first and second
is less than a second.

703
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,852
-We shout like crazy to each other.
-We do.

704
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,920
Hang in there!

705
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,021
-That's right.
-So exciting.

706
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,724
-You give it your all at the end.
-Exactly.

707
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,325
That's the best part.

708
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,394
-It's the most thrilling moment.
-Yes, it is.

709
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,497
If our schedules line up,
let's do it together.

710
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,099
-Seriously?
-Yes.

711
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,333
-We'll go hard.
-Yes.

712
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,468
-Hard?
-Yes.

713
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,539
-Since you said you'll come back…
-Here's a gift for you.

714
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,207
-This is for you.
-It's for next time.

715
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,408
Bring it with you.

716
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,743
You can paddle with that.

717
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,012
Wait, why did you give me this as a gift?

718
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,313
I want a carbon fiber one.

719
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,881
HEHE

720
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,116
You start with a wooden one.

721
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,284
My goodness.

722
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,420
-You all wrote a message on it.
-We did.

723
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,923
"I lost the 300 m race,
but I won the 100 m one.

724
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,758
Please come back again.

725
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,993
Let's enter a race together.
From Jeong-in."

726
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,695
My goodness.

727
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,530
They kept saying, "Don't stop!"

728
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,098
My heart was racing so fast.

729
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,836
I got that same feeling from
when I entered the rowing race at Misari.

730
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,604
I felt a rush. It was amazing.

731
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,339
When we go to local
or international races,

732
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,042
we get to race
in that region's water and mountains.

733
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,978
It's nice that we get to experience that.

734
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,248
It's the best feeling
when you rest after giving it your all.

735
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,385
And looking at Hangang Park
from the water is really relaxing.

736
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,355
That moment makes me
the happiest and is the most fun.

737
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,491
