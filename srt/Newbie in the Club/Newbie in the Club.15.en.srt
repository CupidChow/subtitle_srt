00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,377
Hello, Netflix Club members
around the world.

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,413
I'm Defconn, the newbie
who's crazy about clubs.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,082
This is a club I never imagined existed.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:21,321
I'll be going to a drawing club
that's like a calm and quiet wave.

6
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,324
I haven't drawn in ages.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,126
I think it's been about 30 years.

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,927
That's a really long time, right?

9
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,565
I haven't drawn anything
since elementary school.

10
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,567
I'd like to smile all the time.

11
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,503
So I drew a smiley face.

12
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,304
He's called Miley.

13
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,372
The "S" is silent.

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,440
Miley.

15
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,575
Let's say hello to the president

16
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:43,910
and get to know the club.

17
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,678
Come with me.

18
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,414
Always be smiley.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,050
COME AND GET A (S)MILEY

20
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,419
Hello, nice to meet you.

21
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,522
-Hello.
-Yes. Hello, members.

22
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:56,990
-Where's the president?
-Here.

23
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,058
All right.

24
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,125
Nice to meet you.

25
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,560
-Hello.
-Hello.

26
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:01,628
BAE HYUN-JI / PRESIDENT

27
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,596
I brought some macarons for you.

28
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,765
-Wow!
-Thank you!

29
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,169
A FEW MACARONS ARE ENOUGH
TO MAKE THEM HAPPY

30
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,104
What is the name of your club?

31
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,107
Our club is called Bu Doong Bu Doong.

32
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,042
-It's called Bu Doong Bu Doong?
-Yes.

33
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,143
As in, warmly embracing.

34
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,479
Even if you can't draw well,
we embrace you.

35
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,247
Rather than drawing professionally,

36
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,216
it's a place
where you can chat with others…

37
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,151
-Oh.
-…and be comforted as well.

38
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,687
-Like therapy.
-We do a variety of things.

39
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,189
Wouldn't "cradle" be better?

40
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,256
DUMBFOUNDED BY THE OUTDATED WORD

41
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,324
Isn't "cradle" better?

42
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,693
You can cradle them with their drawings.

43
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,096
Then, it'll sound too old.

44
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,766
Then, what is the schedule
for your club today?

45
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,403
We'll divide the time up
into Doongji 1 and Doongji 2.

46
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,240
In Doongji 1, we draw something
based on the theme I choose.

47
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,642
-Today's theme is reincarnation.
-Reincarnation?

48
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,377
Yes, so we can draw

49
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,180
-what we would like to be reborn as.
-Okay.

50
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,150
Then, we'll guess what we drew later.

51
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,618
-That sounds nice.
-Yes.

52
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,420
-We can use our imagination.
-Right.

53
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,788
-We draw on this?
-Yes.

54
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,424
-We draw on a postcard-sized paper?
-Yes.

55
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,593
I thought we'd use an easel.

56
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,128
I thought you'd use something big.
I guess not.

57
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,630
No, it isn't big.

58
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,798
Nice.

59
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,435
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
11:30 DOONGJI 1 DRAWING

60
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,004
Reincarnation. Gosh.

61
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,440
Would you like to be reincarnated?

62
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,609
No, I'd like to enjoy
my current life more.

63
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,944
IMPRESSED

64
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,248
Don't you have something
you feel like is lacking in this life?

65
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,483
That's why someone
usually dreams of being reborn.

66
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,520
-Really?
-Things that you didn't get to do.

67
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,789
-I think I want to start over.
-Yes.

68
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,758
Why do you want to start over?

69
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,728
I want to be better-looking.

70
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,862
STIRRED

71
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,264
-You're pretty now, though.
-Why?

72
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,398
You look good.

73
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,766
-You're pretty now.
-Yes.

74
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,967
I didn't say it was my face.

75
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,502
OH

76
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,770
I'd like to be taller.

77
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,838
-Your figure?
-Yes.

78
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,506
No, you look good now.

79
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,241
ENDS WITH PRAISES AS EXPECTED

80
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,478
I don't think I've ever thought
I want to be reincarnated.

81
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,647
I've been living my current life

82
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,849
so fiercely every day, like it's a battle.

83
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,350
Don't you want to live

84
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,852
a comfortable life

85
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,620
-in your next life?
-That wouldn't be bad.

86
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:12,926
I got it.

87
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,727
I got it now.

88
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,429
INSPIRED AFTER CHATTING
WITH THE MEMBERS

89
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,032
Gosh. How do I draw a jet plane?

90
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,099
A jet plane?

91
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,001
You want to be reborn as a jet plane?

92
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,704
What are you dreaming about
that you want to be a jet plane?

93
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,772
-Big dream.
-How complex.

94
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,507
Big dream.

95
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,076
HE SQUEEZES HIS BIG DREAM
ONTO THE SMALL PAPER

96
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:35,315
THE OTHER MEMBERS' DREAMS
ARE FILLING THE DRAWING PAPER TOO

97
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:39,819
EVERYONE IS SILENTLY IMMERSED
IN THEIR OWN WORLDS

98
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,422
It's calmer than other clubs, isn't it?

99
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,790
-I love it so much.
-Right?

100
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:44,924
I love it.

101
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,759
Nice way to unwind.

102
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,095
TODAY'S CLUB IS ALL ABOUT
ENJOYING CALMLY WHILE SEATED

103
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,196
Also,

104
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,299
you become calm
as you chat with the members.

105
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,501
This is what I expected.

106
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,769
You are like Seokchon Lake.

107
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,371
-Seokchon Lake?
-Oh, Seokchon Lake.

108
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,873
You are like the ducks
floating on Seokchon Lake.

109
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,677
You don't seem to have any worries.

110
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,546
It puts one at ease.

111
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,881
-So the president runs this club.
-Yes.

112
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,417
Who is next in…

113
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,652
CAN'T MULTITASK

114
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,921
I created this club with our manager.

115
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:15,989
-The manager?
-Yes.

116
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,223
How did you two meet?

117
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,828
-We first met in another drawing club.
-I see.

118
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,329
And now we're dating.

119
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,764
Oh! I knew it.

120
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,499
I'm a dating-show pro.

121
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,634
NEWBIE'S FAVORITE INTEREST

122
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,335
I got a feeling!

123
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,205
-I was just focused on drawing.
-Okay.

124
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,574
But even when I drew a little,
he would compliment me.

125
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,143
-He bombarded you with compliments.
-Yes.

126
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,245
-He's Mr. Compliments.
-Mr. Compliments?

127
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,180
-Yes, I am.
-You're Mr. Compliments.

128
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,283
I love talking about this.

129
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,518
I love talking about these topics

130
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,654
-at clubs.
-It's embarrassing.

131
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,224
BU DOONG BU DOONG'S
HEART-MELTING LOVE STORY

132
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,325
How nice.

133
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,961
COLORING

134
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,263
I wanted to draw a blue sky,

135
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,199
but I can't seem to do it.
It looks like a shooting star.

136
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,335
-Rub it with a tissue.
-How?

137
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,836
-Like this?
-Rub hard.

138
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:04,904
-Like this?
-Yes.

139
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,105
Oh, okay.

140
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,007
-So that's how you do it.
-Yes.

141
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,276
-You can use it like pastel.
-I see.

142
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,811
Is this the tissue technique?

143
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,080
-Tissue technique.
-What technique?

144
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,381
Let's call it that.

145
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,449
EVEN NONSENSE IS EMBRACED

146
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,284
Nice. Very nice.

147
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,585
Did you ever touch hands

148
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,287
while grabbing something?

149
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,056
Nothing like that?

150
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,991
I think it happened here.

151
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,226
SCANNING

152
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,428
You two are dating.

153
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,396
EXPOSED

154
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,464
He got you.

155
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,933
-You two are dating.
-How did you figure that out?

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,401
You spoke informally to him,

157
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,104
and then, he complimented you.

158
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,006
He's definitely a pro.

159
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,274
-He's a dating-show pro.
-Yes.

160
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,542
He heard all of it.

161
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,609
I had no idea.

162
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,614
If you are done drawing,
show us and explain it.

163
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,452
-Shall we guess Sung-won's first?
-All right.

164
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,921
It's too obvious.

165
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,024
-What could this be?
-It looks like you.

166
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,226
I like to draw straightforwardly.

167
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,529
You want to be a sloth
and do nothing in your next life.

168
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,698
Did she get ity?

169
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,799
Yes.

170
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,934
EASY PEASY

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,037
-But it's a little different.
-Is it?

172
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,705
It's not that I want to do nothing.

173
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,107
-You want a slow life.
-I'd like

174
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,742
a slow and leisurely life.

175
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,244
Like the sloth civil servant in Zootopia.

176
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,079
-The sloth civil servant.
-Yes.

177
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,215
BRIEFLY SHOWING OFF
SLOTH MIMICKING SKILLS

178
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,084
A sloth moves at its own pace.

179
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,520
Just as I've lived a busy life
at a human pace,

180
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,088
I could live by sloth speed

181
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,290
if I were born as a sloth.

182
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,426
-That's a good portrait of a sloth.
-Yes.

183
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,062
He draws that well every time?

184
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,363
-Yes.
-His drawings

185
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,199
are often even better than that
that you want to keep for yourself.

186
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,568
We didn't draw for that long,

187
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,971
but he did an amazing job. He's very good.

188
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,205
Our youngest.

189
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,407
Ms. Youngest.

190
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,342
Everyone did so well.

191
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,977
How cute.

192
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:52,879
-Gosh.
-A cat.

193
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,013
How cute.

194
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,448
-It's so cute.
-But…

195
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,216
Look at the angle.

196
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,285
It's in a box and going, "Meow."

197
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,353
Meow.

198
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,954
-That's what it seems.
-You're right.

199
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,191
But it looks like a stray cat
rather than a rich family's cat.

200
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,259
You're right.

201
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,762
But there's a reason why
I chose to draw a stray cat.

202
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,799
I thought it would be better
to meet a variety of owners.

203
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,567
-I see.
-I would be

204
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,769
reborn as a smart cat

205
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,970
and make my own choice.

206
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,007
"The owner didn't abandon me.
I left them."

207
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,575
You spelled it wrong, though.

208
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,510
It's "Take me" not "Taik me."

209
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,946
Cats wouldn't know how to spell things.

210
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,414
IF THE PRESIDENT SAYS SO

211
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,782
Oh, because I'm a cat…

212
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,850
That was smart.

213
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,718
-It's a cat's writing.
-Yes.

214
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,287
NEXT UP

215
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,955
Ji-yeon. What's that?

216
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,490
-It's a tree.
-Yes.

217
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,791
You want to be a tree…

218
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,859
-I know.
-Oh, my.

219
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,494
-But the leaves are different colors.
-Wow.

220
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,529
Do you think you can get it?

221
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,300
You want to be a big tree
that the sloth can hang onto?

222
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,202
NEWBIE'S KIND OF ANSWER

223
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,439
A big tree
that the sloth can hang onto?

224
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,740
I WILL BE YOUR TREE

225
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,009
Look at these two.

226
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,378
There's a reason I want to be a tree.

227
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,315
You have to accomplish something
living as a human.

228
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,217
You have to make money,

229
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,585
be good to your parents,

230
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,788
and things like that.
There are roles we have to fulfill.

231
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,022
But when you become a tree,

232
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,290
you blossom in the spring,

233
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,259
grow leaves in the summer,

234
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,394
change colors in the fall,
and then, drop leaves.

235
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,398
I'd like to live
according to the flow of time.

236
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,000
Put it next to the sloth.

237
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,401
THE TREE-SLOTH UNIVERSE

238
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,803
-It's perfect.
-Like this?

239
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,871
That's why--

240
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,572
-Is the sloth there if you zoom in?
-Yes.

241
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,041
-Oh, it's here somewhere?
-Yes, if you zoom in.

242
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,343
DESTINED TO MEET AGAIN?

243
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,477
Your boyfriend…

244
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,979
OH, MY

245
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,814
When did you accept him as your boyfriend?

246
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,515
-Accept him?
-Yes.

247
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,050
-He said he liked me first.
-I did.

248
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,320
-We went to see flowers together.
-Flowers?

249
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,689
-We don't just draw here.
-Okay.

250
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,259
When the weather is nice,
we go to a lake park

251
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,027
and draw on a picnic mat.

252
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,162
In the fall, we go hiking

253
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,164
and draw at the top of the mountain.

254
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,267
Oh, my. It's too wholesome.

255
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,636
EVEN THEIR OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES
ARE WHOLESOME

256
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,939
They're so wholesome that
I feel cleansed just by talking to them.

257
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,777
Everyone did such a good job
with their drawing

258
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,380
-that I'm embarrassed to show mine.
-You did a good job.

259
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,215
Isn't that a marriage proposal?

260
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,350
It looks like you're passing something on.

261
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,053
You used to be the receiver,
but you want to be the giver?

262
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,488
AMAZED

263
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,689
Nice interpretation.

264
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:17,924
I'll give you a hint.

265
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,059
You all did something you'd enjoy,
but mine is…

266
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,193
-Sad?
-Is it sad?

267
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,428
A family moment?

268
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,797
ALREADY SAD

269
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,265
Oh, that's it.

270
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,302
Since you received a lot
from your parents in this life,

271
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,170
you'd like to be their parents

272
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,939
and give them
many things in your next life.

273
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,373
-That's right.
-Oh, my!

274
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,743
-You love your family.
-How touching.

275
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,811
So touching.

276
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:39,912
How did you draw it?

277
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,914
-My name is Bo-ra.
-Bo-ra.

278
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:46,586
The purple person is me,
and the yellow person is my parents.

279
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,355
In our next lives,
I'd like to be their parent

280
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,091
and I'd like them to be born
as my daughter and son.

281
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,826
That's what I'd like.

282
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,829
Do you think you received
a lot from your parents in this life?

283
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,731
I could never repay them
for what I received.

284
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,133
SO TOUCHING

285
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,202
It isn't easy to say that, right?

286
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,106
-That was so touching.
-Yes.

287
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,942
The fact that she thought
about her parents means

288
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,177
that they are very close.

289
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,979
THEY'VE BECOME SOLEMN
AT THE THOUGHT OF THEIR PARENTS

290
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,414
-It's your turn.
-Yes, it's my turn, isn't it?

291
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,482
I'm rooting for you.

292
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,353
I thought I ought to live
this good a life in my next life.

293
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,721
Shall we try to guess?

294
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,557
What's that?

295
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,625
FOCUSED

296
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,059
If I am reborn,

297
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,862
I will definitely learn English.

298
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,631
-English? He wants to travel
-Yes. Then,

299
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,099
-the world?
-I'll go to Hollywood.

300
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,103
I was so envious of Leonardo DiCaprio.

301
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,105
He'd always rent a boat

302
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,407
and throw parties on it!

303
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,076
-How awesome.
-After working hard,

304
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,646
I'll have parties on my boat, fly on jets,

305
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,748
and get supplies from a helicopter.

306
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,182
TITLE: PARTY ON A BOAT

307
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,784
-It's very specific.
-Yes.

308
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,988
Of course, I am quite satisfied
with my current life as well.

309
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,523
I'm grateful for it.

310
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,892
If I were to be reincarnated,

311
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,628
I'd like to experience
something like this, at least.

312
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,130
That's what I was thinking.

313
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,232
Just like Gatsby.

314
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,802
If you're going to be reborn,
you might as well live like this.

315
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:10,903
Our president is up.

316
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,905
-It's so much pressure.
-You're up, President.

317
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,808
You'd expect the president
to draw the best.

318
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,010
-But I think mine's the worst.
-No.

319
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,112
-You drew so well.
-You did such a good job.

320
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,180
It's cute.

321
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,282
THERE, THERE
YOU DID SUCH A GREAT JOB

322
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,518
You did an amazing job.

323
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,585
It's cute.

324
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,789
When we read webtoons
or watch animated movies,

325
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,125
the character is hit by a car
and wakes up in an alternate universe.

326
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,226
An alternate universe.

327
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,995
Maybe I could end up
in an alternate universe.

328
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,532
I'd like to be the youngest daughter
who is clueless about everything

329
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,033
and is doted upon.

330
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,234
YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF A NOBLE

331
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,636
A young noble lady.

332
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,371
-A young lady?
-I see.

333
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,406
I'd have a lovely teatime

334
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,742
-and eat cakes.
-How nice.

335
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,645
This is my dog.
We would be reincarnated together.

336
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,047
He would even know how to speak.

337
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,683
-It's like that in animated movies.
-Since it's an alternate universe?

338
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,019
I dream about a life like that.

339
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,221
-Very nice.
-How cute.

340
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,689
Most of you

341
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,193
seem to want your next life
to be free of worries

342
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,129
and want to live
a comfortable, relaxed life.

343
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,430
That's what you desire.

344
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,433
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
13:00 DOONGJI 2 DRAWING

345
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,136
TAKING A BRIEF BREAK

346
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,505
Open up.

347
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,173
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

348
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,241
RETURNING THE FORK

349
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,676
Thank you.

350
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,811
-She helped him out by his side.
-That's right.

351
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,814
-She touched up his drawing.
-She helped him out with his drawing.

352
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,516
Isn't this what camaraderie is?

353
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,751
Members must get along.

354
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,885
He's right.

355
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,987
-Shall we begin Doongji 2?
-Yes.

356
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,923
You will draw the answer
to the question you get

357
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,160
from the question card,
and then, present it like before.

358
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,629
We'll give the new member
a chance to pick one.

359
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,897
-Pick one?
-Pick one.

360
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,065
-One of those three?
-Yes.

361
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,800
-The one in the middle.
-The middle one.

362
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,301
Please read it to us.

363
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,671
What is it?

364
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,673
"What comes to mind
when you look in the mirror?"

365
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,942
WHAT COMES TO MIND
WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR?

366
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,012
-How profound.
-Oh, man.

367
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,883
AGAIN, THE PEACEFUL
DRAWING TIME BEGINS

368
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,591
DRAWS DOONGJI 2
WHILE SIPPING TEA

369
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,363
GIGGLING

370
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,431
I really can't draw animals.

371
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,700
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

372
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,202
I laughed too hard.

373
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,270
Don't mock me.

374
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,371
CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH

375
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,039
-But it's so cute.
-It's cute.

376
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,741
-It's cute.
-It's so cute.

377
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,809
GOES BACK TO COMPLIMENTING

378
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,710
By the way, of all the clubs out there,

379
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,679
why did you choose a drawing club?

380
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,215
I used to be in another club,

381
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:40,252
but I felt lonely after I left that club.

382
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,121
What was the other club?

383
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,322
It was a social gathering.

384
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,224
Oh, a social gathering.

385
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,093
But it really wasn't my thing.

386
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,328
Was it overwhelming?

387
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,730
It was overwhelming to deal with people.

388
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,798
-You got exhausted.
-Yes.

389
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,501
It would be tough for an introvert
to be in a club like that.

390
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,569
Right.

391
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,604
Most of you don't seem like extroverts.

392
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,139
-I see a lot of introverts.
-I saw

393
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,540
the gathering of this club

394
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,542
at a cafe twice.

395
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,177
I always drew by myself,

396
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,146
but then I saw these people
having fun, drawing.

397
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,783
I thought that this would be
my last chance to speak to them,

398
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,153
so I asked if I could join the club
and that's how I ended up here.

399
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,855
-He asked you directly?
-Yes.

400
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,423
It was like street casting.

401
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,490
THE BRAVE GETS THE CLUB

402
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,726
It was as if you were drawn
to them like a magnet.

403
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,728
Thankfully,
he had a nice impression of us,

404
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,697
so even his younger brother joined.

405
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,998
-His younger brother?
-Yes.

406
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,499
He brought him along.

407
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,968
But you don't look alike at all.

408
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,971
So that's why you're brothers.

409
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,038
DIFFERENT FACES, SAME HOBBY

410
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:37,176
After my first time here,
I felt so relaxed.

411
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,311
So I try to come by as often as I can.

412
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,379
ACTIVE BROTHER MEMBERS

413
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,182
My perception about
the drawing club has changed.

414
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,886
What is required to qualify as a member?

415
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,521
We're open and embrace everyone,

416
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,390
but there's an age cut-off.

417
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,758
-Age cut-off?
-Actually…

418
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,960
CAN'T EMBRACE AGE

419
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,028
You kept that quiet.

420
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,096
HEALED HEART HAS BEEN BROKEN

421
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,364
That's the only thing.

422
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,933
Okay, Bo-ra.

423
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,301
-Wow!
-Wow.

424
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,203
-How pretty.
-How cute.

425
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,437
-Mirror on a cushion foundation.
-Yes.

426
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,172
-The mirror on a cushion foundation?
-Wow.

427
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,209
We see orange mirrors
on the street, don't we?

428
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,610
A convex mirror.

429
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,013
Oh, the convex mirror for parking.

430
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,917
I look in the mirror
so many times a day.

431
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:21,020
I look at it while I'm on the street
or use my phone as the mirror too.

432
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,188
That's how I am.

433
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,858
But on my way here, I thought,

434
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,527
"I'm heading to our club meeting.
Does my makeup look good?"

435
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,729
I checked myself while thinking that.

436
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,966
So this is me with my makeup on.

437
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,034
TITLE: CHECK MY FACE

438
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,438
I always wished that I had a pretty smile.

439
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,507
BUT YOU ARE PRETTY NOW

440
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,576
You look happiest
when you're smiling, right?

441
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,980
So I was hoping
that my smile appeared pretty.

442
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,281
-It's pretty.
-It's what I hope.

443
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,516
-Your smile's pretty.
-It is.

444
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,583
It's so pretty.

445
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,985
You already have a pretty smile.

446
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,186
-You're lovely.
-I'm embarrassed.

447
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,254
You're so pretty.

448
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,256
Oh, I'm sorry.

449
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,524
IN FRONT OF HER BOYFRIEND

450
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,659
I kept saying she was pretty
in front of you. I'm sorry.

451
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:01,727
But it's true.

452
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,096
THEY ALWAYS END WITH COMPLIMENTS

453
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,297
You look so pretty.

454
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,532
What's that?

455
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,900
-It's a piano.
-It's a piano.

456
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,135
He drew so many things.
They look like hobbies.

457
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,104
This is inside the mirror, right?

458
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:17,376
In the morning, I see various versions
of myself in a mirror.

459
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,577
Then, what about the piano?

460
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,680
-I've done everything in the picture.
-You've done all of them?

461
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,549
What are they? Drawing, piano, and…

462
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,085
You can see me playing the piano,

463
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,920
playing the flute, rolling a bowling ball,

464
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,154
doing kendo,

465
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,590
drawing, and cheerleading.

466
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,592
You love trying out different hobbies.

467
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,730
-You mean clubs?
-He seems to love joining clubs.

468
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,166
You can see your actual self in a mirror,

469
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,935
but you can also draw your future.

470
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,670
-Right.
-So this is

471
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,271
-myself in the mirror.
-How cute.

472
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,107
How cute. You did an amazing job.

473
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,975
-I'm wearing a crown.
-Yes.

474
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,710
I've entered this field…

475
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,912
You want to become the best.

476
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,014
I ought to reach the top.

477
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,649
That's what I hope for.

478
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,718
-Age doesn't matter.
-Exactly.

479
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,621
I've been on TV for some time now,

480
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,423
but it's only been three to four years

481
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,258
since I've started getting so much love.

482
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,326
-Really?
-Before that,

483
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,029
I was slowly building myself up.

484
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,631
-All of a sudden, you got popular?
-Exactly.

485
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,434
My popularity soared
about three to four years ago.

486
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,437
So lately, I have been

487
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,872
thinking,

488
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,473
"I wish this chance had come in my 20s."

489
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,441
FADING STAMINA

490
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,509
-Your energy can't…
-Yeah.

491
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,576
You're busy too.

492
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,712
There's a limit to what I can handle now.

493
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,614
Yes, so,

494
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,815
I wish that

495
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,950
I could have Superman-like energy.

496
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,587
In the end, you need to have
a healthy mind and strong body

497
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,957
to make many people laugh.

498
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,192
The puppy next to me is…

499
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,760
I've been feeling lonely lately.

500
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,463
I've been lonely,

501
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,466
so I'd like to meet someone
whose face looks like a puppy's.

502
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,767
Not just a puppy?

503
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,335
-No, not a puppy.
-Not a puppy.

504
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,504
A cute face like a puppy's. Woof!

505
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,809
I'd like to meet someone whose face
is like a cute puppy's.

506
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,178
That's what I'm hoping for.

507
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,979
It's a mirror anyway. It's not real.

508
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,047
IT WON'T BE EASY TO FIND

509
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,215
-That is all.
-Nice.

510
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,883
That was cool.

511
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,984
ENDS WITH GIRLFRIEND SEARCH

512
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,053
-It was your first time here.
-Yes.

513
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,856
I'm curious about
what you think of our club.

514
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,658
It felt like walking on grass.

515
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,027
-Grass?
-It has been so long. Yes.

516
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,062
We don't get to walk
on grass often, do we?

517
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,464
We only walk on paved roads.

518
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,633
We live intense lives
with our busy schedules,

519
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,502
but today felt like

520
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,139
walking on green grass
with bare feet for a change.

521
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,808
I felt that kind of softness today.

522
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,680
-I think you're the perfect person for us.
-What?

523
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,949
Even though you can't draw well…

524
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,050
Oh, my!

525
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,186
-You aren't exactly skillful,
-Okay.

526
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:45,090
but you can share a lot
of your thoughts and stories here.

527
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,226
The stories behind your drawings
are very rich.

528
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,495
My real drawings are with my words.

529
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,796
I draw with my words.

530
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,831
Do you guys have
an after-session gathering?

531
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,267
When we have a new member,

532
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,503
-we take some time to observe them.
-So,

533
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,570
did this ever happen?

534
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,972
You went with a new member,

535
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,441
but they ended up being really annoying?

536
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,644
Not really. But if we go for drinks
when a new member joins,

537
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,747
they may think
the actual goal of this club is drinking.

538
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,183
-I see.
-We want to avoid such biases,

539
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,284
so we wait a bit longer.

540
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,652
So this is the after-session gathering.

541
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,420
-Right. We have cake.
-We'll eat cake.

542
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,690
Anyway, thank you so much, everyone.

543
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,858
Open up.

544
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,627
YUM

545
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,228
Thanks for helping me
with the smiley face.

546
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,429
ALWAYS ASSISTING THE YOUNGEST

547
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,797
It was relaxing.

548
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:26,865
It really was.

549
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,934
I felt like I had a good rest.

550
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:33,038
The members keep engaging me
in conversations.

551
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,174
THEY EVEN DANCE

552
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,177
And they react well to what I say.
I like that.

553
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,245
As long as you have hands,

554
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,215
you can draw, regardless of your ability.

555
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,284
If you'd like to relax

556
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,386
and converse comfortably with others,

557
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:51,356
and if you're looking for inspiration,
this would be good for you.

558
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,492
BU DOONG BU DOONG
BUPYEONG AND BUCHEON

559
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,760
1. SENTIMENTALITY
2. ENTHUSIASM

560
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,361
3. MIGHT GRAB HANDS
INSTEAD OF COLOR PENCILS

561
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,763
