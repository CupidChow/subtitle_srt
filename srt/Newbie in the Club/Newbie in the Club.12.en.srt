00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,638
Hello, Netflix Club members.
How has your week been?

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,008
Each week, I observe clubs
with the eyes of a bird.

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,777
I'm Defconn,
the newbie who's crazy about clubs.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,714
Hello, I'm Lee Si-an
who's still crazy about being hip.

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,182
Isn't it your second time, Si-an?

7
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,951
-Yes, it is.
-Why are you here again?

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,388
From what I heard, you said
you almost froze to death on your way back

9
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,822
after riding the motorcycle

10
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,190
-last time.
-Well, yes.

11
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,825
That's why I'm back.

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,928
I felt like bikes weren't really my thing,

13
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,865
so I plan on tagging along for a while

14
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,467
to find the perfect club for me.

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,704
I hope you find
the perfect club for you, Si-an.

16
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,639
The club that we'll observe

17
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,009
is a club that sips
on heavenly flavors, the droplet of gods,

18
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,246
We've come to a wine club.

19
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,147
SPOTS THE PRESIDENT

20
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,982
-Hello.
-You must be the president.

21
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,916
Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,620
I'm the president of About Wine.
My name is Choi Joo-young.

23
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:54,921
What are your nicknames?

24
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,790
My nickname? I'm Newbie.

25
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,058
-Newbie and?
-Yes.

26
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,793
-I'm Hip Newbie.
-I thought so.

27
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,594
-She's Hip Newbie.
-Like this.

28
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,763
Do all of you use nicknames, then?

29
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,565
All of us do use nicknames

30
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,368
as it provides
a good conversation topic in the beginning

31
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,504
-and using our own names can be awkward.
-I can see that.

32
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,572
That's right.

33
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,941
How long has your club been around?

34
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,944
We started our club in 2022.

35
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:22,148
At that time,
we started this club because we wanted

36
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,751
to drink various wines together.

37
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,252
But it turned out

38
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,821
sipping some wine could lead…

39
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,055
-To falling in love?
-Yes.

40
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,557
Feelings were developed

41
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,692
and it became a mecca
for those seeking love.

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,961
-That's the club we became.
-What?

43
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,030
There are countless relationships

44
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,631
and quite a lot got married.

45
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,699
-What?
-A lot?

46
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,802
-Really?
-My friend met her mate here

47
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,004
-and will get married soon.
-Oh, really?

48
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,340
You don't go to Paradise here?

49
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,909
SI-AN'S PERSPECTIVE IS STILL SET
ON COUPLES GOING TO PARADISE

50
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,112
-Let's go to the center. Come this way.
-Okay.

51
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,179
DUCK, HIP NEWBIE,
NEWBIE, GOD SEONG

52
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,182
WAITING FOR THE MEMBERS
AT THEIR ASSIGNED SEATS

53
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,617
Someone's here.

54
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,018
-Hello.
-Hello.

55
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,386
Let me take you to your seat.

56
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,654
What's your nickname?

57
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,656
-I'm God Seong.
-God Seong.

58
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,227
You can sit in the middle
since you came early.

59
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,096
Do you decide where everyone sits?

60
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,164
Yes, that's right.

61
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,265
I seat everybody.

62
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,134
A FEMALE MEMBER ENTERS

63
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,368
-Welcome.
-Hello.

64
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,570
-Welcome.
-What's your nickname?

65
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,506
-Nice to meet you, Toran.
-Nice to meet you.

66
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,573
Isn't it Toran?

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,641
-It's Tora.
-Oh, Tora.

68
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,842
-I see.
-This way, Tora.

69
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,545
OH MY

70
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,647
HA-HA
HA-HA

71
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,316
-What? I've never seen that before.
-What do you mean?

72
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,584
Me neither.

73
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,685
PARROT FLIRTING

74
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,187
Nice to meet you, Tsuna. Where?

75
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,255
How about here?

76
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,789
-Yes, come this way.
-Okay.

77
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,258
-We'll just fill the seats up.
-Hi.

78
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,026
Sorry. I forgot your chair earlier.

79
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,094
LIVELY ATMOSPHERE

80
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,029
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

81
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,164
I feel so lonely.

82
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,298
-Tsuna?
-Yes?

83
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,201
A MAN COMES TO LONELY HIP NEWBIE'S TABLE

84
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,470
This is when it's most awkward.

85
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,539
-Yes, it's very awkward.
-Please be patient.

86
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,575
It'll fill up in no time.
Have a seat here, Duck.

87
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,643
I'm Hip Newbie.

88
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,811
Hip Newbie, nice to meet you.

89
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,879
Are you here by yourself?

90
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:00,980
-Yes, I am.
-I see.

91
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,081
Are you here by yourself?

92
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,550
Yes, I'm here by myself as well.

93
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,919
SHE TOTALLY FORGOT
SHE CAME WITH NEWBIE

94
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,922
-Come and have a seat here, Doosan.
-Nice to meet you.

95
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,423
-Doosan?
-Yes, I'm Doosan.

96
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,526
-Is it because you like Baekdu Mountain?
-No.

97
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,594
It's from Doosan Bears.

98
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,529
-I like baseball.
-I see.

99
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,731
Here's another new person.

100
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,367
CONGNAMOON, SHAVLY

101
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,303
DONGGYODONG

102
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,370
Hello.

103
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,672
-Hello.
-Hello.

104
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,773
Do you live in Donggyo-dong?

105
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,641
That's right. Wait, what? It's my name.

106
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,842
DONGGYODONG / JEONG DONG-GYO

107
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,444
-Really?
-My name is Dong-gyo.

108
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,512
ICEBREAKER NICKNAMES

109
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,013
-That's why.
-Your name is Dong-gyo?

110
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,081
That's right.

111
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,983
MORE MEMBERS CONTINUE TO COME

112
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,518
-Hello.
-Hello.

113
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,652
What's your nickname?

114
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,654
-It's Sugeun Sugeun.
-Sugeun Sugeun?

115
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,790
Our last member is here now.

116
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,092
-Naknak?
-Naknak.

117
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,160
LAST MEMBER IS SEATED

118
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,429
All right. Let's start our gathering.

119
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,165
Can you please give me your attention?

120
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,501
Let me introduce the four wines
that we prepared today

121
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,706
and how our gathering will proceed.

122
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,910
Our first drink, the sweet Spumante,

123
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,780
is a very famous specialty of Italy.

124
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,083
I knew it. I could smell the exhaust

125
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,185
-of a Ferrari. Nice.
-You could tell, right?

126
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,220
There are two things
that are the most important.

127
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,190
Every 30 minutes, we'll be changing tables

128
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,026
so that you can meet everyone here.

129
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,861
-How nice.
-Isn't it?

130
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,197
Take a look at the back of your name tag.

131
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,432
Look at the back of your name tag.

132
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,902
Oh, my. It says,
"Who do you want to contact tomorrow?"

133
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,539
You can write the nicknames
of the two people you want to contact.

134
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,242
The cherry blossoms have bloomed
and the weather is nice.

135
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,744
-Let's go to Seokchon Lake.
-Yes.

136
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,980
It's the kind of weather
where you can enjoy Seokchon Lake.

137
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:45,885
I prepared bottles of wine
for those who match up.

138
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,388
EXACTLY WHAT THE MEMBERS LIKE

139
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,958
Anyway, shall we officially make a toast?

140
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,593
When you clink your wine glasses,

141
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,296
they say you must
make eye contact as you do so.

142
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,730
-Etiquette.
-Make eye contact

143
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,668
and we'll start the gathering by saying,
"Nice to meet you."

144
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:05,271
Look more deeply into the eyes of the one
that left a slightly better impression.

145
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,308
The person you like a little more.

146
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,010
I don't know where to look.

147
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,780
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

148
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,283
Shall we all introduce ourselves?

149
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,319
I'm Sugeun Sugeun.

150
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,020
-What do you do?
-I just

151
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,089
work for the sales team at Ikea.

152
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,190
How old are you?

153
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,992
I think I may be the oldest here.

154
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,593
I was born in 1990.

155
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,062
I'm Sheena.

156
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,129
-Sheena.
-Yes.

157
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,331
I was born in 1988.

158
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,565
-1988?
-Really?

159
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,500
-You're the same age as Joo-young.
-Yes.

160
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,768
You look so young.

161
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,337
You look very young.

162
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,538
CONCEDES THE ELDEST POSITION

163
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,006
Currently, I am

164
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,710
working on my doctorate degree
at Seoul Nation University.

165
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,646
My field is something you may use a lot.

166
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,381
It's in language models like ChatGPT.

167
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,449
How awesome.

168
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,783
-AI?
-The language model field.

169
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,985
Anyway, you are all good-looking,

170
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,954
so why are you all single?

171
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,089
I don't get it.

172
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,492
Honestly, after hitting my 30s,

173
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,128
-the people I could meet became limited.
-It did?

174
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,496
It became harder.

175
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,332
-It got harder?
-I got pickier as well.

176
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,268
I have been having too much fun
hanging out by myself these days.

177
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,603
Oh, you're in trouble.

178
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,638
I got used to being by myself

179
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,008
and that was a wake-up call for me.
I decided I couldn't let this happen.

180
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,144
A person should fall in love
and do things.

181
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:19,912
That's why I'm here.

182
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,748
What's your type, Sugeun Sugeun?

183
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,283
My true, ideal woman would be 158 cm tall.

184
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,919
Someone who could fit
in my arms perfectly.

185
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,789
Me?

186
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,491
-Are you 158 cm?
-Are you?

187
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,892
Really?

188
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,960
OH REALLY?

189
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,262
-But she is older than you.
-Right.

190
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,330
Two years older.

191
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,031
Come on. That's nothing.

192
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,199
What do you think?

193
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,567
Yes.

194
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,936
HE FOUND HIS TYPE RIGHT NEXT TO HIM

195
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,338
-Petite.
-Yes.

196
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,606
And her personality?

197
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,741
-I'd like someone who is cheerful.
-Cheerful?

198
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:49,942
She's cheerful.

199
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,177
CHEERFUL

200
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,378
I like the cheerful type.

201
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,946
You two may get a bottle today.

202
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,750
THE DATING SHOW HOST
SENSES A ROSY ATMOSPHERE

203
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,087
You all should ask each other questions.

204
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,822
I'm not here to host.

205
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,824
I'm a member of this club.

206
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,326
-Join us. What's your type?
-What's your type?

207
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,061
-My type?
-Yes, your type.

208
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,129
IT'S BEEN A WHILE

209
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,031
I think you like women
who have soft features.

210
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,466
-Yes.
-Right?

211
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,501
I thought so,
since you have strong features.

212
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,669
You have strong features.

213
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,704
DIDN'T ASK HIM OUT BUT GOT REJECTED

214
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,906
Shall I move?

215
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,544
Are you doing anything else
to meet people?

216
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,912
I don't really like blind dates.

217
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,149
Because you also have to think
about the one who set it up.

218
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,851
-Yeah.
-I see.

219
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,085
I don't like those meetings.

220
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,987
-You haven't done that many?
-No, I haven't.

221
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,289
-Really?
-It's not my style.

222
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,191
Blind dates never worked out for me.

223
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,194
Have you been on many?

224
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,097
I think blind dates are tough.

225
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,165
They really are.

226
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,767
You're one-on-one with that person.

227
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,436
I think the best way is
to meet someone in a casual setting.

228
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,238
THEY FOCUS ON THEIR OWN CHAT

229
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,539
I saw a bit of a spark.

230
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,808
And they're drinking wine.

231
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,612
You have no choice
but to develop feelings for someone.

232
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,215
I guarantee it. There will be one today.

233
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,017
Then, in order to feel comfortable
with one another quickly,

234
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,352
let's speak informally.

235
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,187
-I like that.
-Right? Don't you think so?

236
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,022
-Isn't that right?
-Let's discuss

237
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,492
things like our types.

238
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,559
Shall I start?

239
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,461
Tell us your type and other things.

240
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,965
I like someone who's tall and considerate.

241
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,967
My nickname is Duck

242
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,369
and I'm an elementary school teacher.

243
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,937
How awesome.

244
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,406
Don't you get a lot of blind dates?
Why are you here?

245
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:31,511
The community of teachers is rather small,
so I feel cautious about meeting someone.

246
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,347
I prefer meeting completely new
and various people.

247
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,414
That's why I'm here.

248
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,283
Why do you call yourself Duck?

249
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,386
Elementary school teachers
use call-and-responses.

250
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,188
I typically make duck sounds for that.

251
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,156
-Show us.
-Can you show us?

252
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,491
Please show us.

253
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,393
QUACK QUACK

254
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,630
THE WINE BAR TURNS INTO A BARNYARD

255
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,697
That was good.

256
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,233
I get the children's attention with that.

257
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,434
IT WORKS ON ADULTS TOO

258
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,271
I work as a firefighter.

259
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,873
I used to be a nurse though.

260
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,576
-It suits you.
-It totally does.

261
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,411
I've heard that it suits me.

262
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,779
That's why you seemed gentle.

263
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,482
Your facial expressions
and gestures were tender.

264
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,051
Didn't someone say that their type
was a considerate man?

265
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,185
She's so happy.

266
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,387
Look at her smile.

267
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,890
If a nurse speaks this nicely to someone,

268
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:18,991
it would be nice.

269
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,661
-Right.
-I think that's why I tried hard

270
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,531
as I had to slowly explain
things to the patients.

271
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,199
Is this your third time here?

272
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,668
You'll succeed by your fifth visit.

273
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,202
-Do you think so?
-I do.

274
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,272
-That's a relief.
-Women like men who are considerate.

275
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,174
You have a nice first impression too.

276
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,910
I have a good feeling about you today.
Keep it up.

277
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,313
-Just like this.
-Things are looking good. He's not bad.

278
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,380
SHE BECOMES HIS COACH

279
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,448
Guess the age?

280
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,516
-Guess the age?
-Yes.

281
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,717
-I like it.
-I like that.

282
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,818
Feelings may get hurt.

283
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,720
I think I look my age.

284
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,854
Born in 1994?

285
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,356
You're right.

286
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,791
SHAVLY IS RIGHT

287
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,426
You're practically psychic.

288
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,494
Oh, why don't you guess all of our ages?

289
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,763
-Shall I give it a try?
-Yes, give it a shot.

290
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,398
Let me give you a hint.

291
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm older than you may think.

292
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,501
Then, you were born in 1991.

293
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,569
Well…

294
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,471
-He glared at you.
-Oh, my.

295
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,739
His face turned…

296
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,775
-Sorry, I offended you. Can I stop now?
-Because of my hint…

297
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,410
-Born in 1997?
-In 1997?

298
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,478
I was born in 1999.

299
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,447
-What?
-What did I say?

300
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,514
You said 1991.

301
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,616
-Oh, my gosh.
-Eight years.

302
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,683
I must've lost my mind.

303
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,986
Do you want to hurt my feelings in return?

304
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,089
Try guessing Shavly's age.

305
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,724
Maybe 1997?

306
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,693
I was born in 1994.

307
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,829
-You two are the same age.
-You're the same age.

308
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:30,963
We're the same age.

309
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,732
That's why you felt like a friend.

310
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,334
-Did I look the same age as you?
-You felt like a friend.

311
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,670
THEN, DID HE FEEL LIKE HE WAS OLDER?

312
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,905
I must have felt like I was a lot older.

313
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,641
That oppa vibe.

314
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,110
It's okay. We're switching tables later.

315
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,812
Let's have a drink.

316
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,280
Cheers.

317
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,916
Can I ask what everyone's MBTI is?

318
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,284
You must be INTJ.

319
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,219
-I'm INTJ.
-INTJ.

320
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,954
CORRECT AGAIN

321
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,255
You're definitely an E.

322
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,091
Actually, when I introduce myself,
I say my MBTI is

323
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,395
EE NNNN FF PPPPP.

324
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,463
-That's how I say it.
-I see.

325
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,832
I usually don't get along

326
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,401
with people who are ENFP.

327
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,704
-Come on, Congnamoon.
-In what way?

328
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,172
-Congnamoon.
-No way.

329
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,976
-He got back at her.
-It's hard to argue the facts.

330
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,811
-Congnamoon.
-It's scientifically proven.

331
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,480
You really are the definition of ENFP.

332
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,648
Don't you think so?

333
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,117
I can be a bit clumsy.

334
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,620
Friends who have the T and J personality

335
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,522
look after me by my side.

336
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,590
They take care of me and look after me.

337
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,261
GLANCES

338
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,562
Does anyone want juice?

339
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,464
-I'll go with you.
-It's okay. Will you?

340
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,300
SHAVLY AND DONGGYODONG GET JUICE TOGETHER

341
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,436
Hey. The two of them left together.

342
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,937
They went to get juice.

343
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,239
-Why did the two of them go?
-Why did they go together?

344
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,941
I know. He could've gone by himself.

345
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,777
-The fact that they both went…
-There must be something between them.

346
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,412
NOISY

347
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,381
NEWBIE CHIRRUPS LOUDLY

348
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,649
It's heating up over there.

349
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,717
This won't do.

350
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,552
We have to get more excited.

351
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,786
Do your "quack-quack" again.

352
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:01,854
QUACK QUACK

353
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,890
Come on,
ask each other some more questions.

354
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,525
-Okay.
-Okay.

355
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,662
THIS TABLE IS PARTICULARLY INTROVERTED

356
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,230
GLANCING AROUND

357
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,899
What do you do on your day off?

358
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,569
You asked her first! Yes, this is it!

359
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,571
Oh, why do you wanna know?

360
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,339
On my day off?

361
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,007
BLUSH

362
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,609
-Yes, ask things like that.
-Well,

363
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,911
I was just wondering
if you had any hobbies.

364
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,681
I usually stay at home.

365
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,382
Why do you look at me when you say that?

366
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,717
You should look at him.

367
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,119
I get some rest at home.

368
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,589
I typically spend
most of that time at home.

369
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,324
But if I have plans, I'll go out.

370
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,392
-You don't go out if you don't have plans?
-Right.

371
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,527
Where do you live?

372
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,763
-I live in Uijeongbu.
-Oh, I see.

373
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,898
-And what about you?
-In Gwangjin-gu.

374
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,433
Anyway, it's in the north.

375
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,135
Uijeongbu is in the north too.

376
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,269
I can go anywhere.

377
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,539
HE'S WILLING TO GO ANYWHERE FOR EVERYWHERE

378
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,608
It's like I'm watching them fall in love.

379
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,444
Come on. You have to make a boyfriend too.

380
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,712
What about older women?

381
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,114
When was your most recent relationship?

382
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,916
When do you want to get married?

383
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,618
Let's talk about our MBTIs.

384
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,186
I have a good feeling about you two.

385
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,121
THE CUPID OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

386
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,824
Do you all have an age range?

387
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,058
What about you?

388
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,696
I think we should be
no more than four years apart.

389
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,831
How old are you?

390
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,800
-I'm 32.
-And you are?

391
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,067
-Are you 28?
-Yeah.

392
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,302
Exactly four years apart.

393
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,838
FLIRTING EVERYWHERE

394
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,906
He's good!

395
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,307
-My goodness.
-Four years apart.

396
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,609
You're really determined.

397
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,012
-This is how you flirt.
-I'm just joking.

398
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,647
I should learn from you.

399
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,714
Am I blushing?

400
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,918
This is flirting too. Come on!

401
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,152
-No more wine for me.
-I know.

402
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,654
This shouldn't be called About Wine.

403
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,722
It should be called About Love. Come on.

404
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,693
This is a get-together to find love.
Wine is just an excuse.

405
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,328
I bet we'll see a new couple today.

406
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,430
At least two couples.

407
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,032
Three?

408
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,802
Everybody, it's time to change seats.

409
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,104
We'll move clockwise.

410
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,407
-Bye.
-See you.

411
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,842
-It was nice meeting you.
-Bye.

412
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,543
Bye, Congnamoon.

413
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,779
Bye.

414
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,913
-Hello.
-Hello.

415
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,114
-Have a seat here.
-Hello.

416
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,916
MEETING NEW PEOPLE AGAIN

417
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,751
DOOSAN RETURNS FROM THE BATHROOM

418
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,787
-We were waiting for you, Doosan.
-Pardon me.

419
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,255
Do you two know each other?

420
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,356
No, we've never met.

421
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,058
We just met.

422
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,459
Introduce yourself, please.

423
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,561
Okay. My nickname is Judy.

424
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,830
I was born in 2000 and I'm 26 years old.

425
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,765
You're too young. Why are you here?

426
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,868
I'm sorry.

427
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,071
When you're young, you can just
shoulder check a guy and start dating him.

428
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,906
Shoulder check him?

429
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,875
You can just bump into a guy
at Seokchon Lake.

430
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,977
What does a 26-year-old
have any business here?

431
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,081
Well, I like to meet new people and
converse with them

432
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,550
so that's why I decided to come.

433
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,618
Look, Shavly.

434
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,853
-Yes?
-You clearly don't seem ordinary.

435
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,488
Tell us your type.

436
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,123
May I list them one at a time?

437
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,558
You must have a long list.

438
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,927
All right. Go for it. Come on.

439
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,495
First of all,

440
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,530
I would like him to not be a mama's boy.

441
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,166
-Mama's boy?
-I don't want him to be a mama's boy.

442
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,736
-I like a man who's neat.
-That's the hardest thing.

443
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,804
He must be cleanly shaved.

444
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,606
HE'S OUT

445
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,742
-He must have hair on his head though.
-Okay.

446
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,212
He must be considerate and speak kindly.

447
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,115
He must always be on my side.

448
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,684
He must want to get married.

449
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,587
-I'd like him to take care of himself.
-Take care of himself.

450
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,989
I'd also like him
to continuously improve himself.

451
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:28,394
He should watch the news
so that we can talk about world affairs.

452
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,231
I hope he's the kind of guy
who knows how to appreciate art.

453
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,233
-How many was that?
-Nine?

454
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,635
-Nine? Five?
-Gosh.

455
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,604
Did you ever find a man like that?

456
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,873
I haven't found one. That's why I'm here.

457
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,977
Do you think he's here?

458
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,545
Why not? Everyone is…

459
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,814
Everyone seems so…

460
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,916
I'm going to go over to that table

461
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,218
and do a few of these as well.

462
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,087
Enjoy your conversation with one another.

463
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,288
-Okay.
-Okay.

464
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,624
Hey! INFJ!

465
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,726
-INFJ?
-INFJ.

466
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,794
He's INFJ.

467
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,995
SUDDENLY LINKS PEOPLE AT TABLE 3

468
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,330
-Come on.
-Are you drunk?

469
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,165
I think she is. My head hurts a bit.

470
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,868
Is there anyone here
who left a good impression on you?

471
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,237
You know how there's always
that one person at gatherings?

472
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,473
They lead their table
and make it fun and lively,

473
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,208
and even take the lead to the after party.

474
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,077
But they never get picked by anyone.

475
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,279
Out of ten times,
they're bound to get picked twice.

476
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,714
So just come ten times.

477
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,782
SCANNING

478
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,551
-Angel?
-Yes.

479
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,386
So you're an angel.

480
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,521
How proactive of you.

481
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,123
-Hello.
-Hello.

482
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,925
Why are you Donggyodong?
Do you live there?

483
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,594
-Okay.
-I don't live there. My name is Dong-gyo.

484
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,297
-Oh?
-I wanted it to be memorable.

485
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,865
That's why it became Donggyodong.

486
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,300
Is that in Mapo-gu?

487
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,801
That's right.

488
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,303
Let's talk about our types.

489
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,938
-My type?
-My type?

490
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,039
We can talk about it.

491
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,174
I like someone who looks good in glasses.

492
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,410
-Glasses?
-Looks good in glasses?

493
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,478
NEW FOLKS, SAME FLIRTING

494
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,447
-This is how you flirt.
-I need to learn.

495
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,182
How many times have you been here?

496
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,418
He seemed very smooth, didn't he?

497
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,387
-Twelve times.
-Twelve?

498
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,955
-It's my second time.
-What is?

499
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,523
-It's my second time here.
-Really?

500
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,292
I came here because I was
really curious about wine.

501
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,329
I want to enjoy the wine

502
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,231
-and just leave.
-Stop lying.

503
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:16,735
I really did innocently join
because of the wine at first.

504
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,138
I haven't succeeded in dating anybody yet.

505
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,540
Sadly, you must say goodbye now.

506
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,175
It was nice to meet you.

507
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,911
Was there someone
you wanted to get to know better?

508
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:26,979
Yes or no?

509
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,180
THE ULTIMATE GAME OF TRUTH

510
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,548
-Up or down?
-He's a pro.

511
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,183
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

512
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,952
ALL 6 OF THEM HAVE
SOMEONE THEY WANT TO SEE AGAIN

513
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,020
Everyone has someone.

514
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,091
This is insane! So insane!

515
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,592
I got a dopamine explosion!

516
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,760
Can you move out please?

517
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,429
TRAFFIC JAM

518
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,465
-The men must move out.
-I'm sad they're leaving.

519
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,233
Duck, why are you called Duck?

520
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,070
-I'm an elementary school teacher
-His third time explaining.

521
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,738
and I make duck sounds well.

522
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,107
-The kids pay attention.
-I heard duck noises earlier.

523
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,009
-Did you hear it? You heard it from here?
-Yes.

524
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,010
I really heard it.

525
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,745
DURING THE FIRST QUACK

526
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:00,712
QUACK QUACK

527
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,348
QUACK QUACK QUACK

528
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,783
QUACK QUACK

529
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,685
HE MADE DUCK NOISES
AT EACH TABLE

530
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,719
-That's why.
-Yes.

531
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,521
HIS THIRD DUCK PERFORMANCE

532
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,622
SURPRISED, USED TO IT

533
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,491
That was awesome. One more time please.

534
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,126
DUCK CALL DISPENSER

535
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,427
I'd say, "Class 6-3."

536
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,229
"Pay attention!"

537
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,330
That takes me back.

538
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,599
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN ANYBODY?

539
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,800
WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT HER?

540
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,037
QUACK QUACK

541
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,371
That's how I felt.

542
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,309
Was there anyone you found interesting?

543
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,977
-There were so many.
-So many?

544
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,213
-She was all coy before but not anymore.
-Shush.

545
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,482
-Sugar, you had a few?
-She had lots.

546
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,517
She was acting all coy before.

547
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,718
What's your type?

548
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,321
-Me? Someone who looks good in glasses.
-What?

549
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,090
-A guy who looks good in glasses?
-You're the only one with glasses.

550
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,793
Not someone wearing glasses
but someone who looks good in glasses.

551
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,528
But I'm the only one wearing glasses.

552
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,764
What do you mean by
"someone who looks good in glasses"?

553
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,633
When you look at the person,

554
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,201
it suits them like a tattoo.

555
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,569
-Like a tattoo?
-Yes.

556
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,904
What else?

557
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,639
-I like someone who's calm.
-Calm.

558
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,707
What about looks?

559
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,642
-I don't care about his looks.
-You don't?

560
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,978
Which celebrity would be your type?

561
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,414
NEWBIE

562
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,718
People here are rather good at flirting.

563
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,620
SPEECHLESS

564
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,455
A man who looks good in glasses.

565
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,556
You were being roundabout,

566
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,857
but you were talking about me.

567
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,726
Gosh, I was obviously flirting.

568
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,095
Why me?

569
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,330
-You're cute.
-I'm cute?

570
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,899
EVERYONE FEELS
SECONDHAND EMBARRASSMENT

571
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,367
-You think I'm cute?
-You are.

572
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,801
Really? I see.

573
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,970
What is your MBTI, Newbie?

574
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,639
-Guess.
-Did you introduce…

575
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,506
Take a guess, Sugar.

576
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,708
If you get it right,
I'll feed you a piece of chicken.

577
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,410
What? I want to get it.

578
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,746
What's going on with these two?

579
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,813
What's going on with these two?

580
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,714
STARE

581
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,116
Come on. Just leave.

582
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,118
What the heck? What's up with that look?

583
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,053
Geez. What's up with that look?

584
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,721
Want to switch seats?

585
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,823
I. You're an I.

586
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,892
-N.
-Yes.

587
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,229
TP?

588
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,265
-TJ?
-Want one more chance?

589
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,533
INTJ.

590
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,402
INTJ? That's correct.

591
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,104
Feed me already.

592
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,441
SCREAMING IN EXCITEMENT

593
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,375
What the heck?

594
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,412
Okay, I'll feed you.

595
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,880
I'll feed you. Eat up.

596
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,548
-If that's what you want.
-Oh, my.

597
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,117
You weren't like this before!

598
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,653
-He's so funny. I'm such a huge fan.
-Well…

599
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
NEWBIE CAREFULLY FEEDS HER
THE FRIED CHICKEN

600
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,626
-Isn't it nice to see such initiative?
-Yes.

601
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,062
Gosh, Si-an. I feel so honored.

602
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,965
It's been a long time
since I fed someone a piece of chicken.

603
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,701
Who knows? They may be taking
a bottle of wine to Seokchon Lake.

604
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,069
That would be awesome.

605
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,204
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THESE TWO?

606
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,940
Yes, the time has come for you to choose.

607
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,711
Write the nicknames of two people.

608
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,579
How exciting must it feel to hear

609
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,147
-your name being called.
-To hear it.

610
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,483
-Don't you go over to that flower path?
-Right.

611
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,718
With a bottle of wine.

612
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,753
How many couples will we get?

613
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,855
-Maybe about four?
-Four couples?

614
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,923
-That many?
-That many?

615
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,991
Two couples at best.

616
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,125
-Two couples?
-Two couples.

617
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,661
It would be a success
if we even get one couple.

618
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,097
-In my hand,
-Yes.

619
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,033
I have the results of the matches.

620
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,434
Oh, my gosh!

621
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,336
Why am I getting jittery?

622
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,940
Usually, I would reveal it the next day,

623
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,776
but since we have
the newbies with us today,

624
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,581
I am going to reveal it right here,
right now.

625
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,783
Of course, she should do it now.

626
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,152
-Oh, it's usually revealed the next day?
-What did she say?

627
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,288
Because they may change
their minds in round two.

628
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,391
The first couple.

629
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,626
Here we go.

630
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,528
All right.

631
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,598
Donggyodong and Shavly, congratulations!

632
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,033
Wow! Donggyodong and Shavly!

633
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,269
Donggyodong and Shavly, congratulations!

634
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,104
OH MY GOODNESS

635
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,106
Shavly from our table!

636
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,708
Where's Donggyodong?

637
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,776
Where's Donggyodong?

638
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,444
Can you please come on out?

639
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,645
Wow, Donggyodong!

640
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,914
Come on out.

641
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,182
HE SLOWLY APPROACHES HER

642
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,817
AND BASHFULLY OFFERS HIS HAND

643
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,485
Oh, my gosh!

644
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,020
AHH!

645
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,389
EEK! WOW!

646
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,924
Oh, my goodness.

647
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,260
My dopamine levels are off the charts.

648
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:14,566
Newbie will hand them
the congratulatory wine.

649
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,202
Congratulations!

650
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,270
Well…

651
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,338
CONGRATS TO THE FIRST COUPLE

652
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,906
Why were you interested in her?

653
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,475
-She is extremely outgoing.
-Yes.

654
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,610
Most people can't handle someone like her.

655
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,147
I found her outgoing trait attractive.

656
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,349
-You liked it.
-Well,

657
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,817
I liked her liveliness.

658
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,885
-Is that your type?
-I would say so.

659
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,188
Despite talking to a super lively person,

660
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,190
Donggyodong wasn't intimidated.

661
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,693
I thought that was very awesome.

662
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,061
They suit each other.

663
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,399
-You need to match with someone too.
-I know.

664
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,368
I don't think it'll happen for me.

665
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,038
Didn't you sit
at the same table in the beginning?

666
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,606
He sat next to me.

667
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:56,708
Do you live in Donggyo-dong?

668
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,577
That's right. Wait, what? It's my name.

669
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,811
NEXT TO EACH OTHER FROM THE START

670
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,380
-Really?
-My name is Dong-gyo.

671
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,949
I'm dumbfounded right now.

672
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,851
To be honest,
I didn't know I'd match with her,

673
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,821
but since she had
such a good impression of me,

674
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,658
I'd like to repay that kindness as well.

675
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,327
When I first saw him,

676
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,629
I didn't know I'd find him attractive,

677
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,632
but we ended up being matched,
so I'm very happy.

678
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,634
One, two, three.

679
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,069
SUCCESSFULLY MATCHED!

680
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,704
The fact that I'm holding this

681
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,740
means that there is another couple.

682
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,176
One more? There must be just two couples.

683
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,646
Si-an, who do you think matched?

684
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,648
I don't know about who it would be,

685
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,717
-but there was a couple I was rooting for.
-Who?

686
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:39,918
Naknak…

687
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,820
Naknak? And?

688
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:42,788
And Everywhere.

689
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:43,755
NAKNAK AND EVERYWHERE

690
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,991
-The second couple is…
-The second couple!

691
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,759
Get ready to go out.

692
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,528
It was…

693
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,463
-not who we expected.
-What?

694
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,832
-It's Sugeun Sugeun and…
-Sugeun Sugeun?

695
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:54,866
Sheena.

696
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,103
-Come on out.
-Sheena!

697
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,205
Sugeun Sugeun and Sheena
were with me at my table!

698
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,273
Who are you?

699
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,340
-My gosh!
-Come over here.

700
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,075
Why aren't there any from our table?

701
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,510
-Everywhere!
-Sheena.

702
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,212
What on earth?

703
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,380
-Congratulations!
-Come on!

704
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,848
CONGRATS TO THE SECOND COUPLE

705
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,850
Congratulations! Wow!

706
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,819
Why did you find her attractive?

707
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,187
Because she's pretty.

708
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,588
"Because she's pretty."

709
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,256
And she's even older than you.

710
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,324
She's totally my type.

711
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,126
You're two years older than him, right?

712
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,762
What did you like about Sugeun Sugeun?

713
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,363
There was a glow about him.

714
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,698
MURMURING

715
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,933
There was a glow about him?

716
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,102
DOPAMINE EXPLOSION TILL THE END

717
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,737
At first,

718
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,274
I was very nervous.

719
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,776
But I was so happy

720
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,012
that I was able to converse with her
and find out what a nice person she is.

721
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,116
I hope that this leads
to a good relationship in the future.

722
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,386
I feel so awkward that I can't speak.

723
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,190
We succeeded in being matched.

724
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,892
SUCCESSFULLY MATCHED!

725
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,327
Is that all?

726
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,394
Yes.

727
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,796
-Really?
-Let's wrap it up now.

728
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,964
It'll be all right.

729
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,131
-Really?
-It'll be okay.

730
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,901
May I take a look at who picked whom?

731
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,536
What about you, Sugar?

732
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,804
THE FAILED CHICKEN COUPLE

733
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,205
He was expecting her to pick him.

734
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,074
Can you tell us who you chose?

735
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,775
-No?
-I don't want to reveal it.

736
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,010
All right.

737
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,012
Between us,
who didn't choose the other person?

738
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,847
WHO DIDN'T CHOOSE THE OTHER?

739
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,852
It's been a while
since my dopamine was triggered like this.

740
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,522
You get that good feeling

741
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,857
as you change seats and go around.

742
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:30,061
I seriously want to join
and come to the gathering twice a month.

743
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,363
I'm really intrigued.

744
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,533
Even if you don't like wine,

745
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,968
if you want to meet a variety of people…

746
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,471
If you find it hard
to be introduced to someone

747
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,073
or you're afraid of going on blind dates,

748
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,109
I highly recommend this.

749
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,810
