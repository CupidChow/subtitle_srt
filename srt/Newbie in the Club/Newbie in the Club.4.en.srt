00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,772
Hello Netflix Club members,
how has your week been?

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,408
Each week, I observe clubs
with the eyes of a bird.

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,745
I'm Defconn,
the newbie who's crazy about clubs.

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,682
Today, I'm visiting a club
that's filled with craftsmanship.

6
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,283
It's the knitting club.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,718
-Are you the president?
-Yes.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,721
-I see. Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

9
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,223
Please introduce your club.

10
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,893
People who enjoy knitting
gather here to knit together.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,062
We're called Close-knit Club.

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,731
I was told to come here, so I did,

13
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,233
but what kind of place is this?

14
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,201
This is my home.

15
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,070
-It's your home?
-Yes, it is.

16
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,905
Pardon me, but are you married?

17
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:39,973
It's been two months.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,274
-You're a newlywed.
-Yes.

19
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,909
But you kicked out your husband.

20
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,377
TO HUSBAND: …SORRY

21
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,247
Why do you get together
at your place to knit?

22
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:52,352
That friend over there
studied abroad in Berlin.

23
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,120
-I went to visit her.
-In Germany.

24
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,356
Our friends got together and I taught them

25
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,691
how to knit and we cooked meals together.

26
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,627
I had such fond memories of that,

27
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,629
so I decided to try it in Korea.

28
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,364
And I started it at my place.

29
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,901
You know, I noticed
that even though the president is talking,

30
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,969
you all keep knitting.

31
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,237
You're all addicts.

32
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,739
YOU'RE KNITTING ADDICTS

33
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,608
When someone talks,
you usually stop what you're doing.

34
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,811
But you keep doing what you're doing.

35
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:18,878
Our hands can't rest.

36
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,314
Yes, it does seem that way.

37
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,883
Did you knit this yourself as well?

38
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,286
Yes, I'm knitting a garment now as well

39
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,520
with the yarn you have.

40
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,855
Is it for me?

41
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,490
No, it's for me.

42
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,724
What about your husband's?

43
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,493
Maybe later.

44
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,794
"Later" for the husband.

45
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,963
Sorry about that, honey.

46
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,832
-What are you knitting?
-Socks.

47
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,300
I'll wear them when you're done.

48
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,401
HE WANTS IT ALL

49
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,602
It's mine.

50
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,039
-There's something knitters hate to hear.
-What is it?

51
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,307
"Knit me something."

52
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,374
What does that mean?

53
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,476
"Knit me something too."

54
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,444
-"What about mine?"
-"What about mine?"

55
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,280
They say, "Shouldn't you
knit something for your boyfriend?"

56
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,448
I'm busy with my own.

57
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,050
She's busy knitting her own.

58
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,052
You're self-centered.

59
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,987
-We aren't selfless.
-I see.

60
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,922
Hey, Echo.

61
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:03,990
-"Echo"?
-Echo.

62
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:04,991
Who's that?

63
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,526
Is this your dog?

64
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,094
-Yes.
-Echo.

65
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,395
What's its name?

66
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,297
-It's Jarrette.
-Oh, Jarrette.

67
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,100
How cute. It looks very sweet.

68
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,336
Can you please introduce yourselves?

69
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,906
My name is Kim Angela,
and I own a bookstore.

70
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,574
-Where?
-In Haebangchon.

71
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,977
Haebangchon. I kind of get it now.

72
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,044
The hip area.

73
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,246
-I like hip areas.
-I get it.

74
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,715
-Are you married?
-I'm living with someone.

75
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,917
We chose not to marry,
but we live together.

76
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,720
We live together
without any plans of getting married.

77
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,223
HER UNMATCHED UNIQUE AURA

78
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,391
How interesting.

79
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,360
Well, I respect that.

80
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,028
Were you kind of a hippie?

81
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,396
-I'd like to be one.
-Yes.

82
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,599
Now that I look at you,
you have that hippie vibe.

83
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,234
-I run a bookstore, right?
-Yes.

84
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,004
I can't go to knitting clubs
since I'm running a bookstore,

85
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,872
so I made a knitting club there.

86
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,608
But the club is doing better
than the bookstore,

87
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,377
so I'm struggling.

88
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:58,778
-Has it been tough?
-Yes.

89
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,180
People don't read books.

90
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,714
A BOOKSTORE WITH NO BOOK SALES

91
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,449
Don't go there.

92
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,151
-You're here to relax and knit.
-Yes.

93
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,387
I've been her friend

94
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,289
-since high school.
-Her friend? I see.

95
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,957
You're her high school friend.

96
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,158
We're from the same hometown.

97
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,226
-Jeonju?
-Yes.

98
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,327
-Jeonju? Where?
-Yes.

99
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,029
-Geunyoung High School.
-Really?

100
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,264
-We went to Geunyoung.
-You went to Geunyoung?

101
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,301
Oh, Geunyoung. I see.

102
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,002
You guys made it big.

103
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,037
THRIVING JEONJU FOLKS

104
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,140
You came all the way to Seoul.
You made it big, my friends.

105
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,475
-I'm Kim Dae-ri.
-Yes.

106
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,045
It isn't my real name.
It's my professional name.

107
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,514
-Professional name?
-I'm a knitting influencer.

108
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,951
-Knitting influencer is a thing?
-Yes.

109
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,819
She's the Paik Jong-won of knitting.

110
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,087
-Really?
-Yes.

111
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,689
She teaches us everything.

112
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,190
I run a business too.

113
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,960
-You do?
-I work at my mom's company.

114
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,595
-What kind?
-A knitting company.

115
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,662
KNITTING LEGACY

116
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,864
-She was born with a knitting spoon.
-Yes, I was.

117
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:52,966
How many subscribers?

118
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,235
I have 430,000 subscribers on YouTube.

119
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,237
Really? That's a lot of subscribers.

120
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,639
It's incredible to have
that many with knitting.

121
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,309
Almost every knitter knows her.

122
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,312
Do you want to try to guess
which garments were knit?

123
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,782
You have to tell the ones we knit
from the ones we bought.

124
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,584
-Which is handmade and which is bought?
-Yes.

125
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,986
Yes, handmade or bought?

126
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,420
This was…

127
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,023
bought.

128
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,091
But it looks handmade.

129
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,926
Looks handmade but bought?

130
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,062
It kind of looks like
it's from the back alley of Yeonnam-dong.

131
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,465
Someone over there knit it--

132
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,532
I did buy it there.

133
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,701
You bought it?

134
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,236
-You bought it?
-Yes, from there.

135
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,404
-You see?
-Awesome.

136
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,505
-Awesome.
-I knew it.

137
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,007
GLANCING OVER

138
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,708
She definitely bought this.

139
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,809
100 PERCENT BOUGHT

140
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:37,877
She bought it.

141
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,312
I saw it at Codes Combine.

142
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,849
I think you paid about 45,000 won.

143
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,117
-45,000?
-On Black Friday.

144
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,585
-Wrong.
-Really?

145
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,120
-I knit this.
-You did?

146
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,554
-Really?
-Yes.

147
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,057
You didn't buy this? You knit this? Wow.

148
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,092
That's awesome. You did a great job.

149
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,795
"It looks like it's store-bought"
is the best compliment.

150
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,364
It fits like it was store-bought.

151
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,800
-It means you knit it meticulously.
-That's right.

152
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,237
Can you show me a completed piece?

153
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,105
Something one of you made.

154
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,507
Wow! This is awesome.

155
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,641
-Angela.
-Isn't it pretty?

156
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,709
It's so pretty.

157
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,777
How cute.

158
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,478
You made this? Let me see.

159
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,013
Give it to me. Wow!

160
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,515
JUST WHAT NEWBIE LIKES

161
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,284
Wow, these details are awesome.

162
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,620
You have to pay
over 100,000 won for these.

163
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,688
-Yes.
-Right.

164
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,923
What was the material cost for this?

165
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,591
I used cheap yarn.

166
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,093
Around 60,000 won?

167
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,530
For 60,000 won, you can buy
an Abercrombie sweater on Black Friday.

168
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,031
Despite that…

169
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,634
PEEVED

170
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,670
-I sense danger.
-I enjoy the knitting process.

171
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,838
-You enjoy it.
-Yes.

172
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,973
This one didn't cost much.

173
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,141
As for this one…

174
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,209
Some are pricey?

175
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,044
It cost around 120,000 to 130,000 won.

176
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,145
It must be pricey yarn.

177
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,348
You see, I knit this for my boyfriend.

178
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,149
It might fit him.

179
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,186
You knit it for your boyfriend
who isn't family?

180
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,254
-You must love him very much.
-Of course.

181
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,123
Since men's clothes are bigger,

182
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,658
it takes forever to knit them.

183
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,626
-And the yarn must cost a lot.
-Yes.

184
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,562
When I knit about this much,

185
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,164
I thought, "Do I love him that much?"

186
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,499
It didn't seem worthwhile?

187
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,134
-That's right.
-I see.

188
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,338
What are you doing?

189
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,806
Is that a bib?

190
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,642
-Foreign women knit things like these.
-Yes.

191
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,811
They even knit bikinis? Really?

192
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,980
It isn't for actual swimming.

193
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,648
Just to wear on the beach.

194
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,716
What's this?

195
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,618
I've been working on this
for three years.

196
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,453
Trimming the yarn is
the most tedious thing.

197
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,521
Wait.

198
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,690
Aren't the colors

199
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,659
similar to the color scheme
of G-Dragon's "Power"?

200
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,428
Give it to me. I'll give it to him.

201
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,530
-Really?
-I'm meeting him tomorrow.

202
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,665
-You're meeting G-Dragon tomorrow?
-Well…

203
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,501
HAPPY TO GIVE EVERYTHING
TO G-DRAGON

204
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,902
-I'm happy to give it to him.
-Do it.

205
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,170
Really? Okay.

206
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,538
Really? Okay.

207
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,606
A BIT BITTERSWEET

208
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,674
Now, let's check out
Ms. Kim Dae-ri's work.

209
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,176
Her works are like…

210
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,478
It's like a display stand at Yeonnam-dong.

211
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,480
Oh, my. This is adorable.

212
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,015
-You knit this yourself?
-Yes.

213
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,151
-I made this with leftover yarn.
-Leftover?

214
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,586
I had this much left for each yarn,

215
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,687
so I knit it.

216
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,023
I wish someone would sell stuff like this.

217
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,691
Many people have said

218
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,127
that they wanted to buy this item,

219
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,897
so I made about 60 of these

220
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,232
and sold it at a pop-up store,
but I sold none.

221
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,700
-What?
-For real?

222
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,603
People would say,
"You should sell it. I want to buy it."

223
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,606
-Don't listen.
-Knitters get very excited about that.

224
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,075
We start thinking
we can make money out of it.

225
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,644
We think we can get rich with it.

226
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,379
-But no one ended up buying it.
-No.

227
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,247
Don't believe it when people say that.

228
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,416
Just ask for it like I do.

229
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,252
It's better that I just say
I like it and want it, right?

230
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,887
I sense danger.

231
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,955
Danger.

232
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,123
You sense danger?

233
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,291
How can we politely reject?

234
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,358
THEY'RE BUSY REJECTING HIM

235
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,929
You know, I'd like to give this a try.

236
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,163
You said I could do this.

237
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,331
Yes, this one.

238
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,966
Try this.

239
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,434
-A key chain?
-Yes, a key chain.

240
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,736
WHAT IS THIS?

241
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,105
-The yarn is fluffy like this.
-Okay.

242
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,874
Here are the eyes and other materials.

243
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,175
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

244
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,910
-Let's begin.
-Let's begin.

245
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,346
-Open YouTube.
-Okay.

246
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,181
Look up "dust bunny."

247
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,249
-Dust bunny?
-Yes.

248
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,550
And follow along.

249
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,621
Follow what?

250
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,756
If I was going to do that,
why am I even here?

251
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,824
I'd do it at home.

252
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,993
We aren't a club
that teaches you how to do it.

253
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,495
We're here to knit together.

254
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,297
-Right.
-You must teach yourself how to do it.

255
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,000
And if it becomes too hard,
you can ask the teacher next to you.

256
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,134
What is this, Teacher Kim?

257
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,202
I just did the slip knot.

258
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,270
-Slip knot?
-Yes.

259
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,072
Let me demonstrate for you.

260
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,107
-First, the knit stitch.
-Knit stitch?

261
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,309
The needle without the yarn
in your right hand.

262
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,278
The needle with the yarn
in your left hand.

263
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,615
With the right needle,
take a stitch from the left needle

264
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,884
and slide it up from below.

265
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,953
Then, do you see this long yarn
connected to the ball of yarn?

266
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,991
Grab it and spin it
around the needle on the right.

267
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,326
Spin it around the needle on the right.

268
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,594
His finger looks weird.

269
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,563
-What do I do?
-Let's do it again.

270
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,132
You have to wrap
the string around this needle.

271
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,034
No.

272
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,536
How do I do that?

273
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,371
Wrap it around the right needle.

274
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,972
-Yes.
-I wrapped it around.

275
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,874
-No, the other way.
-The other way.

276
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,442
-She keeps saying no.
-It isn't working.

277
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,411
"No."

278
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,646
Next,

279
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,780
pull it out.

280
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,482
Right. I pulled it out.

281
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,050
-No, you didn't.
-I did.

282
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,351
No.

283
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,320
-I did it.
-You didn't.

284
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,489
You have to wrap it and then pull it out.

285
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,125
Gosh, what do I do about this?

286
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,726
FEELING AT A LOSS

287
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:25,031
I think it's because I can't see
the structure of the yarn.

288
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,400
It's so fluffy that the structure is…

289
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,435
-So this…
-Do you want to try with this one?

290
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,604
Okay, let me try with this one.

291
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,539
-Let me see how it works.
-Okay.

292
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,107
Hold it with both of your hands.

293
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,375
-Both of my hands.
-Yes.

294
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,910
SIGHS

295
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,612
CRUNCH

296
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,980
Why are you eating a cracker?

297
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,748
-I need sugar.
-You crave it?

298
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,016
NEWBIE DRAINED HER ENERGY

299
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,318
With the right needle,

300
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,520
let's give it another shot.

301
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,289
-Listen, just in case,
-Yes.

302
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,158
work a bit on it using this.

303
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,659
Okay. I will.

304
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,695
So I just need to do the last bit.

305
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,862
-Okay.
-Good.

306
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,032
Using the right needle,
make an X with the left needle.

307
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,334
-Like this?
-Yes.

308
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,501
-An X.
-Next…

309
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,403
It won't go up.

310
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,173
ONLY HIS SHOULDERS GO UP

311
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,407
Relax your shoulders.

312
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,475
Yes.

313
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,977
AT EASE

314
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,546
Push that needle into the hole.

315
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,780
SPOON FEEDING HIM

316
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,482
Then, let that come out.

317
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,950
-Right.
-Oh.

318
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,586
-Good. That went much faster.
-I know.

319
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,788
I learn so fast when the teacher is kind.

320
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,657
Unlike a certain someone.

321
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,859
The influencer just got grouchy.

322
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,763
She just wanted me
to watch her video and learn.

323
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,398
Take a look.

324
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,467
I am exhausted just doing this.

325
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,702
-You're very fast, though.
-Yes.

326
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,504
-Really?
-You're understanding it well.

327
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,006
You're doing well.

328
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,142
CAN'T TAKE THEIR EYES OFF HIM

329
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,379
ANOTHER STITCH DONE

330
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,014
-It's become more refined.
-You see?

331
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,349
See, compliments make Newbie happy.

332
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,417
HAPPY NEWBIE

333
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,818
You see?

334
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,420
Why do my shoulders hurt?

335
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,188
-You were knitting like this.
-You were.

336
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,256
YOU WERE SO TENSE

337
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,325
Look, everyone!

338
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,393
I did it.

339
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,727
HE ALREADY FINISHED TWO ROWS

340
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:02,795
My gosh.

341
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,829
It's coming along.

342
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,898
With this, I can do this.

343
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,566
How cute.

344
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,301
-I can do that.
-How nice of you.

345
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,038
-He's making something.
-I did it.

346
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,240
Do you knit every day?

347
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,008
-I knit every day.
-Me too.

348
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,576
How many hours in a day?

349
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,111
Is it just part of your routine?

350
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,814
After finishing work and eating dinner,

351
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,683
you relax and watch a drama, right?

352
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,418
We would knit while watching a drama.

353
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,287
You're knitting
while talking to me right now.

354
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,924
I didn't realize in the beginning,
but now I know how difficult that is.

355
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:32,992
AUTOPILOT HANDS

356
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,194
Right? Don't you agree?

357
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,230
How can you knit while talking to me?

358
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,766
You can do it
once you get the hang of it.

359
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,835
SHE'S GOT THE HANG OF IT

360
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,804
She's knitting with four needles.

361
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,739
I found that truly incredible.

362
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:50,443
What is your longest record?
How many hours was it?

363
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,345
I've done it for ten hours
while not moving at all.

364
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,315
I knit with my club for eight hours
and another eight at home.

365
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,851
-Wow.
-You knit after knitting for eight hours?

366
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,919
Unbelievable.

367
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,688
It's because I wanted to complete it.

368
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,891
I wanted to complete it
in the time frame that I set,

369
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,093
so I kept knitting.

370
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,161
I got a bladder infection while knitting.

371
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,230
I held it for too long.

372
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,698
HER INSANE DEVOTION TO KNITTING

373
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,967
How can you let that happen?

374
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,204
It's so gripping
that it makes you hold your pee?

375
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,674
Once you're focused,
you keep thinking, "I'll go after this."

376
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,942
-You want to finish.
-Yes.

377
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,044
There's even a meme. "One more row."

378
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,780
-I guess it's oddly addicting.
-Yes.

379
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,148
It gives you a dopamine rush.

380
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,216
EACH ROW GIVES YOU
A DOPAMINE RUSH

381
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,551
Then, besides your home,

382
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,187
where else do you…

383
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,256
I've been knitting at the ski resort.

384
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,457
-Ski resort?
-Yes.

385
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,895
Listen, you said
your bookstore isn't doing well.

386
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,699
I started the bookstore with the hopes
of skiing and living a happy life.

387
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,201
If I can't snowboard
because of the bookstore,

388
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,003
wouldn't that be too miserable?

389
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,571
You can only do it during the winter,

390
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,673
so I decided to have a happy winter

391
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,942
and work hard
during the other seasons.

392
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,012
He's at a loss for words.

393
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,247
DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO REACT

394
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,782
She tried so hard to explain it.

395
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,351
It's just because I'm worried.

396
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
I care about you.

397
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,521
It's okay.

398
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,823
-I knit at bars and cafés.
-Everywhere.

399
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,425
-On the subway, on the bus.
-On the plane.

400
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,927
At music festivals too.

401
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,762
Music festivals? Come on.

402
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,931
-A festival?
-Knitting at a jazz festival sounds fun.

403
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,466
-It's fun.
-Angela.

404
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,635
It seems like
your spending is out of control.

405
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,373
Festivals and ski trips…
You're out and about a lot.

406
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,742
-I have to find my happiness.
-What?

407
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,443
It's up to me to search for happiness.

408
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,511
HAPPINESS SEEKER

409
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,282
But doing nothing while waiting
for something feels like a waste.

410
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,384
-It's called "knitting loss."
-Knitting loss?

411
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,052
-Oh, like muscle loss?
-Yes.

412
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,589
I don't go to movie theaters
because I can't knit there.

413
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,359
I get nervous
when I go to places where I can't knit.

414
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,028
NEWBIE'S HANDS LOOK NERVOUS TOO

415
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,362
As I make more stitches,

416
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,398
it's getting more cramped.

417
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,301
Don't hold the knit fabric
from the outside.

418
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,069
Let it fall and do this.

419
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,137
SHE SHOWS HIM HOW

420
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,505
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

421
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,908
You make it so hard, Ms. Influencer.

422
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,743
My goodness.

423
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,878
And you're cold but kind.

424
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:06,946
COLD BUT KIND

425
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,281
The cold-but-kind influencer.

426
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,984
She seems indifferent,
but she does show you how to do it.

427
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,085
All right, everyone.

428
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,753
HE COMPLETED ANOTHER ROW

429
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,888
Knitter's clap.

430
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,056
That's a thing?

431
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,158
-Use your needles.
-Knitter's clap.

432
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,426
Knitter's clap.

433
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,493
CLAP WITH NEEDLES

434
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,195
SWOOSH

435
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,764
OH

436
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,199
Yes, good.

437
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,400
He's on a roll now.

438
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,468
PROUD OF HIM

439
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,704
I'm getting faster now. Wow, damn.

440
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,341
Look at how he wraps the yarn around.

441
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,675
He's like a real knitter.

442
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,511
Wow! I'm getting faster.
Come closer, GoPro.

443
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,146
-Your fingers look good.
-Yes.

444
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,848
I'm on a roll now. Look.

445
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,550
BECOMING A TRUE KNITTER

446
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,452
-You'll be done in no time.
-It's getting bigger.

447
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,754
You're getting faster at completing rows.

448
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:49,855
-Right?
-To go faster,

449
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,058
-you can push this one beforehand.
-Okay.

450
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,760
It's fastest to start from the end.

451
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,928
HELPS HIM NONCHALANTLY

452
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:02,334
SHE CAN'T TAKE HER EYES OFF HIM
JUST LIKE A CONCERNED MOTHER

453
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,403
GLANCING OVER

454
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,939
The yarn has to go to the back.

455
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,908
-Over here?
-Yes.

456
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,509
THE TWO HAVE GOTTEN CLOSER

457
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,811
Isn't it tiresome
to say the same thing repeatedly?

458
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,613
You have to repeat yourself for me.

459
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,748
Yes, it's tiresome.

460
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,884
THEY ALMOST BECAME CLOSE
BUT NOT QUITE

461
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,619
It was cute until the fifth row,

462
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,023
but I got tired of it when he reached
the sixth and seventh rows.

463
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,358
PEEKING OVER

464
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,426
That's right.

465
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,827
That's it.

466
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:29,895
TIRED BUT STILL HELPING

467
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,630
-Hmm?
-Yes.

468
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,898
"Hmm?"

469
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,566
-Right.
-Good.

470
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,369
They became close now.

471
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,571
Is it good? Is it?

472
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,774
-Yes, it's good. It's very good.
-Is it? Good.

473
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,575
Kim Dae-ri is cold but kind.

474
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,145
I'll call her "cold-but-kind Dae-ri."

475
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:47,746
Cold-but-kind Dae-ri.

476
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,281
She's cold but kind.

477
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,816
Do you know what I'm saying?

478
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,153
She seems cold but is actually kind.
She's a good teacher to me.

479
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,289
How interesting. Oh, boy.
Now that I got used to it…

480
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,291
-Isn't it fun?
-I'm enjoying it.

481
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,693
-You're good.
-Yes.

482
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,528
-He's good.
-Yes.

483
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,330
And he'll become a perfectionist.

484
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,397
That's right.

485
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,266
This has that effect.

486
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,702
They call this "meditation with hands."

487
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,205
It's the process
of accepting my imperfect self.

488
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,506
Accepting my imperfect…

489
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:15,407
Sounds grandiose.

490
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,308
…self.

491
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,677
It's true. Nobody's perfect.

492
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,312
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT REACTIONS

493
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,748
Anyway, would you recommend this?

494
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,683
Of course. It's such a nice hobby.

495
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,018
Who would you recommend it to?

496
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,153
It's good for people
who think life is boring.

497
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,521
When you're knitting, time flies.

498
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,657
Why would people want time to fly by?

499
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,758
SIGH

500
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,595
LOOKS AWAY

501
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,897
Why do you want time to fly by? Tell me.

502
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,399
Because life is painful.

503
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,267
-What?
-Life is painful.

504
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,404
You say life is painful,
but you go to festivals

505
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,573
and go to Waterbomb Festival
in the summer.

506
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,008
I became pleasure-seeking.

507
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,243
"Pleasure-seeking."

508
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,811
She is so funny.

509
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,113
Jarrette,

510
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,914
I'm doing pretty good, bro.

511
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,017
She's a girl.

512
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,084
Oh.

513
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,121
I'm doing pretty well, girl.

514
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,757
I didn't have the time
to check her gender.

515
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,059
I didn't have the time to check.

516
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,928
JARRETTE / LADY

517
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,463
Do you want to try this?

518
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,831
One more row, and it's done.

519
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:13,899
-Let's see.
-Here.

520
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,601
-Let me give it a shot.
-Okay.

521
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,935
I think you can do it now.

522
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,103
He's become confident.

523
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,205
-Just knit-stitch one more row.
-Okay.

524
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,140
Let me try.

525
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,074
MORE CONFIDENT NOW

526
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,709
How amazing.

527
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,711
-Yeah. He's good.
-He got better.

528
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,913
I'm no longer afraid of this anymore.

529
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,816
Yes, that's it.

530
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,884
I'm doing it!

531
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,951
EVEN FLUFFY YARN!

532
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,153
He can do it now.

533
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,220
I'm doing it.

534
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,655
I'm doing it!

535
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,791
-He seemed lost earlier.
-He did.

536
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,460
-He's filled with confidence now.
-Yes.

537
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,062
SIGHS

538
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,129
I'm getting it.

539
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,998
I'm getting the "knit-gasm."

540
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,099
OBSCURE KNITTING TERM

541
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,300
I got the "knit-gasm."

542
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,035
I got the "knit-gasm." Gosh.

543
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,870
SO WHAT?

544
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,472
Mr. Kim!

545
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,308
I'm getting it, Mr. Kim. I am.

546
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,943
CALLING OUT FOR
THE NONEXISTENT MR. KIM

547
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,044
HE'S ON A KNITTING SPREE

548
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,012
I got it.

549
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,180
Not yet. Okay.

550
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,314
He didn't get it yet?

551
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,016
STOP MAKING A FUSS

552
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,118
He knows how to keep track
of the stitches.

553
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,553
I know. He can now.

554
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,991
Isn't that too much?
You have a bladder infection.

555
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,059
NO WONDER…

556
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,195
You said you'd had a bladder infection.

557
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,698
If you drink this much tea
while you're sitting here and knitting,

558
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,767
will you be okay?

559
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,069
Slide it in there and pull it all the way.

560
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,938
-Can you pull it so it closes up?
-Okay.

561
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,141
It really turned into a ball.

562
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,876
It's good.

563
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,977
FINISHED THE FACE TOO

564
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,112
He did it.

565
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,213
-Wow!
-How cute!

566
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,081
I knit this.

567
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,950
Garrette.

568
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,017
Garrette.

569
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,686
Jarrette, this is Garrette.

570
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,789
WHAT?

571
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,225
-How much would you sell that for?
-This?

572
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,193
I only just made it,
and you want me to sell it?

573
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,395
My gosh. What are you doing?

574
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,365
I just made it. How can I sell it? Okay.

575
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,500
30,000 won.

576
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,602
NO ONE WOULD BUY IT

577
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,871
It's all done.

578
00:18:58,937 --> 00:18:59,938
MADE A BROACH TOO

579
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,240
I'll wear it like this.

580
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,041
-How cute.
-Isn't it nice?

581
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,376
It looks all right.

582
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,844
NEWBIE'S LIMITED EDITION

583
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,412
-Not bad.
-It looks cute.

584
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,514
-It's so cute.
-Right?

585
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,581
VERY SATISFIED

586
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,583
I just finished the hat.

587
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,085
You finished it today?

588
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,086
-Yes.
-Awesome.

589
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,454
FINISHED THE KNIT HAT

590
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,956
-How adorable.
-How cute. It looks good on you.

591
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,558
-Now you'll go to the ski resort.
-Yes.

592
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,527
-It's perfect for the ski resort.
-Yes.

593
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,661
Thirty.

594
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,629
-What?
-Thirty.

595
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,997
SELL IT TO ME FOR 30,000 WON

596
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,532
-300,000.
-Sell it to me.

597
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,767
I'll sell it for 300,000.

598
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,335
For 300,000 won?

599
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,436
Jeez.

600
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,139
That little thing was 30,000 won.

601
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,575
HAHAHAHA

602
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,776
LAUGHING AWKWARDLY

603
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,812
WHAT I MADE IS PRECIOUS

604
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,782
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
13:30 LUNCH

605
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,850
A PESCATARIAN LUNCH

606
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,353
You asked us to prepare
a pescatarian meal.

607
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,555
Why did you want this?

608
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,456
If we don't set that limit,

609
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,260
people will bring
things like tteokbokki or pizza.

610
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,264
Because we stay seated
for a long time while knitting,

611
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,435
it doesn't feel so great
when we eat something heavy like that.

612
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,404
I thought it would be good for us

613
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,106
to enjoy something a little healthier.

614
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,841
-You want healthy food.
-Yes.

615
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,610
I was wondering.

616
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,312
While you are knitting,

617
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,148
what kind of words piss you off?

618
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,383
Think about the things you said today.

619
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,451
WHAT KNITTERS HATE

620
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,554
You were the perfect example
of people that knitters hate.

621
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,855
Is it for me?

622
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,090
No, it's for me.

623
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,491
I'll wear them when you're done.

624
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,626
1. JUST GIVE IT TO ME

625
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,896
It would be better to buy this
at a store when it's on sale.

626
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,831
But it's not like we're doing this

627
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,766
-because we don't have money.
-Right.

628
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,001
Is she peeved?

629
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,236
PEEVED?

630
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,171
Look at how she got worked up
at what I said!

631
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,573
I slightly peeved her,
and she reacted strongly.

632
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,175
You peeved all of us.

633
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,509
You're right.

634
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,545
I peeved you all. I apologize.

635
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,146
I didn't know, but now I do.

636
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,881
Tell me what I shouldn't say.

637
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,386
It would be nice if everyone
put themselves in our shoes.

638
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,488
For example, you wouldn't go fishing

639
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,057
because you don't have
the money to buy fish, right?

640
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,259
It's just a hobby.

641
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,462
-I wish they would accept this as a hobby.
-Right.

642
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,765
But some people think we do it
because we're broke.

643
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,867
They think we're darning our clothes.

644
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,770
They think you're darning your clothes
because you're broke?

645
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,106
It's fun to complete a garment,

646
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,608
-but it's the process that we enjoy.
-Right.

647
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,045
We knit because we want to
enjoy the process.

648
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,215
When I first saw the clothes you made,

649
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,818
I thought you could do it
because you're skilled.

650
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,954
But now that I've tried it,

651
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,157
I realize how difficult
it would've been to make them.

652
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,258
I admire you.

653
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,359
I'm wearing my life.

654
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,094
-I know.
-My life is woven into this.

655
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,263
So much time goes into this.

656
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,299
It took me two hours to knit this.

657
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,335
If anyone asks me for it,
I don't think I can give it.

658
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,771
It truly is a cool hobby.

659
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,774
You can do it if you want to
do something in your spare time.

660
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,009
People are on the phone
while watching Netflix,

661
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,478
but knitters would knit
and complete something

662
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,248
while watching Netflix.

663
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,484
I think it's more productive
and efficient.

664
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:04,790
Knitting alone is definitely fun,
but knitting with others is fun too.

665
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,525
If you chat for a few hours
with other knitters,

666
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,960
you feel relaxed and great afterward.
