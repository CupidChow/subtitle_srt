1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,304
A BIRD BREAKS ITS EGG
TO COME OUT

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:05,939
THE EGG IS ITS ENTIRE WORLD

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,276
IT MUST DESTROY ITS WORLD
TO BE BORN

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,980
THIS IS ABOUT A BIRD
THAT BROKE OUT OF ITS EGG

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:18,618
TO IMMERSE ITSELF
IN THE CLUB WORLD

00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,858

NEWBIE IN THE CLUB
APPEARS AT HANGANG RIVER

9
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,330
365 days a year, 24 hours a day,

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:34,968
day or night, sitting down or standing up,
you loyally watch Netflix.

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:39,339
Hello, Netflix Club members!

12
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,473
New jerk in the Club?

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,574
No.

14
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,643
Newbie in the Club.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,679
I am Defconn, the newbie in the club.
It's nice to see you.

16
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,815
Hangang River has frozen over.

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,350
Freeze!

18
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,818
It's frozen. Freeze!

19
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,154
What am I doing here
in this freezing weather?

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,122
This is very popular these days, isn't it?

21
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,725
I am at the Mecca for runners.

22
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,361
It is time to meet those
who are mad about running.

23
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,463
What do they like so much about running

24
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,566
that makes them do it
consistently and diligently?

25
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,669
I will observe them
with the eyes of a bird.

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,372
Then, shall we run over there?

27
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,307
Running.

28
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,143

00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,980
There they are.

31
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,282
Guys!

32
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,150
Someone's coming. No?

33
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,618
He's coming.

34
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,087
Is it Defconn?

35
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:30,490
SCREAMING

36
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,827
ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME

37
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,195
-Nice to meet you!
-Hello!

38
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:40,033
THE MEMBERS HAVE
UNUSUALLY HIGH ENERGY

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,968
Who is the president of this club?

40
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,670
The president?

41
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,105
-That's me.
-Are you the president?

42
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,272
-Yes.
-Here.

43
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,608
I brought you something.

44
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,076
Is there something in there?

45
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,411
Yes, it feels heavy.

46
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,712
Who are you, Pikachu?

47
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,947
SHINING BRIGHT IN WINTER

48
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,382
You wore a new jacket, didn't you?

49
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,017
Is he usually energetic like this?

50
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,686
-Yes.
-I see. Pikachu…

51
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:00,820
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

52
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,122
He might shoot bolts soon.

53
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,923
What is wrong with him?

54
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,726
THERE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS
THE ENERGY OF BEING ELECTRIFIED

55
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,562
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
12:20 SELF INTRODUCTION

56
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,233
First of all, can you
introduce your club, President?

57
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,537
We are called Toktok Hare Club.

58
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,239
A CLUB FOR RUNNERS FORMED BY FRIENDS

59
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,807
BORN IN 1987, THE YEAR OF THE HARE

60
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,542
I'm Lee Ji-hong. Nice to meet you.

61
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,010
President Lee Ji-hong.

62
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,612
I've been running for six months.

63
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,515
I am the youngest of the club,
Newbie Son Ye-seul.

64
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,582
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi, Ye-seul.

65
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,351
-The youngest at six months.
-Yes.

66
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,252
I see.

67
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,822
Hello, I was Yeong-suk
in season four of I am SOLO.

68
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,323
My name is Park Jung-rim.

69
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,858
-What?
-I am SOLO.

70
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,793
I was in season four of I am SOLO.

71
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,496
OH MY GOSH!

72
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,631
I MET SOMEONE FROM A TV SHOW!

73
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,598
Yeong-suk.

74
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,699
That's me. Hello.

75
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,434
-You got married.
-That's right.

76
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,003
-Hello.
-This is awesome!

77
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,039
-Wait, your husband isn't here.
-He's not.

78
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,140
He's watching the baby.

79
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,575
-He's watching the baby?
-Yes.

80
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,476
Yeong-suk.

81
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,280
She made dolls for the hosts of I am SOLO.

82
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,916
-You remember. That's right.
-She made that with us.

83
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,150
Are you a member?

84
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,485
-Yes.
-Really?

85
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:10,690
There are so many great people here,
but she found her love somewhere else.

86
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,660
All you did was exercise in this club.

87
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:18,198
Hello, I am the vitamin, the endorphin,
and the radiating light of Toktok.

88
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,200
I am handsome Charles.

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,335
I am so embarrassed.

90
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,504
-He makes me cringe.
-I like it.

91
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,372
Someone like him must come on I am SOLO.

92
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,108
STREET CASTING

93
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,510
I want to!

94
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,779
I get a Gwang-su vibe from you.

95
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,914
-Isn't he Gwang-su?
-I get that a lot.

96
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:35,815
HUMAN VITAMIN GWANG-SU

97
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,850
By the way, are you single?

98
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:38,785
Yes.

99
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,819
I'll apply.

100
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,754
No, I mean… I can tell why you are though.

101
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,089
I get it.

102
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,425
Wait, so you're Pikachu. Is he Squirtle?

103
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,327
Water cannon!

104
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:53,166
From what I can tell at a glance,
you guys are not obsessed with equipment.

105
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,567
Who has carbon plate shoes on?

106
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,369
The six-month-old member.

107
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,671
SHE HAS THE EQUIPMENT OF A PRO

108
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,940
I saw Mr. Hwang Young-cho on YouTube

109
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:05,245
and he said you should not wear
carbon plated shoes unless you're a pro.

110
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,779
You could get injured.

111
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,816
I think she may have some other reason.

112
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,618
-She has a reason for wearing it?
-She has.

113
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,319
DISCOVERED SOMETHING

114
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,054
Are you two dating?

115
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,956
The two of you?

116
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,291
It has only been six months.

117
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,225
Are you insane?

118
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:20,693
You bastard!

119
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,497
We'll hear about how they met
at the wrap-up gathering.

120
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,033
Can you brief us on our schedule today?

121
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,070
Jamsugyo Bridge is the typical course
for runners.

122
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,739
We will go that way.

123
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:33,640
-That way?
-Yes.

124
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,509
We'll go to Hannam Interchange and back.

125
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:41,147
JAMSUGYO BRIDGE, HANNAM INTERCHANGE,
SEVIT ISLAND, HANGANG RIVER

126
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,482
We'll run five kilometers.

127
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,117
-Five kilometers?
-Yes.

128
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,952
-Is that too short?
-Shall we run more?

129
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:46,853
-Ten?
-No.

130
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:47,820
You see…

131
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:48,888
HESITANT

132
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,791
I usually come to Hangang River
and run two kilometers.

133
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,727
Of those 2 kilometers,

134
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,062
I walk for 1 kilometer,

135
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,230
run 500 meters,

136
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,000
and I do breathing exercise
as I walk the last 500 meters.

137
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,235
That's because you were alone.

138
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,803
You'll be okay if you run with us.

139
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,505
-If we run together?
-You can run five kilometers.

140
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,873
It'll be totally fine.

141
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,574
Comradeship.

142
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,876
No.

143
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,244
I can't do it.

144
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,648
You see, don't overdo it
just because you joined the club.

145
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,616
I can't overdo it.

146
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,551
Without overdoing it,

147
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:23,589
I'll closely observe this club's activity.

148
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,426
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
12:40 WARMING UP

149
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,727
-Lunges.
-One, two…

150
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,363
MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH PIKACHU

151
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,198
Don't let your knees splay.

152
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,566
-One, two.
-One, two.

153
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,901
You're doing well.

154
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,136
FLUTTERING WINGS ENCOURAGED BY COMPLIMENTS

155
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,272
Two, three, four.

156
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,307
-Your knees.
-They have to touch.

157
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,642
-Three!
-Three!

158
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,677
ENDING IT ON HIS OWN

159
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,745
Done. Gosh.

160
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,747
I shouldn't have joined this club.

161
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,182
EXHAUSTED JUST WITH THE WARM-UP

162
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,550
Let's make groups.

163
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,718
Pay attention.

164
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,453
We will divide into two groups.

165
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,755
Group one will run faster,
and two will go slower.

166
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,358
You see, they are the ones
that will help you, Defconn.

167
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,693
They will be my pacers during the run.

168
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,828
-Yes.
-Okay.

169
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,496
We will make you run.

170
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,132
I won't get lost because of him.

171
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,434
-Pika…
-Chu!

172
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,970
-Squirtle…
-Water cannon!

173
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,605
READY TO RUN WITH POKÉMON

174
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,441
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
13:00 START RUNNING

175
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,276
-We'll get going first.
-See you.

176
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,244
GROUP 1 SETS OFF

177
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,579
You got this!

178
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,681
-Let's start up there.
-Let's do this!

179
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,283
-Here we go.
-Let's start.

180
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,184
Start what?

181
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,019
Your watch. Check your pace.

182
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,554
Get the GPS ready.

183
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,457
I haven't exercised in a while.
Let me start my watch.

184
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,759
SMART WATCH DOES ITS WORK

185
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,260
Is it right to do this?

186
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,195
My heart rate!

187
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,397
It's at 130.

188
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,265
-130?
-What on earth?

189
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,867
We'll run until it goes up to 200.

190
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,735
200? Are you kidding me?

191
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,970
My heart will explode.

192
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:44,971
Like music beats.

193
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,006
One, two.

194
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,307
ENTERING JAMSUGYO BRIDGE

195
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,177
This is what you meant
by enjoying the view while you run.

196
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,913
We are going to run
about five kilometers today.

197
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,149
We will cross Jamsugyo Bridge and

198
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,383
-turn right…
-We are…

199
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,253
We're going too slow!

200
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,088
Our pace is at 7:30.

201
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,223
Let's increase our pace a little.

202
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,858
Our pace is 7:30.

203
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,160
It's too slow.

204
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,594
What is a pace?

205
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,662
What is 7:30?

206
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,864
We're going a kilometer
in 7 minutes, 30 seconds.

207
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,466
No, we'll run it in 15 minutes.

208
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,368
No, we will feel cold then.

209
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,269
No.

210
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,537
Let's go! We can do it!

211
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,605
-Let's go, Defconn!
-Let's go!

212
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,107
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

213
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,242
Good grief. This is…

214
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,811
You guys are herding sheep.

215
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,012
Let's go! You can do it!

216
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,649
There is only 1 sheep,
but there are 7 Border Collies.

217
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,883
TOKTOK MEMBERS HERD THE NEW BIRDIE

218
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,084
You guys are herding me.

219
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,288
RUNNING FAST

220
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,523
The staff is running fast.

221
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,758
You can do it!

222
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,860
Camera up front!

223
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,295
Wait. I'm…

224
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,362
I'm about to fart.

225
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,263
You can fart!

226
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,164
RUNNING STIMULATES
BOWEL MOVEMENT

227
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,966
-While I'm running--
-Photo!

228
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,301
Photo on the left.

229
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,268
-Where?
-There.

230
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,838
Make the Toktok sign. Do it.

231
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,406
Do the Toktok sign. Do the hand sign.

232
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,574
Toktok!

233
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,175
-Toktok!
-What is this?

234
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,144
It's for the year of the Hare.

235
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,012
EACH CLUB HAS
THEIR OWN HAND SIGN

236
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,047
We can do it.

237
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,849
-There's an incline.
-Almost there.

238
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:07,386
ENTERING A DIFFICULT INCLINE
FROM THE START

239
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,722
Wait. Wait.

240
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,858
It's happening.

241
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,259
He got the runner's high.

242
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,994
Did you get it?

243
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,129
I got it. I got the runner's high.

244
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,564
He got the runner's high.

245
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,167
I got the runner's high.

246
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,002
I got it. I got the runner's high.

247
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,072
You can't get it now. It's an incline.

248
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,240
-One, two.
-One, two.

249
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,475
THE CRAZY NEWBIE FEELS
RUNNER'S HIGH ON AN INCLINE

250
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,011
-One, two.
-We're almost there.

251
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,346
We're almost there.

252
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,780
ENCOURAGING HIM TO KEEP GOING

253
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,215
We're at the top. We can go down now.

254
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,050
He's running well.

255
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,118
He is running well.

256
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,620
He's doing much better.

257
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,821
Let's turn right.

258
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,822
-Make the Toktok sign!
-Photo!

259
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,056
Toktok sign!

260
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,491
Photo, photo!

261
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,727
TAKING PICTURES DURING THE RUN!

262
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,495
DON'T FREAK OUT

263
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,297
How can you talk while you run?

264
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,965
How can you all talk while you run?

265
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,334
Because we are running slower than usual.

266
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,502
-Look at them.
-This is slow?

267
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,637
-Yes.
-This is?

268
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,704
NEWBIE-FRIENDLY PACE

269
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,740
-To the right side.
-We passed seven minutes.

270
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:01,741
Let's stay on the right.

271
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,276
-To the right.
-To the right.

272
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,911
Wait. I got it.

273
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,312
I got my second runner's high.

274
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,914
Oh, my! Excellent!

275
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,549
RUNNER'S HIGH HITS HIM IN THE FACE

276
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,417
The sunlight feels warm, doesn't it?

277
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,119
How many kilometers?

278
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,687
We almost ran a kilometer.

279
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,022
Already a kilometer.

280
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,090
-One kilometer?
-Yes.

281
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,825
We'll run one more and turn around.

282
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,826
Wait. My stomach hurts.

283
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,794
It's all right.

284
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,696
Fart. The person behind you
may hate it, but…

285
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,897
No, please don't.

286
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:25,932
-Should I fart?
-No.

287
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,266
-You can fart.
-Gas, gas!

288
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,334
Watch out for gas.

289
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,235
Look.

290
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,336
CLOSE THE GAS VALVE BEFORE LEAVING

291
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,371
-Do you see the scenery?
-Freeze!

292
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:36,042
Why do you like running so much?

293
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:36,943
First of all…

294
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,845
You can run regardless of the season.

295
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,181
You can run in both hot and cold weather.

296
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,083
Did you like running from the start?

297
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,218
-What?
-Did you always like it?

298
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,787
You must've tried out other clubs, right?

299
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,622
I can't hear you.

300
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,991
It seems like you're out of breath.

301
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,327
He asked what other clubs you've tried.

302
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,629
-Keep it up.
-Keep it up.

303
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,863
They cheer for us.

304
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,365
-Keep it up.
-Keep it up.

305
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,800
Runners are coming on the left.

306
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,168
IT'S NICE TO SAY HI TO OTHER CLUBS

307
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,769
Have you ever run at this hour?

308
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,704
No.

309
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,639
-Have you run along Hangang River?
-No.

310
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,308
-Have you recently run two kilometers?
-No.

311
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,711
You'll have good luck in 2025.

312
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,212
How did you end up there?

313
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,780
You did something totally new.

314
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,582
-You already ran two kilometers.
-Yes.

315
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,151
I've only done a 500-meter run before.

316
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,086
You didn't give up.

317
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:20,987
CONFIDENCE GOES UP

318
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,055
Nice speed.

319
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,390
You're doing good.

320
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,992
No over-pacing!

321
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,461
You surprised me just now.

322
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,362
Watch your step.

323
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,463
CARROT-AND-STICK APPROACH

324
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,864
PEACEFUL LEADING GROUP

325
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,733
-Not bad.
-It's really long.

326
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,135
Do you really run 30 kilometers every day?

327
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,870
Yes, I run 20 kilometers
early in the morning.

328
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:38,871
HE USUALLY RUNS 30 KM

329
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,306
You're amazing.

330
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,442
-This area is so pretty.
-I know.

331
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,078
-I haven't been here in so long.
-It's really frozen.

332
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:46,979
ENJOYING THE VIEW AS WELL

333
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,915
ALL YOU CAN HEAR HERE IS
HEAVY BREATHING

334
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,884
Oh, lord.

335
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,252
Father.

336
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,820
Feel the sunlight.

337
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,255
How warm. Look to your right.

338
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,691
I CAN'T LOOK

339
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,459
Who decided on five kilometers?

340
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,894
Good job. Maintain your pace!

341
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:02,928
Watch the pigeons!

342
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,829
Move.

343
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,098
Don't chase them away. They're my friends.

344
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,733
-They're my friends.
-I hate them.

345
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,634
Don't be scared.

346
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,803
That's why there are
so many pigeons today.

347
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,104
THEN, HIP-HOP PIGEON
NOW, NEW BIRDIE

348
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,074
They're here to welcome you.

349
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,843
BIRD FRIENDS GATHER TO
CHEER FOR NEWBIE IN THE CLUB

350
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,545
You got this!

351
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,479
-You got this!
-You got this!

352
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,480
LEADERS WAITING IN THE HALFWAY POINT

353
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,648
You got this, Defconn!

354
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,483
-You got this, Defconn!
-You got this!

355
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,118
We're at the halfway point!

356
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,422
THE 2.5 KM POINT
ARRIVED AT THE HALFWAY POINT

357
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,025
HIS LEGS GIVE OUT
AT THE HALFWAY POINT

358
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,527
We have to go back right away.

359
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,561
No resting.

360
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,629
SEARCHING FOR A CHAIR FIRST

361
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,064
No, you shouldn't sit down.

362
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,031
Don't sit!

363
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,367
-Don't sit down!
-Don't sit down!

364
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,835
You can't.

365
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,437
I can't go back right away.

366
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,572
Take deep breaths.

367
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,873
Water. Give him some water.

368
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,709
DIFFICULTY BREATHING AFTER
RUNNING 2.5 KM

369
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,612
Why are there so many pigeons near you?

370
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,147
They're my cheerleaders.

371
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,351
NEWBIE! A BIRD DOESN'T
LOOK BACK WHEN IT RUNS

372
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,686
Let's go.

373
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,088
-We got this!
-Let's go!

374
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,056
IT'S TOO SHORT FOR OTHER MEMBERS

375
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,758
TO FEEL RUNNER'S HIGH

376
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,894
-Photo.
-Photo.

377
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,931
THEIR STEPS ARE WAY MORE ADVANCED

378
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,599
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

379
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,934
NEWBIE'S GROUP
GETS READY TO FOLLOW

380
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,103
Can we do something
about this dangling thing?

381
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,237
It dangles too much.

382
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,538
SHE WAS CONSTANTLY BOTHERED
BY HIS MICROPHONE

383
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,873
Why are you looking at it?

384
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,542
It really stands out from the back.

385
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,411
Why do you keep looking at my behind?

386
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,247
It keeps getting in my line of sight.

387
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,248
Really?

388
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,149
Okay. Let's go.

389
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,117
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

390
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,284
Stay to the left.

391
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,521
If it dangles too much,
it'll be tough for the newbie.

392
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,089
I'm just looking out for the new member.

393
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,057
Really?

394
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,559
I wasn't trying to stare at your behind.

395
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,362
I have my standards too, you know.

396
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,563
What's wrong with my butt?

397
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,233
What's wrong with my butt? Geez.

398
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,868
You go ahead of me.

399
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,202
I want to run at the back.

400
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,371
Are you going back there to fart?

401
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,241
I'm going to fart, okay?

402
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,675
IF YOU MUST FART,
GO TO THE BACK

403
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,578
THEY RUN PAST HIM
AT THE THREAT OF A FART

404
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,548
My boyfriend is the president of the club

405
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,750
He is a totally cool guy

406
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,152
My song is

407
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,089
-being written on the spot
-Stay to the left.

408
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,524
Hey, we can go faster.

409
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,659
He's singing,
so it must not be tough for him.

410
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,227
-We'll increase the pace.
-No.

411
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,862
No, no, no.

412
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,597
How many kilometers so far?

413
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,266
Three kilometers. We have two to go.

414
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,801
-Really?
-Single file.

415
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,235
-Single file.
-Single file.

416
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,236
Single file.

417
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,038
It's happening now.

418
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,940
He got another runner's high. Wow!

419
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:28,908
No, you can do it.

420
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,543
-Show us.
-You can do it.

421
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,745
Can you see Jamsugyo Bridge?
You can make it.

422
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,714
HANG IN THERE, NEWBIE

423
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,050
-You're handsome.
-That's right.

424
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,152
His face is looking slimmer.

425
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,421
-You can see his jawline.
-He's right.

426
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,957
He looked handsome earlier from this side.

427
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,327
I can see his jawline
poking out of the neck warmer.

428
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,829
-We passed four kilometers.
-Four.

429
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,831
-Four kilometers already?
-Just go over the incline.

430
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:52,765
RAN 4 KM SO FAR, 1 KM LEFT

431
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,800
CROSSING THE BRIDGE IS ALL THAT'S LEFT
TO FINISH THE RUN

432
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,036
Watch out for the obstacles.

433
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,838
This is your last hurdle.

434
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,172
Catch your breath.

435
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,841
We just have to go over the hill.

436
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,676
THE JAMSUGYO BRIDGE'S INCLINE IS BACK

437
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,244
-One, two.
-Here we go.

438
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,446
HE IS LOSING HIS SOUL IN REAL TIME

439
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,282
You can do it.

440
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,185
NEW BIRDIE IS SAD HE CAN'T FLY

441
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,486
Photo to the left.

442
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,788
-Hare.
-Last photo.

443
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356
-Do the hand sign.
-The photographer.

444
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,390
Hand sign.

445
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,525
PIKACHU RAISES HIS HAND FOR HIM

446
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,494
THEY SHOULD BE CALLED PHOTOTOK,
NOT TOKTOKS AT THIS RATE

447
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,662
Smile.

448
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,663
WAITING TO HIGH FIVE THEM

449
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,798
You're almost there.

450
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,366
-To the end!
-Let's go!

451
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,168
-You got this!
-To the end!

452
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,438
NEWBIE COMPLETES HIS FIRST 5 KM RUN!

453
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,507
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

454
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,475
-Good job.
-Well done.

455
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,477
-Breathe.
-You did so well.

456
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,916
HE COMPLETED HIS RUN
WITH THE CHEERS FROM THE BIRDS

457
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,887
I ran five kilometers
for the first time in my life.

458
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,056
I am not myself right now. Gosh.

459
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,892
I did not do this.

460
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,293
They did this.

461
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,796
I see why they have to run together.

462
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,665
You can never run this much by yourself.

463
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,566
THEY MOTIVATE EACH OTHER

464
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,234
I can see why they run together.

465
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,371
Gosh.

466
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,972
I need to cool down some more.

467
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,941
PATHETIC MOVE OF NEW BIRDIE
WHO RAN BECAUSE IT CAN'T FLY

468
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,376
We're done with the exercise, right?

469
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,277
Yes.

470
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,745
I'll hit "Finish Exercise."

471
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,548
I haven't completed the rings in ages.

472
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,516
WRAPS UP AS FAST AS HE CAN

473
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,651
Well done, everyone.

474
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,319
-Cool down?
-Cool down stretch.

475
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,987
We're cooling down? Nice.

476
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,689
We should do that. My back hurts.

477
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,324
Fold your left shoulder.

478
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,959
Then, do one on the other side.

479
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,360
This is how you stretch.

480
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,461
Yes, it is.

481
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,729
Go up and down.

482
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,366
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

483
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,770
Did anyone get injured
during the run today?

484
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,138
I'll have to see tomorrow.

485
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,439
You don't look well. Are you okay?

486
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,074
I'll find out tomorrow morning.

487
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,142
To the wrap-up gathering.

488
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,209
Let's go.

489
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,311
-Let's go!
-Let's go.

490
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,147
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
14:00 WRAP-UP GATHERING

491
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,315
Good job, everybody.

492
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,283
Good job.

493
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,353
I experienced a miracle,
thanks to you guys.

494
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,521
How was it?

495
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,823
It was exhausting during the run,
but in the end,

496
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,696
I realized that I accomplished
something new in my life.

497
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,297
-It's a cycle of forgetting and repeating.
-I'm sorry?

498
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,232
-That's why we do it all over again.
-That's why?

499
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,068
-That is the beauty of running.
-Yes.

500
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:13,005
I was wondering,
why is your club called Toktok Hare Club?

501
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,873
When I first made the club,

502
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,442
I wanted to run with my friends

503
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,278
so I named it Toktok
as we were born in the year of the Hare.

504
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,213
Because of the year of the Hare.

505
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,049
I thought it was because you like talking.

506
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,617
We are good at that too though.

507
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,386
We talk while we run.

508
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,221
We don't talk while we run!

509
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,522
I doubt that's all you did.

510
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,690
I know, right?

511
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,926
-He hit on a girl too.
-I had no clue.

512
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,627
His heart raced as well.

513
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,795
Yes, his heart raced.

514
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,265
She asked you out first, right?

515
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,768
She asked me out,
but I confessed my feelings first.

516
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,103
-Wow.
-Hey.

517
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,571
Do you have pet names?

518
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:46,739
Princess and Prince.

519
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,806
SHE HATES IT

520
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,508
HE HATES IT TOO

521
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,876
If I need something, I'd ask,

522
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,312
"Is there a prince from a neighboring
kingdom who can help me?"

523
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,947
I CAN'T WATCH

524
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,248
Then, he'd say, "Me."

525
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,017
And he would help me out.

526
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,218
Must we keep going?

527
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,719
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY LONGER

528
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,222
-It's draining to listen to.
-This is too much.

529
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,757
We're not normally like this.

530
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,859
This is way more draining than running.

531
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,294
Why do you like Toktok the most?

532
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,132
I tried out many clubs when I moved here,

533
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,134
but there weren't any that welcomed me.

534
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,568
I wonder why.

535
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,937
Think about it.
Why do you think that happened?

536
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:22,408
I joined them
purely because I wanted to run.

537
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,710
Then, someone recommended this club to me.

538
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,678
I was told
that I could make it at Toktok Club

539
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,214
as I was born in the year of the Hare.

540
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,050
They forced you into this club.

541
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,152
-So this is where you've decided to stay?
-Yes.

542
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,953
I have lasted a long time here.

543
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,989
The fact that he said
he lasted a long time

544
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,424
means that he is still nervous.

545
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,459
I have shown up diligently

546
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,860
and if the president isn't happy,

547
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:42,995
I stay quiet.

548
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,664
I'm mindful of how the president feels.

549
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,666
May I ask what you do for work?

550
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,001
What do you do?

551
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,135
-Our jobs?
-Yes.

552
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,304
You see, everybody has their own job,

553
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,140
but you got together
because of your shared interest.

554
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,508
What do you do, Pikachu?

555
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,445
I am most curious about him.

556
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,313
-He works for a coffee company.
-A famous coffee franchise.

557
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,915
Where? Starbucks?

558
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:03,982
PARK JONG-HWAN
STARBUCKS EMPLOYEE

559
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,350
Really?

560
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,920
I am the host of Starbucks' YouTube show.

561
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,356
That explains why
you seemed so experienced.

562
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,358
Whenever there's an event,
I would host it.

563
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,094
So you're like a minstrel beggar.

564
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,495
-That's right.
-You do everything.

565
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,763
Yes, that's right.

566
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,364
-You're a minstrel beggar.
-Yes.

567
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,866
I'm in the financial industry.

568
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,201
-Finance?
-Let me know if you need my help.

569
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,070
He'd be great with clients.

570
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,004
-He's friendly.
-He is.

571
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:26,905
Right?

572
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,740
He hosted one of our events
during our trip.

573
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,209
-And he did a great job.
-Yes.

574
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,977
-It was so fun.
-I'm sure he did a great job.

575
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,145
He takes care of us.

576
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,782
There has to be a variety of characters
for a club to run smoothly.

577
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,150
-There must be a variety.
-Yes.

578
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,553
I am a sports model and a photographer.

579
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,188
You seem like the Chanel type.

580
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,491
I wish I was.

581
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,793
Chanel would like your look.

582
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,561
Does running help with stress?

583
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,996
It helps so much.

584
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,998
It clears your mind of
distracting thoughts.

585
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,968
I started running
after I got dumped by my ex-boyfriend.

586
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,004
Who dumped you?

587
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,572
Who's that jerk?

588
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,274
How dare he do that
to such a perfect person?

589
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,042
What did that man do for work?

590
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,545
-He was studying for the civil exam.
-The civil exam?

591
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,313
Did he dump you after he passed?

592
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,284
After we broke up,
he got another girlfriend in two months.

593
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,420
He passed the exam
and got a new girlfriend.

594
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,588
It must have been hard.

595
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,757
But I am actually thankful

596
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,627
because he was the reason
I started running.

597
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,128
It must have been such a huge shock,

598
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,664
but you were able to get over it
through running, right?

599
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,468
I was so happy
that we broke up in the end.

600
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,836
That's how it turned out.

601
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,604
Since he was studying,

602
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,107
I couldn't go anywhere
and had to stay at home.

603
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,143
But after we broke up,
I never stay at home.

604
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,078
Look at the camera

605
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,747
and tell him what you need to say.

606
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,849
Yes, do it.

607
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,717
-Just say what you wanted to say.
-Yes.

608
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,853
Honestly, there's nothing to say.

609
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,455
I even thanked him afterwards.

610
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,725
Thank you for breaking up with me.

611
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,927
GET OVER A BREAK-UP WITH RUNNING

612
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,562
That was so cool.

613
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,930
You're awesome.

614
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,698
HER CASUAL COOL MADE HIM FLAP HIS WINGS

615
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,066
That was seriously awesome.

616
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,801
IF YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A BREAK-UP,
JOIN THE RUNNING CLUB

617
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,936
Awesome.

618
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,237
LIFE IS A JOURNEY YOU TAKE ALONE

619
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,206
-Thank you.
-Eat up.

620
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,675
Where do you usually go
for the wrap-up gathering?

621
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,076
I like Subway.

622
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,578
Subway? How wholesome.

623
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,512
He loves Subway.

624
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,048
We usually meet up
at eight in the evening,

625
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,983
and we're done by around nine or ten,

626
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,619
so we prefer something we can eat fast.

627
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,720
Where do you guys usually meet?

628
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,921
Where we met today…

629
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:23,989
-Banpo?
-Yes.

630
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,991
We meet at the tracks at a sports complex.

631
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,092
Namsan Mountain.

632
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,194
Do you run up Namsan Mountain?

633
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,162
-Yes.
-Yes.

634
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,296
That incline?

635
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,865
We run up there, and there's a trail too.

636
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:34,866
We run there too.

637
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,903
Are there any habits
you developed while running?

638
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,405
When I look at the GPS
while stuck in traffic,

639
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,976
I often think running would be faster.

640
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,911
He usually runs to our spot.

641
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,012
-Yes.
-From his home.

642
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,580
-He runs up to 10 km.
-I came here by running.

643
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,781
Where do you live?

644
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:50,816
Sinchon.

645
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,050
You came from Sinchon?

646
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,185
Yes.

647
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,620
UNFAZED

648
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,221
That's awesome.

649
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,422
Sinchon to here?

650
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,724
Are you going to run back home?

651
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,058
No, I don't run after eating.

652
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,227
HE HAS HIS OWN STRICT RULES

653
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,328
Why not?

654
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,963
-Because of stomachaches?
-Yes.

655
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,866
I usually run about 20 km in a day.

656
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,969
Public transportation is
crowded after work

657
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,604
and the traffic is very bad,

658
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,508
but if I run instead,
I can exercise and save time as well.

659
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,311
I usually run to most places,

660
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,013
except for days I have a blind date.

661
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:21,913
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

662
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,151
My prince is very serious about running,
so we run even on our days off.

663
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,920
We went to Gangwon-do recently,
and we ran there too.

664
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,589
I heard a lot of you ran in competitions.

665
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,090
All of us here have.

666
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,859
He participated in the most competitions.

667
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:34,860
-Who?
-Him.

668
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,062
He won a prize.

669
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,297
Which ones did you participate in?

670
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,765
-Which ones?
-Yes.

671
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,133
-How many?
-I go every week.

672
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,100
-Every week?
-Yes.

673
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,337
HE'S WEIRD

674
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:49,107
Has anyone participated
in an international competition?

675
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,143
The Berlin Marathon and Chicago Marathon.

676
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,177
How many people are there?

677
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,512
Tens of thousands.

678
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,047
58,000 PARTICIPATED
IN BERLIN MARATHON 2024

679
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,181
That would be a sight.

680
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,583
Why do you go overseas to run?

681
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,452
People travel abroad, right?

682
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,420
It's like traveling.

683
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,723
We go traveling,
but running is the main event.

684
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,792
When someone asks where we want to go,

685
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,261
we would go
where there is a famous competition.

686
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,130
You must all go abroad
once you fall for running.

687
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,367
Even if we can't communicate
or have different cultures with them,

688
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,502
we are connected through running.

689
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,972
It feels different to interact
and run together with them.

690
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,008
I haven't done one yet,
but I would like to,

691
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,178
because I heard they have
the local foods that they prepare there.

692
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,179
-Really?
-Yes.

693
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,182
You'll see sushi and takoyaki
at a competition in Japan.

694
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,249
I see.

695
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,151
You can run slowly as you eat.

696
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,052
That sounds good.

697
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,554
-You get beer in Berlin.
-Yes.

698
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,089
It's a running buffet.

699
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,957
-That's right.
-Yes.

700
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,493
The people that come to cheer
bring snacks as well.

701
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,995
You can eat cookies and gummies
that the children bring.

702
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,231
-Apples too.
-How nice.

703
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,567
Who would you like
to recommend running to?

704
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,202
If you have a busy life

705
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,205
but you want to make
a bit of time to exercise,

706
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,206
running is the best for you.

707
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,107
Right.

708
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,008
You see, I usually ride my bicycle.

709
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,978
I have to wear my clothes, shoes,

710
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,748
helmet and other equipment to ride.

711
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,616
But with running,

712
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,486
you can go right out
after putting on your clothes and shoes.

713
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,854
It's easy to mobilize.

714
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,690
-There is nothing that is more effective.
-Exactly.

715
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,092
I tried running with you all.

716
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,660
-President of the club?
-Yes.

717
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,264
What do you think about me
as a new member?

718
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,499
HESITATING

719
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,600
We have an age limit.

720
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,002
-An age limit?
-Yes.

721
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,303
That's harsh.

722
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,204
There's an age limit?

723
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,439
Those born after 1987.

724
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,507
-Born after 1987?
-Yes.

725
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,575
I think it's your loss though.

726
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:34,012
Shouldn't you have a member
as influential as me?

727
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,815
It would be nice but not necessary.

728
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,450
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

729
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,718
We'd love to have you!

730
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,020
But must we have Defconn?

731
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:42,988
Not really.

732
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,689
That's the same for every club.

733
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,124
We'd love to have you though.

734
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,093
Yes, I got rejected.

735
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,961
Apparently, they have an age limit.

736
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,030
I guess I'll have
to look for another club.

737
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,001
For those who have a very stressful job,
don't relieve it with alcohol.

738
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,503
You'll see the difference
when you try running.

739
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,038
Don't run by yourself.

740
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,106
Now I know for sure.

741
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,307
If you run together,

742
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,709
you can discover
a better version of yourself.

743
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,447
Yes, that's the number one reason
to join this club.

744
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,348
Anybody can do it.

745
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,417
Just put your shoes on, go outside,

746
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,719
and you can start running.
That's what's best about it.

747
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,756
It's more fun and motivating
to run together

748
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,157
than to run by yourself.

749
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,493
You don't need any equipment to help you.

750
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,862
All you need is your two legs to run.

751
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,866
You may wonder whether you can run 10 km,
but you will end up completing the run.

752
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,268
There is a sense
of accomplishment in that.

753
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,436
TOKTOK HARE CLUB
ENTIRE SEOUL AREA

754
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,671
1. NO NEED TO BE BORN
IN YEAR OF THE HARE

755
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,972
2. MANY MEMBERS HAVE DONE

756
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,273

757
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,277
