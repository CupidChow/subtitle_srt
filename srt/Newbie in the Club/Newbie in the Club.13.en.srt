LOCATION: SUWON, GYEONGGI-DO
TIME: 11 A.M.

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,138
-Hello, Netflix.
-Hello.

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,607
What's "dong" in English? Oh, "bronze."

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,376
-"Mi." Beauty.
-"Mi."

5
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,543
-Bronze and beauty.
-"Sae." Bird.

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,481
I'm Defconn,
the host of "Bronze Beauty Bird."

7
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,016
This is the Hip Newbie.

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,117
Hip, hip.

9
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,685
Nice to meet you, everyone.

10
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,887
How have you been, Netflix Club members?

11
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,922
The club that we'll be observing today

12
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,558
is a gathering of global friends
who met in Korea.

13
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,161
It's a friendship-making club
with foreigners.

14
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,196
-Hi!
-Hello!

15
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,765
-Oh, hi!
-Hi!

16
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,834
THE FOREIGN MEMBERS BASHFULLY GREET THEM

17
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:35,969
Nice to meet you.

18
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,773
Can you introduce yourselves?

19
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,808
-Your foreign crew.
-My foreign crew?

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,176
I'm the leader of Fake Buddies.

21
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,244
EDGAR / LEADER

22
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,849
This is our group. We hang out,
we meet both foreigners and Koreans,

23
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,018
and we just mingle together in Korea.

24
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,354
Please slowly, slowly.

25
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,423
NEWBIE WAS TOTALLY LOST

26
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,591
We're just a group that hangs out.

27
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,260
FAKE BUDDIES

28
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,563
SOCIAL CLUB WHERE YOU CAN MEET
PEOPLE OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES

29
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,532
AND VISIT PLACES IN KOREA TOGETHER

30
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,967
Fake Buddies?
So, friends that aren't real?

31
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,004
We are not friends
when we meet for the first time.

32
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,040
We're on a journey to become real friends.

33
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,142
As we meet again and again,

34
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,044
we become real friends.

35
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,846
Okay. Translate for us. Go on.

36
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,549
…UHH…

37
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,484
GIGGLE

38
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,820
Oh, boy. I'm in trouble today.

39
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:27,887
Translate.

40
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,056
Leader,

41
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,658
can you speak Korean?

42
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,259
-Yeah, I can.
-Korean, please.

43
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,595
-You can speak Korean?
-I'm from Busan.

44
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,263
FELT A TWINGE OF BETRAYAL

45
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,598
Oh, sir.

46
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,732
MIN JI-HONG / BUSAN, KOREA

47
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,934
I'm Korean.

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,368
-What the heck?
-I'm pure Korean.

49
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,104
You're a native of Busan,

50
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,873
but you formed a group
consisting of foreigners.

51
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,074
How come?

52
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,210
I wanted to make some foreign friends.

53
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,744
Here comes his dialect.

54
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,947
I looked around various groups.

55
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,549
Those other groups were fun,

56
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,386
but they were mainly for language exchange
and just partying for the day.

57
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,155
I'd say, "See you next time."

58
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,890
-It didn't work out.
-I never saw them again.

59
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,958
SO HE MADE A CLUB

60
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,993
Can the members introduce themselves?

61
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,230
KIM / CHICAGO, USA

62
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,799
Michael Jordan!

63
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,835
-Chicago Bulls!
-Chicago Bulls!

64
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,203
Six championship rings!

65
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,372
A JORDAN FANATIC
MEETS A CHICAGOAN

66
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,809
SHAI / ALABAMA, USA

67
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,446
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER

68
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:32,986
ZOE / AUSTRALIA

69
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,420
I'm a YouTuber!

70
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,022
HAPPY TO SEE HER

71
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,023
And…

72
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,058
Can I guess your name?

73
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,393
Antonio.

74
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,196
BASELESS GUESS OF HIS NAME

75
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,764
Your name is Antonio.

76
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,699
FRANK / NOT ANTONIO

77
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,936
FRANK / NEW JERSEY, USA

78
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,504
-New Jersey!
-New Jersey!

79
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,672
Oh, so hip!

80
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,840
What's your job?

81
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,112
MY ANTONIO IS ACTUALLY A DOCTOR

82
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,847
How long have you lived in Korea?

83
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,453
You like Korea so much
that you visit often?

84
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,525
THE AUSTRALIAN AGREES
THE AMERICAN AGREES

85
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,794
SO DOES THE KOREAN

86
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,130
HAIM / ISRAEL

87
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,831
Israel's "Wailing Wall."

88
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,000
You understand?

89
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,170
I know it because I live in Korea.
A lot of people told me,

90
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,071
"Hey, Wailing Wall."

91
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,507
A COMMON RESPONSE FROM KOREANS

92
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,343
My mom went to the Wailing Wall.

93
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:35,048
When her church people visited Israel,
they all went to the Wailing Wall.

94
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,816
HAIM HAS NO PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING

95
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,918
They're all like, "Father, Father!"

96
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,021
They go on a pilgrimage to Israel.

97
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:46,359
ANDREA / TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

98
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,594
Caribbean?

99
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,696
GLAD TO HEAR A WORD THEY RECOGNIZE

100
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,898
JULIETTE / FRANCE

101
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,433
Bonjour.

102
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,904
-We've used up all the English we know.
-Okay.

103
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,207
Can you ask them why they came to Korea?

104
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,909
When I first came here…

105
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,178
CAN'T BELIEVE MY EARS

106
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,446
Can you speak Korean?

107
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,814
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,549
You speak so well.

109
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,051
I first came here to study,

110
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,120
but I loved Korea so much
that I came back.

111
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,489
-You sound like a baby.
-Doesn't she sound cute?

112
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,092
The teachers always say,
"You're so lovely, Shai!"

113
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,159
I love it.

114
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,828
You're so cute!

115
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,396
Thank you.

116
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,464
How old are you?

117
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,865
I was born in 1999.

118
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,601
SHAI AND SI-AN ARE THE SAME AGE

119
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:33,006
And the professor that I'm close with
gave me my Korean name.

120
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,674
-It's Kim Hye-seong.
-Hye-seong.

121
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,644
-Kim Hye-seong suits you so well.
-Like a shooting star.

122
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,312
Oh, my.

123
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,047
How long have you been learning Korean?

124
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,949
-It has been three years now.
-Three years?

125
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,984
-She speaks so well for three years.
-She does.

126
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,287
-We can't speak English well in that time.
-I know.

127
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,422
How was your English
while you were in school?

128
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,391
I almost used profanity just now.

129
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,593
CULTURE SHOCK

130
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,762
-I apologize.
-You spoke rough English.

131
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,330
-Yes, I did.
-You spoke rough.

132
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,665
You learn bad words first.

133
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,800
-That's how you learn English fast.
-That's true.

134
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,535
In my case…

135
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,836
ADVANCED LEVEL KOREAN SPEAKER

136
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:04,904
"In my case…"

137
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,373
You're Korean, aren't you?

138
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,741
In my case,

139
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,344
it's kind of a long story,
but I'll keep it short.

140
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,413
So fascinating.

141
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,282
I've been interested in Korea
since high school

142
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,417
because of its pop culture.

143
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,786
Especially BoA and Girls' Generation.

144
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,721
-I was of that generation.
-Girls' Generation.

145
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,056
At the time,

146
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:27,260
I realized that I just had to go to Korea.

147
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,829
-So it's because of BoA.
-That's right.

148
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,130
Thanks to BoA.

149
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,498
Thanks to BoA.

150
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:33,900
There are many like him.

151
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,569
-Many people come to Korea because of BTS.
-Right. K-pop.

152
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,706
Then, who is the life of the party
in this club?

153
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,808
-Right here.
-Yes.

154
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,643
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

155
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,977
THEY POINT TO FRANK

156
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,045
-Really?
-Frank.

157
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,914
How does he liven up the atmosphere?

158
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,382
-I dance.
-Dance?

159
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,550
THE DOCTOR WHO DANCES

160
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,218
-Then--
-Show us.

161
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,753
My butt

162
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,523
HE JUST GROOVED A LITTLE
BUT IT LIVENED UP THE GROUP

163
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,891
I go clubbing.

164
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,626
I like to go clubbing.

165
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,261
Which dance club do you go to, Frank?

166
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,063
-In Hongdae.
-Hongdae.

167
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,531
Hongdae. Yeah.

168
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,866
Doesn't Kim liven up the mood too?

169
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,801
When she drinks a bit of alcohol, yes.

170
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,170
He's right.

171
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,339
-I'm a boozehound.
-A boozehound?

172
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,974
How much do you drink?

173
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,576
Three or four?

174
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,945
-Soju?
-Yes.

175
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,416
Meat, soju, meat, soju, meat, soju.

176
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,485
WITH KOREA'S SOUL FOOD,
4 BOTTLES OF SOJU ARE EASY

177
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,120
-Meat, soju, meat, soju?
-Yes.

178
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,355
AFTER THAT IS THE CLUB

179
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,357
-To the club in Hongdae.
-Hongdae people.

180
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,298
-They're so excited about clubbing.
-They are.

Isn't it so pretty?

188
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,848
There are places like this everywhere.

189
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,818
They made access points
around the fortress.

190
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,086
Raise your hand.

191
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,587
-Raise your hand.
-Ta-da.

192
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,789
RAISING THEIR HANDS HIGH

193
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,124
-You don't really have to do it.
-This is fun.

194
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,427
-How adorable.
-We're like kindergarten students.

195

196
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,297
EXCITING "FAKE BUDDIES" PICNIC

197
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,732
Do you know any K-dramas?

198
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,966
-K-dramas?
-K-dramas?

199
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,101
-Yes.

00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,504
-Lovely Runner.
-Do you know Lovely Runner?

202
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,705
He said he liked her there!

203
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,707
-That's right! I know!
-You know that place?

204
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,176
-Do you like Byeon Woo-seok?

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,848
There's a scene shot here.

208
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,650
Right. It's when he says he likes her.

209
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,986
-That's right.
-It's that place, isn't it?

210
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,588
Sol, I like you!

211
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,757
Sun-jae!

212
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,325
SUWON IS FAMOUS AS A FILMING LOCATION

213
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,760
-This is it.
-Is it Lovely Runner?

214
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,795
They sell Sun-jae and Sol's umbrella.

215
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,530
They sell Sol's umbrella.

216
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,066
Isn't it nice that you can
explore new places

217
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,101
-when you gather like this?
-Yes.

218
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,269
-Yes.
-Right.

219
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,804
We went to the Mud Festival too.

220
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,306
-In Boryeong?
-Yes, Boryeong.

221
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,640
You put mud on yourself?

222
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,677
-The Mud Festival is amazing.
-I want to join too.

223
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,912
Where was the best place you went to?

224
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,447
The place you really liked.

225
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,515
Wolmido.

226
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,749
-Wolmido?
-Wolmido!

227
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,951
The Disco Pang Pang tagada.

228
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,619
Did you like that a lot?

229
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,021
-It was really scary.
-Was it scary?

230
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,990
NEXT IS THE FRONT YARD OF A HANOK BUILDING

231
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,325
Are you all ready?

232
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,395
-They play ddakji in Squid Game.
-Yes.

233
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,730
Has anyone tried it?

234
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,065
MOST OF THEM HAVE TRIED IT

235
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,200
-Yes, I've tried it.
-Yes, I have.

236
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,902
-But I'm not good at it.
-I'm not good.

237
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,337
We're not good at it.

238
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,606
Let's compete in teams

239
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,075
and the losing team
must get a forehead flick.

240
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,576
Introduce your team, please.

241
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,812
Suwon's known for its wang galbi.

242
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,414
-Suwon Wang Galbi!
-Suwon Wang Galbi!

243
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,184
-Suwon Avengers!
-Suwon Avengers!

244
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,387
I'm Tony Stark of Suwon Avengers.

245
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,222
WE CAN'T LET THEM BEAT US

246
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,123
What?

247
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,592
Let's do side dish names
for Suwon wang galbi.

248
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,594
I'm Kimchi of Wang Galbi!

249
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,329
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE?

250
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,531
Why kimchi?

251
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,666
Why is that the only thing
that came to mind?

252
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,001
Listen carefully.

253
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,769
First of all,

254
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,372
when you flip
all of your opponent's ddakjis,

255
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,107
-you win.
-Okay.

256
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,575
-Let's go, Hye-seong.
-Okay.

257
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,876
-Go, Hye-seong.
-Come on, Shai.

258
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,578
Hye-seong is fierce! She's our ace!

259
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,180
The new star Hye-seong
that appears like a shooting star.

260
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,017
-Go, Hye-seong.
-Hye-seong.

261
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,052
-Go, Hye-seong.
-Okay. Nice.

262
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,120
Good.

263
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,255
-You can get it.
-You got this!

264
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,323
You got this.

265
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,392
ANDREA CAME TO GET IT

266
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,993
Oh, no.

267
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,361
No, you can't do that.

268
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,763
Leave it.

269
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,499
HYE-SEONG IS SENSITIVE
ABOUT THE DDAKJI PLACEMENT

270
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,102
IT'S A CLEAN FLIP

271
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,170
SHE'S A HIDDEN MASTER

272
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,505
-Okay, good job.
-Well done.

273
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,906
Good job.

274
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,648
2 WIN IN A ROW, USING THE SAME TRICK

275
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,250
-She's good.
-She's a pro.

276
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,552
-She plays so well.
-She really plays well.

277
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,087
I need to go at this point.

278
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,155
I'll go.

279
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,157
-Tony Stark.
-Go, Tony Stark.

280
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,325
-You can do it.
-You got this.

281
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,392
TONY TO SAVE THE DAY

282
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,860
Tony.

283
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,928
You can't do it.

284
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,064
Tony can't do it.

285
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,165
BETTER PRONUNCIATION THAN USUAL

286
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,335
TONY CAN'T DO IT

287
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,636
I think she'll do it.

288
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,137
HER INTIMIDATING POWER

289
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,539
So close.

290
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,773
You're too good.

291
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,642
I tried this in the States.

292
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,444
-In the States?
-Yes.

293
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,145
At King Sejong Institute.

294
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,847
She tried this in the States.

295
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,915
She's a hustler.

296
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:16,983
They've all done it.

297
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,517
-All of you?
-Go for it.

298
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,219
Go for it?

299
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,488
-She must be confident.
-Go for it.

300
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,791
REGAINS HIS KOREAN PRIDE

301
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,926
DEFCONN BEATS THE FOREIGN ACE

302
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:27,827
You're out.

303
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,563
-Okay, I'll try.
-Host versus host.

304
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,731
KIMCHI'S HERE FOR REVENGE

305
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,568
Have a taste of Kimchi!

306
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,069
-Kimchi slap.
-Kimchi slap.

307
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,338
THESE FOREIGNERS EVEN KNOW
ABOUT THE KIMCHI SLAP

308
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,674
Uh, wait.

309
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,377
KIMCHI WASN'T SO SPICY AFTER ALL

310
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,277
It's okay.

311
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,879
-It's okay!
-It's okay.

312
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,048
Gosh, why is this so difficult?

313
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,484
SUWON WANG GALBI'S ZOE IS UP

314
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,219
Darn it!

315
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,286
Darn it?

316
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,855
-What?
-A foreigner just said…

317
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,423
What's going on?

318
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,325
Hang on. That foreigner just…

319
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,293
Didn't she say she was from Australia?

320
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,762
Do they say that over there too?

321
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,331
HYE-SEONG COACHES HER

322
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,732
1. CLOSE YOUR FINGERS

323
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,567
-Hye-seong, you're good.
-And get lower.

324
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,403
2. LOWER YOUR POSTURE

325
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,972
-She has a technique.
-She's the coach.

326
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,407
Hye-seong is better than me.

327
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,076
SADLY, SHE FAILED

328
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,844
Hey, meat and alcohol.

329
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,945
Meat and alcohol.

330
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,547
-You got this.
-Meat and alcohol.

331
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,217
HER TECHNIQUE WORKED

332
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,687
SUWON AVENGERS WIN THE DDAKJI MATCH

333
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,722
You're holding two of these, right?

334
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,225
The team that gets the most inside wins.

335
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,062
SUWON WANG GALBI
ATTEMPTS TO REGAIN THEIR GLORY

336
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,363
You've done this before.

337
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,131
SO CLOSE

338
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,302
HARD TO GET EVEN ONE IN

339
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,603
That was so close.

340
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,572
SUWON AVENGERS TRIES IT OUT AS WELL

341
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,340
Oh no.

342
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,408
The wind?

343
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,010
NEITHER ONE OF THE TEAMS HAS SUCCEEDED

344
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,212
Juliette, relax.

345
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,315
AWFULLY CLOSE

346
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,450
-Give it more speed.
-Yeah.

347
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,851
A little more speed.

348
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,819
SHE DID IT

349
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,886
SUWON AVENGERS WINS

350
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,189
Juliette! That was awesome!

351
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,490
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

352
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,858
GETTING READY
TO GET FLICKED

353
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,393
Game dummies.

354
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,095
THE DUMMIES THAT LOST TWICE

355
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,863
We can't end it like this.

356
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,164
Double or nothing.

357
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,299
No, one more game.

358
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,401
Then, pay for our meal.

359
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,336
Let's try jegichagi.

360
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,771
Okay. Let's do this.

361
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,474
Tell your teammates how to play jegichagi.

362
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,541
-Yes.
-Okay.

363
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,810
I have to teach my teammates?

364
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,911
-You…
-I have.

365
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,246
You have?

366
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,314
Teach us.

367
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,882
SHE SHAMELESSLY LETS HER BE THE COACH

368
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:30,950
I'm exhausted.

369
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,326
A SIMPLE AND CLEAR EXPLANATION

370
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,495
SHE PUTS IT INTO
PRACTICE IMMEDIATELY

371
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,063
-Hey.
-You're so good at it.

372
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,832
-That's right.
-You have to bounce it.

373
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,901
-Give it a bounce.
-She's right.

374
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,469
Here I go.

375
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,072
FRANK SILENTLY MAKES STRIDES

376
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,040
THEY FINALLY HAVE SOME HOPE

377
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,042
-We got this.
-We got this.

378
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,078
All right. Let's go, everybody.

379
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,379
SI-AN GOES FIRST

380
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,447
We can do it.

381
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,650
-Two.
-Two.

382
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,118
-Two.
-Two.

383
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,853
SI-AN DOES 2

384
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,855
She did so well earlier.

385
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,757
EDGAR GOES NEXT

386
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,263
-Three.
-Three?

387
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,697
You have to do it now!

388
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,134
OKAY!

389
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,669
NUMBER 4 ZOE

390
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,771
Two. Two!

391
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,073
-Two!
-Come on. It's two.

392
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,242
DO I LET THEM HAVE IT?

393
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,343
Come on. It's two!

394
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,412
-She did two.
-You did well. Good!

395
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,847
Fine, okay.

396
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,115
You did well.

397
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,316
I thought I only did one.

398
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,084
-You did two.
-Really?

399
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,486
Okay. Juliette is up.

400
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,554
Juliette.

401
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,621
Relax.

402
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,623
-One.
-Hang on.

403
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,525
-Next.
-Slowly.

404
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,660
ANDREA GOT 1

405
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,196
-Okay. Two!
-Two.

406
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,399
THE CORNERED NEWBIE STEPS UP

407
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,368
SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT, TONY STARK

408
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,137
-Your shoes are a bit…
-My shoes are

409
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,239
-not good for this.
-They aren't.

410
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,540
What size do you wear?

411
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,943
-Your feet.
-My shoes? I'm 285 mm.

412
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,177
Come on.

413
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:06,846
Let me try on your sneakers.

414
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:07,913
CHANGING SHOES TO WIN

415
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,315
-The right shoe.
-Oh, the right one.

416
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,184
-Here.
-Hey, these shoes are nice.

417
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,589
-One, two, three, four,
-Two, three, four,

418
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,991
-five, six, seven,
-five, six, seven,

419
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,492
-eight, nine.
-eight, nine.

420
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,529
NOW THAT'S OUR TEAM'S LEADER

421
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,597
NEWBIE GOT 9

422
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,898
That was really awesome.

423
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,633
THE SHOE WAS VERY EFFECTIVE!

424
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,134
-You're really good.
-I got it.

425
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,603
How many more do we need?

426
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,638
How many does
Frank have to do for you to win?

427
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,573
-Six.
-Six.

428
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,443
FRANK NEEDS TO KICK IT
AT LEAST 6 TIMES

429
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,145
Frank is the best on our team.
You didn't know that, did you?

430
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,014
There's a reason why he wore those pants.

431
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,749
Those shoes are made for jegichagi.

432
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,151
It's as if the jegi is drawn to it.

433
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,821
There's a reason
why you put your hair up, Frank.

434
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,360
FRANK ONLY GOT 1

435
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,362
Weren't we on break?

436
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,830
THE RESULT IS HARD TO BELIEVE

437
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,166
SUWON AVENGERS WINS 3 OUT OF 3

438
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,801
It's time to flick your foreheads

439
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,670
and for you to treat us to a meal.

440
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,804
-All right.
-Very well.

441
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,540
Let me see whose forehead is good.
This one is perfect.

442
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,242
NEWBIE SEARCHES FOR HIS PREY

443
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,379
Should I put a dent in this? Should I?

444
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,147
Who wants to volunteer?

445
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,448
Who wants to experience it?

446
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,485
-Want me to flick your forehead?
-I'll go.

447
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,287
Frank? Why?

448
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,022
Why?

449
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,257
STANDING TALL

450
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,859
LOWER YOURSELF BY STICKING YOUR BUTT BACK

451
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,060
-Twerk.
-No twerking.

452
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,261
Stand.

453
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,635
WOBBLING

454
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,803
That sound…

455
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,972
Are you okay? Are you okay?

456
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,242
NOT OKAY

457
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,310
You know…

458
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,444
Oh, it turned red.

459
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,246
-It's red.
-It's red. Look.

460
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,548
It's red, isn't it? Yes.

461
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,883
I'm okay.

462
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,451
He has a red mark.

463
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,286
He's marked forever.

464
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,156
This is the Korean style
of flicking the forehead.

465
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,857
-It's party time.
-It's party time.

466
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,559
FRANK WILL REMEMBER THIS

467
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,664
But I'm okay.

468
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,635
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
14:30 WRAP-UP GATHERING

469
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,103
You all like makgeolli, don't you?

470
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,172
-Yes.
-We love it.

471
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,174
Kimchi pancake, potato pancake,

472
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,042
spicy sea snails and noodles,
and tofu kimchi.

473
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,578
Napa cabbage.

474
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,681
Haim, you like makgeolli, don't you?

475
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,316
Do you shake it? How do you drink it?

476
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,918
Let me show you how I do it.

477
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,219
-First…
-He's going to show me?

478
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,320
LEARNING HOW TO DRINK

479
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,255
You go like this.

480
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,224
He learned the proper way.

481
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,759
Follow him.

482
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,893
Follow him.

483
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,428
THE KOREAN LEARNS
FROM THE ISRAELI

484
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,496
But be careful.

485
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,664
Shake it.

486
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,033
PLUS POINTERS FROM THE AMERICAN

487
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,636
-My favorite is Jipyeong Makgeolli.
-Jipyeong?

488
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:48,140
-My second favorite is Horanggi Makgeolli.
-Horanggi Makgeolli?

489
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:49,942
I don't even know those.

490
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,844
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

491
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,115
When I say "This member,"
you say "Remember."

492
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,050
This member.

493
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,918
-Remember.
-Remember.

494
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,687
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

495
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,857
THEY ALL DRINK COMFORTABLY

496
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:09,828
BUT THE TWO AMERICANS DRINK
IN THE MOST POLITE WAY

497
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,463
-Wow!
-It's delicious.

498
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,565
-It's rich.
-Nice.

499
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:17,736
HYE-SEONG GOBBLES UP
HER PACKED CABBAGE BOSSAM

500
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,238
You eat so well. You're so cute.

501
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,474
Did you always like Korean food?

502
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,876
-Yes.
-I love it.

503
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,677
What's your favorite Korean dish?

504
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:26,845
Mine is bossam.

505
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,047
Bossam.

506
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,181
-Bossam?
-Bossam.

507
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,149
I love it so much.

508
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,684
-Have you been to Dongdaemun?
-Of course.

509
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,686
-It's so good.
-Isn't it? Your eyes got so big.

510
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,922
I tried beondegi there too.

511
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,024
-You know how to eat beondegi too?
-Yes.

512
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,092
Beondegi?

513
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,929
-What about you, Kim?
-I like dak-galbi.

514
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,097
-Dak-galbi.
-Dak-galbi.

515
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,265
Cheese dak-galbi.

516
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,533
-Cheese dak-galbi.
-Cheese dak-galbi.

517
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,835
Pork belly or dak-galbi? One, two, three.

518
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,337
-Pork belly or dak-galbi?
-One, two, three.

519
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,673
-Pork belly.
-Pork belly.

520
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,910
-Soju, meat.
-Soju, meat, soju, meat.

521
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,845
-Soju and pork belly.
-Yes.

522
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,681
What surprised you the most
when you came to Korea?

523
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,683
-The hurry-hurry culture.
-Hurry-hurry?

524
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,119
When I order something from a restaurant,

525
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,353
-it comes out fast.
-Yes.

526
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,655
You eat fast and leave fast.

527
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,989
Yes, that's right.

528
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,758
Koreans eat

529
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,961
food that is still boiling hot.

530
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,796
-While it's still boiling?
-Right.

531
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,765
-Gukbap.
-They eat it immediately.

532
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,634
I always have to wait for 10 minutes.

533
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,470
-You wait until it cools down?
-Yes.

534
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,038
It's so hot that I can't eat it.

535
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,706
In Korea, you eat it

536
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,508
as soon as it arrives.

537
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,044
-That's right.
-You eat immediately.

538
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,746
KOREANS EVEN DRINK UP
THE LAVA-LIKE GUKBAP

539
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,416
-They eat it immediately.
-It's really a superpower.

540
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,552
When I go for dinner with my colleagues,
our vice principal would eat fast

541
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,155
and say, "We have to get going.
Shall we go to the second round?"

542
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,923
-So we had to go.
-Exactly.

543
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,959
First, second, third, fourth round.

544
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,027
-We don't have that abroad.
-That's right.

545
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:49,928
You don't?

546
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,030
We would eat in the first round.

547
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,867
Drink alcohol and something light
for the second round.

548
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,235
-Then, go home.
-That's right.

549
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,471
But here, you eat in the first round,
drink in the second round,

550
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,241
do noraebang in the third round,
and eat again in the fourth round.

551
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,109
-You keep going.
-You know it so well.

552
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,911
You're practically Korean.

553
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,248
Do you have any life hacks
that you picked up living here?

554
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,552
There aren't any subways in my country,
so I had to learn a lot.

555
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,786
-The subway?
-Yes.

556
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,822
If you really want to sit,

557
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:23,629
you have to stand in front of
an elderly person in hiking gear.

558
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,764
Then, when they get off

559
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,535
at Dobongsan Station
or Bukhansan Ui Station,

560
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,236
I can get a seat.

561
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,304
AN OBVIOUS DESTINATION

562
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,139
Since they get off at Bukhansan.

563
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,841
It's a good tip when you're over there.

564
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,309
That's a great tip.

565
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,947
-Kim's great tip is she really likes apps.
-Apps?

566
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:46,618
Naver Pay, Kakao Pay, Coupang Eats,

567
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,087
-Coupang, the Daiso app,
-Coupang is good.

568
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,356
the Olive Young app. All the apps.

569
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,158
Right? They're good.

570
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,128
-Coupang is the most important.
-I love Coupang so much.

571
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,729
She's the queen of Coupang.

572
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,965
Me too. I'm the queen of Coupang too.

573
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,033
It's so fast.

574
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,801
Do you use Naver Pay
at convenience stores?

575
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,437
Yes, I use the CU app.

576
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,706
Wow. I don't even use that one.

577
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,508
-Yes, the CU app.
-You have the CU app?

578
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,211
It's because you can save
on the two-plus-one deals.

579
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,845
-That's right.
-That's right.

580
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,480
You can manage your coupons.

581
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,682
She knows more than me.

582
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,517
-You know so much about it.
-Yes.

583
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,019
-There are some that I didn't know.
-Me neither.

584
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,087
The two plus one deals.

585
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,189
If you don't want to take
all of them in one day…

586
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,525
-There are rewards points.
-…you can save it for the next day.

587
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,261
Give me another one, please. Another tip.

588
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,731
-I'm the one who has to learn.
-Give me another tip, please.

589
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,536
Is there anything
that you want from Koreans?

590
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,505
-Something you felt while living here.
-Something you'd like them to do.

591
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,541
I'd like to talk to them,

592
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,577
but they'd avoid me
and say, "I don't speak English."

593
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,079
And on subways,

594
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:51,316
they wouldn't sit next to me.

595
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,318
-They're afraid to speak English.
-So I'd say,

596
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,822
"Please have a seat, ma'am."

597
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,557
-Then they sit?
-In Korean?

598
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,959
-They sit immediately.
-You see? That's how they are.

599
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:05,497
-I wish they'd feel comfortable around me.
-If they could be more at ease…

600
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,567
There's a Korean drinking game.

601
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,968
Do you know the APT game?

602
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,971
OF COURSE WE DO

603
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,007
The loser has to drink this up.

604
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,643
-Bottoms up.
-The loser has to chug it.

605
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,845
-Bottoms up.
-Let's go.

606
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,681
-APT APT APT APT.
-APT APT APT APT.

607
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,450
A A A, P P P.

608
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,053

00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,064
-Third.
-Fourth.

615
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,136
BUILDING A 23-STORY APARTMENT

-22nd.

619
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,942
23rd?

620
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,145
Zoe!

621
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,181
ZOE MUST DRINK THE PENALTY DRINK

622
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,250
Not me, not me.

623
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,585
-Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.
-Wait.

624
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,054
-Zoe, Zoe.
-Wait.

625
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,125
-I can only drink this much.
-I don't think she can do it.

626
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,962
I don't think she can do it,
so I'll do it for her.

627
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,798
-Really?
-Wow!

628
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,233
SHAI VOLUNTEERS TO TAKE THE SHOT

629
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,170
She knows how it's done.
Hye-seong is so cool.

630
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,604
Can you really do it?

631
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,940
I can drink five bottles of soju.
I'm fine.

632
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,075
EXPLODING WITH AWESOMENESS

633
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,811
That's right. She drinks
five bottles of soju. This is nothing.

634
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:29,147
Then, you have to grant her wish.
Tell us your wish.

635
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,318
Just be happy.

636
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,787
TOUCHED

637
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,255
Just buy a hamburger?

638
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,558
-Hamburger.
-Hamburger.

639
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,259
-Buy a hamburger.
-Be happy.

640
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,494
Live happily.

641
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,163
-Buy her five hamburgers.
-Got it.

642
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,365
-At any time.
-Five? Okay.

643
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,766
She agreed to the burgers.

644
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,900
Here I go.

645
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,502
TIME FOR SHAI TO DRINK THE PENALTY

646
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,938
-Shai! Shai!
-Shai! Shai!

647
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,940
SHE DRINKS INCREDIBLY FAST

648
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,343
SHE CHUGS IT IN ONE GO

649
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,812
Wow! You're amazing!

650
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,548
Your English skills are a secondary issue.

651
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,851
If you just want
to interact with foreign friends,

652
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,285
you'd enjoy this.

653
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,322
They always seem
to be willing to learn something new

654
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,790
and have an open mind.

655
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,325
They're so cool.
