00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,973
Hello, Netflix Club members,
how has your week been?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,744
Each week, I observe clubs
with the eyes of a bird.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,346
I'm Newbie Defconn. It's good to see you.

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,616
Today, I will be visiting the sport
that is adored by middle-aged Korean men.

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,885
It's none other than the jokgu club.

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,520
MOST ADORED BY MIDDLE-AGED MEN

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,622
-Jokgu, jokgu.
-Jokgu, jokgu.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,558
THE SENIOR MEMBERS
EXCITEDLY GREET HIM

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,627
Please introduce yourself, President.

11
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,563
I'm Lee Kyung-jae,
the president of Jongam JOKGU Club.

12
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,800
-This is Jongam JOKGU Club?
-Yes.

13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,669
Yes, it's because we're
in the Jongam-dong neighborhood.

14
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,607
Our club has been around
for about 20 years.

15
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,742
-We have about 80 members.
-80 members.

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,379
We're the kind of club that has squabbles
but plays well together.

17
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,249
Can you introduce yourselves from here?

18
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,318
I'm Kim Dae-sung, the coach of the club.

19
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,753
Oh, you're the coach.

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,388
What do you do, Coach?

21
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,057
I stop the fights.

22
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,025
SIMPLER TASK THAN HE EXPECTED

23
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,161
If they won't listen,
I'd take them to the bathroom.

24
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,495
-Do you kick them out too?
-Yes.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,563
No, no kicking out.

26
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,465
-You didn't kick someone out for fighting?
-No.

27
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,100
We need to collect membership fees.

28
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,969
Even though you fight,
you always end with a handshake.

29
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,237
-Of course.
-I see.

30
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,207
I'm Yang Ui-su,
the vice president of the club.

31
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,177
You already have a president.
Do you need a vice president as well?

32
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,244
The next president.

33
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,813
Are you the next president?

34
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,915
There's a senior vice president above me.

35
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,216
A senior vice president?

36
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,284
VICE TO SENIOR VICE TO PRESIDENT

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,985
I'm the next, next president.

38
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,687
Do you all have a position?

39
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,123
-We've made all the members an executive…
-Okay.

40
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,025
…so they all do their jobs well.

41
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,460
Very nice. So…

42
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,196
I'm Min and I'm in charge of finance!

43
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,364
I'm Han Jun-hee
and I'm in charge of general affairs.

44
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,500
I'm Jung Sang-il
and I'm currently an advisor.

45
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,069
I'm Park Chi-sang, an advisor of the club.

46
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,138
He's already an advisor.
Why is there another one?

47
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,173
Anyone who has been a president
becomes an advisor.

48
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,610
When you are called an advisor,

49
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,012
you have to pay up when there's an event.

50
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,314
Contributions.

51
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,950
I see. The advisors contribute generously.

52
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,586
THE REASON WHY THEY NEED
MANY ADVISORS: MONEY

53
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,821
I'm So On-ik
and I do facility management.

54
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,156
Let me ask you something.

55
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,091
What facility is there to manage here?

56
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,292
There's a lot.

57
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,195
I'm the only one
who goes all the way up there.

58
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,065
-Oh, the net.
-Yes, I install the nets.

59
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,134
I care for them
and I erect the scaffolding.

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,236
TECHNICAL TERMS
OF THE FACILITY MANAGER

61
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,404
You're in charge of facility management.

62
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,607
-Should I go?
-So… Yes.

63
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,343
Hello. I am the former coach.

64
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,411
-There are 14 clubs in Seongbuk-gu.
-Okay.

65
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,646
I manage all those clubs.

66
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,714
-All of them?
-Yes.

67
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,149
Do you like jokgu that much?

68
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,583
I love it.

69
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,253
If I close my eyes,
it feels like I'm talking to Jong-min.

70
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,455
-You're right.
-It's like I'm talking to Kim Jong-min,

71
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,424
but when I open my eyes,
it's like I'm talking to Jee Seok-jin.

72
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,492
He's right.

73
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,861
-You're quite the character.
-You should be a celebrity.

74
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:47,000
Hello, I'm Cha Young-man
and I've been the auditor for six years.

75
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,035
I am always auditing

76
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,904
how they spend their money.

77
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,839
I know we just met,

78
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,040
but how are you so cute?

79
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,543
SO CUTE

80
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,179
I'm the oldest in this club.

81
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,513
May I ask how old you are?

82
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,981
I was born in 1958.

83
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,983
Gosh, you look young.

84
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,385
Okay, next.

85
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,288
You know, anybody can tell
that you are young blood.

86
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,455
I dyed my hair.

87
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,690
No, next to you.

88
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,892
This guy over there.

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,761
HE TRIES TO PASS AS YOUNG BLOOD

90
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,796
-I'm done?
-Mr. Cha.

91
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,665
-Did you dye your hair?
-Yes.

92
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,900
Yes, I did it myself
using water color dye.

93
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,735
I think that's why your scalp is red.

94
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,103
ROAD TO YOUNG BLOOD LED
TO RED SCALP

95
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,171
Mr. Cha.

96
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,372
Okay, the young blood.

97
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,109
Hello, I'm the new member, Oh Jung-suk.

98
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,078
NEW MEMBERS ARE PRECIOUS
TO OLD CLUBS!

99
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,080
-Oh Jung-suk!
-So handsome!

100
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,382
When did you join the club?

101
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,984
-Two years ago.
-Two years ago?

102
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,420
You've been here for two years.
Do you have a position too?

103
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,188
-No, I do not.
-No position.

104
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,256
4-YEAR MINIMUM FOR A ROLE

105
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,324
You don't have a position.

106
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,959
-And you?
-Hello.

107
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,661
I'm Chun Joo-young
who migrated from a nearby club.

108
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,196
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

109
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,131
You migrated here? What do you mean?

110
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,666
He joined our club first,

111
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,301
so we trained him well.

112
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,904
But he became a bit cocky.

113
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,505
-He betrayed you.
-Yes.

114
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,641
He would play at other clubs
and come back if he has nowhere to go.

115
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,909
-He's a drifter.
-Yes.

116
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,512
Almost nine members have positions.

117
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,481
You might as well give me one, too?

118
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,016
You can be the assistant facility manager.

119
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,150
Sounds good!

120
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,919
-Nice!
-Oh, assistant facility manager?

121
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,754
Would he be my assistant?

122
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,923
If I do that,
do I have to go up the scaffolding?

123
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,091
EXCITED ABOUT A SUCCESSOR

124
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,993
All right. Very nice.

125
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,728
What is our schedule for today?

126
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,663
-As we usually play…
-Okay.

127
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,599
…we'll team up
and play for two wins out of three games.

128
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,868
The losing team
has to pay for a whole meal.

129
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,004
PLAYING FOR A FREE MEAL IS
THE BEST!

130
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,006
-Someone will have to pay!
-Playing for a meal!

131
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,574
Shall we play for jjajangmyeon?

132
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,075
-Yes.
-Chinese food for today.

133
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,745
Since you're the newbie,
I'll give you a notepad.

134
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,513
-Take the orders.
-Please take the orders.

135
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,015
-Me?
-Yes.

136
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,283
There's a newbie over there.

137
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,984
But it's your first time here.

138
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,486
Or you can go up there.

139
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,554
-Go up the scaffolding.
-The scaffolding?

140
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,323
Damn…

141
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,158
I guess this is better than
going up that damn scaffolding.

142
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,693
Pick one of those two.

143
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,827
This is better than
going up that damn scaffolding.

144
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,296
That damn scaffolding.

145
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,031
-It's better to take orders.
-Of course.

146
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:03,436
Then, I hope we get to have
a wonderful time together.

147
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,671
You have a chant, don't you?

148
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,738
One, two, three!

149
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,806
-Jongam!
-Jongam!

150
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,107
-Let's go!
-We got this!

151
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,709
Hang on.

152
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,110
-Listen.
-Was it too…

153
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,545
Do as we always do.

154
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,780
Hey, newbie!

155
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,348
Do you have a chant or not?

156
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,483
First time I'm hearing it.

157
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,686
-Hey.
-Come on.

158
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,288
HE'S NOT A GOOD LIAR

159
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,990
-Let's do as we always do.
-Let's do it.

160
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,825
When I count to three, we say "Yeah!"

161
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,226
Okay. Two, three!

162
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,561
-Yeah!
-Let's go!

163
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,564
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
11:30 SKILLS TEST

164
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,268
When this Jongam JOKGU Club goes on TV,
this club will become famous.

165
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,502
Does this air worldwide?

166
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,837
OF COURSE IT WILL

167
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,272
It'll air worldwide!

168
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,340
HAND IN HAND

169
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,342
World star! Am I right?

170
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,277
You look like Kim Jong-min
when you smile.

171
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,878
I should tell my foreign clients.

172
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,880
Since you're younger than me anyway,

173
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,982
let me just call you Jong-min today.

174
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,818
Okay. It's all good, big brother.

175
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,019
My big brother Defconn.

176
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,987
ARE YOU
A KIM JONG-MIN LOOK-ALIKE?

177
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,289
I got that a lot when I was younger.

178
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,523
I heard that so many times.

179
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,826
People would even ask for an autograph
at weddings.

180
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,160
Hello.

181
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,228
Well, you see…

182
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,963
People say I look like you

183
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,132
and I'm kind of goofy as well.

184
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,068
I would like to meet you one day.

185
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,938
-You have to go through a few tests.
-Okay.

186
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,906
-This is called "hit the wall."
-Hit the wall.

187
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,776
We're testing how well
you receive the ball.

188
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,411
-Watch.
-Okay.

189
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,280
HIT THE WALL WITH THE BALL

190
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,515
-Like this.
-Is that it?

191
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,616
It's easy, right?

192
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,684
Give it a shot.

193
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,119
It looks easy, but…

194
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,353
-Just use your right foot.
-Really?

195
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,621
You got this, Newbie!

196
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,656
Hey, what's this?

197
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,858
-Kick it up.
-That's it.

198
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,326
OH?

199
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,027
ENDS WITH A BAD KICK

200
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,229
Wait.

201
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,298
That was all wrong.

202
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,366
How can you say that?

203
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,901
Jong-min!

204
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,070
How can you say that to me, Jong-min?

205
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,338
It came out of nowhere.

206
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,540
I could tell

207
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,075
that it was all wrong.

208
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,010
He had poor form as well.

209
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,412
It wasn't good.

210
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,380
-Shall I show you?
-Yes.

211
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,015
I'm an expert defender.

212
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,151
Go like this.

213
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,052
-Oh, my.
-What?

214
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,120
SLAPSTICK COMEDY?

215
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,321
What was that?

216
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,956
-This is how I practice.
-How?

217
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,725
You run up

218
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,895
and receive.

219
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,962
Receive.

220
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,097
-What?
-You should've kicked that.

221
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,165
I messed up.

222
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,232
SUPER CONFIDENT

223
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,235
HE'S A CARBON COPY
OF KIM JONG-MIN

224
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,137
The star of jokgu is the hitter.

225
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,240
This is equipment
the hitter uses to practice.

226
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,742
Coach is amazing. Fire Ball.

227
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,810
-Fire Ball.
-Fire Ball.

228
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,011
They're saying he's powerful.

229
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,078
Oh, fire ball.

230
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,747
You're Jongam-dong's Fire Ball?

231
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,049
-I'm Mapo's Honey Fist.
-Hi.

232
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:31,984
MID-AGED MEN LIKE NICKNAMES

233
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,386
He's Jongam-dong's Fire Ball.

234
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,887
-Shall I demonstrate for you?
-Yes.

235
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,456
Move. You'll get hurt.

236
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,157
CLEARING THE WALL

237
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,492
-Seriously?
-You'll get hurt.

238
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,560
All right.

239
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,761
JONGAM'S FIRE BALL DEMONSTRATES

240
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,698
THE POWERFUL SHOT
EVEN SOUNDS DIFFERENT

241
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,166
Like that.

242
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,367
-That's the fire ball.
-Yes.

243
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,037
THEY'RE PROUD
TO HAVE JONGAM'S FIRE BALL

244
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,104
Push it over.

245
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,506
That's it. Like that.

246
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,574
I won't get hit even if I stand here.

247
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,576
He'll fall back. Hold him.

248
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,010
-He'll fall.
-Hold him.

249
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,278
TOTALLY DIFFERENT REACTIONS

250
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,513
It won't hit the wall.

251
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,315
HE SHOOTS AMIDST NO EXPECTATIONS

252
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,153
It did hit the wall.

253
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,521
The ball hit the wall.

254
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,789
Why are you surprised?

255
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,857
NO EXPECTATIONS

256
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,124
Anybody could do that?

257
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,327
I tried twice. What's your assessment?

258
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,661
BLINKING

259
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,797
I don't think you're that good,

260
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,865
but you have potential.

261
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,932
You do.

262
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,300
How was I, Jong-min?

263
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,668
You were pretty good.

264
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,736
NEW CATCHPHRASE

265
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,238
-Pretty good.
-Pretty good?

266
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,606
How could you say that so casually to me?

267
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,907
HE REALLY IS KIM JONG-MIN!

268
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,643
THE REAL JONG-MIN SHOULD
STAY AWAY FROM JONGAM-DONG

269
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,245
So for today, let's not

270
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,213
settle on a position for you.

271
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,415
-Not settle on a position?
-Let's not settle on one.

272
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,917
Let's make teams.

273
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,953
Who wants to play with me?
Raise your hand.

274
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,055
Who wants to be on my team?

275
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,423
Raise your hand.

276
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,325
LAUGHING AWKWARDLY

277
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,528
Raise your hand
if you want to be on my team.

278
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,729
STOP ASKING!

279
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,897
What are you doing?

280
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,633
-Come on!
-Hey, Jong-min.

281
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,934
-Jong-min.
-Jong-min!

282
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,002
You should go.

283
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,503
But I have to go where Coach sends me.

284
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,106
Gosh, you guys are too mean.

285
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,674
So what if I wasn't that good?

286
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,576
Who said I did it all wrong?

287
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,511
Who said that earlier?

288
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,147
I heard everyone say
that I was doing it all wrong.

289
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,249
This is why you aren't
getting more members.

290
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,918
-Right?
-We have to be objective.

291
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,786
-A meal is at stake. What can I do?
-Why?

292
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,621
Is it different when a meal is at stake?

293
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,657
A meal is at stake today.

294
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,925
TEAM BATTLE FOR A FREE MEAL

295
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,626
You guys are in trouble today.

296
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,894
THEY START PROVOKING

297
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,863
I don't think he can receive my ball.

298
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,132
Water Ball of Jongam.

299
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,333
Oh, Water Ball?

300
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,168
There is Fire Ball and Water Ball?

301
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,536
Why is he called Water Ball?

302
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,671
Because his shots are weak.

303
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,905
LAUGHING OUT OF SHAME

304
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,841
-His words are stronger than his kicks.
-But he just said,

305
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,377
"I don't think he can receive my ball."

306
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,779
He provoked me like that.

307
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,581
That's called "mouth jokgu."

308
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,382
That's called "mouth jokgu."

309
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,617
WATER BALL / "MOUTH JOKGU"

310
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,054
I can't accept the fact
that I'm called Water Ball.

311
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,623
I think my kicks are pretty strong.

312
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,626
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
12:00 ACTUAL GAME

313
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,027
All right. Play!

314
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,095
-Yes!
-Let's go.

315
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,496
Let's do this!

316
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,564
We got this.

317
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,899
WATER BALL SERVES

NEWBIE'S TEAM'S SMASH!

SCALP GUY EASILY RECEIVES IT

322
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,711
Wow, he received it.

323
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,379
NEWBIE'S TEAM ATTACKS!

324
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,481
SOLID DEFENSE

325
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,416
Doing good, Young-man!

326
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,484
Mine.

327
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,655
STEADY DEFENSE USING HEADING

328
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,056
Is your head okay?

329
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,992
-It's red.
-I know.

330
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,127
Maybe his scalp is red because of jokgu.

331
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,262
He's getting shorter
because of all his headers.

332

Okay!

335
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,437
THEY SCORE AS THE BALL GOES OUT

336
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,172
It didn't go out! It's in!

337
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,974
-It went out.
-Out.

338
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,242
-Isn't that in?
-It's in.

339
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,543
-It's in.

NEWBIE INSISTS FIRST

343
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,217
No way!

344
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,284
Wasn't it in?

345
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,320
-It's in!
-It was in!

346
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,655
Shall we check the video?

347
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,822
Check the video?

348
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,324
Was it in or out?

349
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,826
-It was out.
-It was? Okay.

350
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,894
Sorry!

351
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:02,962
-I'm sorry.
-What?

352
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,563
I'm sorry.

353
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,999
He hasn't been here long so he can't lie.

354
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,869
WATER BALL TEAM HAS THE MOMENTUM

355
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,605
Mine.

00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,807
Oh, my.

357
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,942
HE FELL BUT THE BALL WENT OVER

358
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,477
WATER BALL'S ATTACK

359
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,713
Wait! Wait!

360
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,283
WATER BALL DOESN'T CUT THEM
ANY SLACK FOR FALLING

361
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,519
A man is down!

362
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,320
"MOUTH JOKGU" ACTIVATED
FOR THE 2ND TIME

363
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,189
Hey, jjajangmyeon is at stake!

364
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,524
Jjajangmyeon is at stake.

365
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,426
THE ORIGINAL
"MOUTH JOKGU" WON'T BACK DOWN

366
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,627
Are you okay?

367
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,762
THE MAN
WHO ACTUALLY FELL LOOKS CALM

368
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,533
IT ENDS WITH "MOUTH JOKGU"
GETTING DRAGGED OUT

369
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:45,237
NEWBIE'S TEAM CONTINUES
TO MAKE ERRORS

370
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,472
Well played!

371
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,707
WATER BALL'S TEAM TOOK
THE FIRST WIN

372
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,108
Hold on, we should shake hands.

373
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,843
-We don't do that.
-You don't?

374
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,944
It's too upsetting.

375
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,112
-You don't shake hands?
-No.

376
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,814
-We don't do that.
-You don't in jokgu?

377
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,015
-Really?
-Okay.

378
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,083
NOT WHEN WE'RE UPSET

379
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,418
-Let's start the second game.
-Yes.

380
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,953
If we lose this time,

381
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,389
-we have to pay for the meal.
-We have to pay.

382
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,357
-We have to win.
-We have to.

383
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,692
-Two, three.
-Yeah!

384
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,860
Here it comes.

385
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,161
STARTING WITH WATER BALL'S SERVE

386
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,497
That's it.

387
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,698
-Nice.
-That's it.

388
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,534
-Oh, no! I'm sorry!
-Darn.

389
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,870
-Darn it!
-Jong-min!

390
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,138
JONG-MIN FROM THE START…

391
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,873
WATER BALL'S TEAM SERVES AGAIN

392
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,941
Show us something!

393
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,409
-That's it.
-Okay.

394
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,010
LIFTS THE LOW BALL WITH A HEADER

395
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,178
Hey!

396
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,880
What's going on right now?

397
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,250
-Should I receive it again?
-Yes, go ahead!

398
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,285
-Use your head!
-Good job!

399
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,087
Wait, my forehead hurts so much.

400
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,555
-It's red up there.
-It's red.

401
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,623
His forehead is red.

402
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,425
-Does your forehead hurt?
-It's red!

403
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,927
THEN, DO ANOTHER HEADING

404
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,330
-Hey.
-We got it.

405
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,499
All right! Good job!

406
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,834
SWITCHING POSITIONS
DUE TO THE RED FOREHEAD ISSUE

407
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,669
It might be more dangerous there.

408
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,906
IT'S ACTUALLY
WATER BALL'S FAVORITE SPOT

409
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:54,974
Get it.

410
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,209
Hurry up and do it!

411
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,277
GOOD DEFENSE

412
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,347
ANOTHER POWERFUL SMASH
TO NEWBIE'S SPOT

413
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,414
-Hey.
-Lift it up.

414
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,750
Take that!

415
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,520
IT MAGICALLY TURNS INTO
FIRE BALL FOR NEWBIE

416
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,654
Sorry about that.

417
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,157
Clearly, you're intentionally kicking
the ball to Newbie.

418
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,325
This is why all the newbies leave.

419
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,760
Listen, Mr. Water Ball.

420
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,028
Mr. Water Ball.

421
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,663
Stop smashing the ball towards me.

422
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,266
But it just happens to go that way
like it always does.

423
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,902
You can't stand in the line.

424
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,969
-Come out.
-Really?

425
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,338
That way, you can receive the ball.

426
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,406
Okay.

427
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,108
SNEAKING IN

428
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,176
Good.

429
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,243
You're going in again.

430
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,245
Stand way over here.

431
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,647
-There?
-Don't go in the line.

432
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,282
Should I stand here then?

433
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,349
-Stand there.
-Okay.

434
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,617
-I'll stay here.
-Yes.

435
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,219
Get ready to go in now.

436
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,122
Here we go! Here we go!

437
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,423
-We got it.
-We got it!

438
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,491
We got it!

439
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,726
Stay out here again?

440
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:48,828
Yes, that's right.

441
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,963
If the ball gets closer, move in a little.

442
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,097
A POWERFUL SPIKE

443
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,167
SUCCEEDS IN DEFENDING

444
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,702
Hey, what was that?

445
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,171
That defense was insane!

446
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,409
THEY SCORE AFTER THE GREAT BLOCK

447
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,677
-Two, three.
-Yeah!

448
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,545
-Nice defense.
-Good.

449
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,847
-You were totally right.
-Yes.

450
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,348
He was totally right.

451
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,616
EXCELLENT COACHING

452
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,750
You shouldn't go in.

453
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,352
Here.

454
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,554
TRACKING THE BALL

455
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,389
COMING IN

456
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,824
AFTER A STABLE TOSS

457
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,959
Smash it!

458
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,695
FIRE BALL'S KICK FOLLOWS

459
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,798
-Two, three.
-Yeah!

460
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,132
Wait a minute.

461
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,567
I have something to say.

462
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,203
This is jokgu.

463
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,506
HE COULDN'T WAIT TO RUN
HIS MOUTH TO PRESIDENT LEE

464
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,809
We got a player in Mapo now.

465
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,410
Stand back. Stand back.

466
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,478
Nice.

467
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,579
-Nice.
-Good.

468
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,981
-Nice.
-That's it!

469
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,783
SLIPS

470
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,987
NEWBIE'S TEAM WINS

471
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,322
-Two, three.
-Yeah!

472
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,224
It's only fun when we go to the finals.

473
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,626
-We got this.
-Play.

474
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,760
Okay. Receive well.

475
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,228
FINALS

476
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,396
Nice.

477
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,331
SLIGHTLY MISSES BALL

478
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,466
Okay! He's got it!

479
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:01,533
Here it goes!

480
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,135
COACH KIM COULDN'T GET IT
OVER THE NET

481
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,203
It didn't go over.

482
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,804
Push it over with your foot, Coach.

483
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,439
-Yes, sir.
-Push it over.

484
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,241
You need to coach him from up there.

485
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,310
-Just go like this.
-Tell him.

486
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,378
Okay.

487
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,812
Follow me.

488
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,914
Like this.

489
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,348
-That's it.
-Okay.

490
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,449
All right.

491
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,084
-Got it.
-Okay!

492
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,386
Don't hold back!

493
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,453
That's it.

494
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,988
BUT THE NET GOT IT

495
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,356
SIGHING

496
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,758
I'm sorry. Just breathe.

497
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:26,825
-Two, three.
-Yeah.

498
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,094
Even if the setter is good,
it's no use if he can't attack.

499
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,097
-Even if the setter tosses the ball up…
-Okay.

500
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,400
He is destroying you with "mouth jokgu."

501
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,870
He learned "mouth jokgu"
before he learned the actual jokgu.

502
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,438
So this is "mouth jokgu."

503
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,806
ALREADY A MASTER AT MOUTH JOKGU

504
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,207
It's far.

505
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,642
Take that!

506
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,777
-Nice.
-Nice.

507
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:45,844
It's pretty steady.

508
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:46,912
BUILDING TEAMWORK

509
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,714
-We got it.
-Nice.

510
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,017
THEY SCORED

511
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,118
That's how it's done.

512
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,186
-Two, three.
-Yeah!

513
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,121
WATER BALL'S POWER SMASH

514
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,558
NEWBIE RECEIVED IT

515
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,626
-Nice.
-Good one.

516
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,494
HE RECEIVED THAT?

517
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,729
That was insane.

518
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,264
What is going on?

519
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,832
-We got it!
-Yeah!

520
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,901
NEWBIE'S TEAM
SCORES CONSECUTIVELY

521
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,738
THE FINAL WINNERS

522
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,507
-This is jokgu!
-Yes!

523
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,810
GOSH, THEY'RE SO ANNOYING

524
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,979
Pay 1,000 won each, the loser team.

525
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,046
Pay 1,000 won each.

526
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,048
It's 1,000 won each. I forgot.

527
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,488
NEWBIE IN THE CLUB SCHEDULE
15:00 LUNCH

528
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,190
Thank you. Have a good one.

529
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,257
NEWBIE PICKS UP DELIVERY

530
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,692
My fellow members!

531
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,895
-Your meal is here!
-Hey, Newbie!

532
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,697
-Your meal is here!
-Send the newbie.

533
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,566
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

534
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,935
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

535
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,671
He makes such fast progress,
just like this TV persona.

536
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,606
JJAJANGMYEON AFTER EXERCISE
TASTES GREAT

537
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,341
TASTES EVEN BETTER
BECAUSE THEY WON

538
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,476
It's so good.

539
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,945
You know, you're so good at tossing.

540
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,346
He's got skills.

541
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,848
Did I have some skills?

542
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,484
-Typically, a newbie wouldn't be a setter.
-Really?

543
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,719
-You're the first one to do it.
-Oh, really?

544
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,987
Mr. Water Ball.

545
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,489
How does it feel to lose?

546
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,391
It's kind of like you got destroyed by me.

547
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,426
I made too many mistakes.

548
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,328
That guy's toss wasn't so great.

549
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,330
IN CHARGE OF TOSSING

550
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,765
ADVISOR JUNG BOWS TO APOLOGIZE

551
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:13,999
Sorry.

552
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,701
Will you let him treat you this way?

553
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,202
He's always like that.

554
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,438
I think you usually blame others.

555
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,773
A little bit.

556
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,575
You don't do that
to your employees, do you?

557
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,144
-He works alone.
-Does he?

558
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,212
RELIEVING HIS LONELINESS
AT WORK HERE

559
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,015
Please tell me
how you all started playing jokgu.

560
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,351
At first, I started playing

561
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,554
because of my health,
so I really did my best.

562
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,257
But we usually finish
at around 10 or 11 o'clock,

563
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,292
so I'd always get fried chicken and beer.

564
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,627
After doing that for about a year,

565
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,694
I got diabetes.

566
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,863
GOT DIABETES!

567
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,299
That's so sad though.

568
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,501
I did it for my health, but it got worse.

569
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,669
Oh, no.

570
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,870
Don't eat a lot at night.

571
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,106
I had to stop my night cravings.

572
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,274
I get hungry when I go home.

573
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,543
Then, just eat some boiled eggs.

574
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,144
I got tired of it though.

575
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,113
So what do you want me to do about it?

576
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,181
So?

577
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,382
After taking care of myself,

578
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,584
I think I got a bit better or maybe not.

579
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,652
Or maybe not?

580
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,821
What do I do with him?

581
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,890
He's like Jong-min in a parallel universe.

582
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,493
How could I meet someone like him up here?

583
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,361
Are you acquainted with Kim Jong-min?

584
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,463
Just the same last name.

585
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,665
He's getting married in April.
You should go.

586
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,833
I'll go if he invites me.

587
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,736
Do any of your wives oppose this?

588
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,674
Our wives seem to like our members here.

589
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,142
Thankfully.

590
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,077
Before we come to the jokgu court,

591
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,912
we'd do the dishes,

592
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,081
-make some side dishes…
-Right.

593
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,850
…and we'd leave when the kids were asleep.

594
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,251
It's the least we can do to play.

595
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,586
It's the same for me.

596
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,188
Our lives are all quite similar.

597
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,357
-There isn't much of a difference.
-Right.

598
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,759
Have you ever told her
you're going elsewhere to come here?

599
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,129
No, but I did say
I was coming here to go elsewhere.

600
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,064
THE GROUP IS STARTLED

601
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,665
Hey, man!

602
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,267
Can that go on TV?

603
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,603
What if your wife doesn't let you play?

604
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,837
It's only you!

605
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,706
Have you ever gone elsewhere like him?

606
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,207
-Many times.
-Where?

607
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,275
MANY TIMES

608
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,344
Why are you guys confessing so easily?

609
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,880
I'd tell her I'm going to play,
and then meet up with him and him and him

610
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,414
to go for drinks.

611
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,482
Didn't we do that?

612
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,184
-You drank with him.
-No, I didn't.

613
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,353
How long have you all been playing jokgu?

614
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,221
After today,
I think you're a match for me.

615
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,623
I THINK YOU'RE A MATCH FOR ME

616
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,024
I've played for almost 15 years.

617
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,593
You came here
after joining other teams, right?

618
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,794
-No.
-Here, the whole time?

619
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,862
I started here.

620
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,264
Once you join, you can't leave.

621
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,665
We lock the door. You can't leave.

622
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,799
Really?

623
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,601
I've played for about 12 to 13 years.

624
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,003
It has been 19 years.

625
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,272
-I've played for over 20 years.
-Over 20 years.

626
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,840
You must enter many tournaments.

627
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,075
About two or three years ago,

628
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,844
we won Seoul City's tournament.

629
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,912
-Really?
-Yes.

630
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,214
Former coach Kim Hong-gil, me,

631
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,049
Vice President Yang Ui-su,

632
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,652
and he isn't here today,
but also Vice President Kim Myung-su.

633
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,522
I think there are
still many executives that I haven't met.

634
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,524
The members that are here
make up about 30 percent.

635
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,825
Only 30 percent?

636
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,863
I'm curious about
all those former presidents.

637
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,298
Here comes the vice president.

638
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,233
The senior vice president is here.

639
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,769
-He's the legendary one?
-Yes, he is.

640
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,270
I see. Senior Vice President.

641
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,573
KIM MYUNG-SU - SENIOR VICE
PRESIDENT AND NEXT PRESIDENT

642
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,640
-Where's Hyung-don?
-Pardon?

643
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,808
Where's Hyung-don?

644
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,276
I do this by myself.

645
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,811
THERE IS ONLY ONE NEWBIE

646
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,112
Why are you causing a ruckus?

647
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,949
You can keep going
until you find your way out.

648
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,483
THE MEMBERS ARE USED TO HIM

649
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,586
What has changed about you
after playing jokgu?

650
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,054
We became more energetic.

651
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,855
As I work on site,

652
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,624
-I don't get to laugh much.
-I see.

653
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,794
Whenever I come to the jokgu court,
I always get to laugh and chat.

654
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,495
I've only seen you angry.

655
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,464
You always get angry.

656
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,932
THE NEWBIE FINALLY SPEAKS UP

657
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,500
You're laughing for the first time.

658
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,668
You've never seen him laugh?

659
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,103
It's the first time in two years.

660
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,504
FIRST LAUGH IN TWO YEARS

661
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,173
-I laugh a lot.
-Excuse me.

662
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,941
When do you laugh?

663
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,509
-When he wins.
-I'm laughing a lot now.

664
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,711
He laughs only when he wins.

665
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,346
He blames others when he loses.

666
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,814
What? Geez.

667
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,148
EVERYONE GANGS UP ON WATER BALL

668
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,950
Please smile a lot from now.

669
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,218
IMMEDIATELY SMILES

670
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,419
All right.

671
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,421
-It's nice to see him smile.
-Isn't it nice?

672
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,657
NEWBIE'S HEART MELTS
AT HIS SMILE

673
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,525
What do you like so much about jokgu?

674
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,893
You don't get injured badly.

675
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,795
Sometimes, you just tear your leg tendon.

676
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,464
Occasionally tearing a tendon?

677
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,965
Isn't that a serious injury?

678
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,234
This guy is really cute.

679
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,535
He's like the team's mascot.

680
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,670
CLUB'S MASCOT, RED SCALP

681
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,641
In Seoul,
all the courts are asphalt or cement.

682
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,343
This is the only place
you can play on a dirt court.

683
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,613
Because we play on a dirt court,
you can't help but become healthy.

684
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,615
-Also, it's in the mountains.
-Yes, it is.

685
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,083
So the air is clean.

686
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,386
First off,
it's good for our mental health.

687
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,822
-We can blow off steam by yelling.
-That's so true.

688
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,391
-It's so good.
-For real.

689
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,327
I didn't know
"mouth jokgu" was so refreshing.

690
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,795
It's so fun!

691
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,797
All the stress disappeared.

692
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:42,000
There aren't many places
where middle-aged men can go.

693
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,137
This place is like a safe haven for us.

694
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,039
It's a place where we can breathe.

695
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,675
Things like that exist in this place.

696
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,809
Is there anything to do?

697
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,811
Is there anything to do to move around?

698
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,179
Middle-aged men who say that,

699
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,148
the answer to that is jokgu.

700
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,016
Four people must work together.

701
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,585
It's the process of scoring
while working together.

702
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,888
I think the thrill they feel is huge.

703
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,690
I play offense,

704
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,125
so I relieve my stress
whenever I kick the ball.

705
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,594
It isn't exhausting
even if I play all day.

706
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,030
The fact that we can have
this much fun with a single ball

707
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,632
makes me so happy.

708
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,334
JONGAM JOKGU CLUB
SEONGBUK-GU, SEOUL

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,435
