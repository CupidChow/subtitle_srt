1
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:48,052
Over 300 criminals head overseas 
to flee from the police every year

2
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:50,558
Many of them hide in Southeast Asia

3
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,145
and continue their criminal activitis 
against Korean tourists and businessmen

4
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:01,749
HOCHI MINH CITY
VIETNAM 2008

00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:12,119

PARK JI-HWAN

8
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:45,822
Isn't it great? It's close to the city too

9
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:48,717
It's the perfect spot to build your resort

10
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:50,921
Why isn't this area developed yet?

11
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:53,038
It was the site of semiconductor factory

12
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,192
but that plan got scrapped it'll 
be changed to a tourist zone

13
00:01:56,582 --> 00:02:01,377
With such prime location and view 
it'll be a major tourist hotspot

14
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,050
Who am I meeting today?

15
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:08,809
He has a big rental car business, 
he's dying to meet you

16
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:10,927
How much did he pay you?

17
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:12,396
It's not like that

18
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:13,475
You so got paid.

19
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:16,370
Do I look like someone who'd take bribes?

20
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:19,611
He’ll do anything to get on your good side

21
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,648
Mr. Choi how's your hangover?

22
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:30,457
Why was last nights beer tap so much?

23
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,870
I got to drink Louis XIII 
for the first time thanks to you

24
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,894
And you let him drink that?
You should've stopped them!

25
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,624
But you won a ton

26
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,963
Winning is one thing,

27
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:43,419
spend money wisely don't 
dump it all on booze

28
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:46,401
Let's finish up and get hangover soup

29
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:48,907
This guy was begging to see you in person

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,031
He's got some money

31
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:52,147
He doesn't do business only with Koreans

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,826
He's got a few buildings in Ho Chi Minh too

33
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,314
Mr. Choi Yong-gi?

34
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:01,956
Good afternoon

35
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:03,986
I heard a lot about you

36
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:04,937
Hop in

37
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:07,011
Have a great chat

38
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,734
Aren't you hot?

39
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:11,289
Having a snack?

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,048
You should eat something good

41
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,146
So Jong-hoon tells me you 
run a huge rental car biz

42
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:29,091
You're filthy rich, I hear

43
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:29,739
What?

44
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,548
You son of a bitch

45
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:33,542
Asshole!

46
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:38,641
Lift up your head!

47
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:46,159
You bastards what's the matter with you?!

48
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:48,146
What is it?! You fuckers!

49
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:49,658
Move aside

50
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:55,967
Do I look like I run a rental car business?

51
00:03:58,085 --> 00:03:58,948
Do I?

52
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,583
You're kidnapped

53
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,324
THE ROUNDUP
(The Outlaws 2)

54
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,953
Buddy! Drop the knife

55
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:19,818
Heady! Bud!

56
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,410
I told you I'm Heady from Youngdeungpo!

57
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:24,916
All right, all right, 
what are you even saying?!

58
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:29,927
Fuck you,assholes!

59
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,226
Don't do it, man!

60
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,176
Come inside!

61
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:34,034
I can kill all of you, fucktards!

62
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:36,194
Damn! Not answering again

63
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:39,176
Here! Over here!

64
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:43,194
This way, this way!

65
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,275
Afternoon, captain!

66
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:45,744
- Here here
- Where is he?

67
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:46,910
He's inside

68
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,379
No, where's Seok-do?

69
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,021
He's not answering the phone!

70
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:52,052
Damn it...

71
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,138
Drop the knife, Heady!

72
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:03,200
Good to see you, sir.

73
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,144
What's going on?

74
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:06,570
What took you so long?!

75
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:09,637
a blind date...

76
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:11,496
How do you have weekly blind dates?

77
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:13,180
He's gotta get married someday

78
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:14,650
What's with him?

79
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:17,026
He's known as Heady, a big nutjob for sure.

80
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:18,021
Heady?

81
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,008
He escaped from an asylum

82
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:20,829
Hostage?

83
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,292
Two, the shop keep randa college girl

84
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:24,588
Should we just barge in?

85
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:28,477
No.way! It's too dangerous, 
let's get the SWAT

86
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:31,285
We don't know what that lunatic will do...

87
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:32,366
Where did they go?

88
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,742
Go easy on him, there are too many eyes!

89
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:36,384
You sons of bitches!

90
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:38,329
Do you know how hard thugs have it?

91
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,840
I know, I know

92
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,390
My mom's from Suncheon!

93
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:43,254
-What about her? 
- She can't cook shit!

94
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:47,618
Damn, I feel so bad for you

95
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:51,378
Come inside 
l'll give yo a scratch

96
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:53,926
Put the knife down!

97
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:55,396
Wiat the?!

98
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,587
Goddamn..

99
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,093
Shit, we're fucked!

100
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,766
Yo, Heady!

101
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:06,543
What are you gonna do?

102
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:07,451
What ?!

103
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:08,358
Come here, let's talk

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,352
What ?!

105
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:10,735
Stay back!

106
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:11,816
Come on, man!

107
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:13,544
- Don't come near me!
- Easy,easy.

108
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:14,624
That's dangerous

109
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,877
Hey, Heady

110
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:18,038
Never seen me, right?
I've never seen you too.

111
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:20,025
Do you trust me or not?

112
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,191
What’s there to trust?!

113
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:24,302
Put the knife down,
it’s really dangerous!

114
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:30,655
Take them outside!

115
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:31,734
Okay, Hong-seok!

116
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:33,506
Please come out!
This way!

117
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,141
Hurry,put them in the car!

118
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,216
You son of a bitch.

119
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:39,771
If you stab people with this knife,

120
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:41,716
would it hurt or not?
Hurt or not?

121
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:43,099
It hurts!

122
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,092
You punk-ass.

123
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:45,605
Get up.

124
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:50,530
Goddamn!

125
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:56,666
Bastard, are you a zombie or something?

126
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,234
Get over here, no photos please!

127
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:07,512
Police's excessive force,
12 weeks in rehab..

128
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:11,141
How was this excessive force?

129
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:13,302
Maybe we should have
asked the nutjob politely,

130
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,981
"Excuse me,sir,
could you calm down?"

131
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:19,956
They were cheering and clapping,
what a messed up article

132
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:23,455
lt’s okay. I'm unrecognizable
with censored eyes

133
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,529
Your body has to be censored
to be unrecognizable

134
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,739
No, no one cant tell

135
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:31,319
Honestly, anyone could mistake him 
for a criminal with that tace

136
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,702
Our rookie's all grown up.

137
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,331
He does kinda look like a Russian thug.

138
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:41,171
If you look at it that way, 
your captain's a terrorist

139
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:44,627
His face has been drooping,
since high school days.

140
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:45,535
Am I right?

141
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,726
He kind of looks like 
a village totem pole!

142
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,189
His face expands and 
contracts ending on the day

143
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,133
- When I first met the captain 
- Quiet,shut up!

144
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:55,170
I almost cuffed him!

145
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:56,856
Cuff what, asshole,
shut up, buddy.

146
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,769
Having fun?
Are you happy?

147
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:05,973
Hey man.

148
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:10,510
You feel good to be on the newspaper?

149
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:15,522
It's a sin to be a captain.

150
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,497
Did they whoop you good?

151
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,349
I'll go talk to the chief.

152
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:24,423
Forget it, forget it.

153
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,368
You need to go to Vietnam.

154
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:27,879
Why there?

155
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,521
Heard of Yoo Jong-hoon?

156
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:30,213
No clue, who is he?

157
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:33,756
it's those guys who robbed a 
jewelry shop in Garibong district

158
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:35,096
Yoo was the lookout

159
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,299
These punks, l remember.

160
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,886
He turned himself in 
in Vietnam tor that case.

161
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:42,052
Why?

162
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,262
Who knows,

163
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,545
so go fetch him, think of it
as a 3-day business trip.

164
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:48,750
Going overseas for once.

165
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:49,700
Who do i bring?

166
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:52,552
Boss, my father is a 
Vietnam war veteran

167
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:53,935
It’s his son's turn to go there.

168
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:56,873
Sir,my sister's friend's
close associate lives in Vietnam!

169
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,644
- Whats with you?
- I'll do my best!

170
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:01,194
- Look at this punk 
- You got no seniority piss off!

171
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:02,274
You idiots!

172
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:05,687
You think this is an 
all-inclusive vacation?

173
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:09,144
It's an important job to 
repatriate a violent criminal!

174
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,601
I'm gonna go with him.

175
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,718
- Wait, hold on
- What is it?

176
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,786
You can't go, I need someone
who speaks English

177
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:18,563
English?

178
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:19,514
Can you speak English?

179
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,286
You're asking me if I speak English?

180
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:21,934
Prove it

181
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,267
I like to order salad first

182
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:24,958
But..

183
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,254
no onion,

184
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,891
no Balsamic vinegar.

185
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:29,755
Happy?

186
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:31,915
Wow. You speak English really well

187
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:36,106
That's right, you'll be just fine 
if you stay with me overseas!

188
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:37,229
Forget it, forget it.

189
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,340
No more on this,
trust me and follow my lead.

190
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:42,026
Our captain is incredible!

191
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:50,322
HO-CHI MINH
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

192
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:55,119
Trust you,huh?

193
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,612
These guys don't understand
British accent at all

194
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:03,544
Man, the Balsamic vinegar
was a huge red flag...

195
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,655
I always wanted to come here.

196
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:08,815
Hey,excuse me.

197
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,580
Hello? Hello? Hello?

198
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:16,506
I, uh...
we're Korea police,police.

199
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:19,488
We're really busy,
so we have to go.

200
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,086
Out, okay? Out.

201
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:22,987
Be quiet!

202
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:26,229
Fuck, this guy doesn't 
understand any English.

203
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,216
Don't swear, I can speak Korean!

204
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,012
Let's go sit.

205
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:35,777
l'm really sorry

206
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:41,482
Thank you

207
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,413
My apologies,
I'm a bit late

208
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,235
I'm Park Chang-su 
resident officer at the consulate.

209
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:50,469
So good to meet you!

210
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,067
I'm. Capt. Jeon Il-man
from Geumcheon Police

211
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,234
You're the captain!

212
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,228
I'm Det. Ma Seok-do.

213
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:55,610
- Detective...
- Hello, hello.

214
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:59,326
My underling can't speak
any English at all,

215
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:01,746
thats why we' re in this 
laughable predicament

216
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:03,691
- What the...
- Right.

217
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,543
It's all right, should we 
go for a meal first?

218
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:08,617
Yes, absolutely!
Sure thing.

219
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,518
- Grab all the luggage!
- Your luggage...

220
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:11,987
Hey!

221
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:14,147
Are there any good diners?

222
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:14,622
Jeez...

223
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,937
This is only $1? Really?

224
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:28,967
- Yes
-   That’s incredible

225
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:31,603
How could they travel without any cash?

226
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:32,900
They were haggling nonstop

227
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:35,190
Those bastards are Korean thugs.

228
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:36,918
Korean thugs are dime a dozen.

229
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:43,141
Many Korean shops opened up,
and gangs appeared alongside,

230
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,474
and violent crimes rose as well.

231
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,585
What the fuck is he looking at?

232
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:51,437
Hi.thugs, good to meet you.

233
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:53,165
You travelled a long way
to Vietnam

234
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,109
Fuck,he's a cop.

235
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,918
- Seriously? 
- You sure?

236
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:01,331
Look at it, they got some 
drugs and marijuana too.

237
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:02,541
They look fishy.

238
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,658
- That’s not marijuana.
- I'll be right back.

239
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:07,034
Come on you're mistaken!

240
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,627
- But those bastards.
- We need a break, man!

241
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,614
- Look, they're leaving!
-  Let them!

242
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:12,565
Are you Koreans?

243
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:15,720
We're having a grand opening,
we'll treat you right.

244
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:16,626
Korean again?

245
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:18,355
Gangnam service 
Ho Chi Minh price!

246
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:21,250
Piss off! 
Get that out of my face

247
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:23,714
Detective Ma!

248
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:25,485
Yo, Gasoline!

249
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:27,948
Boss...

250
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,671
Damn, what are you doing here?

251
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:31,579
KOREAN KARAOKE

252
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,862
Looking towards my future,

253
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:37,066
I couldn’t continue living like 
that in Korea.

254
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:41,257
Then forget night jobs,
 and do something in daylight.

255
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,331
But he works so brightly.

256
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:44,455
Who's this bastard?

257
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:45,794
l'm Cooking Oil

258
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,306
What the  hell...

259
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:51,282
What brings you all here?
To catch a criminal?

260
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:53,269
We're on a vacation.

261
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,336
Boss you have to be careful.

262
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,188
Korean police wield no power here.

263
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:03,121
A ton of gangsters here 
carry guns around.

264
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:03,855
Guns?

265
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:07,182
Yes.they got guns and 
machetes this big,

266
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,385
things are really different here.

267
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:13,275
Who cares about that, we're on vacation.

268
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,349
lt’s not like we'll ever get shot.

269
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,379
- Then come have fun!
- Sure thing.

270
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:18,892
All right.

271
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:20,145
Gangnam service!

272
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:21,268
At Ho Chi Minh price!

273
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:23,904
CONSULATE GENERAL 
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

274
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:26,626
Consulate offices aren't 
all that different from ours.

275
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:28,571
Such a poor condition.

276
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:31,379
At least we got air conditioning.

277
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,934
Yeah, it’s really hot here.

278
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:35,268
- How could anyone...
- Thank you for waiting!

279
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:38,768
- lt's really hot.
- lt sure is.

280
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:41,230
Are there many missing tourist cases?

281
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:44,341
With 30.000 tourists a month,
there are quite a bit of those.

282
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:46,891
Some disappear on their own.

283
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,397
Money Is always the problem.

284
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,212
Please sign here.

285
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:53,286
Once you submit this
to the immigration office,

286
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,965
you can fly him out
 after 10 AM tomorrow.

287
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:57,995
Why are there so much paperwork?

288
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:01,323
This is such a unique case.

289
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:06,076
There's no precedent for a criminal 
turning himself in to a consulate.

290
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:09,144
We freed up a room 
and kept him here,

291
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:11,261
but it’s such a hassle for us.

292
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:13,853
Why did he turn himself in?

293
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:18,088
He felt a pang of guilt.

294
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:19,773
What? He felt what?

295
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:23,489
A pang of guilt.

296
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,440
Pang of..

297
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:28,544
A pang of guilt.

298
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:32,260
Damn, I made a mistake,

299
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:33,988
I signed 'Jeon Guilt.'

300
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:36,970
Sorry about that.

301
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:44,315
Hey Jong-hoon.

302
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,907
Why did you turn yourself in?

303
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:48,808
I'm so very remorseful.

304
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,129
I'll receive my punishment in Korea.

305
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,981
You want to serve
your time in Korea?

306
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,857
You sure eat like a snake.

307
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,623
Captain.

308
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,345
To the Truth Room.

309
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:09,679
Here?

310
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:15,511
Okay, one sec.

311
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:16,635
Give me that!

312
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,350
All ready!

313
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:29,554
Keep a look out.

314
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:30,419
Okay!

315
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,091
Relax, it’s okay

316
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:38,196
Det. Ma can find out everything.

317
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:40,875
What? Find what out?

318
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:42,776
Why did you turn yourself in?

319
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:44,418
I felt a pang of guilt...

320
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:45,671
A pang of guilt?

321
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:49,905
J- J- JD!

322
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,720
J- J- JD!

323
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,090
JD tried to kill me!

324
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:58,677
Lee JD, that idiot 
you kept around?

325
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:00,059
He's here, yeah?

326
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:01,918
No.

327
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:02,998
No?

328
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:08,269
Det. Ma can find out everything.

329
00:16:09,783 --> 00:16:11,942
Let’s take one of your ears.

330
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:13,195
My ear,  my ear!

331
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:15,787
Hey De. Ma
go easy on him!

332
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:17,948
He's got too many ears can take one of them.

333
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:19,461
Buddy, spill it at once

334
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:21,016
Why did JD tried to kill you?

335
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:22,096
Hurts! lt hurts!

336
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,979
I messed with JD's girl...

337
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,843
Bastard, rip his ear off.

338
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:32,855
lf JD is here, 
then Ki-baek is too?

339
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:34,972
The three of you are a set, you punk!

340
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:35,836
No...

341
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:38,429
All right, don't answer.

342
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:42,836
Even if you don't say it,
Det. Ma can find out everything.

343
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,682
Are you doing that thing?
Hold on,wait!

344
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:48,497
You really shouldn't

345
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:51,738
Don't move, stay still,
you'll get hurt,

346
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:54,027
If you move, you might die.

347
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,182
Don't kill me!

348
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:01,027
ls there construction?

349
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:04,916
My eardrum's about to burst,
stop it, it hurts!

350
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,478
You're not sure?

351
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,897
But you're sure about JD?

352
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,490
Yes...

353
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,811
I don't think we should go
and get him on our own.

354
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:24,964
Bringing in two perps instead of one
is instant promotion for you.

355
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:28,292
No, we got no jurisdiction here.

356
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:30,841
Investigation and arrest 
are all illegal.

357
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:34,470
Wel I just tell him nicely
to turn himself in, that's all.

358
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,112
If you're involved,
it's an investigation!

359
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:39,396
Blind dates you go on?
Those are investigations!

360
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:41,644
What did Yoo say?

361
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:44,150
He keeps saying bullshit,

362
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:47,217
Captain. I'll submit this 
to the immigration office then.

363
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:48,212
Yes,sure.

364
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:51,063
I have a friend in Ho Chi Minh
I gotta meet...

365
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:51,711
I see.

366
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:53,310
Do you know where this is?

367
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:55,427
It's not too far from here.

368
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:58,019
But it's a rough neighborhood.

369
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,791
I'm okay with that.

370
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:01,952
He's rougher.

371
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,784
It’s over here.

372
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:16,556
People are home.

373
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:20,445
It’s locked.

374
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:23,038
- Locked?
- Yeah.

375
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:30,815
It's open now.

376
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,919
How could you break that!

377
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,469
JD, Jong-hoon spilled his guts.

378
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:39,155
Let’s go home...

379
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:44,253
What the hell?!

380
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:49,784
Jeez...

381
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,858
Goddamn, what happened?

382
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:55,574
This is a murder.

383
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:57,604
This messes things up.

384
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:02,271
Call Mr. Park immediately.

385
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,660
Buddy,get the hell up!

386
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:13,117
You fucking dare to lie to me?

387
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:14,715
What's going on?

388
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,351
JD was murdered, asshole.

389
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:21,369
What have you been doing?
Tell me everything.

390
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:22,838
How's a beating first?

391
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,171
Sir, deputy, this could 
spark a big problem.

392
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:27,807
Captain,
can you please stop him?

393
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:30,011
Don't do it.

394
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:36,017
Let's not do this,
I'll release you, just go.

395
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:36,795
What?

396
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:38,567
I think that's the best way,
get out of here.

397
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:39,646
Go, come on, go.

398
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,412
Detective, I turned myself in.

399
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:44,745
Turned yourself in?

400
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:46,214
l won't accept it, just go.

401
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,078
Get over here!

402
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:47,770
Get the hell out!

403
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,369
I turned myself in, goddammit!

404
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:52,955
"Goddammit"? You swore at me?

405
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:54,381
- Detective!
- I'll escort you out.

406
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:56,757
- Help! Please help!
- Let’s go, let’s go home!

407
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:58,399
Wait, please! 
What are you doing?!

408
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,862
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

409
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:07,645
We kidnapped a man here 
with a guy named Kang Hae-sang!

410
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,892
Who? Kang Hae-sang?

411
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,127
He lured us to kidnap Choi Yong-gi, 
who runs a resort business.

412
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:15,812
Choi came from money.

413
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:20,997
That young bloke was a chump
but spent money like a champ!

414
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:21,948
Give me that.

415
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,405
This is only $50.000.

416
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:29,034
And this is barely $90.000.

417
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,886
Which is less than
$20.000 per head.

418
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:33,571
No fucking way.

419
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:36,164
Asswipe, what happened?

420
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,374
We went through all that mess
just for this?

421
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:39,663
Speak your mind.

422
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:41,219
Mr. JD,

423
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:44,935
You said your friends are pros,
but they're amateurs.

424
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,404
- What?
- Amateurs?

425
00:20:46,923 --> 00:20:48,219
Maybe they're simpletons.

426
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,472
Fucking hell?!

427
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,595
What did you just say, asshole?

428
00:20:57,596 --> 00:21:01,138
If it wasn't for Choi's money, 
you'd already be dead.

429
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:04,163
I went too easy on you.

430
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:06,064
Fuckers.

431
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,434
Don't want to make money?

432
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,854
There's a limit to my patience.

433
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,145
- Du-ik, you...
- Fucking bitch!

434
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:15,916
Stop it!

435
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:18,638
What in the world?!

436
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,409
Get that bastard!

437
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:23,564
- Stop right there!
- You fucker!

438
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:25,725
We'll continue this chat.

439
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,187
Get that fucker!

440
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:41,539
Goddamn, you!

441
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:43,223
You can't lose him!

442
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:45,729
Stop right there!

443
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,539
Get up!

444
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,692
Grab him!

445
00:21:51,737 --> 00:21:53,119
Son of a bitch!

446
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,124
You fucking bitch!

447
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:04,612
Fuck, get over here!

448
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:07,767
Fucking bastard!

449
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:10,748
You got a death wish?

450
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,952
Wait, please!

451
00:22:12,953 --> 00:22:18,093
I'll pay you $100.000 per head 
that’s a promise!

452
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:19,174
Fuck...

453
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:19,692
$100.000per head!

454
00:22:19,693 --> 00:22:21,507
For real? You sure?

455
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:25,223
I got $200.000 in my hotel room,
and some gold bars too.

456
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,599
So what's the passcode?!

457
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,544
2963! 2963!

458
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:32,050
2963? That's the real one?

459
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,371
We could've saved so much-trouble
if you let us borrow some earlier.

460
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:37,278
Sorry.

461
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:40,605
Why didn't you say so,
what are we doing here?

462
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:44,105
We could open a resort
without that bastard!

463
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:45,487
Look at this fucker.

464
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:48,598
If you lie, you're as good as dead.

465
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:05,018
He's dead?

466
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:09,555
Are you out of your mind?

467
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:11,888
How could you kill him?

468
00:23:12,235 --> 00:23:16,339
We gotta get paid 
before chopping him up, asshole!

469
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,851
Fucking bastard, money...

470
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,178
What the fuck?!

471
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:31,980
One less head means
more for all.

472
00:23:44,685 --> 00:23:48,183
What are you doing.
dig properly, asshole!

473
00:23:57,345 --> 00:23:59,115
Working overseas sure is nice.

474
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:02,745
Cops are loose,
easy to get the job done

475
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:07,369
$200.000 and gold bars
from the hotel safe.

476
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,480
That’s all?

477
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:13,288
I could squeeze more out ot him.

478
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:16,789
You there.

479
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:20,678
Hold on.

480
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:12,355
Mr. Choi here's your son's arm,
send $500.000 and he's yours.

481
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:13,219
And then?

482
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:18,491
2 days later, he got paid,
and JD and I just ran.

483
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,997
With money in his hand,
he turned evil.

484
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:25,058
For a few days now,
I sensed men following me.

485
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,509
I think Kang sent his men to kill me!

486
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:32,966
I'm sorry.

487
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:35,731
You should've said so earlier!

488
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:38,627
That’s why you turned yourself in?

489
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:39,620
Yes...

490
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:42,514
Kang must've killed JD.

491
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:45,020
If he finds out that I'm here
I'm dead as well.

492
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:48,866
Please send me to Korea, boss!

493
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:51,502
Now what then?
We heard everything

494
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,353
Let's find the bodies first.

495
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,038
He's so excited.

496
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,810
Write down the address here.

497
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:59,020
- Address?
- Yeah.

498
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:02,649
Deputy Captain,
this will cause headaches for a lot of people.

499
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,235
Yeah, but l still need
the address.

500
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:07,489
It’s okay, it’s okay.

501
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,420
Captain, this has to be
handed over to the local police.

502
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:13,840
Or he will be deported!

503
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,655
Yes, please make that happen.

504
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:16,173
Pardon?

505
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,161
Please get him deported!

506
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:21,013
Captain, I'm begging you.

507
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:24,124
GEUMCHEON POLICE

508
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:28,617
Boss, are you having fun?

509
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,253
See if anything pops up
on one Kang Hae-sang,

510
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:36,655
and a missing person report
on one Choi Yong-gi.

511
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:38,426
Kang Hae-sang and Choi Yong-gi?

512
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:41,062
Any other details to go on?

513
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:42,013
Nothing else.

514
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:44,173
Get on it.

515
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:45,080
Yes, I understand.

516
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:46,939
Thank you.

517
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,445
So, what did they say?

518
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:53,420
Cops don't sympathize
with other cops.

519
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:55,753
lt'll take about a month
before a warrant is issued.

520
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,993
Kang will fleer te another country
before then!

521
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,722
Then what can.we do?
We're not in Korea.

522
00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:01,802
What can we do?

523
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,790
Shouldn't you do Something?

524
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:05,518
Nothing can be done.

525
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,728
Like what?
Nothing can be done

526
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:07,851
Damn it!

527
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:08,931
Where are you going?

528
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,999
Where is he off to now?

529
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,067
Mr. Park,please go stop him,
he probably won't

530
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,839
listen.

531
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:20,728
Have you seen this person?

532
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:22,412
I don't know what you mean.

533
00:27:22,414 --> 00:27:23,839
Can you understand him?

534
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,350
A few months ago, I think.

535
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:26,475
Seok-do, I now I can't stop you,

536
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:30,061
but this isn't Garibong district.

537
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:33,258
Hey,hey!

538
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:34,295
Wait a minute!

539
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:35,981
- Stop it,man!
- Stop doing that!

540
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,184
What’s the matter with you?

541
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:41,252
Just let me find this prick,
move out of the way

542
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:43,455
Wait!

543
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:45,746
Det. Ma,you really can't do this

544
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,949
Will you be responsible
for any problems?

545
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,548
This is clearly an illegal activity!

546
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:54,171
If this country's laws can't protect 
our people, then shouldn't we?

547
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,856
Seok-do, you're right, but...

548
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:57,800
Am l wrong?

549
00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:05,664
Call the Cops.

550
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:07,523
We'll all be arrested.

551
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:18,281
Christ, is it even here?

552
00:28:20,486 --> 00:28:24,979
Are you gardening?
Hurry up and do it right!

553
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,405
Here,here!

554
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:27,961
lt's a worm...

555
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,868
Damn it.

556
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:33,534
What's this?

557
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:42,133
Damn!

558
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:46,281
Found it, it's right there!

559
00:28:46,628 --> 00:28:47,706
What?

560
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:49,565
Holy cow!

561
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:51,207
I got one here too!

562
00:28:51,726 --> 00:28:52,849
Another one?

563
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:56,607
We're in hell,

564
00:28:56,608 --> 00:28:58,207
I'll notify the authorities.

565
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,367
Four bodies in total.

566
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:17,996
I really did come here
on a vacation.

567
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:19,509
Detective, what's up?

568
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,188
Have you heard of-Kang Hae-sang/

569
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:23,613
What?

570
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,990
You're after that bastard too?

571
00:29:26,552 --> 00:29:27,761
How do you know him?

572
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:34,286
A local Korean thug named Raku 
was looking for Kang

573
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,187
about 3 days ago.

574
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:37,829
Raku?

575
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:40,205
- Where is he now?
- I don't know

576
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,619
- Is something up?
- Look into it and call me ASAP!

577
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,261
What is Korean detective doing here?!

578
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:47,767
ls there a law in your country?!

579
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,150
We'd like to apologize.

580
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:52,995
You'll be responsible for this.

581
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:54,594
Go back to your hotel!

582
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:56,236
- What? Hotel?
- What did he say?

583
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,167
I call your...

584
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:02,155
We'ree cops too!

585
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,920
How could we stand back
when our people are butchered?!

586
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:05,396
Captain!

587
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:07,341
Even if we don't have
any jurisdiction...

588
00:30:07,342 --> 00:30:09,242
Easy,easy.they're 
pulling out their guns.

589
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:11,359
But even so...

590
00:30:11,836 --> 00:30:13,736
I'll sort it out here,
please stay at the hotel.

591
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:16,328
Okay, I understand,
sorry, sorry.

592
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,136
I'm getting this fucker 
no matter what.

593
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:23,544
If we bring him to the consulate,
we could put him on a flight.

594
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:26,439
How do we catch him?
You got a plan?

595
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:30,069
Come with me.

596
00:30:42,686 --> 00:30:44,587
So humid..

597
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:52,105
You're here?

598
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:52,710
Where?

599
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:53,617
Over here! Boss!

600
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,166
Let’s go.

601
00:30:56,643 --> 00:30:57,981
Find it at once!

602
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:00,660
There should be $500.000
in cash,so search thoroughly.

603
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,679
You saw him with your own eyes/

604
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,876
Yes. I'm sure.
I saw him myself.

605
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,253
I saw Kang leave this morning.

606
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,241
I found it!

607
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,519
Good, you may go.

608
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,117
Okay...

609
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:20,581
Thank you.

610
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,475
lt’s a lot.

611
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:27,018
Look at this fucker.

612
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,524
That’s gotta be way more than $1M.

613
00:31:30,044 --> 00:31:31,383
How many did he kill?

614
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:32,981
Let’s send the money back first.

615
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:34,494
Okay.

616
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:38,296
Yes, we found it.

617
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,068
What brings you here?

618
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:48,278
A bus brought us here.

619
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,907
Wow, just look at them.

620
00:31:52,642 --> 00:31:54,500
Look, a sea of Koreans.

621
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,604
Hey,buddy!

622
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:01,586
Come here!

623
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:03,875
What is it?

624
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:07,376
Fetch me Raku or Roku or whatever.

625
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:09,018
Who are you people?

626
00:32:09,321 --> 00:32:11,524
They're all Korean hooligans.

627
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:13,252
Boys, gather around!

628
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,499
Oh, you guys are cops?

629
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:17,832
Leave and save yourself
some bloodshed.

630
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:18,783
ls he there?

631
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:20,208
Where you going?

632
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:27,554
Dude...

633
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:31,832
Stay down.

634
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,603
You'll get hurt!

635
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:35,721
Just stay down.

636
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,337
Stop!

637
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:49,547
Stay on the ground.

638
00:32:49,765 --> 00:32:53,350
Why are fucking Korean po-pos
making noise on my property?

639
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:55,510
Are you the local police/

640
00:32:55,511 --> 00:32:56,633
You're Raku?

641
00:32:56,634 --> 00:32:59,140
I am, motherfucker

642
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,381
Boss!

643
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:04,929
And you are?

644
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,053
I'm Cheeky.

645
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:07,263
Don't be cheeky!

646
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:11,195
Hey!

647
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:13,658
You're all fucking dead bastards.

648
00:33:13,918 --> 00:33:16,941
This is Vietnam, not Korea
you fucking shit!

649
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:24,200
Fuck, this is a real gun
you thought you could kill me?

650
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,540
Come here, come here!

651
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,089
- I'll kill you!
- Stay back!

652
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:29,948
Stay the fuck back!

653
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:32,626
Nobody move!

654
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:34,787
Don't you dare to move!

655
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:39,670
Stay where you are, assholes!

656
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:42,392
Choose your words carefully,
or this is your last day.

657
00:33:42,393 --> 00:33:42,997
Yes, sir.

658
00:33:42,998 --> 00:33:44,293
Speak properly.

659
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:46,324
Why did you look for Kang Hae-sang?

660
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:49,349
We were paid to track him down,
I don't know the details.

661
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:51,638
So who hired you?!

662
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:55,830
Some mercs from Korea,
that’s all l know!

663
00:33:55,831 --> 00:33:56,910
Mercs?

664
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,552
Yes, sir.

665
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:00,280
So did you find Kang/

666
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:03,953
He guided them.

667
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:06,891
Yo, who are you?

668
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:08,620
I'm Cheeky.

669
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:10,521
You fucking cheeky monkey,
get over here!

670
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:14,193
- I'll be back!
- See you soon!

671
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:18,946
Where are you, sir?

672
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:21,236
We're heading to Kang's location.

673
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:22,489
Did you find anything?

674
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:26,206
I asked an friend in the Intelligence 
for Kang's files

675
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:30,440
and strangely, Choi was 
never reported missing.

676
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:30,915
Yeah?

677
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,409
What's the deal with his family?
What does his father do?

678
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:38,563
Choi Choon-baek,
head of Joeun Capital,

679
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:39,816
he's a glorified loan shark.

680
00:34:39,817 --> 00:34:41,415
Choi Choon-baek, I think
I've heard of him.

681
00:34:42,683 --> 00:34:43,511
He's infamous in Myeongdong,

682
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,983
and main business is
lending money to corporations,

683
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:52,087
daily cash transaction amount
is said to be in millions.

684
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:55,155
But he never reported
his own son missing?

685
00:34:55,156 --> 00:34:56,322
Should I dig in further?

686
00:34:56,323 --> 00:34:57,964
Yeah,look into it.

687
00:34:58,224 --> 00:34:59,217
Okay.

688
00:35:00,169 --> 00:35:01,637
What did he say?

689
00:35:02,804 --> 00:35:06,864
it looks like Choi's father
sent mercs to kill the kidnappers.

690
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:29,117
Let’s get ready.

691
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:10,226
Look at this punk.

692
00:38:46,883 --> 00:38:47,487
Die!

693
00:38:57,427 --> 00:38:58,765
You from Korea?

694
00:39:29,142 --> 00:39:30,351
You took my money?

695
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:41,887
Who sent you?

696
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:46,122
Fuck you, asshole.

697
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,153
Choi...
Choi Choon-baek!

698
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,703
Choi Choon-baek?

699
00:39:58,092 --> 00:39:59,604
Yong-gi's father?

700
00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:10,406
JOEUN CAPITAL

701
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:17,103
Mr. Choi,

702
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:20,041
this is Kang Hae-sang.

703
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:22,504
You're not dead yet?

704
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:24,837
You sent men to kill me?

705
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:27,991
You took my money
and killed my son

706
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,670
you thought you'd be safe?

707
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:35,493
I said you'd get him back,
but didn't say he'd be alive.

708
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,522
I...

709
00:40:39,832 --> 00:40:41,472
will kill you.

710
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,170
Why did you take my money?

711
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:51,886
Return it.

712
00:40:52,276 --> 00:40:54,090
Or I'm coming to Korea.

713
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,540
His manners are fucked-up.

714
00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:19,929
Dude, wait a minute!

715
00:41:20,923 --> 00:41:21,354
All ready!

716
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:23,299
Why did you bring the gun?

717
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:25,805
i forgot to return this to him.

718
00:41:25,806 --> 00:41:26,885
Wait for me!

719
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:31,595
The door's open.

720
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,441
Dang,he got wind of it
and fled already.

721
00:41:40,022 --> 00:41:41,187
Holy shit!

722
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:42,224
What the hell?

723
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:44,169
What's all this?

724
00:41:45,812 --> 00:41:47,668
How many are dead here/

725
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:49,527
I think we're too late.

726
00:41:52,768 --> 00:41:53,761
Damn it..

727
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,223
Why are there so many bags?

728
00:42:04,737 --> 00:42:08,063
This fucker targeted Korean tourists.

729
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:11,087
Look at these passports.

730
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:12,729
What’s this?

731
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,013
I found it, it’s Choi Yong-gi

732
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:17,699
Jeez..

733
00:42:31,353 --> 00:42:32,865
Get over here,asshole.

734
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:53,173
Fucking bastards...

735
00:42:54,384 --> 00:42:55,981
You're Kang Hae-sang?

736
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,450
Police!

737
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:06,956
Don't move...

738
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,284
Drop the knife.

739
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:12,400
Drop it,asshole!

740
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:28,043
Get off! Son of a bitch!

741
00:43:39,063 --> 00:43:40,444
Come here asshole!

742
00:43:59,414 --> 00:44:00,147
Fuck...

743
00:44:04,555 --> 00:44:05,549
Goddammit!

744
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,425
Captain!

745
00:44:13,198 --> 00:44:14,925
Bang! Bang!

746
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:16,740
Fuck it...

747
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,592
Useless piece of shit...

748
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:23,178
THONG NHAT ARMY HOSPITAL

749
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:26,894
Yes, I didn't know at all.

750
00:44:26,895 --> 00:44:32,338
But-this happened because 
they were working for our Korean Tourists,

751
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,196
so if you decide to do that...

752
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:36,659
Yes, I know the procedure,
Mr. Consulate,but...

753
00:44:37,956 --> 00:44:38,604
Seok-do..

754
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:41,152
Let's catch him, 
I'm so angry

755
00:44:41,326 --> 00:44:44,263
I catch him.
so get some rest.

756
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,937
How could I?
can't even piss on my own...

757
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:50,788
Call me when you need to piss, goddammit!

758
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:57,399
By the way, how long
do we need to be locked up here?

759
00:44:58,091 --> 00:44:58,912
Hey, Hong-seok!

760
00:44:59,345 --> 00:45:01,633
Are you all right, boss?
How's the captain?

761
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:04,659
Captain's good,
any updates on Kang?

762
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,683
The Intelligence has been gathering
information on kidnapping

763
00:45:07,684 --> 00:45:09,930
and murder cases in Southeast Asia
against Korean tourists.

764
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:11,745
The Philippines, Cambodia, etc.

765
00:45:11,746 --> 00:45:12,652
All four cases
resemble Kang's MO.

766
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:18,269
Make contact, get friendly
kidnap,then demand ransom,

767
00:45:18,443 --> 00:45:20,775
but even after ransom,
none of them came back.

768
00:45:20,993 --> 00:45:22,288
How many in total?

769
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,275
Four have been identified so far.

770
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:25,658
Also, boss,

771
00:45:26,782 --> 00:45:29,893
the chief wants you to
stop causing trouble..

772
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,362
All right! I'm hanging up!

773
00:45:31,751 --> 00:45:34,300
Captain,how are you feeling?

774
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:35,120
It's okay.he's fine,
he's a crybaby.

775
00:45:37,412 --> 00:45:40,349
I told you stay at the hotel...

776
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,688
Oh man..

777
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:45,015
You two are being deported.

778
00:45:46,355 --> 00:45:46,917
What?

779
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:49,725
The authorities will
take you to the airport.

780
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:50,719
Wait a minute..

781
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,971
Stay where you are.

782
00:45:51,972 --> 00:45:54,305
We have to arrest Kang here!

783
00:45:54,307 --> 00:45:56,465
Det. Ma, please.

784
00:45:57,418 --> 00:45:59,318
What exactly is the reason?

785
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:01,565
you're going this far in
someone else's country?

786
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:04,762
Should there be a reason
for wanting to catch a killer/

787
00:46:05,756 --> 00:46:07,700
A bad guy must be caught!

788
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:10,940
We have to catch that bastard,
I won't leave without him!

789
00:46:10,941 --> 00:46:11,935
Never!

790
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:13,879
I'm sorry about this.

791
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,471
l won't leave. l'm too angry.

792
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:17,898
I'm not leaving!

793
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,194
Oh yeah.

794
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:21,613
That tall bastard I brought in...

795
00:46:28,269 --> 00:46:29,261
What?

796
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:31,680
Help me! Help me!

797
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,964
The Korean detectives
in custody ran away!

798
00:46:34,965 --> 00:46:36,650

799
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:39,372

Are you gonna take the fall
for the eight bodies we found?

803
00:47:04,348 --> 00:47:06,940
The local police wil kill you
 if you stay here.

804
00:47:08,755 --> 00:47:09,834
Buddy!

805
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,772
Tell me where Kang is,

806
00:47:14,156 --> 00:47:16,402
and I'll repatriate you.

807
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:20,722
Effective immediately!

808
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:23,099
You'll be deported from Vietnam!

809
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:25,433
Take him to the airport!

810
00:47:25,434 --> 00:47:26,556

00:47:32,088 --> 00:47:33,771
Don't do that, come on!

815
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:36,537
All right, we have to go!

816
00:47:36,538 --> 00:47:37,574

817
00:47:37,575 --> 00:47:38,956
- Go where?
- To Korea!

818
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:39,561
Why there?

819
00:47:39,562 --> 00:47:41,852
We’re being deported,
we must be deported!

820
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:42,845
We are?

821
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,315
Yes, obey the law!

822
00:47:44,316 --> 00:47:45,784
Translate for us.

823
00:47:46,087 --> 00:47:47,513
They'll cooperate.

824
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:49,327

825
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:50,839

00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,290
- We have to go.
- Are you nuts?!

828
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:56,586
We have to catch Kang!

829
00:47:57,279 --> 00:47:59,135
He's in Korea
to meet Choi Choon-baek.

830
00:48:00,217 --> 00:48:01,296
Let’s go!

831
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:05,530
Hey boss.

832
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,604
Look at this fuck
grinning like an idiot

833
00:48:07,605 --> 00:48:08,771
- Allow me.
- Yeah, here.

834
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,838
Captain, look at you.

835
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:12,875
Don't even mention it.

836
00:48:12,876 --> 00:48:17,196
l was ambushed by dozens
of baddies with machetes.

837
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:18,018
Go rest up at home.

838
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:20,092
Go rest... How could I?

839
00:48:20,093 --> 00:48:22,598
I need to head back 
and report to the chief.

840
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,627
- As the captain ...
- Give the captain his luggage.

841
00:48:24,628 --> 00:48:26,054
- Yes of course .
- Let's move quickly.

842
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:27,479
What are you doing?

843
00:48:27,998 --> 00:48:29,985
You gotta carry this for me,
hey, Dong-gyun!

844
00:48:29,986 --> 00:48:31,541
Buddy,my hands!

845

Flying around a in't easy.

846
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:35,991
What a mess.

847
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:40,485
Hong-seok and the rookie's
looking into smuggling vessels,

848
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:43,208
he'll smuggle in, right?

849
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:44,504
Yeah, I'm sure.

850
00:48:44,764 --> 00:48:47,269
The captain almost died.

851
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:51,849
That vicious bastard,
 I'm getting mad thinking about it.

852
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,188
How could he stab a cop?

853
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,862
Just give me one chance.

854
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:14,188
Which floor are you here for?

855
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,787
3rd floor

856
00:49:15,961 --> 00:49:16,780
Come with us.

857
00:49:16,781 --> 00:49:18,509

00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,879
Those guys weren't my guys!

860
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,743
Where should l put it?

861
00:49:22,744 --> 00:49:24,169
Just put it there!

862
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:26,632
Sir! Sir!

863
00:49:28,837 --> 00:49:30,910
Fucking hell...

864
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:36,959
Have a great meal.

865
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:42,793
I'll turn this place upside down.

866
00:49:43,873 --> 00:49:47,200

sweet and sour pork.

867
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:49,403
- Thanks for the meal.
- All of this for one?

868
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,329
How did you know l was here?

869
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,928
Ever heard of GPS?

870
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,483
Everything is searchable.

871
00:49:57,959 --> 00:49:58,909
Asshole!

872
00:49:59,947 --> 00:50:02,582
Sit down, you illegal alien,
come sit down.

873
00:50:02,842 --> 00:50:06,471
I've been legal so long,
and ever since l almost died,

874
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:08,588
I only do legal work.

875
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:12,001
Finding work for illegal alien
is what you call legal?

876
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:13,945
Enough, we got no time,

877
00:50:14,422 --> 00:50:17,316

coming in from China.

878
00:50:18,138 --> 00:50:20,125
I left that life so long ago!

879
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:23,538
What's with your hand?
You rude mofo.

880
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:27,341
I've had it with you,
it's been a while.

881
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:29,761
Here.

882
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:32,526
Listen here.

883
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:33,433
Not coming?

884
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:35,852
I'm not the same Jang Isu
from before!

885
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:37,625
One.

886
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:42,334
If you mess with me, 
l won't take it on my ass!

887
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:43,328
Two.

888

Yeah...

889
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:01,562
So anything came in

890
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:05,839
All right, I'm hanging up.

891
00:51:07,223 --> 00:51:07,957
Who was that?

892
00:51:09,038 --> 00:51:11,024
He's known as Captain One-eye

893
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:13,530
He's the only game in town
when it comes to China.

894
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:14,870
SKIPPER KIM GYO-BUM

895
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:18,154
He said a new vessel
came into Goongpyong port.

896
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:20,011
- Call Hong-seok.
- Calling.

897
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,425

That's it!

902
00:51:34,013 --> 00:51:34,660
That's all.

903
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,641
You can't just barge in
 and harass me!

904
00:51:37,642 --> 00:51:40,104
Shut your face and answer me
when l call, got that?

905
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:41,919
Let’s move.

906
00:51:43,907 --> 00:51:46,412
You fucking bastard!

907
00:51:49,222 --> 00:51:50,992
Did you call me?
No, sir.

908
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:55,400
What a fucking dickhead...

909
00:51:57,518 --> 00:51:59,720
GEUMCHEON POLICE

910
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:02,399
GOONGPYUNGMART CAM #3

911
00:52:03,178 --> 00:52:04,258
Where is this?

912
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:07,844
Parking lot behind the port,
I got nothing

913
00:52:09,142 --> 00:52:10,307
Check the next one.

914
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:15,406
- Sir.
- What?

915
00:52:17,913 --> 00:52:20,634
This guy's suspicious,
he's checking tires.

916
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:22,060
Maybe for car keys?

917
00:52:22,709 --> 00:52:24,479
Boss, I think we got something.

918
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,387
You found him?

919
00:52:25,863 --> 00:52:26,856
Rewind it

920
00:52:27,808 --> 00:52:28,368
Let’s see

921
00:52:30,055 --> 00:52:30,831
Stop.

922
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:32,128
Zoom in

923
00:52:33,554 --> 00:52:34,936
2608251...

924
00:52:34,937 --> 00:52:36,362
Yeah, that's him.

925
00:52:36,622 --> 00:52:38,997
- Send out an APB for it.
- We got you asshole.

926
00:52:49,024 --> 00:52:52,134
Chairman, seems like Kang
entered Korea

927
00:52:52,783 --> 00:52:54,553
Get some more mercs.

928
00:52:54,944 --> 00:52:56,368
Bring them from overseas.

929
00:52:57,321 --> 00:53:01,380
Give them 2 large upfront,
and another 2 after the job.

930
00:53:01,382 --> 00:53:03,542
Dead or alive.

931
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,572
Yes.chairman.

932
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,781
KOREAN COPS WERE
STABBED IN VIETNAM

933
00:53:27,782 --> 00:53:31,282
With your order, l sort it out
with the media.

934
00:53:31,974 --> 00:53:34,090
All right, go on.

935
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:39,491
Ma Seok-do!

936
00:53:39,492 --> 00:53:42,170
I told you to keep a low profile.

937
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:45,064
You made a big ass mess
to fuck with me, right?

938
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:47,743
No way.
I was just trying to catch a perp.

939
00:53:48,954 --> 00:53:50,941
Why were you trying
to catch a perp there?!

940
00:53:50,943 --> 00:53:52,669
They got cops there too!

941
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:56,732
And you, I sent you
to keep an eye on him,

942
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,108
yet you fueled the fire,
and shot a gun too!

943
00:53:59,325 --> 00:54:01,787
l barely shot any,
 it was busted.

944
00:54:02,955 --> 00:54:06,107
Why is this being handed over 
to Foreign Affairs?

945
00:54:06,108 --> 00:54:09,176
We're about to close it 
with security cam evidence,

946
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:10,947
how could you hand it all over now?

947
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:11,465
Yeah!

948
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,151
I'm powerless on this!

949
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:15,571
lt’s no use telling me!

950
00:54:16,306 --> 00:54:19,070
Always so powerless,
that's so weird.

951
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:26,588
Our chief didnt read our report
thoroughly again right?

952
00:54:26,676 --> 00:54:27,712
- Again?!
- Yeah!

953
00:54:27,713 --> 00:54:28,879
No wonder

954
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:30,953
What do you mean?

955
00:54:30,954 --> 00:54:35,662
Jeez, a total of four bodies
were uncovered in Vietnam.

956
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:40,328
Of the missing Korean tourist cases
in the Philippines and Cambodia,

957
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:42,489
Kang is suspected of tour of them!

958
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,007
Four!

959
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:45,341
This guy is in a class of his own!

960
00:54:45,343 --> 00:54:47,587
That’s why Foreign Affairs
is taking over!

961
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:50,440
if that's the end of it,
your call is the right one.

962
00:54:50,743 --> 00:54:52,082
There's something else?

963
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:55,668
To seek revenge
for the death of his son,

964
00:54:55,669 --> 00:54:59,687
Choi's father sent Korean mercs
to kill Kang and his men!

965
00:54:59,903 --> 00:55:02,408
But Kang killed even those guys,

966
00:55:02,409 --> 00:55:04,569
and he's here to find
Choi Choon-baek!

967
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,939
If Kang suddenly shows up,
would Choi just stay back?

968
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:09,193
Isn't it insane?

969
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,230
lt sure is.

970
00:55:10,749 --> 00:55:12,736
Choi will send out gangsters,

971
00:55:13,212 --> 00:55:14,723
Seoul will turn into a bloodbath!

972
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,013
Then well be on TV.

973
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:19,303
If that happens,
we're all dead.

974
00:55:19,304 --> 00:55:19,995
All dead.

975
00:55:19,996 --> 00:55:21,464
Especially you,
you're double dead!

976
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:22,069
So dead.

977
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,840
- As the head police!
- So head.

978
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:26,778
You got that in the report?
That shit will hit the fan?

979
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:30,710
I'm begging you, please!

980
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:32,654
Read the report thoroughly

981
00:55:34,687 --> 00:55:36,587
I can stall them for a week.

982
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:38,012
Close this case within a week!

983
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:39,913
A week! You got it.

984
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:41,470
A week!
A week!

985
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:43,025
Nice! A week!

986
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:08,950
You're the detective
who brought my boy back, right?

987
00:56:10,895 --> 00:56:11,975
Yes, ma'am.

988
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:17,548
Thank you.

989
00:56:19,494 --> 00:56:20,962
Please stay for a meal.

990
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,252
Yes, ma'am.

991
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:28,999
She's his second wife.

992
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,542
He never had any children
with his first before she died,

993
00:56:32,802 --> 00:56:33,493
and Choi Yong-gi
was his only offspring.

994
00:56:36,908 --> 00:56:38,332
No wonder he sent mercs.

995
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:38,894
Yeah, I guess.

996
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:42,912
This is a gangster sausage party

997
00:56:43,562 --> 00:56:44,684
Yes,indeed.

998
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:47,363
Beautiful weather.

999
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,696
Do we get any gas stipend?

1000
00:56:49,999 --> 00:56:52,635
You serious? Dumbass

1001
00:56:53,586 --> 00:56:55,702
How many months financed?

1002
00:56:55,876 --> 00:56:58,640
60 months. I got 59 left.

1003
00:56:59,073 --> 00:57:02,442
Go easy with it,
don't use it on operations.

1004
00:57:03,912 --> 00:57:04,560
Do you know how much
I cherish my baby?

1005
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:05,683
Isn't this a second-hand car?

1006
00:57:05,684 --> 00:57:07,844
Yeah, Dong-gyun,
I got it.

1007
00:57:09,962 --> 00:57:11,862
- Your keys.
- Why?

1008
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:14,627
Dong-gyun found Kang's car.
l'll go check it out.

1009
00:57:14,628 --> 00:57:15,621
I'll come with you.

1010
00:57:15,622 --> 00:57:18,516
No, you stay here and watch Choi,

1011
00:57:18,517 --> 00:57:20,503
and rookie, watch
the cams thoroughly, got it?

1012
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:21,152
Yes,sir.

1013
00:57:21,153 --> 00:57:22,967
- Give him your key,hurry.
- My key?

1014
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:25,429
Give me yours,
I like this type of car,a USB.

1015
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,325
It's SUV...

1016
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,263
Damn,didn't work.

1017
00:57:47,078 --> 00:57:48,028
Boss.

1018
00:57:48,374 --> 00:57:49,583
Did you get anything?

1019
00:57:49,584 --> 00:57:51,916
Kang is so fucking meticulous.

1020
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:55,330
He wiped the vehicle down
before ditching it.

1021
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:57,447
No security cams nearby either.

1022
00:57:58,226 --> 00:57:59,651
This won't be easy.

1023
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:22,379
They're standing by
in the lower parking lot.

1024
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:25,361
Theyre triad Chairman Ju's boys?

1025
00:58:25,362 --> 00:58:27,218
Yes,they're a sure thing.

1026
00:58:27,219 --> 00:58:29,638
If you fail this time,
you'll die first.

1027
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:30,588
Yes,sir.

1028
00:58:32,577 --> 00:58:34,650
The chairman's heading down, standby.

1029
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:46,489
I'm coming down.

1030
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:49,644
Copy.

1031
00:58:53,015 --> 00:58:54,094
Let’s go.

1032
00:58:59,107 --> 00:59:00,402
Wait a sec.

1033
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:03,254
Who are those assholes?

1034
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,637
I don't see any resemblance...

1035
00:59:26,848 --> 00:59:28,271
I'm Kang Hae-sang.

1036
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:29,265
You bastard!

1037
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:39,765
Die!

1038
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,894
Die,you fuck!

1039
01:00:13,685 --> 01:00:15,456
I told you l'd come to Korea

1040
01:00:16,148 --> 01:00:17,530
Where's my money?

1041
01:00:18,265 --> 01:00:20,209
Greet the chairman properly,

1042
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:22,715
and we just need to kill Kang Hae-sang.

1043
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,381
It’s just one guy,
this will be over quickly.

1044
01:00:36,024 --> 01:00:37,362
What's going on here?

1045
01:00:57,757 --> 01:00:59,052
Come here, asshole.

1046
01:01:20,313 --> 01:01:21,608
It's been a while.

1047
01:01:22,602 --> 01:01:24,287
Who are these fucks?

1048
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:27,052
Pay us more for them.

1049
01:01:34,096 --> 01:01:36,126
What's that?

1050
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:38,459
Crap!

1051
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,262
Hong-seok! B1!

1052
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:44,119
Choi is being kidnapped!

1053
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:47,879
Out of the way!

1054
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:49,089
Shit!

1055
01:01:57,126 --> 01:01:59,157
B1! Equus! Equus!

1056
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,656
You fucker! Stop right there!

1057
01:02:09,614 --> 01:02:10,650
Stop...

1058
01:02:17,478 --> 01:02:18,816
Are you all right?

1059
01:02:18,817 --> 01:02:20,156
Did you get the plate number?

1060
01:02:20,181 --> 01:02:21,217
Yes...

1061
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:26,810
Is the camera on?

1062
01:02:27,113 --> 01:02:28,625
Do you see this?

1063
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:32,341
His-head comes off tomorrow.

1064
01:02:33,076 --> 01:02:34,025
Here.

1065
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:35,322
Okay.

1066
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:40,205
Have $2 M ready by tomorrow.

1067
01:02:40,508 --> 01:02:41,976
Keep your phone on.

1068
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:49,236
When did you receive this?

1069
01:02:51,353 --> 01:02:53,426
Last night by a courier.

1070
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:00,426
- Rewind it a bit. 
- Okay.

1071
01:03:02,631 --> 01:03:03,451
- They're brothers?
- Yes.

1072
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:07,772
Contract killing, armed robbery...

1073
01:03:07,773 --> 01:03:11,920
These guys can't be recycled.

1074
01:03:12,698 --> 01:03:15,939
They fled tothe Philippines
with warran,ts for their arrest

1075
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,574
nd they were on Interpol's radar
over a Korean murder case.

1076
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,259
I checked their records,

1077
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:23,716
and their stay in the Philippines
overlaps with Kang's by 6months.

1078
01:03:26,439 --> 01:03:28,944
Was there one near
where the car was found?

1079
01:03:31,235 --> 01:03:33,351
We're not getting any support,

1080
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:37,370
so go toll san and look around
with patrols over there.

1081
01:03:37,371 --> 01:03:38,882
Understood.

1082
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,481
Are we okay on our own?

1083
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:49,900
If things go sour, 
we'll be on the hook.

1084
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,278
There's no time.

1085
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:58,024
He and Yong-gi may not 
be clean, but they're my family.

1086
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:00,963
Please do whatever it takes
to arrest him.

1087
01:04:04,723 --> 01:04:06,407
What can l do to help?

1088
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:09,604
So the thing is..

1089
01:04:10,297 --> 01:04:12,327
We can't transfer the ransom.

1090
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:14,876
Once he sends it overseas
it’s untraceable.

1091
01:04:15,093 --> 01:04:17,166
and we can't ensure
your husband's safety.

1092
01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:20,277
So we have to
make the trade in person,

1093
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:22,567
we need you to lure him.

1094
01:04:22,741 --> 01:04:25,117
Don't get worked up
while on the phone.

1095
01:04:25,118 --> 01:04:27,406
We'll guide you along the way...

1096
01:04:28,229 --> 01:04:29,739
I'm sorry to make you do this.

1097
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,171
No need to be sorry,
there's no other way.

1098
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:37,906
We got the call,
it's him!

1099
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:38,252
Get ready!

1100
01:04:39,636 --> 01:04:41,407
- Quiet down,quiet!
- One moment.

1101
01:04:42,228 --> 01:04:43,654
One,two,

1102
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:44,560
three.

1103
01:04:44,692 --> 01:04:45,555
Please answer.

1104
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:51,517
Hello?

1105
01:04:51,778 --> 01:04:53,419
This is Kang Hae-sang.

1106
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:57,567
This will go smoothly
if you follow my orders.

1107
01:04:58,302 --> 01:04:59,381
Is the money ready?

1108
01:05:00,116 --> 01:05:02,492
I'll send you my account info.

1109
01:05:02,753 --> 01:05:04,004
- Are you an idiot?
- What?

1110
01:05:04,481 --> 01:05:05,128
Why should l pay you $2M?

1111
01:05:06,857 --> 01:05:07,720
Hold on.

1112
01:05:08,412 --> 01:05:09,233
Give her a minute.

1113
01:05:09,234 --> 01:05:10,270
You bastard.

1114
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:13,164
You killed my son even after
receiving the ransom.

1115
01:05:13,987 --> 01:05:16,535
There's no guarantee
you'll let my husband go,

1116
01:05:17,054 --> 01:05:18,825
so why should I
send you money?

1117
01:05:18,913 --> 01:05:20,078
So you won't even try?

1118
01:05:20,856 --> 01:05:22,584
If not, your husband will die for sure.

1119
01:05:22,974 --> 01:05:24,400
I'd thank you for it.

1120
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:26,689
What?

1121
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:30,189
Buddy, you killed my son.

1122
01:05:30,363 --> 01:05:33,387
If you kill my husband too,
who'll end up with his money?

1123
01:05:34,122 --> 01:05:36,152
You'll flee the country, no?

1124
01:05:36,672 --> 01:05:37,664
Am l right?

1125
01:05:38,443 --> 01:05:40,905
I'll give you $2 M in cash.

1126
01:05:42,116 --> 01:05:43,800
Trade with him in person.

1127
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:45,917
I'll hand it over
when l see him alive.

1128
01:05:46,264 --> 01:05:48,207
You're a great negotiator.

1129
01:05:49,763 --> 01:05:50,281
Okay.

1130
01:05:51,924 --> 01:05:54,732
Bring $2 M in a suitcase tomorrow.

1131
01:05:55,511 --> 01:05:59,700
If I find a tracker,
or if you mess with me,

1132
01:05:59,701 --> 01:06:01,083
I'll kill your husband
and come after you.

1133
01:06:01,084 --> 01:06:02,466
1 DRIVER

1134
01:06:02,899 --> 01:06:04,238
Understand?

1135
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:08,083
Come to Ilsan Central Intersection
by 1 PM tomorrow alone.

1136
01:06:08,948 --> 01:06:09,897
Did you get that?

1137
01:06:10,547 --> 01:06:13,786
I can't drive,
I'll need a driver.

1138
01:06:14,134 --> 01:06:15,082
Jesus Christ...

1139
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:16,163
No good?

1140
01:06:16,899 --> 01:06:17,805
No deal?

1141
01:06:18,282 --> 01:06:19,750
Just one driver?

1142
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:20,960
Okay

1143
01:06:21,652 --> 01:06:23,681
Let’s do this right
and keep your hus..

1144
01:06:29,084 --> 01:06:30,898
Bad manner runs in the family.

1145
01:06:35,392 --> 01:06:36,385
Could I get some water?

1146
01:06:36,386 --> 01:06:37,552
- Water!
- Yes, sir.

1147
01:06:39,669 --> 01:06:41,051
You did great.

1148
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:46,971
Here, have some water.

1149
01:07:00,108 --> 01:07:02,267
That lady is no joke.

1150
01:07:02,873 --> 01:07:04,902
I really want to get this bastard.

1151
01:07:05,638 --> 01:07:08,705
So who should we use
as the driver?

1152
01:07:09,268 --> 01:07:11,297
We can't use one of ours
he'll clue in.

1153
01:07:11,299 --> 01:07:12,420
Then who?

1154
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,397
If we use a pushover, 
this will go sour very fast.

1155
01:07:23,354 --> 01:07:25,167
Fake marriage isn't a bad thing.

1156
01:07:25,385 --> 01:07:28,019
All new lives start out that way.

1157
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:31,520
Just hang in there for 3 months.

1158
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:36,705
Did you bring the money?

1159
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:42,796
What is man's face?

1160
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,525
What he look?

1161
01:07:45,606 --> 01:07:47,463
He'll be here in a few.

1162
01:07:51,612 --> 01:07:52,605
You punk!

1163
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:55,111
Ignoring my calls?
I'll fucking kill you!

1164
01:07:55,328 --> 01:07:57,531
You just made me
drive across town.

1165
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:59,432
What's going on here?

1166
01:07:59,433 --> 01:08:02,327
I'm barely making ends meet here.

1167
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,746
What’s this?
Marital status form?

1168
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,044
You asshole!

1169
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:06,994
Excuse me.

1170
01:08:06,995 --> 01:08:09,197
This guy is a con man,
please go home.

1171
01:08:09,198 --> 01:08:11,271
Don't give him money, 
go home.

1172
01:08:11,489 --> 01:08:13,389
Please go, go home.

1173
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,290
He's an illegal alien.

1174
01:08:16,415 --> 01:08:17,666
You're coming with me.

1175
01:08:17,884 --> 01:08:20,389
I need you to dive let’s get going.

1176
01:08:22,247 --> 01:08:24,364
Hey Jang! How have you been?

1177
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,258
Hey : One-eye
get me a boat.

1178
01:08:27,259 --> 01:08:28,123
For which day?

1179
01:08:28,642 --> 01:08:29,808
Tomorrow

1180
01:08:29,809 --> 01:08:32,011
Tomorrow? So suddenly?

1181
01:08:33,222 --> 01:08:35,468
That's gonna be tough.

1182
01:08:35,858 --> 01:08:38,277
Unless l get some extra.

1183
01:08:38,969 --> 01:08:40,048
I'll pay double

1184
01:08:41,172 --> 01:08:42,079
Time and how many?

1185
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,376
1 AM, 3 people.

1186
01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:45,924
1 AM. 3 people, okay.

1187
01:08:46,357 --> 01:08:47,393
Okay.

1188
01:08:50,203 --> 01:08:51,239
You vouch for him?

1189
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,881
All routes to China are blocked,

1190
01:08:52,882 --> 01:08:53,227
this fucker is the on iy quiet way in.

1191
01:08:53,228 --> 01:08:55,689
SKIPPER KIM GYO-BUM

1192
01:08:56,296 --> 01:08:57,677
We're right here.

1193
01:08:57,938 --> 01:08:58,671
Go North.

1194
01:08:59,191 --> 01:09:01,005
Drive around lsan,

1195
01:09:01,351 --> 01:09:03,424
when I give you a signal
lead her down.

1196
01:09:03,944 --> 01:09:06,795
We lose that bitch here,
get the money and ship out.

1197
01:09:06,796 --> 01:09:07,832
Why just the two of us?

1198
01:09:08,092 --> 01:09:09,128
You fuck...

1199
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:11,288
Don't try to be smart.

1200
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:14,184
Are you trying to take
the money for yourself?

1201
01:09:14,185 --> 01:09:14,918
Right?

1202
01:09:17,684 --> 01:09:21,356
You will be following the money,
you got some trust issues?

1203
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:25,115
You trust us?

1204
01:09:26,066 --> 01:09:27,102
Do you?

1205
01:09:28,573 --> 01:09:30,386
Were getting Kang today.

1206
01:09:30,906 --> 01:09:33,929
He knows captain and my faces,
so you guys tail him.

1207
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:34,578
Get off here and check the vicinity.

1208
01:09:36,436 --> 01:09:39,331
Yes, sir.

1209
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,485
Jang is heading out.

1210
01:09:44,992 --> 01:09:47,497
This is fucked up..

1211
01:09:59,986 --> 01:10:01,281
Hup in.

1212
01:10:01,282 --> 01:10:03,787
Put the money in the back,
where I can see it.

1213
01:10:20,639 --> 01:10:21,157
The lady's leaving now
with a driver.

1214
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:22,583
No cops around?

1215
01:10:23,232 --> 01:10:24,311
None!

1216
01:10:25,004 --> 01:10:27,465
Move as we planned when they
enter the Central Intersection.

1217
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:30,058
Just follow my orders,okay?

1218
01:10:31,182 --> 01:10:35,286
He's ordering us around
in the comfort of the hideout

1219
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,316
He think he's the boss.

1220
01:10:37,879 --> 01:10:39,088
Stay on them.

1221
01:10:54,601 --> 01:10:56,415
- Detective 
- What? Yes?

1222
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:59,828
Thank you for helping me.

1223
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:02,592
Uh,yeah...

1224
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:06,439
Dun worry.

1225
01:11:11,926 --> 01:11:12,531
Eyeballs on the Mercedes.

1226
01:11:13,655 --> 01:11:14,735
Okay.

1227
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:16,506
Everyone, standby.

1228
01:11:16,551 --> 01:11:18,321
Hong-seok, scan the other cars.

1229
01:11:18,581 --> 01:11:20,179
Sang-hoon, take over

1230
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,258
Copy

1231
01:11:21,389 --> 01:11:23,938
Central unit check your surroundings.

1232
01:11:26,186 --> 01:11:27,395
I'm on them.

1233
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,678
What the hell?

1234
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:40,099
Stay right on their ass.

1235
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,580
Boss, we found the derelict factory area.

1236
01:11:47,142 --> 01:11:50,037
The search area is huge,
it will take some time.

1237
01:11:50,297 --> 01:11:52,499
Find Choi as quickly as possible!

1238
01:11:52,673 --> 01:11:53,839
Copy,boss!

1239
01:12:05,981 --> 01:12:07,234
I found the Jang brothers.

1240
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:10,085
White Avante , 38M1775.

1241
01:12:10,086 --> 01:12:11,382
Is Kang with them?

1242
01:12:11,598 --> 01:12:13,024
No.it's just two of them.

1243
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:16,740
Damn, where the hell is he?

1244
01:12:19,505 --> 01:12:22,918
200m to Central Intersection,
we're almost there.

1245
01:12:23,395 --> 01:12:24,646
We're close.

1246
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:28,319
Dun worry,tis my specialty.

1247
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:35,104
Stay calm.just stay calm.

1248
01:12:37,006 --> 01:12:38,215
Hello?

1249
01:12:38,216 --> 01:12:40,072
You arrived right on time.

1250
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:41,195
Where are you?

1251
01:12:41,931 --> 01:12:43,010
Make a U-turn.

1252
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,220
What?

1253
01:12:44,567 --> 01:12:46,380
I think that-mail truck
is following us

1254
01:12:46,857 --> 01:12:47,893
Let's begin.

1255
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:48,714
Slow down.

1256
01:12:53,986 --> 01:12:54,936
Shit,what the hell?

1257
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:56,189
What do we do?

1258
01:12:57,529 --> 01:12:58,392
Hold on tight.

1259
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:02,540
He's making a U-turn!

1260
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:03,318
Should l stay on him?

1261
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:04,917
No, no, just drive straight!

1262
01:13:08,807 --> 01:13:10,621
Why is he making a U-turn?

1263
01:13:10,622 --> 01:13:11,614
Sang-hoon,just drive! Go!

1264
01:13:11,702 --> 01:13:12,997
Drive away! Go!

1265
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:16,584
Stay close to her.

1266
01:13:16,844 --> 01:13:19,046
This fucker'ssmoking us out,
I'll get on his tail!

1267
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:21,206
Let's move

1268
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,411
These bastards are
trying to be smart

1269
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:25,744
Hong-seok,standby
at the intersection.

1270
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:29,071
Captain, Sang-hoon,
back him up.

1271
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:29,936
Copy,boss.

1272
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:30,842
We're on the way!

1273
01:13:41,344 --> 01:13:44,367
How am l supposed to search all of these?

1274
01:13:45,275 --> 01:13:45,923
Have you arrived?

1275
01:13:47,176 --> 01:13:48,688
How many U-turns am l doing?

1276
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:50,113
Do another one.

1277
01:13:50,114 --> 01:13:51,540
Are you kidding me?

1278
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,397
You don't want to get paid?

1279
01:13:53,874 --> 01:13:56,465
Shut your hole and do what l say.

1280
01:14:07,225 --> 01:14:08,952
Fuck! Turn it around!

1281
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:10,853
Fucking hell..

1282
01:14:15,348 --> 01:14:16,341
Seok-do, we'll drive straight.

1283
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:18,847
Sang-hoon, you're up.

1284
01:14:24,638 --> 01:14:26,193
Boss, it’s bad to delay
any more time.

1285
01:14:26,194 --> 01:14:28,180
Were making fourth U-turn already.

1286
01:14:28,786 --> 01:14:29,261
They'll find us out soon.

1287
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:32,459
Seok-do, let's grab
the brothers first.

1288
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,137
Well take them by surprise,
and cut off their communication,

1289
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:37,168
and find Choi in the meantime.

1290
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:39,933
No, we need to secure Choi first.

1291
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,402
Choi is a priority too,

1292
01:14:41,403 --> 01:14:42,915
what if we lose these pricks too?

1293
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:44,513
No,hostage comes first!

1294
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:45,723
I don't believe this.

1295
01:14:48,879 --> 01:14:50,174
Damn..

1296
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,760
Holy shit!

1297
01:15:09,059 --> 01:15:09,576
Boss!

1298
01:15:10,096 --> 01:15:11,996

Choi was kidnapped in.

1299
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:13,767
Yeah? What about Choi?

1300
01:15:13,768 --> 01:15:15,971
don't see him,
but I'll check the building.

1301
01:15:15,972 --> 01:15:17,181
Call as soon as you find him!

1302
01:15:17,182 --> 01:15:18,304

1303
01:15:18,737 --> 01:15:20,507
Cap. Dong-gyun found the Equus!

1304
01:15:20,508 --> 01:15:23,230
He did? Okay got it
I'll go back him up!

1305
01:15:29,755 --> 01:15:33,081
I'm feeling it now.

1306
01:15:36,236 --> 01:15:37,575
This is it.

1307
01:15:39,218 --> 01:15:43,279
Mr. Choi where could you be?

1308
01:15:46,823 --> 01:15:47,901
Shit!

1309
01:15:49,156 --> 01:15:50,538
Mr. Choi!

1310
01:15:51,835 --> 01:15:53,778
Are you all right?

1311
01:15:56,328 --> 01:15:57,624
Can you get up?

1312
01:16:00,217 --> 01:16:01,858
We have to get out,
up you go!

1313
01:16:03,328 --> 01:16:04,667
You okay?

1314
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:07,173
Almost there, we're almost there.

1315
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:09,204
Stupid fucks..

1316
01:16:18,063 --> 01:16:20,438

Suspect found!

1320
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,363
Suspect found, requesting back up!

1321
01:16:32,364 --> 01:16:33,790
Requesting back up!

1322
01:16:34,655 --> 01:16:36,598

Where are you going,bastard?
Get back here!

1324
01:17:03,907 --> 01:17:05,677
Isn't that Choi Choon-baek?

1325
01:17:09,438 --> 01:17:12,764
Arrest the brothers! We found Choi!

1326
01:17:12,937 --> 01:17:13,887
You found him?!

1327
01:17:13,888 --> 01:17:15,443
Yeah! We got him!

1328
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:17,819
Good, we'll initiate the op!

1329
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,763
Why didn't you answer my call..

1330
01:17:22,746 --> 01:17:23,264
What’s wrong?

1331
01:17:24,604 --> 01:17:25,511
Dong-gyun!

1332
01:17:26,073 --> 01:17:28,708
What's wrong with you?

1333
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:30,738
Captain... I'm sorry..

1334
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:32,078
Shit!

1335
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:33,893
I let Kang slip through.

1336
01:17:34,974 --> 01:17:35,708
What happened?

1337
01:17:35,709 --> 01:17:37,436
Call the paramedics!
Stay awake!

1338
01:17:37,437 --> 01:17:38,689
What's going on?!

1339
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:41,195
Dong-gyun got stabbed.

1340
01:17:41,499 --> 01:17:42,405
What?!

1341
01:17:42,406 --> 01:17:44,392
Kang stabbed him and fled!

1342
01:17:48,153 --> 01:17:49,448

1343
01:17:55,715 --> 01:17:56,880
Where are you?

1344
01:17:56,925 --> 01:17:59,257
How many times do l have to tell you?

1345
01:17:59,603 --> 01:18:02,411
Central lntersection 
near LC Department Store.

1346
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:04,442
Pull out for now,
cops are on to us.

1347
01:18:04,831 --> 01:18:06,818
What are you saying? Cops?

1348
01:18:07,424 --> 01:18:07,768
Where?

1349
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:09,454
I don't see any here.

1350
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:10,491
Forget it

1351
01:18:10,492 --> 01:18:11,830
Return to the motel

1352
01:18:11,831 --> 01:18:14,380
Let’s regroup there,
 make sure to ditch the car.

1353
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,268
Don't order around, asshole,

1354
01:18:18,269 --> 01:18:19,651
Jang Ki-chul.

1355
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,416
Your mouth could get you killed.

1356
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:26,305

1361
01:18:44,108 --> 01:18:46,872
Kang fled after stabbing Dong-gyun,
and if we lose those guys,

1362
01:18:46,873 --> 01:18:47,996

He's safe, so don't worry.

1371
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:12,452

1380
01:19:33,409 --> 01:19:34,574
Can you tell?

1381
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:40,235
On my cue, block him
at the next intersection

1382
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,346
What if they're really cops?

1383
01:19:43,477 --> 01:19:45,075
Shit,who cares.

1384
01:19:45,335 --> 01:19:46,544

01:24:55,227 --> 01:24:56,392
Get out of here!

1449
01:24:57,172 --> 01:24:59,029
- Are you okay?
- This way!

1450
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:19,380
Wanna go back down?

1451
01:25:32,905 --> 01:25:34,373
- One moment!
- Police!

1452
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,842
Out of the way!

1453
01:25:41,201 --> 01:25:42,151
Take that thing away!

1454
01:25:45,869 --> 01:25:46,990
Let’s cleanup.

1455
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:54,941
Nice!

1456
01:25:56,757 --> 01:25:57,707
Very nice!

1457
01:26:08,855 --> 01:26:10,021
Shit..

1458
01:26:12,182 --> 01:26:13,391
Who the fuck?

1459
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:25,533
Come on!

1460
01:26:37,028 --> 01:26:38,064
Step on it,go!

1461
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:46,058
Excuse me! Sir!

1462
01:26:47,615 --> 01:26:48,694
Pardon me..

1463
01:26:56,299 --> 01:26:59,021
Show's over fucking go home!

1464
01:27:18,638 --> 01:27:21,100
This is how a new life starts!

1465
01:27:27,064 --> 01:27:27,970
Boss!

1466
01:27:28,836 --> 01:27:30,649
Jang lsu managed to shake off Kang.

1467
01:27:30,867 --> 01:27:33,760
But Kang stabbed patrols
and is on the run

1468
01:27:34,366 --> 01:27:35,748
Motherfu...

1469
01:27:36,786 --> 01:27:38,125
Send out national APB on Kang.

1470
01:27:38,126 --> 01:27:38,773
Okay

1471
01:27:38,946 --> 01:27:39,767
How's Dong-gyun?

1472
01:27:39,768 --> 01:27:41,495
Captain took him to the hospital.

1473
01:27:42,317 --> 01:27:44,260
Boss, I can't reach Jang Isu.

1474
01:27:44,261 --> 01:27:47,155
He's not answering his cell phone,
I think he took off with the money

1475
01:27:48,452 --> 01:27:51,562
Two suspects involved in
a kidnapping case were arrested.

1476
01:27:51,822 --> 01:27:54,976
The police released an APB
for a suspect who fled

1477
01:27:54,977 --> 01:27:56,834
after stabbing patrol officers.

1478
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:02,191
They've also issued a warrant
for Korean-Chinese Jang lsu,

1479
01:28:02,192 --> 01:28:03,099
who fled with $2 M ransom.

1480
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:07,809
They believe that Jang will
smuggle out to China,

1481
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:09,840
and are canvasing the west sea.

1482
01:28:17,315 --> 01:28:18,265
Fuck..

1483
01:28:22,415 --> 01:28:22,975
Hello?

1484
01:28:23,193 --> 01:28:24,141
One-eye.

1485
01:28:24,403 --> 01:28:25,568
What’s up?

1486
01:28:25,569 --> 01:28:27,037
I need a boat to China.

1487
01:28:27,383 --> 01:28:28,419
Boat to China?

1488
01:28:29,415 --> 01:28:31,444
There aren't any at this time.

1489
01:28:31,445 --> 01:28:33,475
Come on man, do me a favor!

1490
01:28:33,692 --> 01:28:38,703
I'm not Uber, I can't have
a boat on standby for you.

1491
01:28:39,266 --> 01:28:40,950
- Come on!
-I got none

1492
01:28:41,297 --> 01:28:42,419
I'll pay quadruple.

1493
01:28:42,809 --> 01:28:44,623
There is a boat at quadruple.

1494
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:47,604
But no vacant seat.

1495
01:28:47,821 --> 01:28:51,536
Then I'll pay double of that quadruple, you fuck!

1496
01:28:52,488 --> 01:28:53,221
Where are you?

1497
01:28:53,525 --> 01:28:55,771
I'll send my boy to pick you up.

1498
01:28:56,636 --> 01:28:58,018
Behind the coastal parking lot.

1499
01:28:58,019 --> 01:28:59,228
Okay!

1500
01:29:18,111 --> 01:29:19,232
Are you Jang lsu?

1501
01:29:22,086 --> 01:29:23,683
Did you bring the money?

1502
01:29:24,506 --> 01:29:25,974
Here,open it.

1503
01:29:26,234 --> 01:29:27,399
All there.

1504
01:29:27,832 --> 01:29:29,431
Go to Haejong Port.

1505
01:29:29,993 --> 01:29:30,986
Hey!

1506
01:29:40,579 --> 01:29:41,399
Who are you?

1507
01:29:44,727 --> 01:29:46,065
You missed the news?

1508
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:52,590
Ma Seok-do, that fucker..

1509
01:30:00,757 --> 01:30:02,571
You fucking cocksucker!

1510
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,237
Who do you think I am?

1511
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:13,633
Who the hell are you?

1512
01:30:17,523 --> 01:30:21,065
I'm Jang Chen of Harbin you twat!

1513
01:30:22,795 --> 01:30:24,824

Show me what you got, fucker!

1515
01:30:27,417 --> 01:30:28,280

01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,818
Wait,hold on!

No, asshole, get over here!

Round 2?

1522
01:30:53,774 --> 01:30:56,452
No, stay there, stay there.

1523
01:32:37,821 --> 01:32:39,506
This is the police!

1524
01:32:39,852 --> 01:32:43,654
I'm involved in an active case,
may l ask you to get off the bus?

1525
01:32:43,828 --> 01:32:45,338
Please get off for a moment.

1526
01:32:47,154 --> 01:32:48,061
What did you say?

1527
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:51,648
Maam.could you get off the bus
for a moment please?

1528
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:54,629
Here, give this to your grandson

1529
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:56,574
- Thank you
- Take care,be careful.

1530
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:05,561
You're making me sweat
you wanker.

1531
01:33:05,908 --> 01:33:08,153
How did you think about
chasing a bus?

1532
01:33:08,888 --> 01:33:10,055
You're smarter than you look.

1533
01:33:10,444 --> 01:33:11,524
Better than most.

1534
01:33:14,678 --> 01:33:17,270
Why are you on my ass
like a dog in heat?

1535
01:33:18,998 --> 01:33:20,294
Do you need money?

1536
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,053
Do you want a cut?

1537
01:33:29,455 --> 01:33:30,794
Split 50-50?

1538
01:33:32,782 --> 01:33:33,905
Who's 50?

1539
01:33:37,794 --> 01:33:39,737
You're a lost cause.

1540
01:33:40,128 --> 01:33:41,293
Shit!

1541
01:33:42,417 --> 01:33:44,275
You need a good ass whooping.

1542
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:46,435
If you think you're about to die,

1543
01:33:48,942 --> 01:33:53,089

1544

Hey.

01:34:54,922 --> 01:34:56,347
We're far from done,
get the hell up.

1547
01:36:20,777 --> 01:36:22,462
I'm going to kill you.

1548
01:36:24,493 --> 01:36:25,616
Your family as well..

1549
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:41,560
Oh man.what a mess.

1550
01:36:43,074 --> 01:36:44,412
Sorry about that.

1551
01:36:47,827 --> 01:36:49,510
Let's move!

1552
01:36:50,506 --> 01:36:51,715
You all right?

1553
01:36:52,061 --> 01:36:53,097
Where's Kang?

1554
01:36:53,487 --> 01:36:54,653
He's over there

1555
01:36:54,956 --> 01:36:56,813
Money! Money!
Inside.

1556
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,023

- Wrap it up quickly!
- Yes,sir!

1558
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:01,048
What happened to the bus?

1559
01:37:02,345 --> 01:37:03,251
Not sure...

1560
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:05,584
Anyway, you did good!

1561
01:37:05,585 --> 01:37:06,924
Secure the money!

1562
01:37:07,184 --> 01:37:08,393
What the hell?

1563
01:37:09,214 --> 01:37:10,381
Look at this guy!

1564
01:37:10,856 --> 01:37:14,788
I told him to catch the perp,
not tenderize him!

1565
01:37:15,091 --> 01:37:17,035
Ma Seok-do, you punk!

1566
01:37:29,912 --> 01:37:31,207
Son of a bitch..

1567
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:32,935
Hello?

1568
01:37:32,936 --> 01:37:33,584
Buddy!

1569
01:37:34,017 --> 01:37:35,226
We got Kang.

1570
01:37:36,177 --> 01:37:37,733
You did good,punk.

1571
01:37:38,468 --> 01:37:43,306
You got a warrant out for me,
and tell me l did good?

1572
01:37:52,813 --> 01:37:56,053
We got serial numbers for that cash,
once you use it, it'll be tracked.

1573
01:37:56,054 --> 01:37:57,350
I knew it,fuck...

1574
01:38:01,844 --> 01:38:03,441
Son of a bitch!

1575
01:38:05,689 --> 01:38:06,164
Hello?

1576
01:38:06,165 --> 01:38:08,065
Are you taking off with that money?

1577
01:38:08,066 --> 01:38:08,972
What did you say?

1578
01:38:08,974 --> 01:38:10,744
I almost died trying to
get Kang off my back!

1579
01:38:10,745 --> 01:38:13,294
Actually,stowaway out of the country.

1580
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:14,936

1581
01:38:14,937 --> 01:38:19,084
Call One-eye.and reserve
a boat to China tonight, got it?

1582
01:38:25,221 --> 01:38:26,257
Stowaway?

1583
01:38:26,559 --> 01:38:29,022
Be honest asshole you were 
gonna take off with it, right?

1584
01:38:29,584 --> 01:38:33,861
Hello? Hello?

1585
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:36,281
Signal here is bad..

1586
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:39,824
Hello? Jang Isu!

1587
01:38:41,769 --> 01:38:43,194
Stupid bastard...

1588
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:00,347
Kang, who murdered 13 people,
has been arrested.

1589
01:39:00,348 --> 01:39:04,107
Kang targeted and murdered
Korean tourists in Southeast Asia,

1590
01:39:04,108 --> 01:39:08,169
and was caught-while trying to flee
after a kidnapping case.

1591
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:12,489
Choi, Who sought revenge for
the murder of his son,

1592
01:39:12,490 --> 01:39:16,249
hired mecenaries to kill Kang,
and will be tried.

1593
01:39:16,273 --> 01:39:18,345
The police are looking into
sending officers to regions

1594
01:39:20,441 --> 01:39:25,711
where crimes against
Korean nationals are rampant.

1595
01:39:26,404 --> 01:39:28,813
Captain, my car's side mirror
is all busted, do I get anything?

1596
01:39:28,823 --> 01:39:29,514
Mine too!

1597
01:39:29,515 --> 01:39:32,278
Who cares about your car,
I got stabbed big time.

1598
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:35,562
You got stabbed-with a knife
this big, you crybaby.

1599
01:39:35,822 --> 01:39:38,068
That machete l was stabbed with,

1600
01:39:38,717 --> 01:39:40,315
it was about this long.

1601
01:39:40,316 --> 01:39:44,463
Mine went through my body,
I thought l was a goner.

1602
01:39:44,464 --> 01:39:45,630
- lt went through?
- Yeah!

1603
01:39:45,631 --> 01:39:47,314
My head almost came off!

1604
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:49,346
Dude, stop exaggerating!

1605
01:39:49,347 --> 01:39:49,951
I'm not!

1606
01:39:49,952 --> 01:39:52,413
After all that work,
they get cartilages?

1607
01:39:52,414 --> 01:39:54,876
They deserve real beef!

1608
01:39:54,877 --> 01:39:56,129
All right all.right

1609
01:39:56,131 --> 01:39:57,252
Cheap ass...

1610
01:39:57,253 --> 01:39:59,326
For this occasion,
I brought something big.

1611
01:39:59,328 --> 01:40:00,234

1612
01:40:00,235 --> 01:40:03,086

1613
01:40:03,087 --> 01:40:03,907

1615
01:40:07,062 --> 01:40:07,666
No going back!

1616
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:09,179
It usually has a seal

1617
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:09,957
I have no idea.

1618
01:40:09,958 --> 01:40:10,950
Thank you, salute!

1619
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:15,055
This is not new!
lt was opened already!

1620
01:40:15,056 --> 01:40:15,876
You could tell?

1621
01:40:15,877 --> 01:40:17,604
Come on, don't drink that!

1622
01:40:17,605 --> 01:40:18,122
Don't drink it?

1623
01:40:18,123 --> 01:40:20,067
If you're offended,
don't drink it then.

1624
01:40:20,328 --> 01:40:21,666
Yeah don't drink it...

1625
01:40:21,926 --> 01:40:25,598
So l brought a 30-year old
ginseng liquor!

1626
01:40:27,456 --> 01:40:28,795
