00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,443
I truly am sorry.

359
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,378
There's no need to worry about that.

360
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:56,562
Dream has filled us in.

361
00:28:57,722 --> 00:29:02,576
You've been pouring your heart into your work.

362
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:06,368
It's okay. You were busy.

363
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,323
It's perfectly fine, sweetheart.

364
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:12,890
Seeing you now brings me joy.

365
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:17,030
Try to visit me a bit more often, will you?

366
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,503
I'm happy to see you.

367
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,600
Thank you very much.

368
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,900
How did you come here?

369
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,200
Your mother told me that you were here.

370
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,500
My car has a flat tire.

371
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,200
So I hitchhiked.

372
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,300
And…

373
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,330
Um...

374
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,900
I want to ask you to develop Miracle World.

375
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
I'm not interested.

376
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,000
Or do you prefer stock options?

377
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,500
I can talk to Alice.

378
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,200
It's not that.

379
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,700
So what's the matter?

380
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,800
I just want to forget you.

381
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,400
Do you know why I came this far?

382
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,800
I want to find a foothold

383
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,500
and clear my mind.

384
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,900
I don't want to think.

385
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,400
I want to leave everything behind.

386
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,300
But you still followed me here and asked me to work with you.

387
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Why is it so easy for you?

388
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,100
I'm sorry,

389
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,800
but it's not easy for me either.

390
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,500
And I don't want to do this.

391
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,400
Dream, don't confuse me.

392
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,200
Hey, I won't give up.

393
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Until you say yes or turn me down with more reasonable excuses.

394
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,500
You asked me to work with you but you stole my food.

395
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,100
I was hungry.

396
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,300
Do you want to eat, too?

397
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,900
Why do you want to create the Miracle World?

398
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,800
Do you still remember the Demo Day?

399
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,200
We created True Angel.

400
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,900
I just thought it would be nice

401
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,600
if our world had angels everywhere we go.

402
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:05,600
The angels can connect older and younger generations,

403
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,000
bonding them to live together in harmony...

404
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,700
as your father said.

405
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,200
Our world changes every day,

406
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,400
everyone has to adjust.

407
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,800
But how we can all of us live in harmony?

408
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,200
Please come back and work with us.

409
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,400
Let's make the Miracle World come true. Will you?

410
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,800
I want to do it.

411
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,800
But I feel uncomfortable...

412
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,300
if I work with you.

413
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,200
I still like you.

414
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,600
And how can I move on,

415
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,000
if we still work together?

416
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,000
Let me think about it.

417
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,900
Okay.

418
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,000
Wake up. It's morning.

419
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,600
This is it.

420
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,400
He must be spying on me.

421
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
He must be following me.

422
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,300
Miss Yaya, do you work here?

423
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,600
I had no idea.

424
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,300
You saw my post and followed the trail, right?

425
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,400
Well,

426
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,600
you meant to post it for me to follow, didn't you?

427
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,100
On Songkran Day,

428
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,800
you did a live stream to lure me there too, didn't you?

429
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,100
Hey, you saw through that?

430
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,868
But today, I just want to hand in my homework.

431
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:08,400
And there are some words I want to ask you.

432
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,200
What are they?

433
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,900
If I want to be together with someone, how do I say it in English?

434
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,200
For girls, "Will you be my boyfriend?"

435
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,700
Okay.

436
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,400
I want to be your boyfriend.

437
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,200
So lame!

438
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,600
Well,

439
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,800
we don't need to be together.

440
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Yaya,

441
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,400
but do you want to join our company?

442
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,100
So, will Samkorn Thai Tech really come back?

443
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,500
Mr. Ji.

444
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,800
Bank.

445
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,700
May I have some time?

446
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,000
­[Sandbox]

447
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,800
Do you really want my opinion?

448
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,000
Yes.

449
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,500
I want to hear your criticism.

450
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,900
Please give me some advice.

451
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,500
At that time, it was my fault.

452
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,000
You meant well.

453
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But I couldn't accept the truth.

454
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,900
I'm terribly sorry.

455
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,200
I also apologize for my harsh criticism.

456
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,800
It hurts people's feelings.

457
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,500
Yes.

458
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,000
But this time,

459
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,300
I would like some honest advice from you.

460
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,700
Frankly speaking,

461
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,800
I've never met anyone who is as straightforward and blunt as you.

462
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,200
Is that a compliment?

463
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,100
Of course.

464
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,300
Why did the three of you want to launch a start-up?

465
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:22,100
Because you guys are excited and happy writing programs?

466
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,500
Or because you are excited about running a business?

467
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Running a start-up,

468
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,400
you may face many hardships.

469
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,100
But the only thing that keeps you going is confidence,

470
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,800
that you're doing what you love.

471
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,500
Just think about how it all started.

472
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,000
Passion is the key, right?

473
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,800
Your words changed my mindset.

474
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,400
It's called Elevator Speech.

475
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Elevator Speech?

476
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Yes.

477
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,800
It's a pitch that is brief and powerful enough

478
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,600
to change a person's mind within one minute.

479
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,500
Like a short elevator ride.

480
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Changing people's minds

481
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,900
doesn't need to take a very long time.

482
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,300
Just one minute is enough.

483
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,900
About working with you, let me mull it over.

484
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,100
Why?

485
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,840
We can offer you more compensation.

486
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,200
I don't work for the money.

487
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,200
I didn't join Samkorn three years ago because of money.

488
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,600
So what was the reason?

489
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,700
Because of Dream.

490
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,800
Dream begged me so desperately.

491
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,600
She was willing to do anything.

492
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,200
I think if I could work with someone like that,

493
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,600
my life would be colorful.

494
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,700
This sounds very colorful.

495
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,400
Is there someone in your company who is as desperate as Dream?

496
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,900
So... have you decided whether you want to come back and work with me?

497
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,900
Just tell me the terms you want.

498
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,900
I'm willing to pay any rate. Just tell me.

499
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,500
I don't want money.

500
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,900
I haven't spent money from signing the Good Goal contract at all.

501
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,900
So what do you want?

502
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:59,300
Often, what changes a person's mind are not eloquent words

503
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,900
but desperation.

504
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,600
I want to use that money to buy Sunshine's stocks.

505
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,700
If you are okay with it, I will go with your terms.

506
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,300
Really?

507
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,000
Are you serious?

508
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,200
Or maybe it's sympathy for that person.

509
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,200
I thought it would take a while to get you on board.

510
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,300
I just felt too fed up to put up with being bossed around

511
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,600
by an incompetent partner.

512
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,500
Welcome to the Morning AI Team.

513
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,100
Cheers!

514
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,100
If I follow your advice…

515
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:05,100
we'd better off finding a partner rather than starting our own business.

516
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,300
Well, if that's your conclusion, yes.

517
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,200
And what about Sunshine Company?

518
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,700
Would it be a good partner?

519
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,800
I have been offered to be their CTO.

520
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,500
No.

521
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,200
As a man, it's not good.

522
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,800
I don't want Korn and Dream to work together.

523
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,400
But as an investor,

524
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,000
I believe you'll be great partners.

525
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,000
Ultimately,

526
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
nothing can change a person's mind more easily

527
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
than sincerity when you tell the truth.

528
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,200
Thank you.

529
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,900
How long have you been dating Mr. Ji?

530
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,300
I'm not dating him.

531
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,600
Where did you hear that? You misunderstood.

532
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:47,000
You ran away to here because of that?

533
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,300
So, why didn't you ask me?

534
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,100
Who would dare to ask?

535
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,900
I was afraid I would hear something like three years ago.

536
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,700
I'm sorry that I was too harsh to you at that time.

537
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,900
I didn't mean it.

538
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,000
It's okay.

539
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,500
I know that you were harsh to me

540
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,600
because you didn't want me to lose an opportunity in the US,

541
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,000
I know you didn't mean it...

542
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:55,400
as I didn't mean to lie to you about the letters right from the start.

543
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,100
I haven't had a chance to ask you yet.

544
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,300
Why did you decide to come to me that day?

545
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,700
At my sister's birthday party,

546
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,900
Ji said that you'd refused.

547
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,200
Because I really like you.

548
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,200
Actually, I'd met you before.

549
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,100
This is a smart robot called Ai-oon.

550
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,800
Ai-oon is the latest version of our company's operating system.

551
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,100
It will make your life more comfortable.

552
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,800
And the story in the letters was so impressive.

553
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,500
When the rain stopped,

554
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,100
I saw a huge rainbow.

555
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,700
It was so beautiful,

556
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,100
so beautiful that I forgot all my troubles.

557
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:11,300
There was a phrase in a letter that reminded me of my childhood memory.

558
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,800
That day I fought with my father,

559
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,300
he pressured me to do better in my studies.

560
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:28,300
So I ran away, following a child in the rain.

561
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,200
When the rain stopped,

562
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,900
I saw a beautiful rainbow. Just like today.

563
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,700
Did the child you followed...

564
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:13,000
hold the sunflower umbrella with cartoons on it?

565
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,200
Yes.

566
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,300
How do you know?

567
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:36,000
That child was me.

568
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,400
What?

569
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:49,600
I never expected that we would see the rainbow together again.

570
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,300
What a delightful coincidence.

571
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,100
Welcome, Samkorn team.

572
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,600
I promise to be a good CEO and will never let the same incident happen again.

573
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,700
Now, there are only a few days left until the test day.

574
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,800
I'm counting on you.

575
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,900
Samkorn are here and nothing is impossible.

576
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,000
We get to work together again.

577
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,900
What's up?

578
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,200
Why did you call me?

579
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,200
I want to tell you that Dream and I are back on good terms

580
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,000
and we will work together again.

581
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,500
Congratulations.

582
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,100
Is that all you wanted to say?

583
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,000
There is another matter…

584
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,300
you said you had the right because you met her first.

585
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,000
So?

586
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,300
In the letter, Dream wrote about the rainbow.

587
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,200
I was the one standing next to her at that time.

588
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,000
So, now we are equal.

589
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,113
All right, let's make it happen.
[Next Episode]

590
00:54:49,113 --> 00:54:50,646
The Morning AI crew is also in the mix.

591
00:54:50,646 --> 00:54:51,679
We've got to nail this.

592
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:53,025
Let's settle this fairly.

593
00:54:53,025 --> 00:54:54,600
All right, let's see who Dream chooses.

594
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,900
Hey… keep it down, will you?

595
00:54:57,536 --> 00:54:59,100
What's got you up at the crack of dawn?

596
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,000
- I came to pick you up for work.
- I came to pick you up for work.

597
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,800
Spread the word, discredit their name.

598
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,000
Just get it done.

599
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,200
Korn, someone's here to see you.

600
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,320
There he is.

601
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,140
♫ It’s like the stars have been snuffed out ♫

602
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:45,990
♫ It’s not the same, they’re not shining enough for me to see the way ♫

603
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:50,930
♫ The fading sky ends up in darkness ♫

604
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:55,890
♫ There’s no hand for me to hold from someone who was once beside me ♫

605
00:55:55,890 --> 00:56:00,730
♫ I’m going in circles in the same place ♫

606
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,700
♫ Where we used to be before you abandoned me ♫

607
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:10,480
♫ However much I run, whatever I do ♫

608
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,110
♫ I find only exhaustion ♫

609
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,770
♫ When I close my eyes, I still see your image ♫

610
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:25,820
♫ Whichever way I look, I still see you ♫

611
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:32,760
♫ I still don’t know how to endure this, I still don’t know ♫

612
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,960
♫ When will the stars in the sky return and shine again? ♫

613
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:43,030
♫ Shining so I can see the way, shining so I can find you ♫
