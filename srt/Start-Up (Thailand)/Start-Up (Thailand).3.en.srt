I'm looking for Korn.

I don't want Alice to think poorly of me.

- Are you coming to my birthday party?
- No.

I just can't stand being around your dad.

179
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,800
He annoys me, and it only gets worse.

180
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,300
I don't want to talk to him.

181
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,300
Just be careful with your future.

182
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,300
Do you really think your father will let you run his empire?

183
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
What do you mean by that?

184
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Well, I'm tired of real estate. I want to explore new markets.

185
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,500
And I'll have my son handle them.

186
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Anyway, please support him.

187
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
Is it hot in here?

188
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,500
I'll turn on the AC.

189
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,900
What?

190
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry. I haven't driven this car in a while.

191
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,900
Can he make it?

192
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,000
Where do you want to go?

193
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll take you there.

194
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm not sure.

195
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,500
Anywhere to take my mind off things.

196
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,400
Why did you bring me here?

197
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,300
In the letter, you mentioned you love to sit and look at the river when you're stressed.

198
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,400
Do you remember that?

199
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,390
Over here.

200
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,800
Don't you want to know why I suddenly wanted you to come to me?

201
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,700
And why I pretended in front of my sister and mother?

202
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
I'm curious.

203
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,300
But I figure if you wanted to tell me, you eventually would.

204
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,900
I'm going to tell you. You know I've never kept secrets from you…

205
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,000
What are they talking about?

206
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,400
What are you doing? Hurry and take Dream home and end the conversation.

207
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,200
Did your girlfriend send you a message?

208
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,700
You can just leave.

209
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,200
I'll take you home.

210
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,000
It's okay. You can go. I can stay here.

211
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,300
- But you…
- No problem. Thank you very much.

212
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,800
Then, I'll go home.

213
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
See you.

214
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,770
Korn, you are like that book.

215
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,159
I don't need to open and read it.

216
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,183
Just having you by my side makes me happy.

217
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,020
Doing something you've never done does feel good.

218
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:20,620
And sometimes, sailing without a map is really wonderful.

219
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,220
Dream.

220
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,719
What?

221
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,583
That book? Have you opened and read it yet?

222
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:36,939
Yes, I have.

223
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,900
How was it?

224
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:42,362
It's…

225
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,290
incredibly good.

226
00:21:49,178 --> 00:21:53,153
I now understand the phrase "sailing without a map."

227
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:59,804
From now on, no matter where life takes me.

228
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:03,886
Having Dream by my side is enough.

229
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,279
This is my business card.

230
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,660
You can always call me.

231
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,116
Okay.

232
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:27,117
So, don't you have to hurry back?

233
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:30,770
How about your girlfriend?

234
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,696
I don't have a girlfriend.

235
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:35,439
Really?

236
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,310
This is for you.

237
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:50,120
♫ And come away with me ♫

238
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,850
"Follow your dream."

239
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,950
♫ While the world is still sleeping ♫

240
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,780
♫ Wuh-uh-oh, stay close to me ♫

241
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:17,340
♫ Even if we all fall down tonight ♫

242
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:35,386
Right here.

243
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,560
That's enough.

244
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,180
Hey.

245
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,306
Why didn't you hurry back and cut her off?

246
00:23:57,306 --> 00:23:59,300
Why didn't you do as I told you?

247
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:05,196
Well, I want to try sailing without a map.

248
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,939
Are you serious? Sailing without a map?

249
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:10,377
We're going to get ourselves killed!

250
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:13,154
Waves, wind, storms, sharks, the whole package!

251
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:16,400
But the Thai seas aren't crawling with sharks.

252
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,280
Damn…

253
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,919
Even you agree with this in the letter.

254
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,140
That's just a metaphor.

255
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,899
Metaphor?

256
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:31,040
Whatever. From now on, absolutely no contact with Dream. You understand?

257
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,640
Yes.

258
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,619
I'm so glad we could meet. Thanks so much for helping me.

259
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:43,820
If there's anything I can do to show my appreciation, just tell me.

260
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,990
Tell me what you want to eat and have.

261
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:55,219
What if Dream was the one who contacted me?

262
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:57,640
Did Dream text you?

263
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Yes.

264
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,575
What's up? Why are you grinning like that?

265
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:09,850
I'm thrilled. She is the first girl, other than my mom, to text me.

266
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:12,937
I'm happy for you.

267
00:25:13,996 --> 00:25:17,416
So, what did she text?

268
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,759
- Okay.
- Can I reply?

269
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,539
Just go ahead.

270
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:36,537
My favorite food is BBQ.

271
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:42,700
Now I want a 2-terabyte hard drive.

272
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,181
No! You can't send that. Delete it all.

273
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,440
Why? I…

274
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,780
I told you to delete it. Just delete it.

275
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,400
I just answered all her questions.

276
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,759
She wanted to know what I want to eat and what I want now.

277
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,699
If I tell you to delete it, delete it, and type what I tell you. Okay?

278
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
No need to repay me.

279
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:11,896
"No need to repay me" means that Dream doesn't have to return you the favor.

280
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,620
But it doesn't mean you don't have to repay me.

281
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,230
I see.

282
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,659
"No need to repay me."

283
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:27,740
- Simply seeing you is more than enough.
- "Simply seeing you is more than enough."

284
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,883
I'm always happy to help you.

285
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:35,585
"I'm always happy to help you."

286
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:38,050
If there's anything I can help with, just tell me.

287
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:44,936
"If there's anything I can help with, just tell me."

288
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:50,120
- Sweet dreams.
- "Sweet dreams."

289
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,983
XOXO.

290
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:55,944
No "XOXO".

291
00:26:56,543 --> 00:26:58,799
Why not?

292
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,619
No "XOXO." Are you a child?

293
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,350
See.

294
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,630
That's okay.

295
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:10,456
May I send it?

296
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,440
- Or should I end with XOXO?
- No need for XOXO.

297
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,219
Emoji?

298
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,343
Or…

299
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,000
Mr. Jiraphat?

300
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:37,219
No need to repay me. Simply seeing you is more than enough.

301
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:38,616
I'm always happy to help you.

302
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:42,378
If there's anything I can help with, just tell me. Sweet dreams. XOXO.

303
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,019
- Are you home?
- Grandma, look at here!

304
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,599
Grandma, do you know who I met today?

305
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,499
I met Korn and got his number, too.

306
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:05,900
Which Korn?

307
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:11,620
Korn, my first love, do you remember?

308
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,319
But you told me he stood you up.

309
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,820
Finally, he came. And he came at the perfect time.

310
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,559
He looked so handsome like a hero riding on a white horse to me.

311
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:31,440
One more thing. He runs his own company and is really skilled in IT.

312
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:38,559
Grandma, feel it. My heart is still racing.

313
00:28:47,878 --> 00:28:49,839
[Grandma's Pancake Rolls]

314
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,120
So how was your meeting with Korn?

315
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,499
Dream said he looked so good like a runway model.

316
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:00,900
Grandma, any man looks good in a suit.

317
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,583
No man looks good without one.

318
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:04,780
Except me.

319
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,580
I can tell you that he is a total nerd. Extremely emotionless.

320
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,000
When I talked to him, it was like talking to a wall.

321
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He must talk to a robot the whole day. So nerdy.

322
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,622
- Nerd?
- Yes.

323
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,423
Is there anything else for me to carry?

324
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,699
Why is it not like what Dream said?

325
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:29,730
But anyway, I have to thank you for your help.

326
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,390
Dream was very happy yesterday.

327
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,527
I haven't seen her so happy for a long time.

328
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:40,293
It's okay. But I'm more worried after this.

329
00:29:40,293 --> 00:29:43,419
I think Dream will find out the truth.

330
00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:49,979
Now, Dream is having a sweet dream

331
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:53,197
without knowing what the truth is.

332
00:29:53,744 --> 00:29:58,983
It's time to wake up her from that dream.

333
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:02,079
I have to tell her I wrote those letters.

334
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:07,119
If so,

335
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:11,056
Dream will be so disappointed.

336
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:16,822
It's bound to happen, sooner or later.

337
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,405
Better now than later.

338
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,159
Thank you, Good boy, for helping me.

339
00:30:43,256 --> 00:30:44,900
Have you sent the files?

340
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,300
- It's done.
- Okay.

341
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,780
- If this file is on time, just send it.
- Yes.

342
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,581
Even though I am in the US, you must report to me if something happens here.

343
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:56,000
- Do you understand?
- Yes, madam.

344
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:07,207
You said you didn't like to come here.

345
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:09,641
Do you miss Dad?

346
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,750
If it's not necessary, I wouldn't have come.

347
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,179
So, have you contacted your sister?

348
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,559
How is she?

349
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,959
I haven't contacted her. I don't have her number.

350
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:28,060
Why don't you contact her? After all, you are still sisters.

351
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,679
Mom, is this your necessity?

352
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:33,018
I don't have that much time.

353
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:39,574
Will you really go back to the subsidiary company in the US?

354
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,699
Well, Father ordered it. Do I have a choice?

355
00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:45,956
And here?

356
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:49,736
You didn't think about choosing for yourself at all, did you?

357
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:54,200
Can I choose?

358
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,880
You must try talking to your father.

359
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,079
Start to fight. Don't just give in.

360
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,940
Is that all you want to say? I have work to do.

361
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,359
See you.

362
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,039
It's been a while since you've been back, but you haven't had any time at all. You must be very tired.

363
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,580
- I'm not tired, Dad. I can handle this.
- That's not true.

364
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:32,559
I saw you working hard without resting until your face got this haggard.

365
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,219
Thank you for your concern.

366
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,699
I'm a terrible father. Really selfish.

367
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:43,010
I should've cared about my daughter's health.

368
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,836
How about this?

369
00:32:47,836 --> 00:32:49,839
- This company.
- Yes?

370
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:55,620
Why don't you have your brother handle things here?

371
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,459
And you just focus on the US branch.

372
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,639
Are you going to kick me out of the CEO position?

373
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,499
Not exactly.

374
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:16,680
Do you really think your father will let you run his empire?

375
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:25,160
But before you leave, I might need you to train me.

376
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,303
I'm still not that skilled.

377
00:33:27,303 --> 00:33:29,580
Otherwise, I would be managing the US branch.

378
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:37,859
But, Father, would the shareholders and investors approve of this?

379
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:42,980
Suddenly changing the CEO like this could damage the company's credibility.

380
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,099
You don't have to worry about credibility.

381
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:48,063
As for the shares…

382
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:51,699
what's my ownership percentage?

383
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:58,190
It's 72 percent, plus mine's 14 percent. It's exactly 86.

384
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,759
Just Witoon and I make the decisions.

385
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,740
Who else do you need to care about?

386
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,960
Think of this as my gift.

387
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,880
I'm really worried about you. I don't want you to work too hard.

388
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:19,139
You should have a work-life balance.

389
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,619
Yes.

390
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,800
So, what's your plan now?

391
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,380
Now the manager and Jack's FC are putting a lot of pressure on the boss.

00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,199
I'm just a small webpage reporter. No influence, no wealth.

393
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,782
What chance do I have against a famous star?

394
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:48,900
Go to the 32nd floor using the elevator in the High Zone over there.

395
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,420
Thank you very much.

396
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,277
Is it true?

397
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,320
So, what's your next move, Dream?

398
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,969
If you get let go, what's your plan?

404
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:37,159
I've made up my mind. I'd like to take the elevator to the High Zone.

405
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,040
Are you really going to resign?

406
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,639
Yes, I've made up my mind.

407
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:51,679
I have a new goal in life.

408
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,590
I want to take the High-Zone elevator.

00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,719
Yes, Mom.

Are you really leaving?

411
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,740
Are you going to see me off?

412
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,660
I might be gone for a long time.

413
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:16,099
If you're just leaving to live abroad, I'd see you off.

414

But if you're giving up everything you've built, just go.

Today, your father is calling a shareholders' meeting.

416
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,160
Make up your mind.

417
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:51,169
So, if nobody objects, from now on, I will be the CEO in place of Ms. Alice.

418
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:52,979
Please support me.

I thought you were leaving today.

421
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:06,426
I just wanted to come and congratulate my brother first

422
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:10,026
for getting his position by stealing someone else's job.

423
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,239
And I also came to thank my father for teaching me a valuable lesson

424
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,930
that what is easily obtained can easily be taken away.

425
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,800
CEOs like me, who don't have shares, are probably like chewing gum

From today, I am no longer involved with this company.

I quit!

434
00:38:03,678 --> 00:38:10,158
Alice! I told you to reclaim your position, not to quit.

435
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:13,072
- Are you crazy?
- Yes, I'm crazy.

436
00:38:13,072 --> 00:38:16,005
But I don't want anyone to tell me again that I'm successful because my dad is rich.

Most importantly,

438
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,800
I don't want to be anyone's puppet again.

00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,159
What will you get from this?

00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:25,340
I'm relieved, Mom. I'm free now. Maybe you should try it.

00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,819
You made this company grow. Aren't you sorry for leaving it like this?

526
00:44:48,796 --> 00:44:50,783
So, what brings you here?

527
00:44:50,783 --> 00:44:54,776
I wanted to stop by to see Korn for a moment.

528
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,819
Please, feel free.

529
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:05,160
I wanted to bring this to you.

530
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,440
Goldfish are believed to bring good fortune and wealth.

531
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,539
Just find a jar for it.

532
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:19,679
How can a goldfish make a person rich?

533
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,780
(Thank you).

534
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,939
Ah... Thank you.

535
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:41,060
And… I have good news to share.

536
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,760
Good news?

537
00:45:45,419 --> 00:45:50,870
Today, I decided to quit my job.

538
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:05,200
And I'm going to start a company like you did.

539
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:07,639
Like me?

540
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:12,579
I got inspiration from you.

541
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:19,339
I was really hopeless before. I felt like I was no match with my sister.

542
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:23,945
And I keep finding excuses that I'm younger than her.

543
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,460
But when I met you. You're even younger than my sister.

544
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,160
But you own a company.

545
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:39,459
So I decided I wanted to be like you.

546
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,300
Like me?

547
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,780
Yes.

548
00:46:44,646 --> 00:46:48,240
I will also be more successful than my sister.

549
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:55,130
Please support me.

550
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,760
Keep fighting.

551
00:47:20,836 --> 00:47:24,210
Bank, why don't you return the suit?

552
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:28,600
- It's cold.
- You said you didn't want to wear it.

553
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,660
My computer?

554
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,319
Where is it?

555
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:50,969
Korn.

556
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:55,739
Here it is.

557
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,880
What's this for?

558
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,090
It's the compensation as we agreed.

559
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:07,807
How much longer do we have to keep up this act?

560
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:11,960
Just for today, Dream's grandmother decided to tell her the truth.

561
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,680
About the letters and what happened at the party.

562
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:20,519
Then, what did we even come here for today?

563
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:22,118
Good question.

564
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,420
Sorry for wasting your time.

565
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,627
Anyway, thank you so much.

566
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,199
When you're done, don't forget to tidy up.

567
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:34,939
I cannot accept this.

568
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:37,736
Korn.

569
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:44,240
That day, I decided to see Dream myself. Not because you hired me.

570
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,515
And about the lie to Dream, can we hold off on telling her the truth for now?

571
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:55,019
No, today is already a mess.

572
00:48:56,139 --> 00:49:00,933
Seriously, we told her two lies.

573
00:49:00,933 --> 00:49:04,499
First, you wrote the letters 15 years ago and we told her it was me.

574
00:49:04,499 --> 00:49:08,220
Second, we told her I'm a hotshot CEO.

575
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:13,079
As for the first lie, all will be fine if you don't tell and I don't tell.

576
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,339
And how about the second one?

577
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:18,120
As for the second one, if we can get into the Sandbox

578
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,920
and become successful, it becomes true.

579
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:26,570
Get into Sandbox?

580
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,999
Don't even dream about it. It's impossible.

581
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:37,139
Why do you keep saying it's impossible?

582
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:39,663
You haven't even seen our work yet.

583
00:49:39,663 --> 00:49:42,121
Because it's impossible.

584
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:46,820
Even if your technology is good, your business plan can't entice investors.

585
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,480
How do you plan to sustain long-term profitability?

586
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,250
More importantly, you guys have no guarantees for your abilities at all.

587
00:49:55,096 --> 00:49:57,563
Isn't that just a pipe dream?

588
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:04,059
- Bank .
- What?

589
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:05,548
- Look at this.
- What's this?

590
00:50:05,548 --> 00:50:07,860
Is it what I think?

591
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:12,760
Yes! Look at this, Korn.

592
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,139
Korn! Look, we won first place in CODA!

593
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,940
Samkorn Thai Tech won the top prize!

594
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,923
Hooray! We did it!

595
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,063
You did it!

596
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,580
Take a look at this. It's proof of our capabilities.

597
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,159
Now you can stop looking down on us.

598
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,800
CODA!

599
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:49,653
Got the lighting? Here it is. Hold the reflector.

600
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:55,240
Okay. Bank, you might want to put on a hat.

601
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:58,540
- What about the reflector?
- Tilt it up a bit.

602
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,180
- Higher!
- Yeah. A little more!

603
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,039
- This?
- Okay.

604
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,179
Okay then. Wear it well. Turn your hat up a little.

605
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:10,159
Nice. Are you ready?

606
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:12,460
Do we really have to film this?

607
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:14,728
Of course, we do.

608
00:51:14,728 --> 00:51:18,039
We don't have time to apply for a visa, so we need to send this clip.

609
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:20,576
The world must know about Samkorn Thai Tech.

610
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:24,320
- Ready?
- Hold on! So, what do we have to say?

611
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,059
Yeah, what's the script?

612
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:29,879
Leo Burnett, the advertising genius, once said:

613
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:34,879
"Ads should be simple, memorable, fun and catchy."

614
00:51:34,879 --> 00:51:38,739
- Hey, you know Leo Burnett?
- Of course!

615
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:40,068
That's my motto, too.

616
00:51:40,068 --> 00:51:42,001
- Do you know Leo Burnett?
- Yeah!

617
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:46,000
Then, let's come up with three impactful sentences.

618
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,279
We are the future. We need a partner.

619
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:51,819
And we make a lot of money.

620
00:51:51,819 --> 00:51:56,359
- That's it. Good. Let's go. Ready?
- Okay.

621
00:51:56,359 --> 00:52:01,059
Ready, three, two, one. Action!

622
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:06,239
"Hi. I'm Korn, CEO of the Samkorn Thai Tech.

623
00:52:06,863 --> 00:52:08,559
And…

624
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:16,119
we are the future, we need a partner, and we need a lot of money."

625
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:19,360
Okay, cut. Great. Very good. We're done.

626
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,500
Is that all?

627
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,719
That's it, just like the script. The rest will be edited.

628
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:25,860
Just one take?

629
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,880
Well, believe me. I am Leo Burnett of Thailand.

630
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:35,079
As for your pay?

631
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:39,559
No worry about that. We're cousins.

632
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:43,100
But I didn't pay you for the business cards.

633
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,280
Never mind it. Just call me when you need help.

634
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,040
Video production, editing, PR, marketing. I get you covered,

635
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,200
but I want 1% of your shares. kay?

636
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,050
Right?

637
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:00,541
Can I have another take?

638
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:03,840
It's already good. Trust me. Great!

639
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,240
- Are we done?
- We are.

640
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,940
- Come on.
- Do you think we got it?

641
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,470
Why don't you want to tell Dream the truth?

642
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:27,100
I came to think about it. Keeping this secret shouldn't be any harm.

643
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:32,939
I won't tell. You won't tell. No one will know.

644
00:53:32,939 --> 00:53:34,680
And what about Korn?

645
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,140
I will make Korn the perfect man. Just like in the letter.

646
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,800
I don't think it's easy.

647
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,059
Grandma, trust me. I'm so talented.

648
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,720
Guys.

649
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:13,779
- Do we really have to send a video?
- Yes, of course.

650
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:18,074
Our message should reach the world.

651
00:54:18,074 --> 00:54:21,239
Some major global companies will definitely take notice of us.

652
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:25,760
We're talking about dealing with giants like Google or Apple.

653
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,016
Small players like Mr.Ji's company just aren't on our level.

654
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,970
Really?

655
00:54:34,026 --> 00:54:37,080
But I think Mr. Ji is the best partner for us.

656
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:40,960
- Why?
- How?

657
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:46,760
I think we and Mr. Ji have the same objective function.

658
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:50,883
Objective function?

659
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:57,026
Why go through such difficulty? I don't get it.

660
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,190
I want to do something for you.

661
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,610
And...

662
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:07,219
I'm so worried that I can't sleep.

663
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,180
You've been fine all along. Why can't you sleep all of a sudden?

664
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:20,939
Well, you wouldn't want to disappoint your granddaughter, would you?

665
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,100
Don't worry, Grandma.

666
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,199
Korn, the man of her dreams, I'll make it happen.

667
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:33,490
Your guys look at this.

668
00:55:34,341 --> 00:55:35,841
What?

669
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,881
We and the investors have two types of networks.

670
00:55:43,881 --> 00:55:46,922
Let's say two networks were to find the Nash Equilibrium.

671
00:55:46,922 --> 00:55:52,477
That means the investors and us, Mr. Ji and Samkorn Thai Tech…

672
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,419
have two networks.

673
00:55:56,345 --> 00:55:59,546
- We're listening.
- Go on.

674
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,880
But if we are too different, it will be hard to calculate the loss function

675
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,841
and learning won't be easy.

676
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:11,083
But what if…

677
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,559
we have the same objective function?

678
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,760
Then you will only need one loss function.

679
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,023
- And the learning process will be easier.
- Exactly.

680
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:23,199
Why are you bullshitting?

681
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:26,880
This is why people talk shit about engineering majors.

682
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,040
You could've just said that Mr. Ji shares the same goal with us.

683
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,719
So, we can expect a good result. That's it.

684
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:34,519
- No need to be convoluted.
- Right.

685
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:38,128
Yes, our company's goal is success.

686
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,660
And Mr. Ji wants our company to be successful as well.

687
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,420
Because Mr. Ji doesn't want to disappoint Dream, just like me.

688
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:51,099
- Like you?
- Yeah.

689
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:00,239
I can understand the thing about Mr. Ji and Dream.

690
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:03,723
They have a history, so it's natural for him to want to help her.

691
00:57:03,723 --> 00:57:07,800
But what I don't get is why you would pretend to be Korn in the letter.

692
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,296
Yes! She's just a stranger.

693
00:57:11,296 --> 00:57:14,473
And if she's disappointed, what does that have to do with you? Why do you care?

694
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,906
I don't want Dream to be disappointed.

695
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:24,263
Do you have feelings for Dream?

696
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:30,740
You're making such an effort to spare Dream from disappointment,

697
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:34,030
because you have feelings for her. Right?

698
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:39,160
♫ Still I found you there in my dreams ♫

699
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,930
♫ Still I'm lost in our memories ♫

700
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,320
♫ Don't know how long it's gonna be ♫

701
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,550
- No.
- Yes, I like Dream.

702
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:57,220
♫ I'm begging for the star to shine me back the light ♫

703
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:07,200
[Welcome to Sandbox Next Gen]­

704
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,655
[Why do you want to start a startup?]

705
00:58:37,685 --> 00:58:39,618
[I want to use an executive's elevator.]

706
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:42,780
[I deserve better.]

707
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,983
[To turn a misunderstanding into reality.]

708
00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:49,081
[To return a favor.]

709
00:58:56,844 --> 00:59:02,155
[Follow your dream.]

710
00:59:02,794 --> 00:59:04,466
Why do you want to join Sandbox?
[Next Episode]

711
00:59:04,466 --> 00:59:07,619
Nobody, including you, will truly see what I'm capable of.

712
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:09,000
Are you stupid?

713
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,582
How could you give away the whole algorithm like that?

714
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:14,059
Dream said she'd take me to the beach to celebrate her birthday.

715
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:16,034
What wish did you write down?

716
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:17,330
My wish?

717
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:19,921
You don't have the DNA of being an executive.

718
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:22,889
If you get into Sandbox, you should find a new CEO.

719
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:27,590
Welcome everyone to the 9th generation of Sandbox.

720
00:59:28,116 --> 00:59:29,298
Why are you here?

721
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:33,438
And why is your CEO boyfriend here?

722
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,000
♫ It’s like the stars have been snuffed out ♫

723
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,100
♫ It’s like the stars have been snuffed out ♫

724
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:07,110
♫ It’s not the same, they’re not shining enough for me to see the way ♫

725
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:11,930
♫ The fading sky ends up in darkness ♫

726
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:16,710
♫ There’s no hand for me to hold from someone who was once beside me ♫

727
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:21,680
♫ I’m going in circles in the same place ♫

728
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:26,570
♫ Where we used to be before you abandoned me ♫

729
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:31,640
♫ However much I run, whatever I do ♫

730
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:36,550
♫ I find only exhaustion ♫

731
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:41,150
♫ When I close my eyes, I still see your image ♫

732
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:46,720
♫ Whichever way I look, I still see you ♫
