00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,400
What should I do?

174
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Korn!

175
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Come out and talk. Open the door right now.

176
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,200
I know you're in there.

177
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,800
Korn! You think you can hide? Come out!

178
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,500
- Damn, Bank, the phone. Turn it off.
- Turn it off now!

179
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,700
You idiot. We don't even have a cat in our office.

180
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Well, right.

181
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,600
Korn, come and talk to me.

182
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,000
If it's so dark in there, maybe he's not here, dear.

183
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,700
If he was, he'd have come out already.

184
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's just go home.

185
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,500
Holy…

186
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,900
Korn!

187
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,900
Korn! You'll get it today!

188
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,800
Sorry!

189
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,800
You promised to make this company successful within a year!

190
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Now what? Any progress? Have you achieved anything at all?

191
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I… about that...

192
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,600
He's trying, dear. We have to support our son.

193
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,400
Didn't I support him?

194
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,000
Son, I'm not a millionaire. I don't have endless money for you to waste.

195
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,500
I sold my farm and gave you money to invest.

196
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,200
And what is this? What is this?

197
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,500
I'm so sorry, Dad. I'm sorry for letting you down.

198
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,700
We're asking for one more chance, Dad. Please.

199
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,800
Please.

200
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,200
Dad, just give him another chance. Their job isn't easy to do, right?

201
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,100
Yes, Mom.

202
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So, as an investor, I want to know…

203
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
is it worth investing in you guys anymore?

204
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,700
Just tell me the truth.

205
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:58,200
Well, the money you gave us covered the rent, server fees, equipment, and devices.

206
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,800
And yes, we cook our own meals too, Dad.

207
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,000
I also keep a strict record of our income and expenses.

208
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,500
He does everything he can for the company.

209
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,000
He's very frugal, almost stingy.

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,800
He'd put us on a rice and salt diet if he could.

211
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,300
No need for dramatics, Bank. You're quite the actor.

212
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:32,200
So, tell me what will make me want to invest further?

213
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
What gives me hope?

214
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,600
This is our latest project, our hope.

215
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,800
We're currently competing in CODA.

216
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,600
- It's a world-class competition, Dad!
- Absolutely.

217
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,400
What is CODA? I don't know anything about CODA.

218
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,500
CODA is a well-known company worldwide. They are now planning an AI tournament.

219
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,200
- What is it?
- Dad, it's like the AI Olympics.

220
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,600
So you're going to make a top-notch pornographic film?

221
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,800
How frequently do you watch them?

222
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,000
Dad, that's AV.

223
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,200
Artificial Intelligence is referred to as AI.

224
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,400
We are now able to detect pictures on computers.

225
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
- Key, go grab the PC.
- That one.

226
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,000
All right, so the goal at this point

227
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,800
is to teach computers to identify imagesin the same manner that people do.

228
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,100
- Dad, give it a go.
- Right here.

231
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,600
What do you think?

232
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,300
Tissue paper. But wait. Let me try it. Grab this.

234
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,200
A flashlight. Wait. Let me try another thing.

235
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,000
This one must be challenging.

237
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,100
Cactus.

238
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,200
This device is impressive!

239
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,300
Yes, a lot of businesses are doing this at the moment.

240
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,000
However, we are the fastest and most precise at doing it.

241
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,200
I can hope for a little bit after all.

242
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Dad, please get in here.

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,700

244
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,279
Very clever.

245
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,400
- No, Dad.
- Fix it now.

246
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,600
A bug.

247
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,300
A little error, sir.

248
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
Let's give it another go.

Crazy Man.
[Crazy Man]

250
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,100
Did it call me crazy? This awful thing?

251
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,600
Are you going to use my money to build a machine that called me crazy?

252
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,800
Never ever. This has gone too far. This has gone too far. How could you do this?

253
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,600
- Korn! You jerk!
- Dad, calm down. Take it easy, Dad.

Samkorn Thai Tech. Korn.

258
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,900
So, is he as handsome and smart as we wrote about him?

259
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,500
Not the least as handsome as me.

260
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,700
So what does he do?

261
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,600
He's trying to get a startup off the ground, but it seems like it's struggling.

262
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,800
To be honest, he doesn't quite live up to the image we created in the letters.

263
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
Maybe it's best if Dream doesn't meet him.

264
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,400
It could shock her, especially if she brought him to the party.

265
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,600
He'd cause her more embarrassment. So it's better if they don't meet at all.

266
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,200
Shame we put in all that effort to find him.

267
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,000
It is what it is, Grandma.

268
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,200
Speaking of Dream, what's she up to now?

269
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Come try it. It's free. Want to try? It's for everyone. Come on over and give it a go.

- I'm sorry.
- Yes?

What do you think about a child who hasn't seen her mother in years,

274
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,200
but when they meet, she keeps playing with her cell phone?

275
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
What kind of child do you think she is?

276
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
It means she must be very busy.

277
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,000
My husband is the same. He never looks up from his cell phone.

278
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,800
Please excuse me.

- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

What kind of mother refuses to go home and take care of her family,

281
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,200
but chooses to stay at a hotel instead, even though her house is nearby?

282
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Recently customers like to stay in hotels on weekends. It's a trend now.

283
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,800
But no one stays in a hotel for years like my mother.

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,700
If you want something more, just let me know.

285

I have to look after the other tables.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

287
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,800
Mom, are you really not coming home?

288
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:08,200
I'm fine here. I can swim here, go to the fitness center, and go to the spa.

289
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,800
Plus, I don't have to see your dad.

290
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,700
But you can go swimming, go to the gym, and to the spa,

291
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:22,100
with his money. Right? If you choose to use his money, you should accept it.

292
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,300
You call the person who cheats on your mother a dad?

Is your dad really going to withdraw his investment?

302
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,400
I think so.

303
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,600
It would be fantastic if we could get into Sandbox.

304
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,000
It would relieve us of the burden of paying the server cost and rent.

305
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,900
The rent is not very high. I can talk to my uncle.

306
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,700
He will let us stay if there isn't anyone on the waiting list.

307
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,400
But server and maintenance are a problem. How do we handle that?

Go, Korn. You're just refreshing the page anyway.

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Is it really that difficult?

336
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But how did you manage to find him?

337
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,400
It's a combination of talent and luck, Grandma.

Are you sure it's not intense for me too? Look at this!

340
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,600
Fine, fine, I'll get it.

341
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,800
It should've been you, not him again.

Just so you know, nobody else could have found him!

343
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,400
But my Dream is a lucky person, too.

344
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,800
- Oh, yeah? Eat up!
- Ah.

345
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
- Dream.
- Yes?

346
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,500
Let's eat.

347
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,600
You're just playing on the phone and not eating.

348
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,200
Just a second, Grandma. I'm looking for Korn.

349
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
[Korn Panpaisan]

350
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:48,944
[Korn Simapaisan]

351
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,320
[Follow your dream]­

352
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,200
[­I'm interested in the gloves.]

353
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,500
I'm interested in the gloves. Can I see pics for confirmation?

354
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,500
- Grandma!
- What?

355
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,400
- Grandma!
- What in the world is going on?

356
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
I found him. Grandma! I've found him!

357
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,600
- What have you found?
- I found Korn!

358
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,800
He's the one in the news…

359
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Look! He's free today! I'm going to see him. What should I wear?

360
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Here it is, friends. I very proudly present this one. It's the highlight of today.

361
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,300
The monstrous Setton, slayer of Ultraman with Ultraman's own beam.

362
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,600
Bank.

363
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:55,200
Hurry. You'll say "Set", and I'll say "Ton". Set. Ton! Come on. Set. Ton!

364
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,000
- Set.
- Ton!

365
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,200
- That's enough.
- Why?

366
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,600
Is anyone watching?

367
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,700
Let's have some spirit. Just one more person left, and our customers are waiting. Set… Ton!

368
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,800
Set. Ton.

369
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,300
That one person is just me.

370
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,300
Or post them for sale online, as Korn did?

371
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,100
What do you think? You can do that?

372
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,600
See this, I sold those gloves for a lot of money!

373
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,100
Really?

374
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,600
Really, you could really get thousands of Baht.

375
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,500
- You just opened the account, didn't you?
- Yeah.

376
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,400
And you managed to sell something that fast?

377
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,500
And who is stupid enough to buy?

378
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,100
- Yes!
- Here.

379
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,300
"I am Pafun. Are you free right now?"

380
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,400
"Would it be possible for you to bring those things to me?"

381
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,800
"Maybe we can chat."

382
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,600
Sheesh! Does she talk like she knows you well? Who is she?

383
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,800
What's this about chatting?

384
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,800
I don't know either. I don't know her.

385
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,200
- This is weird.
- Yeah, it's definitely strange.

386
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,838
- Who is this?
- Go on with the livestream!

387
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,559
I'm delivering an order.

388
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,040
Hello.

389
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,680
Dream is also lucky. She found Korn.

390
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,240
How did she manage that?

391
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,439
How could I know?

392
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,030
Have they set a meeting yet?

393
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:33,330
Where?

394
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:37,850
Don't worry. I'll handle it myself.

395
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,819
- Yes, Mr. Ji, please give me the details.
- We'll talk later.

396
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:04,075
I'm on a BTS skytrain now.

397
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:16,706
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

398
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:56,871
I'm here. I'm in a brown dress.

399
00:31:57,465 --> 00:32:00,468
I'm here, too. I'm walking to you.

400
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,550
♫ It's like the sky lost all the light ♫

401
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:11,490
♫ And I'm the only one here without you by my side ♫

402
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,370
♫ I tried to run but I fell back down ♫

403
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:21,020
♫ Looking for the door when there's no way out ♫

404
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,860
♫ I tried to hide but I don't know how ♫

405
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,090
♫ I can't get you off my mind ♫

406
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,820
♫ Still I found you there in my dreams ♫

407
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,780
♫ Still I'm lost in our memories ♫

408
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,350
♫ Don't know how long it's gonna be ♫

409
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,230
♫ I'm asking please ♫

410
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,970
♫ I'm begging for the star to shine me back the light ♫

411
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,940
♫ I'm shouting to the sky but there's no reply ♫

412
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,700
♫ I'm sick of running in the maze with eyes fully blind ♫

413
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,430
♫ But how can I turn back time? ♫

414
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,240
♫ And have you here in my arms ♫

415
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,403
What's going on? What are you doing?

416
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,499
I'm sorry.

417
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,219
Angel.

418
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,643
Are you Mr. Korn?

419
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:37,380
- Yes, and are you Mr. Jiraphat?
- Yes.

420
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,860
I sent an email to you. I didn't think you'd come to see me yourself.

421
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,820
So how did you know I was here?

422
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,380
Well, there's something I need to talk to you about.

423
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:52,936
Shall we go elsewhere? How about your office?

424
00:33:52,936 --> 00:33:54,830
- Of course.
- Let's go.

425
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,882
Hold on a second, can you spare me five minutes? I just need to drop off this order.

426
00:33:58,882 --> 00:34:01,063
Are you going to see Dream?

427
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,400
Come with me first. I'll explain everything later.

428
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:14,679
I'm so happy to finally meet you.

429
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,619
I've been waiting for your response for a while now.

430
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,260
I was hoping you could offer some advice on my startup business.

431
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,252
Or, if you're interested, I'd be thrilled to have you invest.

432
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:25,860
We're currently in the development stage…

433
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,279
Actually, I'm not here about business.

434
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:34,070
Then what brings you here?

435
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:42,356
Let's take a look at these first.

436
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:07,719
Korn? It's the same name as mine. Now, who is this Pafun?

437
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,840
That Korn is you.

438
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,759
As for Pafun or Dream, she is the person you were supposed to meet.

439
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:26,889
But let me explain further. First, please read these letters.

440
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:43,290
I have urgent business. Sorry for not making the appointment.

441
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,956
Hello, what's up?

442
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,299
Really, I have to be there?

443
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,359
Okay. I'll head over now.

444
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,630
Korn, Dear friend?

445
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,639
What is going on?

446
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:24,223
So, in short, you didn't come here for a business meeting.

447
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,579
Instead, you want me to pretend to be this "Korn"

448
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:31,960
from these letters and meet the girl you wrote to?

449
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,710
Yes.

450
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:41,220
I'm sorry.

451
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:47,280
I know it sounds crazy, but it's a request from an important person who helped me out.

452
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,500
It would be just for an hour? Can you even do that?

453
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:55,159
And why does my friend have to help you?

454
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,310
- Yes, we have things to do.
- Yes.

455
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,680
And this wouldn't be a free favor. I'll offer you some compensation.

456
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,540
Have you had a chance to look at our business plan yet?

457
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,720
Yes, I've seen it.

458
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,780
What did you think?

459
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,983
Honestly, it doesn't quite meet my standards yet.

460
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,059
Not meet your standards? So, there are… problems? Gaps?

461
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:34,900
I apologize, but I didn't come here today to discuss investment.

462
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,380
I came to ask for your help, and I'm willing to pay you for it.

463
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,720
How much do you want? Just tell me.

464
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,760
Do you really think we can be bought off that easily?

465
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Fifty thousand baht? Would that be enough?

466
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,700
We need to talk for a moment outside. Mr. Ji, please wait here.

467
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:05,280
- We're so lucky!
- Yes!

468
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,519
Just accept his offer. We have nothing to lose. It feels like we have the upper hand here.

469
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,419
What if we could push for a bit more? Maybe another ten or twenty thousand?

470
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,479
Greed can lead to trouble. I won't be a part of asking for more.

471
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:21,139
You haven't even asked me yet! I'm the one who's supposed to do this…

472
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:23,467
- No buts, Korn, we need to do this.
- Yeah.

473
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,628
We really don't have a choice.

474
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,260
Have you forgotten our company is struggling?

475
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,689
This money could be a lifesaver, much more than what we make selling crafts all day.

476
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,860
I found Korn.

477
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,779
But…

478
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,737
I'm not sure he's the best person for the job.

479
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:49,336
Just remember, we're doing this for Samkorn.

480
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
- Yes!
- Well! Okay.

481
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,336
Well, good call, Korn. You made the right decision.

482
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:59,023
Don't worry, Grandma.

483
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:01,419
I'll do my best to handle it.

484
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:10,583
Okay, Mr. Jiraphat,

485
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,236
I agree to help.

486
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,315
Excellent! So, how would you like me to handle the payment?

487
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:18,148
Can I get your account number…?

488
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,363
Actually, there's no need for money.

489
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,529
But I do have a condition…

490
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,203
I want you to help our business.

491
00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:30,758
Help…

492
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,063
Help with what?

493
00:39:34,063 --> 00:39:36,323
We want to join Sandbox.

494
00:39:41,263 --> 00:39:43,103
I can't do that.

495
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,670
Mr. Jiraphat, please wait a minute. Mr. Jiraphat, listen!

496
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:55,509
I've seen more than a thousand startups.

497
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:59,641
I've funded only thirty, and out of those,

498
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:02,876
only four didn't receive additional funding later on.

499
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:05,719
Four. You've made mistakes four times.

500
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:11,560
But no startup I've refused funding to has ever survived.

501
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,399
I won't risk tarnishing my record. So, I won't be funding your business.

502
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,903
Don't let someone else's words discourage us.

503
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:56,136
Bank, you handled that well.

504
00:41:02,346 --> 00:41:04,571
[Tai Tiang]

505
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,019
- Wan.
- Huh?

506
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:10,660
What happened?

507
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,090
You need to ask Berm himself. He's coming.

508
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,900
Jack's picture you posted online.

509
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,500
His manager saw it and contacted us.

510
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:32,561
He claims it's photoshopped and is threatening to sue.

511
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:36,383

Korn, my dear friend. I actually came to Bangkok today to visit my sister,

555
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:38,403
but things haven't exactly gone smoothly. It's been a bit of a rough day.

556
00:48:38,403 --> 00:48:43,460
I ended up crying pretty hard. To top it all off, it started pouring rain.

557
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:54,374
I just threw away my umbrella and walked in the rain.

558
00:48:54,374 --> 00:48:58,348
I didn't want anyone to see me like that.

It was so beautiful that it took away all my worries for a moment.

It made me realize that sometimes,

You know, my dad once gave me a book. He said it was a fantastic story.

569
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:41,500
But believe it or not, I only read the prologue. I was afraid to read any further,

570
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,700
afraid the ending wouldn't be what I wanted, afraid of being disappointed.

571

I'm afraid that the book my dad gave me will be wrinkled.

572
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:57,400
It's all worrying. So, in the end, I never finished reading it. Funny, isn't it?

You know, Korn, you're kind of like that book to me.

I don't need to open you and read your story to know that it's valuable.

I'm sure you have your own story too, just as precious as that book.
