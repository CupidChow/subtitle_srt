176
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
What should we do? Something service-related?

177
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,500
So how about a service based on machine learning?

178
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,900
CEO, do you know what Machine Learning is?

179
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,300
I know, Korn explained it to me.

180
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,700
It's a romantic technology.

181
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
How romantic?

182
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,100
We haven't written letters in years.

183
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,200
Fill me in on your life. What have you been up to?

184
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:42,100
What are your interests, dislikes, or what's been keeping you busy? Can you share it with me?

185
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,000
My interest? I like designing artificial neuron networks.

186
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,200
Have you heard of it?

187
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,000
And how about Machine Learning?

188
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,100
Machine Learning. I've heard that term, too.

189
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,500
But I don't quite understand it.

190
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,860
Look.­

191
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,500
So let's say this is a computer.

192
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:23,700
We'll call it angel. An angel was born and grew up on a paradise island.

193
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:35,000
But one day, Satan appears on Paradise Island. The angel's never seen Satan before.

194
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,900
Angel wants to befriend Satan. She gives him a rock but Satan doesn't like it.

195
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,200
Then she gives him flowers.

196
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,300
This time, it makes him happy. One day, Angel catches him with a snake.

197
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,800
But he doesn't like it.

198
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,400
When she catches him a rabbit it makes him happy.

199
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,800
What's next?

200
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,400
So the angel keeps on trying.

201
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:07,000
While building such experiences, Angel learns what Satan likes or dislikes.

202
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Finally, she learns how to win his heart.

203
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,300
I see… Hence, the term Machine Learning.

204
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,300
We teach the machine to learn.

205
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,400
Exactly.

206
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,560
I get the metaphor.

207
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,136
Angel and Satan?

208
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,500
It does sound familiar. Reminds me of Tarzan and Jane.

209
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,300
Did you borrow from that story?

210
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,400
No, I came up with it myself,

211
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,000
though it was partly inspired by it.

212
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,700
How long will this chitchat last?

213
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,300
So, what kind of data set should we choose to do a service?

214
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,700
There's all kinds of data here.

215
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Road accidents, fine dust levels, photos, news pictures.

216
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,000
Should we try using news photos and images?

217
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,700
It's pretty interesting, too.

218
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
What's the next step?

219
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,900
Next, we input the data and train the machine

220
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,100
to differentiatebetween forged images and authentic ones.

221
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,800
Interesting.

222
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
But can that be a viable business model?

223
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,100
It's okay, guys. We can think and collect data first.

224
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,500
Then we can see which option is viable.

225
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,300
Okay.

226
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:55,100
As for you, help me find information or news that's currently trending.

227
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,400
Of course.

228
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600

- Let's do it!
- Fight!

Okay. Got you, buddy.

I'm looking at the traffic accident data.

234
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,800
How about distribution? That's our expertise.

235
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,700
Let's use the photo and image data set.

236
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,100
For what kind of business model?

237
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,200
It's up to you to decide.

238
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,800
So can you please tell me,

239
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,200
what made you choose this topic?

240
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,500
Samkorn Thai Tech guys are planning to create a service using this data set.

241
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,200
So what?

242
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,800
If we can defeat Samkorn Thai Tech,

243
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,500
it's like taking down the world champion.

244
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,700
Then, everyone will see who's truly the best.

245
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,963
Interested?

246
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,531

Is it walking meditation? Haven't you seen it before?

00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:32,939
And what for?

00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:38,276
For concentration. Comes concentration, comes wisdom.

I had to quit my job because they thought the pictures I took were photoshopped.

269
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,221
If we had a tool that could examine shared materials

270
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:01,760
and detect photoshopped images from authentic ones,

271
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,349
consumers would know how to identify fake news.

Let's load it for my mom. She only shares edited images

275
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,559
and doesn't even know if any of them are real.

276
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,739
My father, too. He shares stuff every day, believing in all that rubbish.

277

He even ended up buying the wrong medicine.

278
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:19,740
- He bought the wrong medicine, too?
- Yes!

279
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,380
Well, my patients often request surgery after seeing those edited pictures.

280
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,019
They're all fake. How could they fall for it?

281
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:30,519
Let's use our technology to verify.

282
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:35,220
If the image is authentic or photoshopped, starting with the existing database.

283
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,123
But we have little time left. Can we make it in time?

284
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:42,889
We'll have to take the risk.

285

- Besides what is already available, right?
- Yes.

292
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,480
We actually have it. I just found it.

293
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,340
- Yes.
- Share it on the central drive.

352
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:26,859
- Because it's heavy to carry all this.
- Thank you.

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,883

- Goodbye.
- Sorry I can't see you off.

358
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,256
No need for that. I can come and go on my own. Just focus on your job. Go on!

00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:52,436
- Take care.
- Thanks.

Is the kid here, too?

379

Yes, she is in the hackathon too.

380
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:17,820
Really? Did you tell her to join?

381
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,265
No, we met by accident. She must have no idea that

382
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:27,156
she was the inspiration behind the Sandbox.

383

Why are you guys dragging me out?

387
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,790
I went around and found that

388
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,223
CEOs from some teams are not pitching themselves.

So what?

391
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,039
I mean, we want you to do the pitching instead of Dream.

392
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,939
Yes.

393
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:05,620
Why?

394
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,240
Come to think of it, friend,

395
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,260
she doesn't know even the term parameter.

396
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,660
That's it.

00:34:12,406 --> 00:34:14,770
People used to say the same thing about us.

398
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,256
And why now are you looking down on someone when you know what it feels like?

399
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,023
What if we don't make it?

400
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:28,136
If you guys are going to pitch, you'll really be screwed.

What do you mean by that?

00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,130
If so, I'll personally invest.

408
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:17,899
Finally, the intense hackathon has come to an end.

409
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:30,780
And now it's time for you guys to pitch your business ideas to your potential investors.

Let's meet the first team.

shifting from single-use fashion to more stable and sustainable shopping.

413
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,381
On our platform, sellers can showcase trendy clothes

414

and tag the products they wish to sell in our Sharing Closet.

415
00:35:59,939 --> 00:36:03,501
Meanwhile, buyers can follow their favorite fashion influencers

416
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:05,419
and purchase items directly from the platform.

417
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:09,581
If you're someone with allergies and struggle to find food options to avoid such triggers.

418
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:11,099
"Allerfood" can help you.

Keep the intro short and impactful.

When you want to emphasize something, speak slowly.

426
00:37:33,296 --> 00:37:35,923
Just delete this whole sentence.

427
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:38,583

429
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:50,119
As for the ending part, should I make it shorter?

430
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:56,150
Yeah, make it more concise. Maybe you should…

431
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:04,750
Next, let's meet number 19 from the Alice Company team.

especially in the realm of online fashion.

That's why our company is here to make things easier.

442

477
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,200
we've seen numerous instances of people mistakenly taking incorrect medication,

misunderstanding vaccination information.

479

aim to elicit donations of millions of baht,

481
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:15,099
despite the fact that none of it is real.

482
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:21,900
And then there are the fake transfer slips that cause a multitude of problems

483
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,419
often leading to legal action and court proceedings.

The previous team focused on creating realistic images.

504

507
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,600
Why bother with that? Alice's technology is meant to be deceptive anyway.

508
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,400
I don't see the point in detection.

509
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:32,262
Actually, it does matter.

510
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:36,499
If someone misuses that technology

511
00:45:36,499 --> 00:45:39,740
to edit photos, presenting themselves as something they're not to deceive others,

512
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,300
then our detectors would definitely come in handy.

513
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,700

514
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,200

00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,700
Don't even apologize.

525
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,600
Wait a minute.

526
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,700
I have a question to ask you.

527
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,000
What's the matter?

528
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,100
About you helping Korn to lie.

529
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,700
I get it that Korn lied to me.

530
00:49:52,700 --> 00:50:00,000
He probably wanted to impress me but what confuses me is…

531
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,600
why you went to great lengths to help him with it.

532
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,000
Because I…

533
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,100
Why?

534
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,600
Mr. Ji. Ms. Rose called an urgent meeting.

535
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,100
You can go. It's okay.

536
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,800
- So, I have to excuse myself.
- Yes.

537
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,900
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

538
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,100
Sorry guys. It was my fault.

539
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,400
It's okay. Don't worry.

540
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,700
Right?

541
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,700
You've done your best.

542
00:50:54,700 --> 00:51:00,300
Yes, dude. Even if we don't pass, now we have Mr. Ji.

543
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,400
Do we really let Mr. Ji invest with us?

544
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,000
What? But why not?

545
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I am afraid he will change his mind and not invest with us.

546
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,400
- Right?
- Yes!

547
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,200
Is that all you can do?

548
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,000
I'll leave.

549
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,500
Are you guys planning to stick around?

550
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,500
Let's just hang tight and wait for the results to be announced first.

551
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,900
Are you all still hanging around for the results?

552
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,600
Just making sure we're ready to slip in,

553
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,300
if they happen to make a mistake in the announcement.

554
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,200
- Right?
- Absolutely!

555
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,000
I shouldn't have wasted my time being on your team.

556
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,400
So, why did you choose to join our team?

557
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,800
Why don't you tell me a compelling reason?

558
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,700
Why I want to be on the same team as yours.

559
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,600
First, I'm sure you're a talented person.

560
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:23,000
Second, I am a quick-witted person. And it comes with luck.

561
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Is that all?

562
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:31,400
No, that was just the warm-up. Here's the real deal.

563
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,800
Our team boasts a world-champion developer.

564
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,400
He had the chance to work with a CEO who's both talented and renowned,

565
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,300
but he chose me as his CEO.

566
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,800
So, he's probably regretting that decision now.

567
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,000
And your other reason still isn't compelling.

568
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,600
I'll pass.

569
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,300
I think you might be wrong.

570
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,300
As I am the one who always gives my best in anything I do.

571
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,100
And I'm confident.

572
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:09,600
That neither you nor he will regret choosing me as CEO.

573
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,200
So, I was curious about who this amazing developer was.

574
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,000
But, as it turns out, he's just average.

575
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,400
Now, we have the 9th Sandbox finalists.

576
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,700
Roughly, but the final team is the problem.

577
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,500
They all got the same scores. What should we do?

578
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,500
That's really hard to choose.

579
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,000
I haven't scored yet.

580
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,600
Mr. Mark!

581
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,900
Ms. Rose.

582
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,900
This is Mr. Mark from Good Goal Company in the US,

583
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,600
a major partner of Sandbox.

584
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
Very nice to meet you, sir.

585
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,500
Nice to meet you.

586
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:14,000
- Mr. Ji.
- Good to see you again.

587
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,400
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

588
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,610
Mr. Mark is a committee member and is one of our mentors.

589
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,300
So, Mark, have you decided? Which team would you choose?

590
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,800
Yes, I have.

591
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,400
Please have some water.

592
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,700
Thank you.

593
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,600
You're welcome.

594
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,159
Please have some more.

595
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,840
Dad, I looked up the name on the business card.

596
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,075
The company listed is the 7th most valuable company in the world.

597
00:54:51,075 --> 00:54:53,100
- Seriously?
- Yes.

598
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,400
In that case, we need to make sure we really praise our son.

599
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:03,600
Mr. Mark, when Korn was a kid, he won the gold medal in the Math Olympics.

600
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,100
Wow! Bravo!

601
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,100
I mean, he was just a little boy, a tiny little boy.

602
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,700
- A little young boy.
- Yes.

603
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,600
- I see.
- Tiny.

604
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,200
You must be proud.

605
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,400
He's been smart since he was a kid.

606
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,500
Don't cry.

607
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,400
- Thank you.
- You did it.

608
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Just look at that gold medal, Hon.

609
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,400
- You're awesome!
- Gold medal!

610
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,400
You got more tutoring, yet you lost to a kid.

611
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,400
Aren't you embarrassed?

612
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,600
Our son is amazing.

613
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,100
You can have this.

614
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,700
Mr. Mark, our Korn prefers to lose in competitions.

615
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:06,600
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, he doesn't care about fame or wealth.

616
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,900
Whenever someone asks for something, he's always willing to give.

617
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,700
So I named him "Phra Vessantara".

618
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,100
- Western Corn?
- Vessantara.

619
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,400
- Western Corn? Western Dawn?
- Yeah, Dawn?

620
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,800
Korn was a very smart kid.

621
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:36,100
I mean, he's as smart as Mark Iceberg, Bill… Zuckerberg.

622
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,000
Yeah, that Berg guy.

623
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,800
Just like those people. But he lacks ambition.

624
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:47,200
That's right! Korn, my son, is a modest genius.

625
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,500
He always acts modestly. As small as this.

626
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,300
If he had gotten a good chance, Mr. Mark,

627
00:56:55,300 --> 00:57:00,100
he would have planted his flag and be strolling on Mars by now.

628
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,500
- You mean Mars?
- Yeah, Mars…

629
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,400
- Mars.
- Mars. Yeah.

630
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,700
So, which team do you choose Mark?

631
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,600
Samkorn Thai Tech, for sure.

632
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,200
Why?

633
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,100
I have carefully examined their algorithms.

634
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,900
Given the short amount of time he had, the results are truly impressive.

635
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:41,000
If he had been given more time, there's no doubt he would have excelled even further.

636
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,100
- Where are you going?
- Where is he going?

637
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,000
- Dream! Dream!
- Yes, Korn?

638
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,400
We got into Sandbox!

639
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,200
For real?

640
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,600
Look at the screen.

641
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,400
Samkorn Thai Tech.

We're as close as brothers.

Big brother is always here for you, my dear bro.

We finally met. The girl who inspired our Sandbox.

655
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,300
I disagree.

656
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,100
I'm leaving. Just change the name to Pafun Tech!
