00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,000
It's tough.

179
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,300
I feel it might be a waste of time and resources.

180
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,900
But isn't there a slim chance?

181
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,300
Perhaps, if it's one in ten thousand.

182
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,800
One in ten thousand?

183
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,300
Yet, deep down, you're eager to join the bid, aren't you?

184
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,900
Dream,

185
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,100
please ask your grandma to stop sending over so much food.

186
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,900
My fridge is packed full.

187
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,000
What can I do? She enjoys fattening you up.

188
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,500
Looks like the elevator's stuck.

189
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,300
Pardon me, the elevator has halted on the 3rd floor of Building A.

190
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,100
The technicians are on their way.

191
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,200
Thank you.

192
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,700
Help is on the way.

193

Dream,

195
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,300
I'm leaning toward submitting a bid.

196
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,500
You ought to respect the CEO's decision.

197
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,400
Still, it's worth a shot.

198
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,800
We should learn what it's like.

199
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Without proper planning, it's a lost cause.

200
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Setting sail without a map is a gamble, don't you agree?

201
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,100
I'm aware,

202
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,600
but some risks are worth taking.

203
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:12,400
Are you willing to risk everything?

204
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,700
If we survive, we'll be pioneers that the world will remember.

205
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,500
Okay! Enough already.

206
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,600
Is everything okay?

207
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,100
Yes, thank you.

208
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

209
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,800
- Wait a second, Dream.
- Wait a second, Dream.

210
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
I was the first to call out to Dream.

211
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,800
No, I called her first.

212
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,300
Let's settle this fairly.

213
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,400
All right, let's see who Dream chooses.

214
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,900
Hey… keep it down, will you?

215
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
Do you ever quit?

216
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,900
- No.
- No.

217
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,840
You're on fire today.

218
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,008
- Knock it off.
- You're looking sharp.

219
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:18,545
Enough, with the teasing.

220
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:21,800
Out of the blue, two guys declared they were vying for my attention.

221
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm at a loss.

222
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,100
What's got you so worked up that you invited me for a drink?

223
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,200
It's Key.

224
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,000
His fanbase makes me jealous.

225
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,900
I've never been this frustrated.

226
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,900
Maybe you and Key should just make it official and clear up this confusion.

227
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,300
I guess we're already seeing each other.

228
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,000
What?

229
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,400
Why did you summon me? What's the issue?

230
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,514
I don't like it.

231
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:06,699
There are two things I need from you.

232
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:07,823
What might those be?

233
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:12,303
Firstly, stop the live streams.

234
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:17,288
Secondly, keep your relationship out of the office.

235
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:19,543
Can you manage that?

236
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:21,890
Why should I?

237
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,380
If you do, I'll consider dating you.

238
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,665
What's that supposed to mean?

239
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:45,723
And let's keep our relationship under wraps.

240
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:48,293
Your pulse is racing.

241
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:51,303
Angie might need to call an ambulance—

242
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:03,882
Really?

243
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:08,347
And… Key wasn't floored by the news.

244
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,820
He was utterly stunned.

245
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,720
What prompted you to take such a drastic step?

246
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:18,950
I wanted to set the record straight.

247
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:23,946
Indeed… clear as day.

248
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:28,062
You should sort out your feelings, too.

Make a choice and end this drama.

250
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,768
To be honest,

251
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:41,897
I'm still unsure about my own feelings. Who do I have my heart set on?

252
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,596

Not just yet. Can I have a bit more time?

257
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:30,859
We need to hurry. We need to submit the bid soon.

You seem worn out. Did you have trouble sleeping?

Grandma, how have you been?

263
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:20,380
I'm restless. I've missed being busy since I stopped selling pancakes.

264
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,434
Just hang in there for your symptoms to get better.

265

Once I wrap up my work, we'll take a long trip.

00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:15,183
Riverman, right.

359
00:30:15,183 --> 00:30:17,480
Rapper Viper.

360
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,419
Bank, dude. Can I borrow your tablet?

361
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,615
- Huh?
- Tablet.

362
00:30:21,615 --> 00:30:23,101
- What?
- Tablet.

363
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:24,293
Just a moment.

364
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:27,240
- Right now, friend. I must use it now.
- Right now?

365
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,659
Now. I need it now.

366
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:34,196
And anything else?

367
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:37,845
Virgin.

368
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:38,833
Virgin.

369
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,477
Virgin? That's it!

370
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:42,557
It can be other words…

371
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,830
Quit playing the game. Go back to work, Bank.

372
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,760
What's the matter?

373
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:53,250
I'm not gaming. I'm cracking this puzzle.

374
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,030
We'll figure out who's behind the ransomware.

375
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,765
What's wrong with that?

376
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:01,300
German…

377
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,100
German…

378
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:10,540
Actually, if it's German, we can get many more words.

379
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,820
- German.
- German!

380
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,236
What's bothering you more?

381
00:31:56,236 --> 00:32:00,098
Me or the bid?

382
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,420
Well… both, actually.

383
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:10,193
If it's about me,

384
00:32:10,614 --> 00:32:13,156
you can let that go now.

385
00:32:13,156 --> 00:32:15,243
As for the bid,

386
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:19,599
whatever you decide,

387
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:24,683
I'll stand with you and support you.

388
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:31,956
Thanks.

389
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,220
I don't want you to be so worried that you're afraid to make a choice.

390
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:46,436
And even if it's the wrong one,

391
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:51,547
just remember I'll always be here.

392
00:32:51,547 --> 00:32:53,603
Nothing will change between us.

393
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:00,500
I've changed since three years ago.

394
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,250
I'm more cautious now.

395
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:13,843
And I've grown stronger and more determined.

396
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,359
That's good to hear.

397
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,060
Korn, someone's here to see you.

398
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,256
Yes, Dad?

399
00:34:01,743 --> 00:34:03,743
There he is.

400
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,280
I've brought back your goldfish.

401
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,346
And… could I get back what I borrowed from you?

402
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:18,280
What did you borrow from him? Why haven't you returned it?

403
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,579
He had to come all this way.

404
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:23,559
There's nothing.

405
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,359
Yes, there is.

406
00:34:26,603 --> 00:34:29,396
Yes, I'd like all my letters back.

407
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:39,160
I'll look for them.

408
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,920
Would you like some water, Mr. Ji?

409
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,656
- Thank you.
- You've come this far.

410
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:51,869
We're sampling our homemade liquor. Care to join us, Mr. Ji?

411
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:54,386
- Yes?
- Let's enjoy my homebrew outside.

412
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,599
For the full experience, we should head to the yard.

413
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,619
I'll fetch the glasses.

414
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:00,060
Well… I…

415
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,160
Dear, could you bring some snacks?

416
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,099
- Mr. Ji…
- Yes?

417
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,319
Come on, it's really good. Trust me. Let's go.

418
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:56,073
Why hold onto someone else's past?

419
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:05,380
You're blushing, how adorable.

420
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,740
Mr. Ji, you must try this. I've perfected many recipes.

421
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,006
This one has a mix of herbs. It's the ultimate blend.

422
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:15,019
You simply must try it.

423
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:18,400
Mr. Ji doesn't look like he can handle his drink.

424
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,760
Looks like he's not up to it.

425
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,049
I can handle it.

426
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:26,370
Well then, cheers!

427
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:30,589
Wow… bottom up!

428
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:32,640
- May I have another, please?
- Dear, top him up.

429
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,380
Certainly, right away.

430
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,600
You should join him. It's not often we have guests.

431
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,056
All right.

432
00:36:44,056 --> 00:36:46,563
Dear, ladle him a shot.

433
00:36:47,743 --> 00:36:50,296
- To the last drop!
- Thank you.

434
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:53,245
Mr. Ji, this way.

435
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,329
There we go, the good times are rolling.

436
00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:01,036
Me too, but I've hit my limit.

437
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:05,348
- It's really good, Dad.
- Of course, it is.

438
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,134
Then, may I have another, please?

439
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:10,819
At your service.

440
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:18,050
Here you go.

441
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:23,262
Hey, isn't that a bit stingy? How about a bit more?

442
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,780
Fancy some pickles? They're great with drinks.

443
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:35,660
Absolutely.

444
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,710
Here we go… It's a standoff, Mom.

445
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:44,035
Mr. Ji, cheers.

446
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:47,883
Cheers.

447
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,928
Dear, come sit with us.

448
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:55,701
Dad, it's time for bed.

449
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:58,379
Won't you stay a bit longer, Dear?

450
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:02,659
Hey, are you all right, Mr. Ji?

451
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:04,579
Looks like they're in for a long night.

452
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:07,860
It's delicious. Maybe I drank a bit too quickly.

453
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,900
If you like it, have some more.

454
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,728
I'll leave you to it.

455
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:14,708
Feel at home.

456
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,780
Goodnight.

457
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,159
Don't worry about cleaning up. I'll take care of it tomorrow.

458
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,763
- Night, Dad.
- Night.

459
00:38:19,763 --> 00:38:22,440
Mom, let's have something else to eat.

460
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,209
Come, quick.

461
00:38:25,558 --> 00:38:29,341
- That's all you gave me?
- You've already had five or six.

462
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,992
Don't pass out yet. Let me top you off.

463
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,736
Do you know why…

464
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,913
I wrote your name in those letters?

465
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:07,739
Grandma said I looked like a good boy.

466
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:12,196
No… I did it...

467
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,728
because I was jealous.

468
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:24,443
You have a father and mother,

469
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:27,316
a perfect family.

470
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:32,396
Unlike me,

471
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:37,763
I had nothing, so I used your name.

472
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,960
But I was more jealous of you.

473
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:49,198
Because I'm wealthy?

474
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,288
No…

475
00:39:54,721 --> 00:39:59,945
Because you were Dream's first love.

476
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:07,650
You're the one in her memories.

477
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:17,580
So, I have to outdo you with my own hands.

478
00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:23,887
Are you thinking of giving up?

479
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,719
Never.

480
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,380
Will you keep loving her, even if she doesn't return your feelings?

481
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:35,519
Yes.

482
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:40,029
Me too,

483
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:42,962
but…

484
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:47,065
I think I'm more hopeless than you.

485
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,812
I'm just as hopeless, if not more.

486
00:40:58,797 --> 00:41:01,970
Can't you tell, big brother?

487
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,810
Little brother, Dream's pretty tough, isn't she?

488
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:17,780
The toughest.

489
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,220
She's ruthless.

490
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,920
More.

491
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:26,534
Here you go.

492
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:34,859
- Dream's ruthless…
- Dream's ruthless...

493
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,023
Grandma, why are you up this early?

494
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:49,460
Your mom's stirred up quite the storm.

495
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,059
What happened?

496
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:56,288
She's taken over a Giant Pancake shop lease,

497
00:41:56,868 --> 00:42:00,503
and wants to keep my dream alive.

498
00:42:01,123 --> 00:42:04,340
Mom's selling pancakes now?

499
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,750
Yep,

500
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,510
and I'm tasked with jotting down the recipe.

501
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,914
But look at her, still not up for the market run.

502
00:42:15,468 --> 00:42:21,820
Grandma, won't this be too much? The doctor said no more exerting yourself.

503
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,420
Well, I can't whip them up myself,

504
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:30,077
but pancakes are my calling.

505
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,483
If there's a sliver of a chance to do something, I'm all in.

506
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,316
Dream, we've still got the strength.

507
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:48,123
We've got to give our all while we can.

508
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:04,859
Grandma,

509
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:09,163
I can't thank you enough.

510
00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:12,079
For what?

511
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:18,527
For everything.

512
00:43:18,527 --> 00:43:24,309
Work had me tied up in knots, but you've shown me the way.

513
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:02,119
Why's everything so far away?

514
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,371
Mr. Ji, hold on. I'll grab you a shirt.

515
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:08,720
No need, I'm off to bed.

516
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,620
- At least change first.
- Where is it?

517
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,974
- Just change, will you?
- No way.

518
00:44:12,974 --> 00:44:15,741
Gross, come here. Let's get you changed.

519
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:17,468
Change now!

520
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:20,760
I'm fine with this.

521
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:39,958
Damn…

522
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:58,572
This Tom Yum is mild. Mr. Ji might not like the heat.

523
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:01,419
I bet Mr. Ji can take the spice, Mom.

524
00:45:01,419 --> 00:45:04,560
- Really?
- He's a chili paste kind of guy, I hear.

525
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,963
I'm going home.

526
00:45:11,568 --> 00:45:16,590
Stay, let's eat together.

527
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,059
I'd rather not.

528
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:22,919
Everything's hot off the stove. Join us.

529
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:24,362
Have a seat.

530
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:29,173
Try my Tom Yum, here you go.

531
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:32,737
My Tom Yum.

532
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,269
Do you like it?

533
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:38,919
- Try it.
- Is it too tangy?

534
00:45:42,328 --> 00:45:43,968
Give it a taste.

535
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:46,848
Need anything added? Just say the word.

536
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,100
It's perfect.

♫ The fading sky ends up in darkness ♫

719
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,550
♫ There’s no hand for me to hold from someone who was once beside me ♫

720
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:45,380
♫ I’m going in circles in the same place ♫

721
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:50,310
♫ Where we used to be before you abandoned me ♫

722
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:55,480
♫ However much I run, whatever I do ♫

723
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:00,780
♫ I find only exhaustion ♫

724
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:05,060
♫ When I close my eyes, I still see your image ♫

725
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:10,190
♫ Whichever way I look, I still see you ♫

726
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:17,080
♫ I still don’t know how to endure this, I still don’t know ♫

727
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:22,200
♫ When will the stars in the sky return and shine again? ♫

728
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:27,440
♫ Shining so I can see the way, shining so I can find you ♫

729
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,440
