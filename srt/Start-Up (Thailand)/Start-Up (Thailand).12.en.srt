[Start-Up]

2
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:52,229
Samkorn Thai Tech is the winner.
[Previously]

3
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,135
What's so great about Samkorn Thai Tech?

4
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:56,060
Why are they getting offered 90 million?

5
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,433
Isn't it strange?

6
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,722
Mom is living with Grandma now.

7
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:00,936
How come?

8
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,451
I should ask you, how come Mom stays with me?

9
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:06,594
Let's forgive her, child.

10
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:10,159
Samkorn Thai Tech is signing an acquisition deal with Good Goal today.

11
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,230
Acquisition deal?

12
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,978
Hold up. If everything's fine, why stop them?

13
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:16,961
I am afraid that they are not acquiring your company for its value.

14
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,463
All they want is to recruit engineers.

15
00:01:18,463 --> 00:01:20,097
The moment the contract is signed,

16
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:22,877
your team will be disbanded.

17
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,939
Mother, should it look like this?

18
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,050
It's a bit too runny. Add more flour.

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,820
Grandma, have you taken your morning medicine yet?

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,359
Not yet.

21
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,840
- Not yet.
- Oh!

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,719
Mom, I got it ready for you.

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,070
Grandma, why don't you eat on time?

24
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,940
The doctor will get upset.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,139
And if I'm not here, what will you do?

26
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:52,219
Oh… well.

27
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,540
Should I not go to the US then?

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,499
Dream, don't worry about Grandma.

29
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:01,059
I'll take good care of her.

30
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:04,180
This medicine is for after meals to delay Parkinson's symptoms,

31
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,863
and these vitamins are for before meals to nourish the brain.

32
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:09,700
No, it's the other way around.

33
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,079
Can you rely on her?

34
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,939
So, when are you going to the US?

35
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,000
They haven't confirmed yet.

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,252
I should set up Angie for you.

37
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:29,163
Here we go…

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,020
I'll create a system with Angie to remind you to take your medicine.

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,199
Because I don't trust Mom.

40
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,760
Agreed.

41
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,980
Then I don't have to.

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,059
If you need to take your morning medicine, just say,

43
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:50,460
"Angie, morning medicine," and it will remind you of your morning medicine.

44
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,963
You won't mix them up, right?

45
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,120
How is the job recruitment going?

46
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,659
The announcement email has been sent out.

47
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,759
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

48
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:11,810
You look happy.

49
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,300
- Do I?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,379
I'm going to America.

51
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,480
You won't have a thorn in your eyes.

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,700
You must feel a bit lonely.

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Probably.

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,580
Congratulations.

55
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,000
I heard Good Goal acquired your company for a very good price.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,116
Thank you very much.

57
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,590
Are you not congratulating me?

58
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,900
I'll let you go first,

59
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,963
then I'll congratulate you from my heart.

60
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,843
Ms. Alice, may I be excused?

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,023
Are you jealous?

62
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,180
I'm more worried.

63
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,499
I want to warn you with good intentions.

64
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:02,543
I don't want you to make another wrong decision.

65
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,960
You want to insist that I made the wrong decision.

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,039
Why?

67
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,379
Do you think you won with your choice?

68
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:17,856
Do you think I'm still bothered by what happened 15 years ago?

69
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:19,319
Who knows?

70
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,739
You even stole my fond memories from that time.

71
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:26,620
Just stop bothering me about what happened 15 ages ago.

72
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,620
One day you'll understand that I meant well.

73
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,220
Good morning, ladies.

74
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,519
- Alice.
- Hi.

75
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,720
- Ms. Pafun.
- Yes.

76
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,339
Do you have something to talk about with Ms. Alice?

77
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:44,299
No, there is nothing important.

78
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,643
Mr. Mark, what's the matter?

79
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,476
Well, Mr. Ji,

80
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:03,296
Samkorn Thai Tech is in trouble.

81
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,740
What's the matter?

82
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:10,720
Well, Mark is going to dismiss Pafun and Yaya.

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,443
He's only taking just the three developers to Silicon Valley.

84
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:25,579
Hey, where are you going?

85
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,035
[Episode 12: Acqhire]

86
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,120
You said you'd take the whole team.

87
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,260
This is fraud.

88
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,779
Listen guys, I am sorry.

89
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:39,020
I tried to convince the head office,

90
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,160
but I don't have the authority to make this decision.

91
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,140
If you look at the contract you signed,

92
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,380
Good Goal hasn't broken any terms at all.

93
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,260
You're cheating!

94
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,256
Everything is written in the contract!

95
00:05:54,859 --> 00:06:00,160
But Yaya and Pafun played important roles in developing True Angel.

96
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,076
Regarding True Angel,

97
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:07,210
the head office decided it doesn't need any further updates.

98
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,360
No wonder, on Demo Day, you only asked about technology.

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,720
You didn't ask about our vision or services at all.

100
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,852
I'm asking honestly,

101
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:26,210
you never wanted to do True Angel from the beginning, did you?

102
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,940
But we acquired your business at a very high price.

103
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,859
It's more than fair.

104
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:46,800
Plus, you'll get experience working with us for three years.

105
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,983
Then I'm canceling the contract.

106
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,179
You've signed the contract.

107
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,099
So take your 90 million back.

108
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:58,820
According to the contract, if you break the contract,

109
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,439
you must pay a penalty double the takeover price.

110
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,488
Double?

111
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:06,388
That is…

112
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:08,436
180 million?

113
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,876
Yes, Samkorn Thai Tech has been acquired.

114
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:26,160
So it's just like I thought.

115
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,670
Yes, only the developers are going to Silicon Valley.

116
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,510
Right after the takeover, they are disbanded.

117
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,710
Do you think this is funny?

118
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,900
Let's hire a freelance developer

119
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,439
and a strategic planner.

120
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,219
Yes.

121
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,933
Bank,

122
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:13,079
you said Mr. Ji was talking bullshit.

123
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,050
Now look at what happened. Everything he said was right.

124
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,199
What?

125
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,403
Mr. Ji tried to stop us?

126
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,019
Yes,

127
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,980
Mr. Ji warned us.

128
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,759
Then, why didn't you tell me?

129
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:40,779
I thought…

130
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:45,996
Mr. Ji just didn't want you to go to the US with Dream.

131
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,079
Bank,

132
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,300
Mr. Ji is our company's mentor!

133
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,483
He might be a good mentor for you,

134
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,290
but not for us.

135
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,940
He keeps nitpicking us,

136
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,319
keeps interrupting us in everything.

137
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,820
All he does is put us down.

138
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:32,023
I was giving my opinion as an investor.

139
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,083
If it sounded like nitpicking, it's a shame.

140
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:40,059
Telling the hard truth you don't want to hear,

141
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,223
that's my job.

142
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,303
So please tell us, then.

143
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,459
What should we do now?

144
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,896
Be as blunt as you need to be.

145
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:11,696
I need to know.

146
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,520
All right.

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,819
Number one:

148
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,419
You're still inexperienced in business.

149
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:29,279
That's why you didn't review the contract or consider the implications for the company.

150
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,440
Number two:

151
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,940
You all made decisions without consulting me first.

152
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,803
Even when I tried to stop you,

153
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,830
you didn't listen.

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,160
Number three:

155
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,219
You might have been blinded by the 90 million figure.

156
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:52,815
But Good Goal didn't pay because of True Angel,

157
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:57,156
they paid for personnel reasons.

158
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,779
As a result,

159
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,363
two of you were fired.

160
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,620
A CEO should have seen this coming.

161
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,439
It was my fault.

162
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:50,220
No, it was my fault. I'm the CEO.

164
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,323
I should have been more careful.

165
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,416
I'm sorry, everyone.

166
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,203
So what can we do?

167
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,620
Nothing.

168
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,996
There's no point in blaming each other

169
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:21,290
since the contract's been signed.

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,120
Just accept it...

171
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,143
and learn from this.

172
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,270
Are you happy hurting us like this?

173
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,879
If you can't handle this, just go back to your old place.

174
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:48,930
If this is too much for you,

175
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:51,963
maybe you shouldn't be here.

176
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:58,459
You're going to work for a global company.

177
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,359
Aren't you happy?

178
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:43,683
I'm not going anywhere.

179
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,956
I want to stay here

180
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:49,120
and continue working on True Angel.

181
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,650
I want to perfect it as best as I can.

182
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,986
Just accept it.

183
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:59,905
Even if this hadn't happened, it wouldn't have lasted long.

184
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:02,836
Why keep something that's not making money?

185
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,560
Because Grandma needs it.

186
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,403
Grandma has Parkinson's disease.

187
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,156
Grandma didn't want you to worry, so she didn't tell you.

[Grandma's Pancake Rolls]

189
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,799
W-W-Wait a minute.

190
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,208
Mom!

191
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,140
S-S-Sorry..

192
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,100
Mom, it's okay. I'll take care of it. Let me clean it up.

193
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
I'm sorry.

194
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,499
That's all right.

195
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,540
Good boy, what brings you here?

196
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,320
What happened to your face?

197
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Why do you look like this?

198
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,159
Why is this like this? Who did that?

199
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,382
I had a little fight.

200
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,080
What… What happened between you guys?

201
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,320
I…

202
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,340
It was my fault.

203
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:15,119
That's not true. You're a good boy.

204
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,499
Grandma, can you please stop calling me "good boy"?

205
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,340
I'm not a good boy.

206
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,776
I'm not a good person either.

207
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,419
I only hurt other people.

208
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:32,060
I pretend that I'm smart. That I know everything.

209
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,959
In fact, I'm just an idiot.

210
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,960
I'm stupid.

211
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,136
I know nothing at all.

212
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,900
I know nothing at all, Grandma.

213
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:53,481
I know nothing at all, Grandma.

214
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:56,890
It's okay.

215
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,920
It's okay. It's okay.

216
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,323
I'm sorry.

217
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:06,739
It's okay.

218
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:08,956
I'm sorry.

219
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:16,516
I'm sorry, Grandma.

220
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,576
I'm sorry, Grandma.

221
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:42,016
You haven't gone home yet?

222
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,299
Yes.

223
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,536
I'm thinking about the contract.

224
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,716
I think there must be a way

225
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,570
to cancel the contract without having to pay such a penalty.

226
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,176
We could file a lawsuit,

227
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,089
but winning would be difficult.

228
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,496
Why? Silicon Valley has been your dream, hasn't it?

229
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,340
If we go, I want us all to go together.

230
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,079
How can I leave the rest behind?

231
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,800
Why do you sound like you don't want to file a lawsuit?

232
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,099
No,

233
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,459
it's just that I've been sued before.

234
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:37,179
That's why I'm here now.

235
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:40,286
Lawsuits are exhausting,

236
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:44,100
draining both money and time.

237
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,253
And winning isn't guaranteed.

238
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:54,790
I feel sorry for Korn.

239
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,580
Tomorrow's his birthday.

240
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,039
Why do these things always happen at the worst times?

241
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,500
Mr. Ji!

242
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,200
What are you doing here?

243
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:27,000
I just visited Grandma at the shop and dropped her off here.

244
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And what happened to your face?

245
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
I fell.

246
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,700
It doesn't look like it.

247
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,700
I'm sorry if I spoke too harshly.

248
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,000
It's okay. I understand.

249
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,800
You had to say it.

250
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,000
Then, excuse me.

251
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
Sure.

252
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,000
Mr. Ji,

253
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,700
I need your advice.

254
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,900
Do you have time?

255
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,800
What should I do about the Good Goal issue?

256
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:07,019
Mr. Ji, please be honest.

257
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:09,619
Don't worry about hurting my feelings.

258
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,200
I've never been mad at or offended by you

259
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,700
when you spoke harshly or honestly to me.

260
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,100
I'm actually grateful for it.

261
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
Never?

262
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,000
Maybe a little sometimes,

263
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,500
like a couple of times.

264
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
You're really tough.

265
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,400
Yes, I'm very tough.

266
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:51,600
So just say it. I'm all ears.

267
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,500
If you're thinking of suing Good Goal,

268
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I don't think you stand a chance.

269
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,600
Everything in the contract is clearly stated.

270
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,100
So what should I do now?

271
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,100
If you know you can't win, then raise the white flag and join them.

272
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,300
It's better than making enemies.

273
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,200
Even though I'm in the Sandbox,

274
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,200
even a small mistake in my decisions hurts a lot.

275
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,400
When you really fall,

276
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,000
even if there's sand, it can still hurt.

277
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,200
You always get straight to the point.

278
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,300
But let me be frank about Good Goal's contract.

279
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,900
Korn and his friends aren't at any disadvantage.

280
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,700
It's actually good for them.

281
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,600
If they throw it away,

282
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,800
it's a shame.

283
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,500
But I believe that Korn will never leave everyone behind.

284
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,800
Yes,

285
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,300
I thought he'd never leave you.

286
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,700
Happy birthday to you.

287
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,000
Happy birthday to you.

288
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,300
Happy Birthday, Korn! I wish you lots of happiness.

289
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
I've reserved a restaurant to celebrate.

290
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,100
See you this evening.

291
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,900
I've already made an appointment with Dream and sent you the location.

292
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,900
Check it out and dress up!

293
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,100
Don't miss it.

294
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,000
Bye.

295
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,100
Are they still in the mood for a party?

296
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,600
We've changed our minds. We're not coming, Korn.

297
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,900
So you and Dream can spend time together.

298
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,200
Good luck.

299
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,300
I hope you get a positive answer from Dream as you hoped.

300
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,900
Where are the others?

301
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,300
They stood us up on purpose.

302
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,100
They want the two of us to celebrate.

303
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,780
Oh, this.

304
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
I stumbled and fell.

305
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,100
Did you have a fight with Mr. Ji?

306
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,600
There was a misunderstanding,

307
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,500
but it's been cleared up.

308
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,100
The restaurant is nice.

309
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Happy birthday, Korn.

310
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,200
May you be very happy.

311
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,000
Thank you.

312
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,900
Dream, don't worry about the company.

313
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,100
I did some research about acqhire yesterday.

314
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,900
There've been many cases similar to ours.

315
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,400
In one case, they used the media to fight and they won.

316
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,100
Korn, today is your birthday.

317
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,600
Let's not talk about work. Okay?

318
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,500
I want to know when you found out that you were good at coding.

319
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,400
Well, I think I was about 13.

320
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,700
13?

321
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,100
That's very young.

322
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,800
Coding is a language I'm most comfortable with.

323
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,100
So algorithms were easier for me.

324
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,900
[Algorithm: Sequences or steps, and conditions in data processing]

325
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,300
Do you know reporters?

326
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,100
Maybe they could help us.

327
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,800
What are the chances of being born a genius like you?

328
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,800
And the chances that such a genius

329
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,400
is recognized by someone as competent as Mark?

330
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,900
One in ten million?

331
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,900
Most geniuses are never discovered.

332
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,400
You were one of them until recently.

333
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:59,300
The odds of Mark discovering you are harder than winning the lottery.

334
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,000
If you don't go, it would be a shame.

335
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,100
That's enough, Dream.

336
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm not going anywhere.

337
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
Korn,

338
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,200
I really want you to go.

339
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
If it were you,

340
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,900
would you give up the team?

341
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I can't do it.

342
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,600
Actually, I didn't want to go from the beginning.

343
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,300
I'm worried about Grandma.

344
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,600
I don't want to leave her with my mother.

345
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,300
One more thing,

346
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,900
I've thought about it a lot.

347
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,800
I still don't feel good about you

348
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,400
lying to me about Korn in the letters.

349
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:09,538
Especially if we go to the US together,

350
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:12,800
it would be very uncomfortable.

351
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:29,847
Most importantly,

352
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,540
I like the Korn in the letters.

353
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,153
I don't like you.

and your dream is not mine.

360

We must live in reality,

361
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:19,673
not a dream.

362
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:53,539
Dream, you're lying to me because you want me to move on. Right?

363
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,730
Don't be full of yourself.

364
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,419

Thanks a lot, Mr. Ji, for your assistance.

Why does Dream have to be so harsh?

381
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,769
Such a lovely face shouldn't harbor such cruelty.

382
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,439

00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,280
Yes.

You've got a point.

394
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,723
But my drive to go isn't solely about money.

00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,399
Can you actually care about something other than money?

Easy, there.

398
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,540
I want to go because I need to prove myself.

399
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,040
I can't have Mr. Ji remembering us as failures.

400
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,579
I've seen countless startups in my time.

401
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:31,680
I've funded only thirty, and out of those,

402
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,900
only four didn't receive additional funding later on.

403
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,979
I won't risk tarnishing my record.

404
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:39,260
Therefore, I won't be funding your business.

405
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:44,719

407
00:36:56,503 --> 00:37:00,519
Here's my take. If we stay and fight the case here,

408
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,219
odds are we'll end up on the losing side.

409
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,860
But if we head there, hold our ground for three years,

410
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,440
we could return as champions.

He shared your story with me.

but you were scared.

454
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,199
So, he put sand underneath to cushion any falls.

00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,000
I want to be by your side, taking care of you.

546
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,500
I want to be the first person to come to your mind.

547
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,400
I don't know what's wrong with the computer.

548
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,700
I understand. But can you reach the team leader who removed the ransomware?

549
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,100
Double it? 20 million?

550
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,300
Just pay the ransom.

551
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,300
As someone who came first,

552
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,000
I recommend you go back.

553
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,670
♫ It’s like the stars have been snuffed out ♫

554
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:17,580
♫ It’s not the same, they’re not shining enough for me to see the way ♫

555
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:22,500
♫ The fading sky ends up in darkness ♫

556
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:27,390
♫ There’s no hand for me to hold from someone who was once beside me ♫

557
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:32,230
♫ I’m going in circles in the same place ♫

558
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:37,030
♫ Where we used to be before you abandoned me ♫

559
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:42,050
♫ However much I run, whatever I do ♫

560
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:47,580
♫ I find only exhaustion ♫

561
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,250
♫ When I close my eyes, I still see your image ♫

562
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:57,360
♫ Whichever way I look, I still see you ♫

563
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:04,310
♫ I still don’t know how to endure this, I still don’t know ♫

564
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:09,450
♫ When will the stars in the sky return and shine again? ♫

565
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:14,350
♫ Shining so I can see the way, shining so I can find you ♫
