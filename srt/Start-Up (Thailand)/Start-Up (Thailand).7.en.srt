Over my dead body!

00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,700
I'm leaving. Just change the name to Pafun Tech!

5
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,400
If you ever need advice or assistance,

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,100
I'm here for you.

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
Korn is definitely a good person, Bank.

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,300
In conclusion, you are ignoring my opinion.

9
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,600
But as the CEO, I really needed to make this decision.

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,700
Is Grandma home?

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,200
I'd like to say hello to her.

[Episode 7: Burn Rate]

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
- Grandma!
- Yes?

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,200
Guess, who's joining me today?

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Who could that be?

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,900
Hi there, Grandma.

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,800
Hello.

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,800
Auntie, come on. I'm in a hurry.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,500
Please, hurry up. I'm really in a rush.

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,100
Just a moment.

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Here, let me give you a hand.

23
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,719
Thank you.

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,700
Would you like me to call a taxi for you?

25
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,300
Oh, it's okay. I'm feeling better now.

26
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,800
Please sit down first. Make yourself at home.

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,700
You haven't seen each other over for ten years.

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,600
Do you still remember my grandmother?

29
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,300
Grandma?

30
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,600
Do you still remember Korn? It's Korn.

31
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:37,786
Well.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,500
Well.

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,100
I'll tell Dream the truth about the letters.

34
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,900
Why all of a sudden?

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Because I want to fix bugs before they happen.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,800
No. Trust me. It will all go downhill.

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Your relationship with Dream and the company.

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,300
But I'm sure that

39
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,700
if I tell Dream the truth, she will understand.

40
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,300
What makes you so sure?

41
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,600
Then why are you so confident that telling the truth will ruin everything?

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,800
Because Dream cares and has such strong feelings for Korn in the letter.

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,300
Yes! We'll see about that.

44
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,200
Well.

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,200
Can't you two recognize each other?

46
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Right. Well, Grandma, it's been quite a while since we last met.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,900
Yeah, it's been ages. You've grown up so much.

48
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,800
Look at you.

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,100
You're looking great.

50
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Thanks.

51
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,500
Grandma, I bought something for you.

52
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,600
Some vitamins.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,500
Thank you, but it's not necessary.

54
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,100
I'm just glad you came.

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,100
Anyway, thank you very much.

56
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,900
Yes.

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,200
I'll go and check on it. You two can catch up. Make yourself at home.

58
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,100
Mr. Ji, what brings you here?

59
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,300
Is Korn here?

60
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,200
Yes.

61
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Please, don't tell Dream about my illness.

62
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,500
Why?

63
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,100
I don't want to see her cry or worry about me,

64
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:01,400
or give me that pitiful look like you're doing right now.

65
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,100
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,300
If I take good care of myself, everything will be fine.

67
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,100
Please, keep it a secret. Don't tell Ji either.

68
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,700
If Ji finds out, he'll be shocked and blame himself.

69
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,600
He'll make a big fuss about repaying me.

70
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,200
Okay.

71
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,800
So, how do you know my house?

72
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,400
Korn told me.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,600
I have urgent business to discuss with Korn,

74
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,100
so I stopped by here. May I disturb you?

75
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,600
Oh, no problem at all. Of course, you're welcome.

76
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
- Thanks.
- Please.

77
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
- This way.
- Yes.

78
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Come in.

79
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,500
Mr. Ji, what brings you here?

80
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,700
I called you. Have you forgotten?

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,900
Oh! Right, I forgot.

82
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,800
Grandma, this is Mr. Jiraphat, my mentor

83
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,600
and consultant for my company.

84
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
And he is very close to Korn as well.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,300
Mr. Ji has helped our company too.

86
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,200
Mr. Ji, this is my grandma.

87
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,400
Hello, Grandma.

88
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,700
Hello, Mr. Ji, what?

89
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,400
Jiraphat.

90
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,000
I mean, I just happen to have an urgent matter that I need to discuss with Korn.

91
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
So…

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,500
About that, I'll take your advice.

93
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,100
If you have nothing else, just leave.

94
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Okay.

95
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Are you finished yet? Shall we go back together?

96
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,200
Mr. Ji, please stay for dinner.

97
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Mr. Ji must have a plan.

98
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,500
Nope. I'd like to stay for dinner.

99
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,600
Of course.

100
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,000
Stay for dinner. There's a lot of food. Just a moment.

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,500
My Grandma likes to cook. Mr. Ji, please make yourself at home.

102
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,900
Thanks.

103
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,539
Grandma, I'll help you.

104
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,887
Okay.

105
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,700
Mr. Ji, take a seat. Do you want something to drink or a snack? I'll go and get it for you.

106
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,600
That's okay. I think I'd better go and help those two.

107
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,300
Grandma, I'll help you.

108
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,100
Yes.

109
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh my gosh, sons. Are those too many?

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,600
Onions are healthy.

111
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,500
That's right, Grandma.

112
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,683
I think you guys should wait outside.

113
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,400
If you let Korn peel them like that,

114
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,900
we'll never get to eat Son-in-Law's eggs.

115
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,900
Come on, you two. Get out.

116
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,300
Here they are, the Son-in-law's eggs.

117
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,100
Help yourselves.

118
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,900
- It's lively today, isn't it? Grandma.
- You bet.

119
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,000
Dream, make sure to eat plenty of fish and—

120
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,200
And I will become smart, right?

121
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
You think I'm dumb?

122
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No, I mean fish is good for your health.

123
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,700
The protein in fish helps build and repair body tissues.

124
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,600
Plus, the fat in fish contains DHA and EPA,

125
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,900
which supports brain function and will help us work more effectively.

126
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,200
Okay, then we both should share

127
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,100
so that we'll have enough energy to work.

128
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:32,300
Some say that fish can also prevent heart disease.

129
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,700
Thank you.

130
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,200
Be careful with your bones. You always get them stuck in your throat.

131
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,600
Dream always seems to get fishbones stuck in her throat.

132
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,700
That's true. It happens to everyone.

133
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:12,200
I've heard a lot about you. You're always helping Dream, right?

134
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
Yes.

135
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,700
Grandma, Mr. Ji wasn't actually helping me.

136
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,100
He was helping Korn. We work together,

137
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
so Mr. Ji ended up helping me too.

138
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,000
That's not true.

139
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,900
I'm not kind and I don't have time to help anyone.

140
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,300
So why did you help me?

141
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,100
It's just because…

142
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,400
Because…

143
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,143
I just wanted to help you… that's all.

144
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Then, you should eat a lot today.

145
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,500
Consider it a repayment.

146
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,800
Yep.

147
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,400
Yummy.

148
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,100
Go home safely.

149
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I've answered your questions.

150
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,600
Have you checked your email yet?

151
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
No.

152
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,900
Hey, you answered all 400 messages?

153
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,300
It's 461 in total.

154
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,000
That's awesome, Mr. Ji. Thank you very much.

155
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
I'll quickly go back up and read them.

156
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,600
And I promise that I will be a good CEO.

157
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,200
All right.

158
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,600
Dream, the two of us share a total of 71%.

159
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,200
We are one team. We won't leave each other.

160
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:10,200
Don't worry. I want you to trust me and also trust yourself.

161
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,400
Okay, I trust you.

162
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,300
Just go. It's getting late.

163
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Mr. Ji, drive carefully.

164
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,500
Yeah.

165
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,300
Goodnight!

166
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,900
You said you were going to tell the truth.

167
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,000
So why did you follow me?

168
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,400
Or do you like Dream?

169
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,600
Grandma, how do you find Korn? Has his face changed from when he was a child?

170
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,600
Well, a little bit.

171
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Really?

172
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,400
So, which Korn do you like better?

173
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,800
Korn, the letter writer, or the Korn right now?

174
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:36,300
Korn, who wrote the letter, and the current Korn are the same person.

175
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,700
That's a strange question.

176
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:45,600
As time passes, people grow and their character may change.

177
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,900
I want to know if you hadn't been penpals with Korn initially,

178
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,300
would he meet your picky standards?

179
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,000
Are you implying that I'm picky? I'm not.

180
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I just want the best guy.

181
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,900

Ai-oon, what is jealousy?

201
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,000
Jealousy refers to the feeling you get when you think the person you love,

202

Right. If you give up such a stable career as being a doctor,

there must be some important reasons. Right?

00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,000
- You go.
- Me?

357
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,741
Go, quickly.

358
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:34,170
Okay, here's my idea. It'll certainly disrupt the agricultural industry.

359
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,319
And it is…

360
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,219
AI Intelligent Scarecrow.

361
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:42,640
- That's right, friend.
- Enough.

362
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,919
You guys must be wondering how a scarecrow can be an intelligent solution?

363
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,240
My scarecrow will have sensors that can detect crows

364
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,828
and animals of all kinds anywhere.

365
00:32:53,828 --> 00:32:58,996
Not only that, it can also eliminate them completely.

366
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,019
If it doesn't die, it'll be shot again.

367
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:06,300
It's dead.

368
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,300
Crazy.

369
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,820
You're retarded.

370
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,580
Doesn't it work?

371
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,880
No!

372
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,320
What?

373
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,800
How amazing would it be if we had a device that could detect people susceptible to epidemics?

374
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,240
I present to you: "Germ scanning glasses".

375
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,440
Just put on the glasses, and you'll be able to see the temperature

376
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,100
and serious diseases in the human body.

377
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,540
It's like a moving X-ray machine.

378
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,563
[Clear]
[Scanning]

379
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:50,599
She has a serious illness. Get lost, everyone.
[Danger]

380
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,599
- Really?
- Yes!

381
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,499
Is this funny to you?

382
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,443
You're crazy just like me. Sit down, friend.

383
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:02,619
Pack your glasses. You wearing them looks annoying. Put them in your bag.

384
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:06,520
And what about you? Do you have suggestions?

385
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:11,412
I want to make a fortunetelling app.

386
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:20,539
Just think how great it would be if you could predict the future accurately.

387
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:25,956
Let's do this. Because I want to know the future of the two of us.

388
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:27,400
We can't let you have a chance.

389
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,239
A little bit, please.

390
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,281
It sounds appealing to the masses.

391
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:32,929
But is it not too superstitious?

392
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:36,619
It's like we're making a living off of people's beliefs.

393
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:39,180
You're trying to be cool again.

394
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:45,080
And what about Korn? What's your idea?

395
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:00,800
Hey, Alice. Darling.

396
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,239
You're coming to the Sandbox quite often.

397
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,519
I'm looking for someone to work on the project that you left behind.

398
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,560
If that's the case, you could find anyone to do it.

399
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,639
Let me guess.

400
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,639
You want to create an image of yourself as

401
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:25,939
an investor who gives opportunities to start-ups. Right?

402
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:28,913
You really know me.

403
00:35:28,913 --> 00:35:36,578
If you change your mind, just write a proposal. I'll help you.

404
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:39,619
If you want to help me, you can watch quietly.

405
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:42,880
Don't put your fingers in my business.

406
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,900
Alice, Dad just wants to help.

407
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,039
You know that people are after this project like a pack of dogs.

408
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:55,123
Let those dogs do it, then.

409
00:35:55,123 --> 00:36:02,039
And besides, I don't want to be a dog wagging its tail for you again.

410
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,060
Excuse me.

411
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:06,960
Go in.

412
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,320
Wait, my skills aren't there yet. Can you take a look at the one on the right?

413
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,479
You are stunned, right?

414
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:25,243
I thought he would leave after the hackathon.

415
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,780
But he's settled down here, damn it.

416
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,919
I think there must be something.

417
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:37,100
Yes? My boss is competent. So I'll continue to work with her.

418
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,819
The first project will reap a profit of 15 million.

419
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:45,939
Yes, that's right. Let's talk later. See you.

420
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
15 million!!

421
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,440
Guys, Alice's team got the project from The Best Department Store.

422
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,619
- The Best Department Store?
- Yes!

423
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:00,473
Yes, it is a project reducing security guards using AI.

424
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:03,573
They've got paid 15 million baht.

425
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:05,196
15 million.

426
00:37:05,196 --> 00:37:07,139
Using AI?

427
00:37:08,363 --> 00:37:10,063
That's interesting.

428
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:13,439
Ms. Alice is really talented.

429
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,159
Talented? Maybe she used connections.

430
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,180
I heard that the CEO of The Best Department Store is

431
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,679
a close friend of Alice's father.

432
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,499
- Is it true?
- Yes. I heard that.

433
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:31,281
It's not fair at all.

434
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:33,920
Really, really unfair.

435
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:41,239
Bill Gates once said "Life isn't fair. Get used to it."

436
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,176
You're so cool, friend. Let's toast.

437
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,063
I heard that you landed a project with the Best Department Store. Congratulations!

438
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:07,670
You sound fake. If you don't want to say it, just don't say it.

439
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,760
Because your success is fake.

440
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,679
How is it fake?

441
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,400
You used your connections to get the project. Is it not fake?

442
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,139
Do you think I used my father's connections?

443
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,019
Didn't you?

444
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,659
His company also has an AI project.

445
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,059
If I really wanted to use his connections,

446
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,760
why not just take that project?

447
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,139
Why do I have to run around like this?

448
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:38,629
So how did you get that job?

449
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,190
Once the Hackathon competition was over,

450
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,480
I went to see the manager of the department store who was a committee member.

451
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,139
I exchanged business cards with him and contacted him.

452
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:53,760
I didn't sit around and get emotional like you.

453
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,779
So, your dad didn't help you at all?

454
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:59,900
I know how to look for opportunities.

455
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,139
You also can but you are incompetent.

456
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:10,339
I'll tell you what. Just work and stop harassing others.

457
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:15,141
I was so kind enough to tell you about the AI project in Morning Group.

458
00:39:15,141 --> 00:39:17,821
If you are smart enough,

459
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:20,299
you should know what to do.

460
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:25,043
And why should I do the job you won't take?

461
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:28,896
It's money. And you want it, don't you?

462
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,736
Or will you let the opportunity slip away again?

463
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:46,873
Do you really want to do the Morning Group project?

464
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:51,140
But we already have our own business model.

465
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,799
That's right.

466
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:58,099
We'll postpone it. I want to try this project.

467
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:03,760
Think of it as making money to fund a business that we want to do, okay?

468
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,900
What if we take this project?

469
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,800
How much will we get?

470
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,300
If we can offer them a solution, we will get 1,500,000 baht.

471
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,100
If it can be implemented,

472
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,500
they will give us 9 million.

473
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,800
And if we manage to carry out all the work,

474
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,600
we'll get 30 million or more.

475
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,600
30 million? That's a lot of money.

476
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,000
We can hold out for 3 years.

477
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,300
- 3 years?
- Yeah.

478
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,800
That's good. Then we don't have to run around trying to secure funding.

479
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,900
So what do you guys think?

480
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,300
I think it's worth it.

481
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,800
If everyone is okay, I am okay.

482
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,900
If so, then go ahead.

483
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,600
- Let's go.
- Go ahead.

484
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,400
Okay.

485
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
For 3 years.

486
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,000
3 years.

487
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,900
I'm sorry.

488
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
What for?

489
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The project you want to do.

490
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:27,400
I really want to do it, but it costs a lot.

491
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,300
And our company isn't ready yet.

492
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,200
It's okay. I'm just worried about you.

493
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,100
About me? For what?

494
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,200
Well, your mother married Mr. Buntoon.

495
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,900
I think you don't want to get involved with him.

496
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,800
Yes, I really hate him.

497
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,100
So why?

498
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,800
Well, I'm the CEO of this company.

499
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,500
Whatever I can do for the company,

500
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,800
I must do. I shouldn't take things personally.

501
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,200
It's about work, right?

502
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,000
And Grandma once told me.

503
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,100
If we cut everyone out of our lives,

504
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,000
we won't have anyone left.

505
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,000
Then you don't have to worry.

506
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,300
Even if you cut everyone else,

507
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,100
I will be the last one in your life.

508
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:13,000
Thank you. You're still the same as 15 years ago.

509
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,800
No one understands me better than you.

510
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:29,200
Honestly, I think I've changed a lot.

511
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,200
And I don't remember what happened 15 years ago.

512
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,100
I want you to forget about 15 years ago.

513
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,200
Why?

514
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,300
Because I want you to look at me who is in front of you.

515
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,800
Now rather than someone in the past,

516
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,800
let the past be the past.

517
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,200
Do you want a new one?

518
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,300
Oh my gosh, it's all messed up.

519
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,700
I've heard that the Alice Company landed The Best's AI project.

520
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,700
Yes, she's brilliant.

521
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,200
She doesn't need a mentor.

522
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,200
Alice knows what to do.

523
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,000
But I don't think she knows why she's doing it.

524
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,200
For the money, of course. What other reason could there be?

525
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,900
True. It's a pretty straightforward reason.

526
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,600
But this girl will be different.

527
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,300
She would find other reasons, not money.

528
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,800
Different reasons? Like what?

529
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,100
Ms. Lilawadee, all three cards have been suspended.

530
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,500
Wait a moment.

531
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,100
Yes, Madam.

532
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,400
[Buntoon]

533
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,800
He suspended my cards and dared to call.

534
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,800
[Alice]

535
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,900
Hello.

536
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,100
Mom, haven't you come home yet?

537
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,300
Dad sent a message asking when you would come home.

538
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,600
You haven't returned either. Why are you telling me to go back?

539
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:58,200
It's not the same. I'm working, but you are using his money.

540
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,300
I'm your mother.

541
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,900
Because you're my mother.

542
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,500
If you want to take pride or have freedom, just stop using his money first

543
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,600
and go find work.

544
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,600
Mr. Ji.

545
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,300
Are you avoiding me?

546
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,400
No.

547
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,900
You didn't answer my calls and haven't read my messages.

548
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,400
So, I'm waiting for you in front of your office.

549
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,000
I mean, I've been busy lately.

550
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,200
Then, please spare me a minute.

551
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,100
Well, we submitted a proposal to Morning Group.

552
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,900
For an organizational downsizing using AI,

553
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,800
I'm here to let you know in case you have any suggestions.

554
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,700
I sent all the information to your email.

555
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,600
Please read it.

556
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,400
Okay. So, I'll take a look at it.

557
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,100
Yes. Mr. Ji?

558
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,500
I saw that you seem busy these days.

559
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,900
You probably work hard, right?

560
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,300
So I bought some vitamins.

561
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:39,700
So why did you have to buy it for me? Why do you care about me?

562
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,200
I just want to give it to you.

563
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,900
But I don't want it.

564
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,400
If you force unwanted help on others, you're 'nosy' and it makes others uncomfortable.

565
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,200
Don't you understand?

566
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,200
Sorry,

567
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,300
I won't do this again.

568
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,900
No. You're the one who's nosy. You were nice to me first.

569
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,400
When you helped me, you never asked me a single question. You've helped me more than I helped you.

570
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,900
If you can do it, why can't I?

571
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,200
Are you mad at me?

572
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:32,100
Yes! And from now on, I will keep being nosy like this until you get used to it.

573
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,700
What are you upset about, Dad?

574
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,500
Is she still not picking up?

575
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,000
No.

576
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,600
Or does she really want a divorce?

577
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,900
She doesn't dare.

578
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,200
She signed the prenup, she won't get anything...

579
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,900
if she leaves my golden cage.

580
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,900
So maybe she is drawing some attention.

581
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,600
Probably so, both mother and daughter.

582
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,800
They are annoying.

583
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,200
Not as tame as before.

584
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,500
How about work?

585
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,800
The tech manager told me that Samkorn Thai Tech Company

586
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,100
submitted a proposal for the downsizing project.

587
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,100
Pafun?

588
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,600
Yes, Alice's sister.

589
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,700
They want a meeting and a presentation.

590
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,000
And the proposal is pretty good, Dad.

591
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,500
When's the meeting?

592
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,200
Tomorrow.

593
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,500
We must make our enemies our friends.

594
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,900
Remember, we must make our enemies our friends.

595
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,800
Let's go.

596
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,800
Good morning.

597
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,400
Good morning. My name is Pafun.

598
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,500
I am the CEO of Samkorn Thai Tech Company. This is my business card.

599
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,800
I'm Korn. I'm the CTO.

600
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,900
Hey, are you Pafun, Alice's little sister?

601
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,500
Yes.

602
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,200
Then you are considered my sister, too.

603
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,500
Don't mind the formalities.

604
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,400
Yes.

605
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Tom. Bua. I saw you in the IG story. Why didn't you ask me?

606
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,400
Phakaphon.

607
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:06,900
Yes.

608
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,100
How about the Mornings Group project?

609
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,200
Any news?

610
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,300
Yes, I've got it.

611
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:18,000
As far as I see, the Morning Group task force

612
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,100
has already set up a developer's team.

613
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,100
Just as I thought.

614
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,800
Mr. Ji, they already have the Dev team.

615
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,400
Why would they hire Samkorn Thai Tech?

616
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,200
Probably for a part-time gig. Something they can outsource.

617
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Pardon? You will hire our company to collect images?

618
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,800
That's right.

619
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:45,100
For work like this, you can buy data or hire part-timers.

620
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,400
You don't need to hire us.

621
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,000
We are developers.

622
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yes.

623
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,300
We are here to propose an AI solution for downsizing projects,

624
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,400
not to collect data.

625
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,200
But the basic function of AI is collecting data for machine learning, isn't it?

626
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,800
Our Dev team will create a solution.

627
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,400
So why did you ask us to submit a proposal for a solution

628
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,200
instead of hiring people to collect data?

629
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,300
Hiring such part-time will cost too much.

630
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,000
Plus, they'd not know what we need.

631
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,400
You guys are more skilled and would save us money.

632
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,000
Just mull it over. I'm not that serious about it.

633
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,400
Dad wants to see you.

634
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,000
Go meet him in his room. He is a nice man. Just talk to him first.

635
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,100
Mr. Ji, isn't that too exploitative?

636
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,800
Who would accept such an offer?

637
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,300
A lot of startups would.

638
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,800
To get good references, they must include big companies' logos in their profile.

639
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,100
But this kind of offer is not fair at all.

640
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,900
Mr. Ji, will they accept the offer?

641
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
I have no idea.

642
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,700
[Morning Group]­

643
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,700
It's been a lot of work.

644
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,800
It may look like manual labor

645
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,400
but it'll be a good experience and opportunity for you.

646
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,570
So, that means our solution is not necessary for you.

647
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,600
Your solution? Why not? If it's a good idea, we should use it.

648
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:58,300
You promised to pay a budget of 1 million baht for a solution.

649
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,900
I just offered it for the marketing.

650
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,700
I checked your website and it is pretty bare.

651
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,700
You should put our logo on your main page.

652
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,300
"Morning Group's strategic partner."

653
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,400
That's worth a lot more than 1 million baht.

654
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,700
You're using us.

655
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,700
Don't use the word using. I'm helping your company.

656
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,500
I picked your company out of all the candidates.

657
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:44,300
It was for your mother who is my wife.

658
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,400
That's why I'm offering you my help.

659
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,000
I'm sorry, Dream, but we're not taking this job.

660
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,100
Korn!

661
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,800
I apologize but my patience reached its limit.

662
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,800
You don't have to pay attention to those people's words.

663
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,300
I thank you for being that angry for me.

664
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,300
Let's just forget about this project

665
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:03,300
and work on the project you presented the other day.

666
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,000
Which project?

667
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,600
Well, the service you told me the other day.

668
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,200
And what about Korn? What do you have?

669
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,200
I want to make an app that helps people.

670
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,700
Well, the other day I met an old lady.

671
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,600
She has Parkinson's disease, so I came up with this idea.

672
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,800
People suffering from Parkinson's disease live very difficult lives.

673
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,000
Most of them have balance problems and are prone to falling and accidents.

674
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:52,200
What if those people could get a warning sound when they are about to fall or are about to have an accident?

675
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,900
Imagine what it'd be like.

676
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,100
That's good.

677
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:03,000
But I think it's a bit too group-specific.

678
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,200
Then we add functions to cover the elderly as well.

679
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,400
Such as vision aid or something.

680
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:18,100
If we succeed, we can help many more people.

681
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,100
I think it works. Guys, just imagine that.

682
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,800
When I was shitting my pants,

683
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,700
my arms and legs were worn out.

684
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,400
No one came to help. I thought I was going to die.

685
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,800
Yes, exactly. It's great!

686
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,800
So let's go ahead. Let's do it!

687
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,000
Go ahead!

688
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,700
Come quick!

689
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,400
Go ahead!

690
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,700
When you told me your idea, I was excited.

691
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,100
And I really wanted to do it. I like this idea.

692
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,600
It's really cool and interesting.

693
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:04,500
But if we do this project, we can hold out no longer than 6 months.

694
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,200
That's true.

695
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:17,000
But if it will be 6 months that we're free to do anything we really want to do.

696
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,600
It'll be fun and very delightful, right?

697
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,600
But it's also very risky.

698
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,800
Just like I've told you.

699
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,800
How about sailing off without a map?

700
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,900
It would be fun.

701
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,600
If I had someone on that sailboat,

702
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:57,339
I would be willing to go even without a map.

703
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,400
Thanks.

704
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:31,000
And if you have to pick one, which Korn do you like better?

705
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,700
If I really have to pick one…

706
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,400
I would probably pick…

707
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,800
the one who wrote me the letters 15 years ago.

708
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,600
Korn 15 years ago?

709
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,100
Yes.

710
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,800
Because he was my first love.

711
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,200
He was a caring person

712
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,300
and he was the one who'd been supporting me.

713
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,760
And what about the Korn you know now?

714
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,300
The Korn I know now.

715
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,800
I'm still not used to him.

716
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,500
At times, he seems to be a stranger.

717
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,600
But for some reason,

718
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,800
he also makes me flutter

719
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,800
and have butterflies in my stomach.

720
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,400
Why are you asking that?

721
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,500
This is youth stuff.

­[Morning Group]

723
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,100
Yes, Dad.

724
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:27,200
Go and check the CCTV. And send the clip to the legal team.

725
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,800
Copy that.

726
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:41,600
Ms. Rose, actually Pafun and Alice are sisters.

727
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,200
What if we call the app True Angel?

728
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,300
True Angel and God Sepsin.

729
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,500
I won't agree. It's an intensive service technology but not lucrative.

730
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,600
How can a small startup like you achieve that?

731
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,500
What is it?

732
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,400
You have been accused of property damage by Morning Group Company.

733
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,900
When is your birthday?

734
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,000
It's May 7th.

735
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,420
Your birthday is the same day as Korn's?

736
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,810
♫ It’s like the stars have been snuffed out ♫

737
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:35,780
♫ It’s not the same, they’re not shining enough for me to see the way ♫

738
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:40,670
♫ The fading sky ends up in darkness ♫

739
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:45,610
♫ There’s no hand for me to hold from someone who was once beside me ♫

740
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:50,870
♫ I’m going in circles in the same place ♫

741
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:55,230
♫ Where we used to be before you abandoned me ♫

742
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:00,300
♫ However much I run, whatever I do ♫

743
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:05,730
♫ I find only exhaustion ♫

744
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:10,300
♫ When I close my eyes, I still see your image ♫

745
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:15,390
♫ Whichever way I look, I still see you ♫

746
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:22,500
♫ I still don’t know how to endure this, I still don’t know ♫

747
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:27,530
♫ When will the stars in the sky return and shine again? ♫

748
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:32,550
♫ Shining so I can see the way, shining so I can find you ♫
