We'll see about that.

Okay, now we'll begin the Hackathon. You're given 48 hours.

00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:58,855
I'm curious if Samkorn Thai Tech's technology

00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:01,555
can detect the edits made by Alice Company.

00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:03,055
Absolutely.

00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:39,530
Congratulations on getting in.

11
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,700
Thanks to you, I wanted to fight.

12
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,919
And did Dream ask anything about our lie?

13
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,660
I already answered it for you.

14
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,660
You did?

15
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,460
What did you tell her?

16
00:01:58,403 --> 00:02:03,596
Well, Korn, why did Mr. Ji help you lie?

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,339
I asked him to.

18
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:14,260
I mean I wanted to look good in your eyes.

19
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,440
I wanted to impress you.

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,980
So why did Mr. Ji agree to help you?

21
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,779
I mean… Mr.Ji and I are so close, practically like brothers.

22
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,699
And did Dream believe that?

23
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,539
Yeah, she did.

24
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:41,919
I said that you've done everything just to help me.

25
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,900
There isn't anything special.

26
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,819
Good job.

27
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,453
You look more confident. You don't stutter or look away anymore.

28
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:02,472
And you look angry.

29
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:05,581
I have the right to be now.

30
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:09,001
Because you entered Sandbox, you have a right to be angry. Right?

31
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:13,719
Yes, but now I'm not angry anymore.

32
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:17,940
Because I want Dream to believe that we are really close like brothers.

Congratulations, girl. Congratulations.

Good job. Congratulations.

Well, both of you.

Congratulations on getting into Sandbox.

I've got to say, it seemed like a breeze. I was expecting more of a challenge.

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:22,633
Nice, here's to hoping you thrive as CEO of your new startup. I hope you make it.

46

You underestimate me. I'm definitely going to make it.

Anyway, if you need anything, just give us a shout.

Hold on a moment, son.

66
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,959
You know, as a CEO, it's important to have a good briefcase.

It's probably just conflicting interests. Everyone wants to come out ahead.

111
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,480
But our company won't be like that, for sure.

112
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,560
Our teamwork is solid, and we genuinely care about each other. Right?

Absolutely.

I have to excuse myself.

Did you notice Mr. Ji seemed a bit off today?

140
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:54,320
Maybe he's feeling the pressure of mentoring this new generation in Sandbox.

I get it. VC as Angel.

142
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,480
It's like having a professor teach preschoolers the alphabet.

But Mr. Ji inspired me to step up and mentor this round myself.

­[Sandbox]

155
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:53,100
So, in essence, Sandbox functions as an accelerator.

156
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,720
They don't offer upfront capital, but instead provide facilities, mentorship,

157
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,059
and other support for a period of 6 months.

158
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,589
At the end of this period,

159
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,741
Sandbox will assess your progress to decide whether to invest.

160
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:07,900
Be careful. You'll fall.

161
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,867
That's the gist of it.

162
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:13,366
They'll consider investing in exchange for shares of your company.

163
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:18,459
This year, Sandbox secured funding from the government.

164
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:24,799
So, they're granting you 3 million baht as starting capital for your startup.

165
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,320
3 million baht?

166
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,220
Brilliant!

167
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,480
That's huge.

168
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,679
In any case, be prepared for due diligence for your status.

169
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,440
If everything looks good, you'll be paid.

170
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,261
Yes.

171
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,419

00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,519
What's this status?

173
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,600
What is the status?

174
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,664
I'm single.

175

Well, same status as me.

176

Is this a joke or are you really stupid?

177
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:59,676
Put your hand away.

178
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:06,499
Key, it means a company appraisal process is conducted before investment.

179
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:13,219
Does your company have any financial statements or shareholder percentages?

180
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:18,880
As if, they don't even know the term 'due diligence'.

181
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,000
The due diligence process will be performed by your mentor.

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,620
And who are our mentors?

183
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,480
I will introduce them to you.

184
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,519
The first one, Ms. Roslin, is the president of Sandbox

185
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,220
and SH Venture Capital.

186
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,320
The second is Mr. Mark who is from Good Goal America.

187
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,080
The 7th largest company in the world in terms of market cap.

188
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,820
Good Goal.

189
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:50,416
As for the third person, Mr. Buntoon is the Chairman of Morning Group.

190
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,455
And the fourth person, Mr. Jiraphat,

191
00:12:55,455 --> 00:13:00,220
the team leader, senior executive of SH Venture.

192
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,219
There are so many interesting people.

193
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:12,100
Oh, right?

194
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,219
Almost all of them are interesting.

195
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,440
Hello, Dad.

196
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,918
Hi, there.

197
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,530
Aren't you going to thank me?

198
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,240
For what?

199
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,879
For... helping you get in.

200
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,850
What help?

201
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,600
Please tell me.

202
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,750
That day, if I hadn't suggested the test, you would've not gotten in.

203
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,436
So, do you want me to return the favor?

204
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:06,559
What's so funny?

205
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,499
I knew you'd say something like this.

206
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:19,639
If I lost, you'd humiliate me by saying, "Serve you right for leaving me."

207
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:26,759
If I won, you'd brag and say, "See, you got in, all thanks to me."

208
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:35,239
I meant well. I made time to come here to be your mentor.

209
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,799
I appreciate that but if I chose you,

210
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,539
I wouldn't have left Morning Group in the first place. Excuse me.

211
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,648
Hello.

212
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:07,220
- Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

213
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,299
Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.

214
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:16,749
We meet finally.

215
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,515
The girl who inspired our Sandbox.

216
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,980
The little girl playing on the swing that Ms. Rose mentioned,

217
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,480
is Ms. Alice?

218
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,180
Yes.

219
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,898
Is that you?

220
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,840
Ms. Rose, do you know my late father?

221
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,219
I met him once 15 years ago.

222
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,960
Wait. If that's her father, then...

223
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,519
She has two fathers.

224
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:02,600
Your dad is the one who inspired this place.

225
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,019
Ready? Jump!

226
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:17,860
All good? Hang on tight. Let's go higher!

227
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,236
One, two, three.

228
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:36,888
Well, in that case, would you do me the honor of being my mentor?

229
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:45,121
With pleasure. I'll make sure to do everything I can

230
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:50,439
to keep you from getting hurt, just like when you fell off that swing.

231
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,319
Thank you.

232
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,340
Please have a seat.

233
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,000
I really enjoyed Samkorn Thai Tech's pitch.

234
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,743
Thank you very much, Ms. Rose.

235
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:33,745
Do any of you want to be Samkorn Thai Tech's mentor?

236
00:17:33,745 --> 00:17:38,614
It's okay. I've already decided who should be our mentor.

237
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,540
Who do you want?

238
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,519
Mr. Jiraphat.

239
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,980
Wait! What?

240
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,919
Why not me?

241
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,480
Yeah, if I were you, I wouldn't choose me.

242
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,799
Mr. Mark is more than willing to mentor your team.

243
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,439
You should pick him over me.

244
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:02,520
No, I've thought it through. I'm going with Mr. Jiraphat.

245
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,780
But Mr. Mark comes from a global company.

246
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,159
Most importantly, he's the one who recommended Samkorn Thai Tech to Sandbox.

247
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:14,599
Yes, I know. Thank you so much, Mark.

248
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,183
However…

249
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:21,402
I want Mr. Jiraphat to be the mentor of Samkorn Thai Tech.

250
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,780
Is that possible, Ms. Rose?

251
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,250
Okay?

252
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:43,000
Ms. Dream, can I have a word with you, please?

253
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
Yes.

254
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,040
Why did you pass on Mr. Mark and choose me?

255
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,879
He flew all the way from Silicon Valley just to meet the Samkorn Thai Tech team.

256
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:57,179
I know, but you've shown a lot of interest in our company.

257
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,240
And you even went out of your way to help us.

258
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,019
Me? I'm in no way that interested, though.

259
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:10,481
But from what I recall, you were quite interested and dedicated.

260
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:13,207
You've helped us so much

261
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:17,440
that I thought you had a crush on Korn.

262
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,839
That's amusing. I'm into women.

263
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,919
Or do you have a crush on me?

264
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:34,136
Just kidding.

265
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:35,801
I was just messing around.

266
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:41,300
I asked Korn, and he told me you two were as close as brothers.

267
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,100
No wonder you went to such lengths to help him.

268
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:50,820
Kind of. We're very close.

269
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,318
Korn's like a true little brother to me.

270
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,010
Yeah, regardless of who you're helping.

271
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:03,083
but as the CEO of the company, I really want to thank you for getting us here.

272
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:12,640
So, may I ask you a favor, to continue looking out for us?

273
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
Okay?

274
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,979
All right, but are you sure you won't regret choosing me?

275
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:28,579
No, I've never regretted any choice I've made.

276
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,740
Thank you very much. Please excuse me first.

277
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,979
- Yes.
- See you.

278
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,890
­[Sandbox]

279
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,499
You passed on Mr. Mark and chose Mr. Ji to be our mentor?

280
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:03,060
But Mr. Mark flew all the way from the USA just to meet us.

281
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,859
And you chose a local figure over a global one.

282
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:09,320
Are you some kind of nationalist?

283
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,340
Yes, Mr. Mark might have global recognition,

284
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,306
but Mr. Ji is like family.

285
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:21,300
Right, Korn?

286
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,660
What is she talking about?

287
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:37,710
Well, we're as close as brothers.

288
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,798
Absolutely, just like real siblings.

289
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:44,860
If you need any help from your big brother,

290
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,616
just let me know. Big brother is always here for you, my dear bro.

291
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:54,500
Yeah, bro.

292
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,343
Mr. Ji is truly like a caring brother to us,

293
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,979
as well as our mentor.

294
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:05,495
Okay. It's time for due diligence.

295
00:22:05,495 --> 00:22:08,820
Let's start with the basic contracts.

296
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,342
Sure. I've already prepared them.

297
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:22,493
The business plan is 10 points, and the company regulations are 10 points.

298
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:25,333
But the shareholder's list...

299
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:29,330
gets minus one million points.

300
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,119
Why?

301
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,230
Why? How?

302
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,641
Korn has 19%. Pafun, Thanakorn, Kirakorn, Yaya, Teeranai have 16% each,

303
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:42,008
and Sepsin 1%.

304
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:44,839
Korn is considered a major shareholder, is that right?

305
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,879
Yes, Korn is the best coder and the first founder of the company.

306
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:54,729
So he gets the highest share. And the rest of us get 16% each, which is fair.

307
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:57,799
And who is Teeranai?

308
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,839
It's my father.

309
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,179
He's the person who invested in Samkorn Thai Tech.

310
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:07,380
Have you forgotten, bro?

311
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,860
Father… I only heard you call him Papa.

312
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,019
I forgot his first name.

313
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:17,030
What about this Sepsin guy?

314
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,479
My cousin.

315
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:22,640
Oh, cousin.

316
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,780
He designs and edits videos for Samkorn Thai Tech.

317
00:23:28,403 --> 00:23:30,440
Fair enough. You guys split shares quite fairly.

318
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,259
Yes, we are a company with good governance.

319
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:34,759
- Right?
- Yes.

320
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,720
Fair but bad.

321
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,780
Distributing equity like this, people will see the CEO as weak.

322
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,610
No one will be stupid enough to invest with you.

323
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,580
Why?

324
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,879
Where do you think the power of the CEO comes from?

325
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:53,979
From equity.

326
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,956
And what if someday someone disagrees?

327
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:04,240
It's impossible. We'll never betray each other.

328
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,580
Yeah, we're so close we can practically smell each other's ass.

329
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,979
Our bond is unbreakable and lasts forever.

330
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:15,419
For generations, even until Rama II Road is finished.

331
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:21,719
Together forever? Have you ever seen people head over heels in love before marriage,

332
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:24,050
only to end up divorced?

333
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,056
They never thought they'd split, but they do.

334
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:32,482
When a marriage ends, you divide up your money and custody.

335
00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:34,716
But a company? It's different.

336
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:37,699
If you guys split, the company goes under.

337
00:24:37,699 --> 00:24:41,226
Investors' money disappears in an instant.

338
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:43,452
You get it?

339
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:48,640
And what if I give up my shares to someone so the person has 35%.

340
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,419
You can't!

341
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,339
- Korn.
- No.

342
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:56,208
35% is still too little.

343
00:24:56,208 --> 00:25:00,037
Once the funding round begins, investors will start to buy the company's shares.

344
00:25:00,037 --> 00:25:03,788
It won't be long before an investor owns more than 35%.

345
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:07,860
In the worst-case scenario, your colleagues may betray you and side with investors

346
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,659
to take control of the company,

347
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,320
or even sell it.

348
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,799
To prevent that from happening,

349
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,179
you have to give the keyman a majority of the shares in the beginning.

350
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,419
That's how you protect the company.

351
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,820
How do you decide who should be the keyman?

352
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,699
It's simple. The person who Samkorn Thai Tech can't do without.

353
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:32,499
How much equity should that person have?

354
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:40,039
At least 60%, but if you ask my opinion, it should be more than 90%.

355

The equity is distributed well. The CEO gets 80%.

356
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,520
The rest of the 20% is distributed among the founding members.

00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,219
How was Dream's first day at work?

530
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,403
She is having problems on the first day. Her company won't survive.

531
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,641
Then, just help her.

532
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:49,705
You are more experienced than your sister. She's still a novice.

533
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:55,700
The only way I can help is if she stops trying to do stuff she's not good at.

534
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,320
Business just isn't her thing.

535
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,241
If she doesn't get it, can't you at least show her the ropes?

536
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,574
You could be a big help.

537
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:06,232
Look... This isn't my problem, all right?

538
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:08,679
I'm swamped and I've got to find a new place to live.

539
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,941
Why move out?

540
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:13,880
You could just stay here if you don't want to go back home.

541
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,300
No, I'm not relying on Dad's connections again.

542
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,000
Come on, don't be so stubborn. Just stay put for now.

[Pafun sent 420 messages]

544
00:42:05,613 --> 00:42:08,013
What is all this?

545
00:42:22,317 --> 00:42:24,683
Hi, Mr. Ji.

546
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,740
Yes?

547
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,630
I'm here to hear the answers to the questions I sent last night.

548
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,880
Question number one.

549
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,840
Yes.

550
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:43,520
"What makes a great CEO?" There's no such thing.

551
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,110
That's like asking what makes a great politician.

552
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,679
Why?

553
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:55,580
Politics and management are not like university exams. There are no right answers.

554
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,100
No right answers?

555
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:03,720
So what should I do, Mr. Ji?

556
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:08,939
Don't try to find the answer. Just make a choice.

557
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:12,820
Because no matter which path you choose, you'll be criticized.

558
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,059
But if you're afraid of criticism, you won't dare to make any decisions.

559
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:21,499
And people like that are not qualified to be a CEO.

560
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:28,280
What do you want to be? A good person or a CEO.

561
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,559
You can't be both.

562
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,600
You have to pick one.

563
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:09,819
Hello.

564
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:13,099
Korn, I'm sending over some easy-to-digest food.

565
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:15,739
I already told you, there's no need to send any food.

566
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,199
Just have a little for my sake.

567
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:18,280
Yeah, sure.

568
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,719
And remember, don't stress too much.

569
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:23,099
I'll try not to stress and end up with constipation.

570
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,820
Hey, he's already here.

571
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,840
Has the delivery man arrived?

572
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,520
Yes, he has.

573
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,670
I'll go downstairs and get it.

574
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,960
Oh, you.

575
00:44:55,578 --> 00:44:56,978
Yes!

576
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,280
The water in my glass, don't drink it.

577
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,980
What?

578
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,289
How can you be so petty with me?

579
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:27,650
Refreshing!

580
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,676
Is it an important call? You can take it.

581
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:37,310
It's okay. Please continue, doctor.

582
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,240
I really hope you'll consider coming back to our clinic.

583
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:57,679
You can charge me whatever you like.

584
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,400
Just take cases on the weekends or whenever you're available.

585
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,699
Please think it over.

00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,460
- Korn.
- Bank.

587
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,440
- Korn.
- What's the matter?

588

Please help me.

589
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:26,939
What's wrong with you?

590
00:46:26,939 --> 00:46:28,640
I'm about to explode.

591
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,419
Don't tell me you drank the water in my glass.

What's going on?

595
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,021
I can't hold it anymore.

596
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:37,840
Come, get up.

597
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,559
I can't hold it anymore.

598
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:41,659
What's up? What did you do?

599
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:43,159
Lift him up!

600
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:44,499
- Lay your legs here.
- One, two, three.

Easy.

Are you shitting yourself?

I can't hold it anymore.

604
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,000
Take it easy, friend. Take it easy.

605
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,360
Can't you carry me the other way?

00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,780
Which way?

608
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,419

- It's coming.
- Go.

612
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,360
It's coming. Oh, it's coming.

613
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:16,360
We're here. We've arrived.

614
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,940
Please help my friend.

615
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:23,340
Be gentle, please. My friend is almost out of water.

I can't hold it anymore.

617
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:29,100
- Bank.
- Bank, please don't fart. Bank, don't fart.

618
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,740
Please tell my father and mother that I love them very much.

619
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,040
Hold tight. You must not die.

620
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,879
I don't want to tell your parents that you shit yourself to death.

621
00:47:37,879 --> 00:47:41,319
- I'm at my breaking point.
- Bank, don't fart or it will all come out.

622
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:46,860
- Bank.
- I can't hold it anymore.

I'm sorry.

638
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:48,173
I spoke harshly to you guys.

639

I'm sorry.

640
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,443
Can I give you a hug?

641
00:49:19,939 --> 00:49:23,280
Dream sent a message that she wants to have a meeting tomorrow.

642
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,059
I got it, too.

643

644

please support me.

00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,519
Yes?

647
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,629
I trust you.

648
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,540
I trust you unconditionally.

649
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:56,360
But for Dream…

650
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:02,719
If you trust me, please trust Dream, too. I beg you.

651
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:04,700
Just listen to me first.

652
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:09,700
I am saying I trust Dream like I trust you

653
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,600
and I'll give up my shares to her. Okay?

654
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,619
- Really?
- Yeah.

Thank you guys very much.

656
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,000
I promise that I'll make sure we won't become a bug.

657
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,200
A bug? Don't tell me you overheard us last night.

658
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:36,079
Were you eavesdropping?

659
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,079
You didn't just make some noise saying hi to us.

660
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,203
You talked too loud.

661
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,079
It was you. Good that we talked only about that.

662
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,500
I just happened to walk up there.

663
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,600
What did you hear?

664
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,300
Only that.

665
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,600
- Please give me a hug, my friends.
- Again?

666
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,600
- Okay, thank you.
- Enemies at the gate!

667

- Move over a little.
- You guys.

668
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,400
- It's coming.
- What, shit?

669
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,421
Don't fart.

670
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:04,579
- Ooh!
- Is it coming for real, Bank?

671
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:06,000
- Where is the restroom?
- Is it for real?

672
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,940
Wait a moment. It's close.

­[Sandbox]

674
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,539
I made a new shareholders' list.

675
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:33,900
Thanakorn, Kirakorn, Theeranai, and I get 8% each, and Sepsin 1%.

676
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,600
The largest shareholder is Korn with 67%.

677
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,600
But we…

678
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:46,100
As the CEO, I would like to ask for it to be this way.

679
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,900
Are there any questions or objections?

680
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,400
Why aren't there any shares for me?

681
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:59,200
Because it's not clear whether you're committed to working with us long-term.

682
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,200
I don't want someone who's just here for fun.

683
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,200
If you're genuinely committed to our company and want your fair share,

684
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,200
I can redistribute the shares.

685
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,200
In that case, we'll each have 7%.

686
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:19,100
Sepsin gets 1%, while Korn will have 64%.

687
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:34,300
Please focus on your work. Don't bring up unrelated matters during work hours.

688
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,600
So, what's your decision?

689
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,900
Just choose whether you want to stay or not.

690
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,100
Okay. Ready. Key. Squeeze in.

691
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,500
Okay, come, get ready, one, two, three.

692
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,100
Say Samkorn Thai Tech in unison, okay?

693
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,000
One, two, three.

696
00:53:17,163 --> 00:53:18,801
- Bank.
- Yeah?

697
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:21,600
Speaking of Dream, she can be quite serious.

698
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,400
You bet. I was so stunned I got goosebumps. See?

699
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,500
Are you about to go again?

700
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,800
- You jerk!
- Don't chitchat during work time.

701
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,300
I'm sorry.

702
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,600
I thought there was someone stricter than Dream.

703
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,300
"Don't chitchat during work time."

704
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,700
You switched sides just like that?

00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,800
­[Kirakorn: 7%, Parfun: 7%, Korn: 64%]

706
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,500
I told you guys that this will confuse investors about who the keyman is.

707
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
You or Korn?

708
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,900
It needs to be clear who they should be dealing with.

709
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:05,100
For business meetings, both Korn and I, as CTO, will always attend together.

710
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,300
And if you disagree.

711
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,700
That's not going to happen.

712
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:16,100
Yes, and now one person has the most shares as you said.

713
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:21,000
Investors can never become the majority shareholders.

714
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,500
In conclusion, you are ignoring my opinion.

715
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,900
No, I followed your advice.

716
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:36,200
Well, you were the one who told me that whatever the CEO chooses, they will get criticized.

717
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,100
So I made the choice I knew I would be criticized for by one person.

718
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,560
And that person is me?

719
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,200
Yes, I'm sorry.

720
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:53,500
But as the CEO, I really needed to make this decision.

721
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,700
Okay, your capital will be transferred tomorrow.

722
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,700
Thank you very much.

723
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,300
Please excuse me.

724
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,000
Let's go.

725
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,600
Just go ahead. I have something to discuss with Mr. Ji.

726
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,100
Okay.

727
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,800
Do you have something to tell me?

728
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,300
I'll tell Dream the truth about the letters.

729
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,500
Why all of a sudden?

730
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,900
Because I want to fix bugs before they happen.

731
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,800
At the meeting, you were like a different person.

732
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,900
Really?

733
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,400
Seriously, I practiced my speech all night.

734
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,600
I was so excited that I almost had a heart attack.

735
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,800
Actually, the heart is on the left.

736
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,600
Left.

737
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:27,200
So, you have 7% of the shares, will that be okay?

738
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,900
There's nothing wrong with that.

739
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:35,300
I have 7%. You have 64%. Together we've got 71%.

740
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,581
My shares are like your shares.

741
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:42,900
So we always have to be a team.

742
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,400
Don't leave each other, no matter what. Okay?

743
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,400
I won't.

744
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,700
Dream…

745
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,280
Is Grandma home?

746
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,419
I think so. Why?

747
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:08,000
Well, I'd like to say hello to her.

748
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,400
Of course, Grandma would be happy to see you.

749
00:57:36,139 --> 00:57:39,380
Do you like it?

750
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,919
I'm the one who ended up taking care of you.

751
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,280
Are you hungry?

752
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,119
How is it living with me?

753
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,800
Can you tell me what you're thinking?

754
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,200
Tell me…

755
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:17,820
Grandma.

756
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:22,300
- Guess, who's joining me today?
- Who could that be?

757
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,300
Grandma, hello.

758
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,700
Hello.

759
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,200
- Grandma!
- Yes?

760
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,200
[Next Episode]

761
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,500
Grandma, this is Mr. Jiraphat, my mentor and consultant for my company.

762
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,300
So why did you follow me?

763
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,200
Or do you like Dream?

764
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,200
You used your connections to get the project. Is it not fake?

765
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,757
I picked your company out of all the candidates.

766
00:58:53,757 --> 00:58:55,960
It was for your mother.

767
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:23,340
♫ It’s like the stars have been snuffed out ♫

768
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:28,220
♫ It’s not the same, they’re not shining enough for me to see the way ♫

769
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:33,140
♫ The fading sky ends up in darkness ♫

770
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:37,830
♫ There’s no hand for me to hold from someone who was once beside me ♫

771
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:43,000
♫ I’m going in circles in the same place ♫

772
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,560
♫ Where we used to be before you abandoned me ♫

773
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:52,870
♫ However much I run, whatever I do ♫

774
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:57,680
♫ I find only exhaustion ♫

775
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,000
♫ When I close my eyes, I still see your image ♫

776
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,510
♫ When I close my eyes, I still see your image ♫

777
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:07,400
♫ Whichever way I look, I still see you ♫

778
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:14,590
♫ I still don’t know how to endure this, I still don’t know ♫

779
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:19,600
♫ When will the stars in the sky return and shine again? ♫

780
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:24,460
♫ Shining so I can see the way, shining so I can find you ♫
