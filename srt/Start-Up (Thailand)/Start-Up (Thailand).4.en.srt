[Deep Learning - A tech simulating the processing capability of human neural cells and brains.]

182
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,100
Let's go.

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Wait a minute.

184
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
What are you doing, Mr. Ji?

185
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,100
What are you guys doing? Are you stupid?

186
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,000
How could you give away the whole algorithm like that?

187
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,500
[Algorithm - Solution workflow of a program]

188
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
He said he wanted to see the technology before investing.

189
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,800
You should've found out first who they are.

190
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,800
It's basic stuff, and you want to join Sandbox?

191
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,200
Why not?

192
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,500
We won CODA. And you see how many investors are showing interest.

193
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,900
So what? And has any of them invested?

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,600
Why are you discouraging us all the time, Mr. Ji?

195
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
None of the other VCs were harsh like you.

196
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,000
They were polite because they were going to turn you down.

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
You guys are the car they aren't going to board.

198
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,800
So, they just compliment that it's good and great.

199
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,400
But I really want to board this car,

200
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,500
so I have to check the tires, the lining,

201
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,400
before getting on it.

202
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,500
Bank, why do we have to check the lining?

203
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
Let me translate for you.

204
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,300
It's because I'm really interested,

205
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,800
so I'm giving you advice.

206
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,300
I didn't come to flatter you like the others.

207
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,200
From now on,

208
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,700
before making any decision, please ask me first.

209
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Understand?

210
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,200
Yes.

211
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,000
Is tomorrow your birthday?

212
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,900
Yes.

213
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,500
Dream said she'd take me to the beach to celebrate my birthday.

214
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,000
Does she remember my birthday?

215
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,500
And do you remember your wish, too?

216
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,300
Dream said she'd make your wish come true.

217
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
And she told me to bring my friends along, too.

218
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,400
My wish?

219
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,500
I can't remember.

220
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Hey, Key.

221
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,500
Yes?

222
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,600
Look at Korn.

223
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,000
- Poor guy.
- You're right!

224
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,600
What's gotten into him? He's going out of his way to help you like this.

225
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,400
Exactly. But Mr. Ji always finds fault whenever we meet.

226
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
I know, right!

227
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,156
Tomorrow, I'll get the car ready for you.

228
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:53,340
Let Dream know that I'll be joining, too.

229
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,800
Are you coming, too?

230
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,900
Yes, to help you.

231
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,100
Why are you doing this?

232
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Do you have feelings for Dream?

233
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,100
No, I just want to repay my debt.

234
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,100
Do as I told you.

235
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,000
All right.

236
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,950
­[NOTICE: Not an entrance]

237
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
How about this?

238
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
Where are you going?

239
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm taking Korn to Pattaya tomorrow for his birthday.

240
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,800
There.

241
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,400
Going to the beach with a man alone?

242
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,200
Grandma, it's not like that. Many others are coming, too.

243
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Korn and his friends,

244
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,600
and even Mr. Ji, the well-known investor, is coming along.

245
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,700
Ji is going, too?

246
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Do you know Mr. Ji as well?

247
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,300
I've seen him on TV.

248
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,300
So, why does it have to be the beach?

249
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,700
I just want to fulfill Korn's wish.

250
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,400
What wish?

251
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,100
The one he wrote in the letter.

252
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,100
Let me show you.

253
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
Here it is.

254
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,600
What kind of wish is this?

255
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
Isn't it adorable?

256
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,100
Right, adorable.

257
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,600
Grandma, help me pick which one to wear.

258
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,800
Is this okay?

259
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,400
This dress is too yellow.

260
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,700
Joyful vibe.

261
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,200
But this color is beautiful.

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Just pick one of these bags.

263
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,400
Let's choose a necklace first.

264
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,000
Grandma?

265
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,100
Is it beautiful?

266
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,600
It's cute. But you can buy a necklace at the beach.

267
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,900
But I want this one. Coral necklaces sort of.

268
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,500
- Coral is no longer trendy.
- No longer?

269
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,600
Then don't ask me next time.

270
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,400
[Somboon Shrine since 1967]

271
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,200
The shrine in front of my house is very sacred.

272
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,900
Whatever you wish for will come true.

273
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Just try it. Here.

274
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Asking for a wish without taking action will not lead to success.

275
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Well, I believe it is acceptable to seek moral support.

276
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,900
- Let's go.
- Yes.

277
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,200
Mr. Ji, I didn't think you had time to join.

278
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,200
It's my brother's birthday. I have to go and take care of him.

279
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,300
You two seem close.

280
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,900
You go everywhere together.

281
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,081
Well, yes.

282
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,399
We're coming!

283
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,639
- So, what are you waiting for?
- Should we get going?

284
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:46,599
- Get in the car.
- Let's go.

285
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,700
- We were waiting for you guys.
- Then, let's go.

286
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
- Is this the one, Mr. Ji? That's right.
- Yes, this is the one.

287
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
There is only one car.

288
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,200
- Help me open it.
- Just a moment, friend.

289
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
- We get to travel now.
- Close it for us. Press it?

290
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,583
Maybe just push it.

291
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,283
Right.

292
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:07,000
Bank, can I sit with you?

293
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,179
Sit in the front. It's already full back here.

294
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,300
- Can't I sit with you?
- Please.

295
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,800
Okay.

296
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,230
The ocean air is really refreshing.

297
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,340
- Let's go.
- Wait for us.

298
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,203
It's really big, isn't it?

299
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,040
Can you handle it?

300
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,890
It might get in my eyes.

301
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,180
Let's swap.

302
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:34,440
Happy Birthday to Korn…

303
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:40,756
Make a wish!

304
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,896
Just make a wish. It's your birthday.

305
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,616
Do I have to?

306
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:56,979
So if sacred beings really exist,

307
00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:02,383
please make everyone stop asking for blessings and start relying on themselves. Please.

308
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:06,620
- What the hell did he wish for?
- No idea.

309
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,476
Are you trying to tease me?

310
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,380
Grandma told me to bring this for you. Good Boy Pancake Rolls. Your favorite.

311
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,019
Thank you.

312
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,739
I hope you can find a girlfriend this year.

313
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:33,759
Why don't you have a girlfriend yet?

314
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,279
I want to know. Why?

315
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:38,540
Well, he used to be popular.

316
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,179
Girls always approached him first.

317
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:43,619
- Really?
- But the problem was him.

318
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,300
Why?

319
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,096
Just look at how he made his wish.

320
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:49,799
He was like that around girls.

321
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:53,860
No girl can stand such an absurdly logical nerd.

322
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,100
That's why he's still single.

323
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,963
It's like the two of us are cursed as well.

324
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,360
It's adorable.

325
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,083
How?

326
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:11,499
- How?
- Well, you sound honest.

327
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,063
But what was Korn's wish on those days?

328
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:26,416
I do not know. I can't recall.

329
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,050
What did I wish?

330
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,616
I'm telling you.

331
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:38,821
Bury him.

332
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,442
- Come here, Korn.
- No! Stop!

333
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:55,356
- Take him!
- You're heavy.

334
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:58,160
- Get up.
- No!

335
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,480
- No.
- You'll know where you're going.

336
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:11,060
Your birthday is coming up.

337
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:17,580
Do you have any wishes? I'll make them come true.

338
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:38,296
Mr. Ji.

339
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:40,400
- Yes?
- Let's go.

340
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,419
- That's okay. I'd rather stay here.
- Let's go together.

341
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,880
[Dear Dream, I want to go to the beach with my family and friends.]

342
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,379
[Have a barbecue by the sea, and then… let my friends bury me in the sand.]

343
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,303
- Key, take a picture for me.
- Of course.

344
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:09,000
Hey, guys, let's take a selfie.

345
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,743
Come on, everyone. One. Two. Three.

346
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,056
Okie dokie!

347
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,540
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

348
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,240
Did you really have to make a wish to come to the beach?

349
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,300
Korn, did you really really have to make a wish just to come to the beach?

350
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:46,279
Key, what might seem trivial to some could hold special significance for others.

351
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:53,603
It could be a cherished memory or a new experience they're eager to try.

352
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,719
Isn't that right?

353
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,159
Yes.

354
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:15,019
I see. So, Mr. Ji used to be like that, too?

355
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,739
All right, Mr. Ji. Let's go for a swim.

356
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:17,759
Absolutely. Let's go.

357

You don't have the DNA to be an executive.

536
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,320
Your company needs a better CEO than you.

539
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:38,099
And I'm going to start a business like you.

She's serious.

541
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,400
Dream, what is she doing on the stage?

542
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,480
- I'm wondering the same thing.
- Ms. Alice, too.

543
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:57,919
Weren't you supposed to be in the US? Why are you here?

544
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:02,950
And why is your CEO boyfriend here?

545
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,440
We've been caught!

546

We have one hour for the CEOs on the stage

to choose 5 teammates to proceed to the next round of Hackathon.

[­Team Members Selection]

Nobody seems to care about us.

551

Plus, we need to find a CEO who will take all three of us.

Korn…

553
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:50,683
What are you doing here? Didn't you guys start a company?

554
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,419
I..

555
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:57,816
I'm wondering that too. Why is Mr. Korn here?

556
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,883
Here it says you haven't found any investors yet.

557

And your only credential is winning the CODA competition.

558

I'm sorry, Dream, for lying.

559
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:25,750
You two seemed shocked.

560
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:32,736
Shocked to be fooled and shocked to be caught.

561
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:42,360
Dear god, today marks my first significant step.

562
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,519
I pray to you. Please grant me the opportunity to enter Sandbox.

563

And guide me to find the right companions for this journey.

564
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,970
May it be so.

565
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:05,839
What a response to my prayer!

566
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,439
Will you consider recruiting me as the CEO of your company?

567
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:37,839
Wait a minute! I want to make a similar offer, too.

568
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,660
Wait! What does this mean?

571
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,976
Isn't this a bit too direct?

572
00:49:55,979 --> 00:49:58,939
I notice your credentials are lacking.

573
00:49:58,939 --> 00:50:02,199
If your CEO lacks experience as well,

574
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:05,049
you guys are definitely heading for trouble.

575
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,503
Who says I lack experience? I've held numerous jobs.

- Then.
- Wait a second, Korn.

Excuse us for a minute.

- Just a moment.
- Come here.

What do we do?

583
00:50:53,476 --> 00:50:56,844
Korn, the future of our company is on the line.

584
00:50:56,844 --> 00:51:00,900
- It all depends on this decision.
- Yes.

585
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,400
Either way, I choose Dream.

586
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,500
You have to put your feelings aside, Korn.

587
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,449
Yes, it's true.

588
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:12,356
No, you guys listen to me first.

589
00:51:12,356 --> 00:51:15,950
You two don't want to be anyone's underlings, right?

590
00:51:16,965 --> 00:51:18,465
Of course not.

00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,609
- Neither do I.
- And?

592
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,140
Dream asked us to recruit her as CEO.

593
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,643
While Alice said she'd recruit us.

594
00:51:29,643 --> 00:51:31,820
Can you see the difference?

595
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,940
- Well, that's right.
- Really different.

596
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:46,556
You mean, either we recruit a CEO or a CEO recruits us, is that it?

597
00:51:46,556 --> 00:51:49,803
So, it means that if we choose Ms. Alice,

598
00:51:49,803 --> 00:51:51,639
we will have to be her employees.

599
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:55,293
But if we choose Dream, we are still Samkorn Thai Tech

600
00:51:55,293 --> 00:51:58,036
and can continue working together. Right?

601
00:51:58,696 --> 00:52:01,643
Then, who will you guys choose?

602
00:52:01,643 --> 00:52:03,590
I'll do as you say.

603
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:11,016
Aren't you mad at your boyfriend for putting on such a big show like that?

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,219
No, I actually love showy people.

605

The more boastful, the more I like them.
