00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,343
and I don't have to rely on you.

180
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,300
This stepdaughter of yours is really stubborn.

181
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,812
Yeah!

182
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,280
Yes, Mom.

183
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,320
I heard about what's going on. How are you holding up?

184
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,090
I'm okay. There's nothing to worry about.

185
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:20,559
Alice, you've got this. I'm cheering you on.

186
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,700
Thanks.

187
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,039
Hello, Uncle Tee and Auntie Rat.

188
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,900
What brings you here?

189
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,880
I was out of town. So, I bought a lot of stuff for you.

190
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,740
Show us.

191
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,163
So, this time…

192
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,310
Here it is.

193
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:10,321
Bamboo sticky rice, steamed fish in curry paste, coconut pancakes, chives,

194
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:13,060
Zebra, Holy Threads, and an envelope for donations.

195
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,659
So, please put your donation in the envelope.

196
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,580
That's a sudden joke.

197
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,040
Amen.

198
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:26,580
I'd like to thank Ms. Pafun,

199
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,979
the CEO of Samkorn Thai Tech for this great opportunity to do good.

200
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:34,780
Oh, and what about the details of the collaboration with Ms. Pafun?

201
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,100
Who is this Pafun?

202
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
She's the CEO of Korn's company.

203
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,885
Isn't Korn the CEO?

204
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:45,530
Hasn't he told you that he's not the CEO?

205
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,198
Korn!

206
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:57,000
What's for dinner?

207
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,419
Hotpot? I've been craving it.

208
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:00,730
Uncle found out you appointed Dream as CEO,

209
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,863
so he's pretty ticked off.

210
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:04,060
You might want to crash elsewhere tonight, okay?

211
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,860
Guys.

212
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:08,739
What's up?

213
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,059
Let's grab some beers.

214
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,480
- Let's go.
- Oh, whatever.

215
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,846
- All right, let's bounce. Let's go.
- What's this?

216
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:18,219
Which bar?

217
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:19,459
Sounds good though.

218
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,000
My throat's parched.

219
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:26,473
Come on, toast!

220
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:36,560
Didn't you tell your dad that Dream is the CEO?

221
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,200
But wouldn't he have noticed when he signed the contract?

222
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,060
I forged my father's signature.

223
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,260
Korn!

224
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,460
You forged your dad's signature? You could end up in jail for that.

225
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,040
He's more scared of his dad than of jail.

226
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:55,320
It's good that Sek warned you.

227
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,359
His name is not Sek, it's Sep! Sepsilp.

228
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,361
What did I say?

229
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:01,320
- You said Sek.
- Did I?

230
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,439
Good thing he didn't bring his guitar. You dummie!

231
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,900
If you go home,

232
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,302
it's not going to end well.

233
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,199
You won't make it.

234
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:12,099
Yes! Oh?

235
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm going to go back and spill everything to my dad.

236
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,440
Why would you do that? I just said you're doomed if you do!

237
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,096
Yes!

238
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,019
All right, let's do this. Practice with us first?

239
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,139
Yes, I'll play your dad.

240
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:32,160
Okay, you are Dad.

241
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,920
Got it.

242
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,300
- Here we go.
- Let's start!

243
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,999
Action!

244
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:43,660
Dad, I'm sorry for lying.

245
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,620
This woman seduced you, didn't she? Korn?

246
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,739
No, Dad!

247
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm just a fool.

248
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,679
I'm useless.

249
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:05,256
It's all my fault.

250
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:13,839
If you're useless, what does that make us? A bunch of losers?

251
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,060
Exactly.

252
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,079
Why did you lie to me?

253
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,359
Dream.

254
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:37,863
I'm sorry, Dream,

255
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:42,294
for lying to you.

256
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,590
What's wrong with him?

257
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,079
- What's wrong with him?
- What did he eat?

258
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,600
He's heavy.

259
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Korn, stop weighing me down.

260
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:05,085
Where is my phone?

261
00:22:05,085 --> 00:22:06,519
Where did you put it?

262
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,179
Oh, damn! I left my phone behind. I need to go back.

263
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,579
Yeah.

264
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:14,060
Korn, your dad's calling.

265
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,119
I'll talk to him. Just hold on.

266
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:20,080
Hey, Dad.

267
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,319
Yeah, we're on our way.

268
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,779
Korn's wasted. I've got to carry him home.

269
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,470
Don't lock the house yet…

270
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,800
- Let's go, Korn.
- Where's Korn?

271
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,519
Where did Korn go?

272
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,820
Hey, was Korn with you? I was only gone for a bit.

273
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:50,920
Dream…

274
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,720
Dream…

275
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,259
Korn!

276
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,399
Dream…

277
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:12,480
Korn!

278
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,880
Korn, get up. Gosh!

279
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:26,099
Hello.

280
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:26,820
- Dream.
- Huh?

281
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,140
- He's with Dream.
- Is Korn with Dream?

282
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,019
Why is he so wasted?

283
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:33,060
He had a fight with his dad.

284
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,760
Well, where should I take him then?

285
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,140
Please take care of him.

286
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,863
What?

287
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:46,140
He's clever. He chose the right place to go.

288
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,500
Come on, get up. Let's go.

289
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,800
Come on.

290
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,960
Korn, take it easy.

291
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,559
What are you doing here, Mr. Ji?

292
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,900
Hello, Mr. Ji. I'm heading to Dream's place.

293
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,559
I'm going to spill all the truth to her.

294
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:27,019
Korn!

295
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:40,080
That is…

296
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,401
Korn called me saying he was on his way to you.

297
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:47,780
But he sounded drunk, so I got worried and came to check on him.

298
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,263
But I didn't expect him to be this wasted.

299
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,720
Come on, let's head back.

300
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,659
Just stay out of it!

301
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:02,359
It's all because of you, jerk!

302
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:03,939
Jerk?

303
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:07,003
Yeah, you…

304
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:11,240
It was you. You told me to…

305
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,720
Don't say anymore. Why did you have to drink so much?

306
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,856
I'm sorry. I'll take him home.

307
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:21,308
- Korn, let's go.
- I'm not going back. I won't!

308
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:23,219
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.

309
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:25,321
Mr. Ji, let's handle this.

310
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:27,305
Let Korn stay at my place for now.

311
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:30,140
We'll wait until he's sober. He can't go like this.

312
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,040
Okay.

313
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,283
He's asleep.

314
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:39,619
- Wait, can you give me a hand?
- Of course.

315
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:47,060
Can you do it?

316
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,540
- Yes, I can.
- Let's go.

317
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:57,416
Here.

318
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:03,400
- Easy.
- Oh, why are you so wasted?

319
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,319
- There's puke on the shirt, too.
- Shirt?

320
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,659
- I'll find a shirt for you.
- Yes.

321
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,140
- Just a moment.
- Yes.

322
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:40,620
Sit here, son.

323
00:26:43,112 --> 00:26:45,273
Drink some water.

324
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,479
Thank you.

325
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,840
Can you hold it?

326
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,348
The washroom is over there.

327
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:56,600
Just go.

328
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,199
Are you all right?

329
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,440
Wash your face.

330
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,761
What am I doing here?

331
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:24,459
You were sleepwalking?

332
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:28,140
Come, sit down, son. Take a seat.

333
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,040
Are you all right? Seriously, are you okay?

334
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,701
How could he take it anymore?

335
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:35,854
He barfed all over me, all the way down my back!

336
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,780
I think you should change your shirt.

337
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,996
Do you still feel nauseous?

338
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:49,840
Head still pounding?

339
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,127
I'm fine now.

340
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:54,418
I'm sorry for the trouble.

341
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:58,195
It's no trouble. You can sleep with me tonight.

342
00:27:58,195 --> 00:27:59,995
What?

343
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:08,390
It's not like that. I mean, Korn should stay here tonight.

344
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:11,340
That's not a good idea.

345
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,450
Why not? It's late already. Or are you coming, too?

346
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,183
That's not a good idea.

347
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,256
So both of you should stay.

348
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:26,259
Driving late at night is dangerous.

349
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:30,759
And you guys are big, so take the big bed in Dream's room.

350
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,020
Dream, you can sleep in my room.

351
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:41,240
Okay, I'll stay to look after my little brother, Korn.

352
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:47,239
I'll go change first then.

353
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:49,140
Just go.

354
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:52,840
My water.

355
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:02,859
Thanks.

356
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:13,680
Why would you leave your comfortable bed to sleep here?

357
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,680
Why sleep here, when you have your home sweet home?

358
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,950
You've got everything.

359
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,944
Why so greedy?

360
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:35,520
I've got everything?

361
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,876
You have more than me.

362
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,246
Well, you have money,

363
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:44,643
luxury cars,

364
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:47,386
and a big house by the lake.

365
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,303
But I don't have a father, a mother,

366
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:59,918
the ones who love and wait for you at home.

367
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,710
Let's change.

368
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,476
Take everything I have...

369
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:09,675
in exchange for everyone you love.

370
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,259
No, thank you.

371
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,697
My father has Parkinson's. He's starting to speak unclearly,

372
00:31:32,697 --> 00:31:37,161
but True Angel can understand that he wants to go to the sunflower field.

373
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,134
So I took him on a trip.

374
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:41,273
My father looked very happy.

375
00:31:41,273 --> 00:31:44,817
Before, I was so busy working, I neglected him.

376
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:47,064
I'm very sorry.

377
00:31:47,064 --> 00:31:52,232
This is not a review, just pointless venting, isn't it?

378
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,499
Grandma, are you feeling okay?

379
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:38,560
I'm fine.

380
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:45,999
Hey, Mr. Ji, hasn't Korn gotten up yet?

381
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,780
Hasn't he come down stairs? He wasn't in the room.

382
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,620
He's gone?

383
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,500
Let's just have breakfast.

384
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,384
He shouldn't have left without saying goodbye.

385
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,100
Let me help you.

386
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,223
What's up?

387
00:33:07,223 --> 00:33:09,472
You want to take me and Grandma on a trip?

388
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:11,144
Now?

389
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,059
Okay, fine.

390
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,559
Let's go on a trip.

391
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,720
That sounds good.

392
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:27,870
She's here.

393
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:32,723
Mr. Ji, here's your shirt.

394
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,779
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

395
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,359
It's nice to go on a trip.

396
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:41,959
Right.

397
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,140
Yes.

398
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:47,560
Are you ready yet?

399
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:51,082
Why are you taking me and Grandma on a trip?

400
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:53,811
How are we getting there?

401
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:56,680
I rented a car.

402
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,459
So where are you going?

403
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:02,539
Somewhere far.

404
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:07,252
Somewhere far? What do you mean by that?

405
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:11,193
It means we're going to somewhere far away.

406
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,039
Shall we go together?

407
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,580
- Okay.
- All right.

408
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,039
So, shall we go?

409
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,120
Yes.

410
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:30,470
- Just a moment.
- Yes.

411
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:35,856
Is the CTO of DC GROUP selling shares?

412
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:40,036
You can take care of that yourself.

413
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:45,180
If you can't go, it's okay, Mr. Ji.

414
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,939
Of course, I can. It's already taken care of.

415
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:48,760
Okay.

416
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,679
- So, I'm ready. Let's go. Got it.
- Yeah. Let's go.

417
00:34:55,556 --> 00:34:57,340
Yes, Ms. Rose.

418
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:03,060
Yes, I'll handle it.

419
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,548
What a shame.

420
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:09,305
But you should go to work first.

421
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:12,725
Go to work, son.

422
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,863
I should.

423
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,715
So, I'll leave then.

424
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,259
Yeah.

425
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:21,419
- See you soon.
- See you soon, Mr. Ji.

426
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,059
Yes.

427
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:25,953
Your shirt bag.

428
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:36,539
Drive carefully.

429
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:39,299
Careful, son.

430
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:45,519
Okay, so let's get going, shall we?

431
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,389
Let's go. Well, let's go.

432
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:49,519
Wait a minute.

433
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,080
Wait. I'll check the gas again.

434
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,308
Okay, I'll wait here.

435
00:35:55,308 --> 00:35:56,836
Just a second.

436
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:07,200
(Where are you taking me and Grandma?)

437
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,920
I promise you and Grandma will love it.

438
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,340
But let's go to a temple first.

439
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,260
- Yes.
- I could use this.

440
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,319
Aren't gongs meant to be struck?

441
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,039
People don't hit the gong anymore.

442
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,560
It's believed that if you rub the gong and it makes a noise,

443
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,121
your wishes will come true.

444
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:54,765
Look.

445
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:59,401
I wish True Angel success.

446
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:04,001
Lots of downloads and users.

447
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:07,396
And many reviews, too.

448
00:37:07,396 --> 00:37:11,079
May it be so.

449
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,979
It's not so loud.

450
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,700
Dream!

451
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,419
- Yes, Grandma.
- Give me a hand.

452
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:24,160
Why are so many people coming?

453
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,240
Okay. I can do it.

454
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,646
Grandma, we've arrived.

455
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:50,660
Don't rush.

456
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,619
- Thanks.
- Come on.

457
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:56,516
Just a moment. Close the door first.

458
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,700
So beautiful.

459
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,420
Was this the place I came to as a child? It's as beautiful as I remember.

460
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,580
It's as beautiful as I remember.

461
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,719
Yes, you were whining at that time, asking Dad to carry you.

462
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,650
Wow, it's really beautiful.

463
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:25,576
Well, thank you very much for bringing me here.

464
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,300
Take it easy.

465
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,000
Sure.

466
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:38,920
Hey, you must've seen my comment. So you brought me and Grandma here.

467
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,519
I saw the comments and also a picture of you and Grandma at home.

468
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,023
Thank you for bringing us here.

469
00:38:51,023 --> 00:38:54,236
We haven't traveled together like this in a long time.

470
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,340
I'm glad you like it.

471

00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,521
- I'm tired. You go ahead.
- Okay.

473
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:24,719
- Just go ahead, son.
- So, just wait there for a moment.

474
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,642
- You should wait in the car.
- Okay?

Are you okay with that, Mr. Ji?

483
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,300

Take a photo.

485
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,499
- Yes.
- Grandma?

486
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,200
Let's go. Here.

487
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,720
Slowly.

488
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,060
Here we go.

489
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,619
Okay.

490
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,019
Dear, would you mind taking a picture of me and my mom?

491
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:21,999
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

492
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,640
Just a moment.

493
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:26,619
How was it, Grandma? Did you have fun?

494
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:30,539
Of course. Thank you very much for bringing me here.

495
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:36,499
I was just along for the ride. We should thank him.

496
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:42,059
Korn is a kind-hearted person, and he cares.

497
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Grandma,

498
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,877
could…

499
00:40:51,877 --> 00:40:57,519
the Korn from the past and the Korn now be different people?

500
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,559
What a weird question.

501
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:09,959
It's nothing. It just crossed my mind.

502
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,553
I'm worried…

503
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,629
and scared that…

504
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:18,532
he's not the same person as the one in the letter.

505
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:20,639
So…

506
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,339
How is that possible?

507
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:32,419
There are many things I wanted to ask him, but I don't dare.

508
00:41:32,419 --> 00:41:34,816
Why not?

509
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:40,668
Are you ready to go back yet?

510
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,459
Okay.

511
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,820
Right.

512
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,960
I am hungry.

513
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,279
- Are you hungry?
- Honestly, I didn't dare say.

514
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:49,919
- Well, we can eat before heading back.
- Yes.

515
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:51,380
Grandma, what do you want to eat?

516
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:57,579
20 years ago, I used to come here. There was a restaurant where I used to eat.

517
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:00,139
It was delicious, but I don't know if it's still there.

518
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:02,220
It's been 20 years, Grandma.

519
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,615
We don't know. Let's give it a try.

520
00:42:03,615 --> 00:42:05,820
It's okay. I'll try to find it on GPS.

521
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,280
Yeah.

522
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,780
We're back in the car now.

523
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,660
Grandma, be careful.

524
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,439
They should be back by now.

525
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:02,999
I'm sorry, Dream. It seems I'm lost.

526
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,500
But the view here is beautiful, too.

527
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,760
Want to go down and take a look?

528
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,347
Why not?

529
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:01,520
The sky is so beautiful.

530
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:07,299
It's actually nice to be lost…

531
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,176
You don't want to go home yet?

532
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:19,699
Are you still fighting with your parents?

533
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,500
No.

534
00:44:24,338 --> 00:44:28,104
No? So why don't you want to go home?

535
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:37,663
You know, my dad and grandma...

536
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:42,857
always told me that I was like a sunflower...

537

01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:04,261
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

718
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:05,557
I can't bear to look at you anymore.

719
01:03:05,557 --> 01:03:07,825
Can I work part-time at your shop?

720
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,507
At my shop?

721
01:03:09,507 --> 01:03:11,407
I like you.

722
01:03:11,407 --> 01:03:12,727
How about we hang out?

723
01:03:12,727 --> 01:03:15,169
You can think of it as keeping your sister company.

724
01:03:15,169 --> 01:03:17,601
So I can't be a good brother to you anymore.

725
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:21,038
And if not, who are you?

726
01:03:21,038 --> 01:03:22,933
Competitor.

727
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,330
♫ It’s like the stars have been snuffed out ♫

728
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:55,140
♫ It’s not the same, they’re not shining enough for me to see the way ♫

729
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:00,060
♫ The fading sky ends up in darkness ♫

730
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:05,050
♫ There’s no hand for me to hold from someone who was once beside me ♫

731
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:09,920
♫ I’m going in circles in the same place ♫

732
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,750
♫ Where we used to be before you abandoned me ♫

733
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:19,690
♫ However much I run, whatever I do ♫

734
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:24,970
♫ I find only exhaustion ♫

735
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:29,900
♫ When I close my eyes, I still see your image ♫

736
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:34,860
♫ Whichever way I look, I still see you ♫

737
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:41,910
♫ I still don’t know how to endure this, I still don’t know ♫

738
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:46,970
♫ When will the stars in the sky return and shine again? ♫

739
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:52,140
♫ Shining so I can see the way, shining so I can find you ♫
