he is the same Korn in the letters.

00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,100
Let's change.

00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,200
Take everything I have in exchange for everyone you love.

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,700
I've decided to tell her the truth.

7
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,500
Why is your letter in Mr. Ji's hand?

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,770
Why is it not you standing before me right now?

9
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,900
You…

10
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
Why are you here?

11
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:47,200
I have to ask you. How did you come here?

12
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,400
Why did you come to collect the letter instead of Korn?

13
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,600
Please, just tell me.

14
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,400
Why does Mr. Ji have your letter?

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,400
Why is it not you standing before me right now?

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,200
Why is it, Mr. Ji?

17
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,900
I…

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
So, what's the truth?

19
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,700
Fifteen years ago, Grandma asked me to write letters.

20
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,300
She wanted you to have a friend during your lonely times.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,300
And how do you know my grandmother?

22
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,900
She once helped me. She's my benefactor.

23
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,400
What about Korn?

24
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,900
We saw his name in the newspaper...

25
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,500
and…

26
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,200
just picked a random name.

27
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,500
So, you didn't really know Korn.

28
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,700
How did he end up at my sister's birthday party?

29
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,200
I tracked him down and asked him to come.

30
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,100
- I offered him money but he…
- Enough.

31
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,600
So, he came for money.

32
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,400
It wasn't just money.

33
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,100
- Korn decided to attend…
- You've been plotting to deceive me all along.

34
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,300
What else am I supposed to believe?

35
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Hey, Korn, where the hell are you?

36
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,800
So, are you all right?

37
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,800
Don't stress about work. Sort out your stuff first.

38
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,300
Was that Korn? What's up with him?

39
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,300
The bug is here.

40
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,600
We're in deep trouble.

41
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,500
What's the bug? Who's in trouble?

42
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,200
No, I mean, the project we're working on. It's got bugs.

43
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
It's definitely messed up.

44
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
Have you fixed the code issue yet?

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm working on it, man.

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,500
- Why not give it a test run?
- Oh, right.

This is bad. Our company's in serious trouble.

50
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,300
Is it really that bad?

51
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,400
Such a mess. How can Korn and Dream even face each other now?

52
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,700
Dream might not be mad at Korn.

53
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,100
- Right?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,100
If not mad, Dream might have feelings for Mr. Ji

55
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,900
who wrote those letters.

56
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
Then, Korn would hit rock bottom.

57
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,700
What's hitting rock bottom?

58
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,000

Either way, it's not good.

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,500
But Dream might not like Mr. Ji, right?

62
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,200
Definitely.

63
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,500
Mr. Ji is Dream's first love.

He's handsome, rich,

65
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,500
and well-educated. Who wouldn't be charmed by him?

66
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,200
And where does our Korn fall short?

67
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000

So I kept it all going.

Watching me get so excited talking about a Korn you made up?

86
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,800
Was it hilarious…

87
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,300
to see my dream of doing a startup like you?

88
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,200
I must have looked ridiculous, right?

89

It's not like that, Dream.

Of course, I do.

183
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,923
If you join me, I will make your dreams come true.

184
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,600
My dream isn't about money.

185
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
It's about a person.

186
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,900
What?

187
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,000
How is Dream doing today?

188
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,100
She's not okay.

189
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,700
I can't believe it.

190
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,900
I wrote those letters to cheer her up.

191
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,400
And now…

192
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,400
they've only made her sad.

193
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,000
Don't be too hard on yourself.

194
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,900
You did all those things with good intentions.

195
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,300
I know,

196
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,600
but lying is still lying.

197
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,500
It's tough knowing the truth.

198
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,400
Let's grab some lunch. It's noon.

199
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Hey, is it lunchtime already?

200
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,939
Yeah.

201
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,300
My stomach always knows.

202
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,219
Well then, let's go eat.

203
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,500
Friends, let's grab a meal together.

204
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,300
Dream, want to join us for lunch?

205
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,500
We can order a variety of dishes since there are so many of us.

206
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,300
I've got plans. You guys go ahead.

207
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,400
Korn, come along.

208
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,400
Sure thing, buddy.

209
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,100
Lunch is served.

210
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,619
Here you go, Yaya.

211
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,600
What do we have here?

212
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,900
- Salmon.
- Wow, salmon.

213
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,000
Come on, Korn. Hurry up and eat.

214
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
We've got salmon fried rice for you.

215
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,720
You guys go ahead. I'm not really hungry.

216
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
What?

217
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,500
He must be too stressed to eat.

218
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,000
Was Korn really in the wrong?

219
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,500
He cares about Dream and does everything for her.

220
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Why can't she see that?

221
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,000
Exactly!

222
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,100
She's being really harsh.

223
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,800
I get it. I've been in a similar situation.

224
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,440
Ever secretly liked someone and they didn't even notice?

225
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,800
It hurts.

226
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,420
So you've secretly liked someone, too?

227
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,300
Who is it?

228
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,300
See, you still don't know.

229
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Wait, is it me?

230
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,000
Is it Key?

231
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,500
I never would've guessed.

232
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,000
Ms. Yaya, I'm sorry for being distant before.

233
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,800
Actually, I really like you a lot.

234
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,900
Just kidding.

235
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,500
Is this… Are you fooling me?

236
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,600
See? This is how Dream feels.

237
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
But her pain is multiplied

238
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,900
because Korn has been lying to her for months.

239
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,400
Lies only lead to temporary happiness.

240
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,100
That was quite the revelation. Right?

241
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,300
Was that amusing to you?

242
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,900
Hey.

243
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,800
Key.

244
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,100
I wonder if he's not eating either.

245
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,000
Shall we eat?

246
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm sorry.

247
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,100
I know it made you uncomfortable.

248
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,500
But…

249
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,100
I have something to tell you.

250
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,800
What's the matter?

251
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,800
You said…

252
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,800
you wanted me to be honest, right?

253
00:22:56,466 --> 00:22:57,886
Yes.

254
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,200
Actually, there are things you don't know.

255
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,300
Is there still something else you lied to me about?

256
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,600
Actually,

257
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,500
Korn and I aren't close friends.

258
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,500
I don't even like Korn.

259
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,400
But even though I don't like him,

260
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,400
I don't want you to misunderstand him.

261
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,800
Everything he did…

262
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,300
Korn went to help you that day,

263
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,600
it was his decision alone.

264
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,200
I didn't give him any orders or money.

265
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,400
You lied to me a lot. So how can I believe you?

266
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,600
And when you followed me to Chonburi, were you lying too?

267
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,800
Yes, I lied.

268
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,300
I followed you that day...

269
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,100
because I was worried about you.

270
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,700
Why did you have to lie about such a trivial matter?

271
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,700
Because I like you.

272
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,100
So I wanted to follow you and take care of you.

273
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,800
I just wanted to tell you.

274
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,500
I'm not asking you to return my feelings.

275
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,800
Just don't avoid me...

276
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,200
and let's act normal.

277
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:19,560
- We won't stand for it!
- We're not quitting!

278
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:25,900
- We won't stand for it!
- We're not quitting!

279
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,400
Take plenty of pictures for your story.

280
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,100
How dare you show up here? You even brought reporters.

281
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,900
Sir, calm down.

282
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm here because I want to negotiate with your leader.

283
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,100
Where is he?

284
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,200
That's me.

285
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,900
What's the issue?

286
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,800
Hello, I'm Alice,

287
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,400
the CEO of Alice Company.

288
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm here to discuss and clarify the situation with you.

289
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,100
What else is there to explain?

290
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,000
All you guys do is take bread out of our mouths and leave us starving. Right?

291
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,600
- Yes!
- Yes!

292
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,500
Let's call it a manpower efficiency model.

293
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,100
There's no difference. Its aim is to fire people.

294
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,200
Right, you guys?

295
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,400
- Yes! True!
- Sandbox?

296
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,100
Yes, our company is in the Sandbox.

297
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,900
Isn't that where the manager's son recently joined?

298
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,600
Really?

299
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,600
He must be in the same generation as me if it's recent.

300
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,800
What's his name?

301
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,600
His name is Korn. Do you have anything else to ask?

302
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,800
Is your son Korn from Samakorn Thai Tech Company?

303
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,500
Yes.

304
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,300
The world is small.

305
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,900
So?

306
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,800
Samkorn Thai Tech Company developed a solution to fire people as well.

307
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,600
And here you are, protesting against it.

308
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,400
Aren't you worried that Korn will get in trouble if news of this spreads?

309
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,300
Hello, Mom? You fell?

310
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,200
She needs surgery? Yes. I'm coming right away.

311
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,500
My wife collapsed and needs surgery. I've got to go. Cover for me.

312
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,700
Yes, of course.

313
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,500
What should we do now?

314
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,900
Should we postpone the meeting?

315
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,800
Then, please come to the meeting.

316
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,300
You're back early, honey.

317
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,900
Yeah.

318
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,900
Isn't there a meeting with the protestors today?

319
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,000
I can't make it. If I stayed any longer, our son would be in trouble.

320
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
How did that happen, honey?

321
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,100
Mother!

322
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,100
What are you looking at?

323
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:36,420
I…

324
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,600
Can I work part-time at your shop?

325
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,700
At my shop?

326
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,900
Basically, you've run away from home and have been homeless for months?

327
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:58,800
Well, let's just say I left home. And I wasn't exactly homeless, Mom.

328
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,200
So you have nowhere to go and now you want to live off me.

329
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,500
I'm not trying to live off you, Mother.

330
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,800
You need help.

331
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,800
And I need money. It's a mutual benefit.

332
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,600
I don't think it's possible.

333
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,700
I can't employ my ex-daughter-in-law who left my son.

334
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm sorry, Mom.

335
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,400
I really am. Please forgive me.

336
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Mother, you don't have to see me as your daughter-in-law.

337
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:40,500
Just think of it as hiring a widowwho has nowhere else to go.

338
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I can't do it.

339
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,900
Just seeing your face makes me furious.

340
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:54,800
I think it's best if we live our own lives and remain strangers.

341
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:31,483
You look stressed.

342
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,290
You look just as stressed as I feel.

343
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,939
Just a little bit.

344
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,259
How about we hang out?

345
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,259
I don't want to be alone.

346
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,960
You can think of it as keeping your sister company.

347
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,320
Yeah, sure.

348
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:53,380
Mr. Phakapon mentioned that you wanted to talk to me.

349
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,380
Take a seat.

350
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,820
I'll give you some advice about demo day.

351
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:06,720
Dream doesn't seem to want to listen to me right now.

352
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:10,959
Take notes.

353
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,272
In the past 3 years, has True Angel ever generated any revenue?

354
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,141
Business is all about numbers.

355
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:21,601
Tell me about your profit model.

356
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:23,183
What's the core technology of True Angel?

357
00:32:23,183 --> 00:32:24,440
Is it patented?

358
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,680
Tell me about your estimated break-even point and financing plan.

359
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,800
So what is Samkorn Thai Tech's ultimate weapon?

360
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,440
Mr. Ji, could you please slow down? I couldn't keep up.

361
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,900
These are the questions that Dream will have to face on Demo Day.

362
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:46,962
If you tell them your business has no competitors, they will ask if it's really needed.

363
00:32:46,962 --> 00:32:49,641
If you tell them you do, they'll grill you about your patent

364
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:51,115
and market entry barriers.

365
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:53,721
No matter how you answer, you will be attacked.

366
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,027
You must help Dream prepare thoroughly.

367
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:59,794
So she won't make a mistake and regret it later.

368
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,863
What mood are you in?

369
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:06,590
Why are you nice to me?

370
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,856
I want to act like a good brother one last time…

371
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:19,200
I told Dream I had feelings for her.

372
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,156
So, I can't be a good brother to you anymore.

373
00:33:25,156 --> 00:33:29,163
And if not, who are you?

374
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,419
A competitor.

375
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:40,820
I will reclaim my past and my memories with Dream in the letters.

376
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,359
If you're just going to sit there silently,

377
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:01,620
you might as well move to another table, huh?

378
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,459
Well, you asked me to drink, not to engage in small talk.

379
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:10,060
Just let it out.

380
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,900
There's no need to keep everything bottled up inside.

381
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,639
It'll drive you crazy.

382
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,270
Even if I can't offer much help,

383
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,840
I can at least lend an ear.

384
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,379
Hey.

385
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,320
Don't worry about me. Focus on yourself first.

386
00:34:40,218 --> 00:34:44,769
True, I barely have my life together.

387
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,676
Let's call a truce for today.

388
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,939
I'll play the role of your older sister.

389
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:01,179
Do you want any advice?

390
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:08,650
I appreciate the offer,

391
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,030
but...

392
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:12,920
but I'm not sure where to begin.

393
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,119
Let me get a little drunk first.

394
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,559
Can I get two more, please?

395
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,679
Sure thing.

396
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,660
More please.

397
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,060
Make it four.

398
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,500
Actually, make it six.

399
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,710
Which Korn am I really in love with?

400
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:54,340
The Korn from 15 years ago or the Korn now?

401
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,939
Why does it have to be like this?

402
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:03,059
I told you to meet him in person back then.

403
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:06,334
Now I'm completely lost.

404
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:11,632
Both with Korn and with work.

405
00:36:12,699 --> 00:36:15,979
It's understandable. It's normal to feel lost sometimes.

406
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:18,116
Yeah!

407
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:20,853
Because none of it was real,

408
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:24,800
everything felt fake.

409
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,180
And you know what the worst part is?

410
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,680
I've lost my confidence.

411
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,440
Even though I…

412
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,900
I'm supposed to be a CEO, someone who inspires others,

413
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,325
I should have confidence and trust myself.

414
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:48,150
But it turned out that

415
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,280
I can't even trust myself anymore.

416
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,679
So what shall you do next?

417
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,749
I don't know either.

418
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,440
Dream.

419
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,680
Did you hear what my sister was saying?

420
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,931
Clear things up.

421
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:23,023
I don't want to see my little sister sad like this.

422
00:37:25,694 --> 00:37:29,033
I want to compete with her at her best.

423
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:33,032
Excuse me.

424
00:37:34,939 --> 00:37:38,919
Thank you for calling me.

425
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:44,214
Take care of my sister.

426
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,419
I'm going to be sick.

427
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:14,339
Are you all right?

428
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Just… okay…

429
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:28,039
I'm sorry...

430
00:38:28,882 --> 00:38:31,362
for making you feel bad.

431
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:40,329
I can't forgive you...

432
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:48,088
for making me so confused.

433
00:38:48,939 --> 00:38:55,530
I don't know what's real and what's not anymore.

434
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:03,560
Now, I've lost all my confidence.

435
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,380
So…

436
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:12,665
how can we help you regain your confidence?

437
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:24,043
Can you show up like that time again?

438
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:32,050
Like at my sister's birthday party.

439
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:37,500
You were so amazing.

440
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:43,700
You were like a charming prince riding in on a white horse to rescue me.

441
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:55,020
Since then, I've felt so much more confident.

442
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,800
Just hang on for a bit.

443
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,700
How did I get home?

444
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,300
Hey, Grandma.

445
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,580
How did I get home last night?

446
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,750
Well...­

447
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,400
You came home by yourself. Don't you remember?

448
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,400
All right, I'm hanging up. Nature calls.

449
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,300
My stomach is killing me.

450
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,100
You!

451
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,900
Stop being stubborn and come home.

452
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:41,200
I'm not going back!

453
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,300
I'm tired of being with you.

454
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,800
Don't act like it's a game.

455
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,600
My dad just doesn't want us to end up in the gossip news.

456
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,400
It's annoying.

457
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,000
Here, take the check. Will you go home now?

458
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,900
Are you trying to buy me off?

459
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,600
I have some dignity, you know.

460
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,800
You've lived for money all your life.

461
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Do you want to end up starving on the streets like a stray dog?

462
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,300
A dog with an owner is better off than a stray.

463
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,000
Don't you get it? I don't want to live my life day by day

464
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,700
taking orders like a dog.

465
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,000
I don't want it anymore, I've had enough.

466
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:36,500
Even if I were a stray dog, I wouldn't go back to live with a jerk like you!

467
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,400
Stop! Stop it now.

468
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,300
Grandma, what are you doing here?

469
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,800
You're attacking a woman.

470
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,200
Do you even deserve to call yourself a man?

471
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,200
What a disgrace! Keep it up, and I'll call the police.

472
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,700
Get out of here!

473
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,400
- Let's go, Dad.
- Get lost!

474
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,300
Day, take care of this. I have to go now.

475
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,300
All right, good luck.

476
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:22,060
[Is preparation for Demo Day going smoothly?]

477
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:34,840
[If you need help, just tell me.]

478
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:42,159
[How are you? I'm worried.]

479
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,600
Where are you going?

480
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,200
I have to go to the Demo Day orientation with the CEOs.

481
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,400
Yes.

482
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,200
Take off your shirt.

483
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,200
Mr. Ji. Are you crazy? In front of so many?

484
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,100
I can't take off my shirt here.

485
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,100
Take off your shirt. I'll go there myself.

486
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,900
- Really?
- Yes.

487
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,300
When you saw me wearing it, you didn't say anything.

488
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,600
Don't dilly-dally.

489
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,800
Next time, if you see me putting it on, just tell me.

490
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Still have a hangover?

491
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,800
Just a little bit.

492
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,900
And did you go home safely last night?

493
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,100
Have you talked with Korn yet?

494
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,700
What does Korn have to do with it?

495
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,500
Well, last night you went home with Korn.

496
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,900
- Last night?
- Yeah.

497
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,000
Korn came to pick me up?

498
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,700
Hey, don't you remember anything?

499
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,300
How about you?

500
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,300
How about the news?

501
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,400
I'm fine already.

502
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,700
Just mind your business.

503
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,300
Don't mix personal issues with work.

504
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,100
Hello.

505
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,200
How come Mr. Ji is here, not Mr. Pakaphon?

506
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,600
Mr. Pakaphon is busy.

507
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:37,235
[Demo Day]

508
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,900
Demo Day will be the day to showcase all the hard work you've put in.

509
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,000
After a brief pitch on stage, you'll have to answer tough questions

510
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,400
from the committee and investors in attendance.

511
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,700
I heard there's going to be a live broadcast?

512
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,100
That's right.

513
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,800
And if we don't win, what happens then?

514
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,500
It depends on whether any investors are interested in your project.

515
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:10,900
Good Goal is also scouting for potential partners in AI on Demo Day, right?

516
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,300
That's correct.

517
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,000
I heard they're looking for partners in AI,

518
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,800
and we only have Alice Company and Samkorn Thai Tech in our group.

519
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Maybe it's best not to dwell on that. It'll just add more pressure.

520
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,600
Sometimes,

521
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,700
success isn't always measured by winning.

522
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,100
Let's just do it and do our best

523
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:47,600
and show the investors how dedicated and passionate we are about this project.

524
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,800
That in itself is a success.

525
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,900
So, no need to worry.

526
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,700
Everyone can do it.

527
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,000
- Right.
- Yes.

528
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,300
Yes.

529
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,100
- Bank.
- Huh?

530
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100
Can I borrow your suit?

531
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,400
I want to wear it on Demo Day.

532
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,900
Why do you need to wear a suit?

533
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,300
You want to impress Dream.

534
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,200
No.

535
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,100
Dream mentioned she'd lost her confidence.

536
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:34,000
She wanted me to show up like a charming prince on a white horse, like at the party.

537
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,800
Dramatic. Anyway, just come and get it.

538
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,700
A charming prince on a white horse?

539
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,100
Why does it have to be white?

540
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,000
Korn.

541
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,200
Is your mom feeling better now?

542
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,700
Do you know my mother?

543
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,300
The other day I ran into your father.

544
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:06,400
He mentioned your mother fell and was hospitalized.

545
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,900
No, she was fine this morning.

546
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,300
Do you know about your father's work?

547
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,000
I don't know.

548
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
What do you want to say?

549
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,060
Remember the guy who attacked me?

550
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:33,100
Your father is leading their protest against downsizing manpower.

551
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,100
This jar is for the stomping horse recipe.

552
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,200
Hello. I remember.

553
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:58,300
My wife still can't walk. She had surgery and wears…

554
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,100
a cast. Well, I have to…

555
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,900
take care of her closely.

556
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,100
Yeah, go protest without me.

557
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,500
You already know what to do.

558
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,100
You lied to your friends to keep me out of trouble. Right?

559
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,700
If you want to go out and fight,

560
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,300
Dad, go ahead. I don't mind.

561
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,900
I'm not fighting anymore. I'm just out of energy.

562
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,300
Because of me, right?

563
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,700
Not at all. Don't think too much. It's nothing.

564
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,700
Dad, you don't have to worry about my future.

565
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,900
Just focus on your job.

566
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,400
As for me, I'll do my best at work, too.

567
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,100
Dad, you don't have to worry about causing me any problems.

568
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,200
But you are my pride.

569
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,400
I can't cause you any problems.

570
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,100
But I don't want to be your source of pride.

571
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,800
Living life to make others proud is exhausting.

572
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,800
And I didn't want to disappoint anyone.

573
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,400
So I always had to pretend to be good.

574
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,700
I think… we don't need to be proud of each other.

575
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,300
So what then?

576
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,500
Well…

577
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,700
just being father and son,

578
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,600
loving each other like we do, is already enough.

579
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,800
That's a touching sentiment.

580
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,400
It doesn't match.

581
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,800
You're beautiful and running late.

582
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,700
What's wrong with you? Why are you making such a face?

583
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,900
The future of my company depends on my pitching today, Grandma.

584
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,000
Then what?

585
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,300
I feel that I can't trust myself at all.

586
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,900
I feel stupid,

587
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,400
incompetent.

588
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,600
You are good, so you can do it, child.

589
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,800
My sunflower is about to bloom.

590
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,834
[Demo Day]

591
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,900
If you don't want to lose,

592
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,100
you can just leave.

593
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,000
Are you feeling unwell?

594
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,600
Your face looks pale.

595
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,300
You don't need to worry about me.

596
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,900
No matter how sick I am,

597
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,300
I'll still crawl up there and pitch my work to beat you.

598
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,000
You really know how to talk.

599
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:32,400
Hello, Alice. Is the kid on the Sandbox logo really you?

600
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,300
Yes.

601
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,400
I once read an interview where Ms. Roslin mentioned that this child

602
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,100
was playing on the swing and fell.

603
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,500
So she asked her father to lay sand to protect her from getting hurt.

604
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,400
That's the story behind Sandbox.

605
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,600
I can't believe you're the inspiration for Sandbox.

606
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,100
Okay.

607
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,200
A child playing on a swing. What does that mean?

608
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,900
When I applied for Sandbox,

609
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,500
I used your story with Dad as my motivation. That's all.

610
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,000
Dad?

611
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,300
You left him and you took Dad's story and claimed it as yours?

612
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,400
You blatantly stole other people's memories like that.

613
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,600
Aren't you ashamed?

614
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,300
So what?

615
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,000
Those looks and gestures like that. Just stop it.

616
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,800
Accept it for once that you are not that confident.

617
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,800
You stole my memories...

618
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,400
because you were afraid of not being able to enter the Sandbox

619
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,200
and losing to me?

620
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,900
Should someone like me be afraid of losing to

621
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,400
someone who has failed their whole life like you?

622
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,100
Just apologize to Dream.

623
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,900
Why should I?

624
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,200
You really did steal it.

625
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,300
You felt like you weren't good enough

626
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,700
and didn't trust yourself,

627
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,900
so you had to do that.

628
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,300
And once you lied,

629
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,400
you had to keep it a secret...

630
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,600
and always feel uneasy

631
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,800
about stealing other people's memories as your own.

632
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,400
You must be very tired.

633
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,900
How could someone like you understand that?

634
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,700
I know.

635
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,600
I've also stolen other people's memories.

636
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:24,000
And I also know how awful it feels.

637
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,100
Dream, do you remember the suit I wore when I first met you?

638
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,000
I initially thought of wearing it today.

639
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:58,400
And why not? I think it looks good.

640
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,100
It's not me.

641
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,400
I don't want to confuse you.

642
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,800
Dream, can you completely forget me from before?

643
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,800
I just want you to remember me like this,

644
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,400
dressed like this.

645
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,100
And I wasn't born on the 7th either.

646
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:36,800
But there's one thing I don't want you to forget or be confused about,

647
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,700
because it's true.

648
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,100
What's that?

649
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,800
That Samkorn Thai Tech has come this far...

650
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,600
because of you.

651
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,500
That's true.

652
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,300
Never doubt this.

653
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,100
I want you to be confident

654
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,800
because this is your gift.

655
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,300
Thank you so much.

656
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,900
Ms Dream, it's time to rehearse.

657
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,200
So, I'll get going.

658
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,400
Ms. Yaya.

659
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:10,300
Have you seen Dream? I have something to discuss with her.

660
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,600
Dream should be…

661
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,400
What do you have to discuss with our CEO?

662
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,200
If you have anything, just tell us. We'll inform her.

663
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,000
Okay. How is she now?

664
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,500
She's stressed, of course,

665
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,800
because our future depends on the Demo Day.

666
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,800
So please tell her not to stress.

667
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,900
I will be Plan B for her.

668
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,100
Plan B?

669
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,300
Are you taking it seriously?

670
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,500
Yes, if she fails,

671
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,800
I will personally fund your company.

672
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,600
Anyway, I'll leave it to you.

673
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,500
Did he really say that?

674
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
We'll make it through.

675
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,900
- Is that for real?
- Yep.

676
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,700
I'm fine with that.

677
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,500
What's the vibe here?

678
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,800
Hey, Korn, dude.

679
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,500
What?

680
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,200
Don't stress anymore, buddy.

681
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,700
We've got a Plan B in place now.

682
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,900
What's Plan B?

683
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,800
Well, if we can't find any investors,

684
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,400
Mr. Ji will personally invest in us.

685
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,200
Are you guys serious about this?

686
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,200
So you're not interested?

687
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,200
Korn,

688
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,100
where are you going?

689
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,700
Mr. Mark.

690
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,600
Hi there, Mr. Korn.

691
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,100
I have something to ask you.

692
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,100
Remember that offer you made to my company?

693
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,700
Are you still interested?

694
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,200
Absolutely.

695
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,000
Then, why the sudden change of heart?

696
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,700
I've decided I don't want to resort to Plan B.

697
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,300
What?

698
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,700
I don't want to rely on anyone else's help.

699
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:20,100
I want to be the one doing the choosing, not the one being chosen.

700
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,700
Mr. Mark, can you take the entire Samkorn Thai Tech team?
[Next Episode]

701
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,700
So it's like I buy out your company.

702
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,800
Good luck to all teams on Demo Day.

703
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,900
I am very interested in the technology of Samkorn Thai Tech.

704
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,800
I would like to know the human recognition accuracy rate.

705
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,200
Let's brag first and let Korn increase the actual rate later.

706
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,400
Are you going to lie?

01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:02,700
♫ When will the stars in the sky return and shine again? ♫

719
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:07,840
♫ Shining so I can see the way, shining so I can find you ♫
