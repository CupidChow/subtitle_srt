All right, let's make it happen.

The Morning AI crew is also in the mix.

4
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:52,296
We've got to nail this.

5
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:53,554
Let's settle this fairly.

6
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,161
All right, let's see who Dream chooses.

7
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:56,224
Hey… keep it down, will you?

8
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:58,614
She's ruthless.

9
00:00:58,614 --> 00:01:00,104
I'm entering the bid.

10
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:06,011
A company I interviewed yesterday dealt with a bad ransomware attack.

11
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,900
So was our company.

12
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,839
But we swiftly resolved it within a few hours.

13
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,899
Indeed, we have a team of skilled and seasoned developers.

14
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:36,100
We addressed the issue just in the nick of time.

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,640
Moreover, we're continuously improving our systems

16
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,959
to prevent such incidents from recurring.

17
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,220
However, in your case,

18
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,399
it's about people's safety.

19
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,520
If the system is under development,

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,640
and the same issue arises,

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,359
isn't there a risk to users' lives?

22
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,972
We need to halt this interview. That journalist—

23
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,691
I'm familiar with him.

24
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:13,639
He's known as the "trash reporter".

25
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,679
I've been aware of him since the Nature Morning days.

26
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,039
Aren't you going to intervene?

27
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,411
Rest assured, Mr. Ji.

28
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:23,404
Dream has got this under control.

29
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:26,638
We'll just observe from here.

30
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,859
All right,

31
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,910
I believe I have all the information I need.

32
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,366
Thank you.

33
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,510
Please don't leave just yet.

34
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,260
Is there more?

35
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,720
Unless I'm mistaken,

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,086
you're planning to twist the facts.

37
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:53,130
"Sunshine Company was hacked"

38
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,779
"Lacking standards and security," right?

39
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:02,446
Twist?

40
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:04,860
But these are the facts.

41
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,700
Aren't you curious who's behind the attack?

42
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,028
You know who it is?

43
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:11,828
Yes.

44
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,700
- It's not going to work.
- Player.

45
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,239
What's going on here? Why the long faces?

46
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,980
I've been pondering over the ransomware's hostname

47
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,219
and trying to decode the anagrams.

48
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:28,479
It might give us a clue about the perpetrator.

50
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:37,580
I noticed Fafad's profile in our control tool.

51
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,760
His username was "Vampire".

52
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,719
Hey… I recall that Fafad has a bat tattoo on his finger.

53
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,819
After analyzing the event log, we identified the attacker.

54
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,610
We conducted a port scan on the suspect's laptop

55
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,539
and confirmed that the IP Address and hostname matched.

56
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,523
That's how we pinpointed the hacker.

57
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:32,060
We've already forwarded the evidence to the authorities.

58
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,160
They've just informed us that the suspect has been apprehended.

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,286
So, who's the suspect?

60
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:40,908
His name is Fafad.

61
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:43,400
He was once part of our development team.

62
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,538
However after the incident,

63
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:48,325
Morning AI poached him as their CTO.

We also have CCTV footage showing

68
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,779

71
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:11,170
would certainly draw more attention and views.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,840
Well, since the matter has been resolved,

73
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,560
our editor will likely drop the story.

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,783
But if the mastermind

75
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:24,650
is the son of Morning Group's CEO,

76
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,831
it's bound to be headline news.

77
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,644
How can you overlook this?

00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:29,875
I adhere to ethical standards.

Besides, I'm not authorized to report on crimes that are still under investigation.

80
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,260
It could influence the case.

That's fine.

00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:41,371

You have detailed information.

90

Otherwise, people might suspect that you're in collusion with the culprits.

This time, we're up against many companies.

111

They're all well-known and formidable.

So,

how do we outdo them?

114
00:07:31,203 --> 00:07:37,120
Winning? I thought our goal wasn't to win the bid but to gain experience.

115
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:41,000
Right, I forgot about that.

If that happens,

We'll see about that.

My phone died, too.

Thankfully, True Angel called an ambulance for her.

158

It was just a minor fall.

159
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:51,240
Grandma, that was no minor fall. You were unconscious.

160
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,159
Grandma,

161
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,200
do you realize even a minor fall can be dangerous at your age?

162
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,159
If you needed something, you could've asked. I could have gone shopping for you.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm fine, dear.

164
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,000
But what if something serious had happened?

165
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,400
What would I do then?

I'm still here, don't worry… there, it's okay.

167
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,408
It's not okay. You're in the hospital. That's not okay.

168
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:23,261
And if something happened to you, I'd be lost.

169
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm fine. Please, no tears.

170
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm just scared… If I lost you, I'd be alone.

I'm right here. No more tears, okay?

Try not to laugh too much. It might hurt.

178
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,000
Careful, laughing might make it worse.

179
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,900

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,400
I should be the one comforting you.

You were crying like a little kid.

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Even more upset than I was.

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,300
It was a shock.

186
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,200
Anyone would have been upset seeing her like that.

187
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,700
You know…

188
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,100
it seems you care about Grandma more than I realized.

189
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,900
Well,

190
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,800
she's all I have.

191
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,800
If she hadn't taken in an orphan like me back then,

192
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,600
I might not have made it.

193
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,500
I would probably have starved on the street somewhere.

194
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:00,600
To me,

195
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
she's more than family.

196
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,000
And…

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,830
She always talked about you when I was growing up.

198
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,000
And I must have written you a hundred letters.

199
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
So,

200
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,800
I guess my feelings for you...

201
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,600
had been building for a long time.

202
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,300
When exactly it started, I can't say.

203
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,100
Do you think...

204
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,500
my words might change your mind?

205
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,700
Hold on a second.

206
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,300
Hello?

207
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,600
Where are you?

208
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,200
At the hospital. Grandma had a fall.

209
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,400
She's okay, though. Lucky for us, True Angel called an ambulance in time.

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,900
Don't worry about it.

211
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,000
We'll talk more later, okay?

212
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,700
This is delicious.

213
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,700
Korn,

214
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,500
did you spend the whole night here?

215
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,000
I was tweaking some features of Miracle World.

216
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,600
What features exactly?

217
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,200
When Grandma was hospitalized,

218
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,000
nobody could explain to the doctor how she fell.

219
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,600
We should equip Grandma with something like a black box.

220
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,260
Imagine integrating chips into her glasses that record visuals,

221
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,700
sounds, locations, activities, and even her heart rate.

222
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,800
We'd be able to access all this data from the last 24 hours

223
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,200
and sync it with her profile in True Angel,

224
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,100
along with the travel log from the black box.

225
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,600
Wow, that's an impressive concept.

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,700
But is it feasible?

227
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,800
We have to make it work.

228
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Don't worry. I'll get it done for you.

229
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Do you know how airplanes have black boxes?

230
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,200
I envision this chip as a mini black box inside the glasses.

231
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,300
It'll have its own unique algorithm.

232
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,500
What I'm looking at is…

233
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,800
If there's an accident,

234
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,400
True Angel would instantly send the data to the hospital.

235
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,900
They'd have immediate access to her medical history,

236
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,500
blood pressure, heart rate,

237
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,800
and what she was doing before the accident.

238
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,900
So, we could trace back the information for a full day.

239
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
We're here, everyone.

240
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
Duck rice, anyone?

241
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,500
This way, the medical team can quickly analyze symptoms and the patient's behavior.

242
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,700
These new Smart Glasses features will be the centerpiece of our bid.
[Smart Glasses]

243
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,600
It's a perfect pitch.

244
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,819
I'm going to double-check the documents.

245
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:20,419
You've checked them a million times already.

246
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:23,040
I just want to make sure everything's complete.

247
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,000
You don't seem ready.

248
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,000
And are you prepared for prison?

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,400
That was all a big misunderstanding.

250
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,000
We'll sort it out in court.

251
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,300
What does that have to do with the bidding?

252
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:52,659
Honestly, not much.

253
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:56,900
I never thought a big company's CEO

254
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,600
would dare to hire someone with a criminal record.

255
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,790
Watch your language, or you might face a lawsuit.

256
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
I'm not worried.

257
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
I have evidence.

258
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm not intimidated by a low-level hacker like you.

259
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
Just be cautious today.

260
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,000
There are lots of journalists around.

261
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,800
Dream,

262
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,700
don't let those words get to you.

263
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,500
Stay calm.

264
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,100
Hey,

265
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,600
you've really changed.

266
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,300
You're more composed and patient now.

267
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,000
I've got to be better for you.

268
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,240
­[Sandbox]

269
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,200
Will it be announced at 2:00 p.m?

270
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Yes.

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,400
Just 2 minutes to go. Hang tight.

272
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,700
Stop hitting refresh, you'll break the key.

273
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,700
Why the rush?

274
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,200
They're only announcing the five finalists, not the winner.

275
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,800
So you're calm?

276
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,700
You smell like incense like you've visited every temple in town.

277
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,200
Any help is welcome.

278
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
Guys, it's 2:00.

279
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

280
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,440
Let me hit refresh.

281
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,759
Do it!

282
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,500
Look, it's up!

283
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,400
- Hit enter.
- Doing it.

284
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,800
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

285
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,400
[Congratulations, your company has been selected for the next round.]

286
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,200
Everyone…

287
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
listen up.

288
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,300
- Yeah?
- What's up?

289
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,200
Glasses up.

290
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,300
A huge thanks to all of you.

291
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,200
Let's make the most of this moment,

292
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,100
Cheers!

293
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,400
Cheers!

294
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,200
Careful! You're spilling it.

295
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,300
Remember,

296
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:58,200
if we win, you owe us.

297
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,600
No chance. Getting this far is already a miracle.

298
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,680
Cough up that 10 million.

299
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,000
- Well, turns out I might be able to.
- Really now?

300
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,900
And you're going to shave your head, remember?

301
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,000
No big deal. I've got my razor on standby, Bank.

302
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,500
- Seriously?
- As serious as can be.

303
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,500
Yaya, and don't forget your promise.

304
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,600
If this actually happens, I expect a 10-carat diamond ring.

305
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,700
10 carats?

306
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,600
Will it be enough?

307
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,700
I mean, do you think I have enough money to buy it?

308
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,200
Just messing with you.

309
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Hold on a second, you two are acting strange.

310
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,000
Spill it. Are you proposing, or did you already… you know.

311
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
I've had a hunch since the bid day.

312
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
He's been super focused lately.

313
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
I've always been diligent.

314
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,600
Nope, you weren't always this driven.

315
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,800
You're keeping secrets.

316
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:01,700
Come on, just tell them. It's weird like this.

317
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,400
Today feels like the right day.

318
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,200
All right…

319
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
Yaya, stand up.

320
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
No way.

321
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Come on!

322
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
Up you go.

323
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,100
Fine, okay, we're…

324
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,300
we're seeing each other.

325
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,799
Cheers!

326
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,599
- Cheers!
- To the couple!

327
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,300
Absolutely.

328
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,000
All right, enough teasing me. I've got a question, too.

329
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,600
Dream…

330
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,300
have you decided?

331
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,400
Who's the one for you?

332
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,300
Hey, that's not fair! You can't ask that, Yaya.

333
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,200
- Why not?
- Just don't.

334
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,800
- Aren't you curious?
- I don't want to know. Too much to drink?

335
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,900
You really don't want to know?

336
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,400
No, drop it. You always do this.

337
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,100
I need a bathroom break.

338
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,700
This isn't right.

339
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,600
Does anyone want more to eat?

340
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,700
Sure.

341
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,700
Just call the waiter.

342
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll be right back.

343
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,200
Let's order some more.

344
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
Excuse me, sir.

345
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,600
Dream,

346
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,100
what's got you here all by yourself?

347
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,100
I get it.

348
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,900
You're trying to spare their feelings.

349
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,700
You don't want to lose them.

350
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,800
But you cannot have it all.

351
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,900
You can't keep avoiding the issue.

352
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,200
Do you get it?

353
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm saying this as your boss, okay?

354
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,200
Just hear me out.

355
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
All right, I know.

356
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,300
And you? Why do you dodge the truth?

357
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,000
What do you mean?

358
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:42,000
Alice, we're family.

359
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,300
Grandma misses you every day.

360
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,600
She's hoping you'll come home to us.

361
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,300
I know that.

362
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,500
Think it over, will you?

363
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,000
You should, too. Let's clear the air.

364
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,800
Understood.

365
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,900
Heading back inside?

366
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,000
You go on ahead. I need a moment to breathe.

367
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,400
Could I get a papaya salad with crab and fermented fish?

368
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
- You're having that now?
- Yeah, what's up with that?

369
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,300
Have you had too much to drink?

370
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,200
Maybe just a little.

371
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,900
Decisions like these...

372
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
aren't easy.

373
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,600
My sister's in a tough spot.

374
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,100
But trust me,

375
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,000
Dream will make the right choice for herself.

376
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,700
Yes.

377
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,700
Korn and I, we're on the same page.

378
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,600
We'll be happy with whatever Dream decides.

379
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,900
Come on, Mr. Ji, show some backbone.

380
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,300
You can dish out tough talk to others, but when it's personal, you clam up.

381
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,700
You've got a point.

382
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,000
Tough talks hit differently when you're on the receiving end.

383
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,500
Life's full of these weird moments.

384
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,300
If things don't go your way, drinks are on me.

385
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,200
Appreciate it.

386
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
It's a deal.

387
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,900
Everything is good?

388
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,700
I'm okay.

389
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,400
I think…

390
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,200
it's time to choose a bar.

391
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,600
Could you come to see me?

392
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I need to tell you something.

393
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,900
I'm sorry for calling you both out here together.

394
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,200
But there's something I need to say to you both.

395
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,200
You and Ji wanted an answer.

396
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,600
I've made up my mind.

397
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,000
It's all right, Dream.

398
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,610
Just say what you need to.

399
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,000
I can't be with anyone right now.

400
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,400
I need to look after Grandma.

401
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,700
I need to focus on my work.

402
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,700
Ji, you,

403
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
you're like family to me.

404
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,000
It might sound selfish,

405
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
but I can't bear the thought of hurting anyone again.

406
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:51,900
I can't lose you or Ji.

407
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,500
I'm really sorry.

408
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,460
Dream, no need for apologies.

409
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:10,170
I respect your choice.

410
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,739
I'll always be here for you, supporting you as a friend.

411
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:20,499
That's a promise.

412
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,580
Thanks, Korn.

413
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:32,119
I respect your decision, too.

414
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,160
And I'll always be here, like a brother, wishing you the best.

415
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,223
Don't worry about it.

416
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,756
Thanks a lot, Brother Ji.

417
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,798
Stop patting me, I'll start crying again.

418
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,810
Even when you brace for it,

419
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:31,380
it still stings to hear it all out loud.

420
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,000
Right, Korn?

421
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,696
Brother…

422
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:38,579
I'm just being honest.

423
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:44,776
Feeling any better?

424
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:03,507
Grandma…

425
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:19,670
You look as down as a drooping sunflower.

426
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:30,340
Grandma, I turned down Ji and Korn.

427
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,056
I felt so guilty saying it,

428
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:41,116
but I couldn't lead them on any longer.

429
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,923
Didn't you have feelings for either of them?

430
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:52,276
Well, before Korn left for America,

431
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:55,176
I did feel something.

432
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,410
But now, everything's changed.

433
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:07,460
Ji, Korn, and I, we've been through so much together.

434
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,019
We've shared hardships, chased dreams.

435
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:20,580
The bond I have with both of them,

436
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,383
it's deeper than romance.

437
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:30,490
It's good you didn't leave things unresolved.

438
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:40,259
I wonder how they're feeling now.

439
00:33:47,883 --> 00:33:51,499
Don't be down, Ji. You know what monks say,

440
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:58,870
"Where there's love, there's bound to be pain. Amen!"

441
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:01,956
Ai-oon.

442
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,919
Grandma, what brings you here?

443
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:21,983
I've been missing you, so I decided to drop by.

444
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:37,336
Dream mentioned how lovely your place is.

445
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:40,076
I really should've visited sooner.

446
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,400
Next time, just let me know, and I'll come and get you.

447
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,460
You shouldn't have to travel all this way alone.

448
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,119
It's no bother at all.

449
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:56,660
I just wanted to see you, to see how you're getting on.

450
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:02,089
Living by myself, eating by myself… it's been like this.

451
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:05,916
Maybe I should start visiting you more often, then?

452
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:09,543
Grandma, anytime you miss me,

453
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:11,782
just say the word, and I'll be there.

454
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,123
My dear, don't isolate yourself.

455
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:28,839
Whether you're overjoyed or down in the dumps,

456
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,050
remember, you can always share a laugh,

457
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:39,723
or shed a tear with me.

458
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,140
But, please,

459
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:48,750
don't wallow in solitude, my good boy.

460
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:10,288
Yes, Grandma.

461
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:25,663
Thank you so much.

462
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,076
Thank you so much.

[Morning Group] [Sandbox]­

464
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:52,196
I always make room for fresh faces.

465
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:59,316
If you've got real talent and the guts to step forward,

466
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,589
then come and chat with us.

467
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:04,243
Here at Morning Group,

468
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:07,515
we cherish talent

469
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:12,798
and stand ready to back up every gifted individual.

470
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:15,679
Thank you.

471
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,683
I'd like to ask something.

472
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:32,479
Thanks.

473
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:43,149
You claim personnel is the be-all and end-all that organizations must hold onto.

474
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:44,739
Indeed.

475
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,243
It's vital to retain top-notch staff,

476
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:52,596
but they need to be under control.

477
00:37:53,180 --> 00:38:00,003
Yet, the truly skilled and gifted require their liberty, their room to breathe.

478
00:38:00,003 --> 00:38:04,703
Nobody appreciates being stifled or micromanaged.

479
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:09,748
And if a firm can't provide them with stability or advancement opportunities,

480
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:12,148
naturally, they'll move on.

481
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:16,682
It seems, though, that Morning Group prefers those

482
00:38:16,682 --> 00:38:19,916
who are more controllable, wouldn't you say?

483
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,473
Cat got his tongue?

484
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,560
Alice!

485
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:34,296
It's Alisa, not Alice.

486
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:37,196
And I'm no longer your stepdaughter.

487
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,036
But still, thank you for everything.

488
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,360
Where are you going?

489
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,020
Ms. Alice.

490
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,483
I owe you an apology.

491
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,080
To me?

492
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,419
Yes.

493
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:27,482
I…

494
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:36,170
I regret speaking so harshly to you three years ago.

495
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,663
I'd like to ask how you feel when

496
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:44,519
someone says you are successful

497
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,759
because your father is a wealthy businessman.

498
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,840
And if you're really competent,

499
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,523
you should start from scratch at Sandbox, shouldn't you?

500
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:00,210
I've been working with someone who insulted me all this time?

501
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:07,340
I was out of line. I didn't even know the whole truth.

502
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:10,219
Sorry.

503
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,996
Your insults that day...

504
00:40:16,357 --> 00:40:21,130
motivated me until these days,

505
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,020
Thank you.

506
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,260
Okay.

507
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,723
Apology accepted.

508
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,599
Thank you.

509
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,903
I'll take my leave now.

510
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:48,280
Pretty cool!

511
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,779
Thanks, friend.

512
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:53,679
Not you.

513
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,120
Korn.

514
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:10,479
Korn.

515
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:12,200
Are you doing all right?

516
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,180
I'm hanging in there, thanks to all of you.

517
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,256
Let me help mend your spirits.

518
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:21,060
It's all right.

519
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,623
I do miss how things used to be.

520
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:34,436
- My friends,
- Well?

521
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,263
I owe you all an apology.

522
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:42,186
I've dragged you into my mess.

523
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,183
Had you worked with a better CEO,

524
00:41:46,183 --> 00:41:49,780
you wouldn't have had to endure these hardships because I lost my way.

525
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,380
Come on.

526
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,219
What are you even saying? That's ridiculous.

527
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:59,459
If it were just about the money,

528
00:41:59,459 --> 00:42:01,869
I would've left ages ago.

529
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,480
Sure, I love a good payday,

530
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,883
but I've never once regretted our time together.

531
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:17,699
Even through the tough patches, I found joy.

532
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:25,559
I appreciate you, you're incredible!

533
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,159
Chin up, no need for tears.

534
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:29,700
I really mean it, thank you.

535
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,860
It's all good.

Look, you guys… the sign.

00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,059

00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,979
Funny, their success turned you into a cheerleader.

547
00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:14,943
When he was starting up, all you did was discourage him.

548
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:20,823
That's exactly why it's going up.

549
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:25,260
Should Korn ever say or do something that rubs me the wrong way again,

550
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,079
I'll bite my tongue.

551
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,703
I'll give him my trust, unlike before.

552
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,338
It looks great. Mom, check out the logo.

554
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,760
Remember, the deadline is next week.

555
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,299
Mr. Ji, good to see you.

556
00:43:48,299 --> 00:43:50,195
Please, prepare the documents in this table.

Phakaphon.

558
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:51,979
Yes.

559
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:54,299
What is this?

560
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,268
Someone sent me an email.

561
00:43:56,268 --> 00:43:58,900
It is an application that supports orphans.

562
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,399
I think it's interesting. So I want you to read it.

563
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:03,979
Give me some details.

564
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:08,180
It's a startup that connects orphans with

565
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,880
homes and guardians.

566
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,561
The CEO is an orphan herself,
[Dream Fulfillment Project]

567
00:44:13,561 --> 00:44:15,499
so she's really dedicated to the cause.

568
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:18,661
I thought you might want to check it out…

569
00:44:18,661 --> 00:44:20,979
So they are doing charity without generating revenue.

570
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:28,260
So no reason to spend our partner's hard-earned money on them. Right?

571
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,779
I know. I'm going to cancel the meeting.

572
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:35,243
Don't. Schedule a meeting with the CEO.

573
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:37,519
Yes, sir.

574
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,939
Alice, I'm looking to bring in investors to scale up.

575
00:44:45,939 --> 00:44:48,923
Really? Are you sure that's wise?

576
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:50,260
Absolutely!

577
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,650
We were finalists in a major bidding competition.

578
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,936
It shows we're up to par and have an edge.

579
00:44:56,936 --> 00:45:04,200
But taking on investors without any revenue could devalue the company.

580
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,196
Plus, you'd be giving up some control.

581
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:10,696
The idea is to boost revenue.

582
00:45:10,696 --> 00:45:12,679
We need to build traction first,

583
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:15,459
then consider hedge funding. There's still time.

584
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:17,579
I disagree.

585
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,340
If we don't secure the capital to improve our products now,

586
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,119
we won't get that traction.

587
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,119
I get where you're coming from,

588
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,760
but I'm not keen on outside investors right now.

589
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,459
It could dilute our executive power

590
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:28,963
and make it harder to steer the company.

591
00:45:28,963 --> 00:45:33,679
And remember, your company's value can still skyrocket.

592
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:34,860
Let's not rush this.

593
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,260
I still think…

594
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,970
Let's leave it there.

595
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:41,116
You've been doing great.

00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:43,636
No need to rush things.

Okay.

We match orphans with families.

604
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:45,220
And if the families need help, we're just a call away through the online system.

605

I've gone through your business plan.

606
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:51,799
Have you considered how much your company is worth?

607
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,680
Not yet.

608
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:01,199
And how much are you looking to raise?

609
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:08,876
Around 3 million.

610
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,859
I don't think my company will be able to invest in your company.

611
00:47:17,939 --> 00:47:19,939
But…

612
00:47:19,939 --> 00:47:22,356
I would like to invest personally.

613
00:47:27,459 --> 00:47:29,623

I'll put in 3 million myself

616
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:40,160
and add another 10 million as a donation.

617
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:47,176
If that works for you, I'll send over the terms next week.

00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,300

Grandma, what's your take? Do you like the place?

631
00:49:11,996 --> 00:49:16,294
It's a big house. Too much for me to clean.

Listen, Mom, you won't have to lift a finger. I've got it all covered.

634
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,639
It's spacious and comfy, sure.

635
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:32,049
But without family, it's just empty space.

Absolutely, Grandma.

640
00:50:01,939 --> 00:50:06,700
I don't need looking after. I'm not a child.

Or do you think it's still too early?

684
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,140

I'm okay.

00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,500
Been through it a couple of times myself.

Though, probably not as rough as what you've been dealing with, Brother.

706
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,781
It's something you can get used to.

707

So, what's up? Why the call?

708
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:52,199
Ms. Roslin has shown some interest in investing in your venture.

709
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:56,220
And you're telling me this because…?

710
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,600
Why not just head to the office?

711
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,560
Or is it that you're avoiding the CEO?

712
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,419
No, it's not that.

713
00:56:07,419 --> 00:56:09,380

00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,980
Are you open to this investment?

715
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:18,020
So if I say no, you've got a ready-made excuse for Rose?

716
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,960
You've made it clear before,

717
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,956
that you didn't want my money involved.

718
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:31,499
True.

719
00:56:31,499 --> 00:56:33,499
I don't.

720
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:36,069
Okay. That's it.

721
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:38,119
I'll let Ms. Rose know.

722
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,209
Hold on, Mr. Ji.

723
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,323
I'd like your genuine take on this.

724
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:56,180
Just give it to me straight, emotions aside.

725
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,300
What's your verdict?

726
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,239
You remember my track record, right?

727
00:57:06,939 --> 00:57:08,939
I do.

728
00:57:08,939 --> 00:57:12,200
Among the companies, you decided not to invest in,

729
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,930
none succeeded.

730
00:57:15,419 --> 00:57:18,000
If I let Sunshine Company slip by,

731
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,459
I'll break that streak.

732
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:27,560
For an investor, it's a chance I'd hate to miss out on.

733
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:33,476
Then go for it.

734
00:57:35,423 --> 00:57:40,419
You turned down my offer before heading to the States.

735
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:43,636
Why would you consider it now?

736
00:57:43,636 --> 00:57:49,156
Because now, my tech is your Plan A.

737
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:52,436
I'm nobody's second choice…

738
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,300
So, yeah, let's make it happen.

739
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,876
Thanks a ton, Brother.

740
00:58:04,539 --> 00:58:06,600
I should thank you.

741
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,599
So, how confident are you about the final pitch?

742
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,659
I'd say about 99.9% there.

743
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:22,639
And the tiny 0.01%?

744
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,660
That's just in case luck's not on my side,

745
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:31,443
or if Uranus aligns weirdly with my horoscope or something.

746
00:58:31,443 --> 00:58:33,002
Cut the crap.

747
00:58:33,002 --> 00:58:35,919
Hey, I'm just messing with you.

748
00:58:35,919 --> 00:58:37,579
I've got this.

749
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:41,339
I mean, we're aiming to be the next big Unicorn, right?

750
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:42,740
Always the big dreamer, huh?
[Unicorn: Start-ups worth more than one billion USD]

751
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,419
I'm serious! It's not just talk.

752
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:46,499
Sure sounds like it!

753
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:49,256
Never doubt what young folks can pull off.

754
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,750
You make it sound like we're ancient or something.

755
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:58,959
But we've got this, right, Dream?

756
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:00,721
Absolutely…

757
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:06,610
Let's give it our all, reach for those stars!

758
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,740
Are we teaming up or what?

759
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,519
Am I a lone wolf here?

760
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:20,250
Come on, let's do this!

761
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:48,660
Hello, I am Pafun, CEO of Sunshine Company.

762

And today we will take you into the Miracle World.

763
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:02,483
Finally, we can all create a world where we can live happily together.

764
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:12,109
A safe world with advanced and convenient technology that leaves no one behind.

765
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,380
No matter how far we go,

766
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:19,400
I won't forget to put my heart into it.

767
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,209
It looks like it was time for your medicine five minutes back.

768
01:00:23,209 --> 01:00:26,379
Angie is calling Ms. Sa.

769
01:00:30,454 --> 01:00:31,079
Hey, child.

770
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,240
Hey Grandma, what's up? Did you remember to take your meds?

771
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:41,220
I'm on a run. Angie's giving me an earful.

772
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,217
Ugh… Angie, you have such a big mouth.

It's Sister Dream for you, okay?

791

Hey, Grandma. Hi, Mom.

Sunshine, why'd you leave me behind?

793
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,280
No worries, kiddo.

794
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,820
You think you can handle her for one day?

795
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,163
It's all good, buddy.

796
01:01:54,163 --> 01:01:56,239
But man, Sunshine's sprouting up quickly!

797
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:00,019
Seeing her like this… kind of makes me want a kid of my own.

How about finding a girlfriend first, Brother Ji?

799
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:06,239
I've been too busy looking out for you guys to even think about dating.
