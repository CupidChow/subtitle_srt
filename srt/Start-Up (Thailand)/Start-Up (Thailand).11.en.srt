So what?

8
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,301
So, I can't be a good brother to you anymore.

00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:07,286
And if not, who are you?

10
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:09,366
A competitor.

12
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,863
Okay, thanks.

13
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,299
Mr. Mark!

14
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,620
Can you spare me a moment?

15
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:45,199
I heard you're looking for a skilled developer for your company, right?

16
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,740
Are you interested, then?

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,280
Yep, why not?

18
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,103
Don't you want to hear the conditions first?

19
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:55,619
No need.

20
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,980
Who wouldn't want to join one of the world's top companies?

21
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,099
Only a crazy person would refuse.

22
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,086
And you're okay with leaving your team behind?

23
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:06,912
Don't you even care?

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,649
No, I don't.

25
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,970
Do you need an inhaler?

26
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,183
It might help.

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,459
No, thanks. I've got good medicine. I'm fully aware and confident.

28
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,850
All right, everyone. Let's gather around for a moment. I'd like a box.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,650
We'll draw lots to decide the presentation order.

30
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,030
Everyone, grab one.

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,320
It's exciting! I just want to double-check a few things.

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,520
Which team is number 1?

33
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,820
Alice Company…

34
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,720

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,639

39
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,679
We still have an hour to prepare.

40
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:32,540
Once it starts, Team 1 can be on standby here.

41
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,290
For now, please follow me to the side room.

42
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,343
Would you like an inhaler?

43
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:44,547
You might need it.

44
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,200
Mr. Mark!

45
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,660
Mr. Korn.

46
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:04,630
I have something to ask you.

47
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,436
The offer you made the other day,

48
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:12,659
is it still on the table?

49
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,730
Yes, of course.

50
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,116
What changed your mind?

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,783
I don't want to go with Plan B.

52
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:22,383
What?

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,306
I don't want to rely on anyone else's help.

54
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:28,843
I want to be the one choosing,

55
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,988
rather than being chosen.

56
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:36,690
Then I'll send you an offer via email.

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,039
Thanks, but I want to change the conditions.

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,563
Mr. Mark, can you take the entire Samkorn Thai Tech team?

59
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:49,459
Everyone?

60
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,123
So it's like I buy out your company.

61
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,019
Yes,

62
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,219
and…

63
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:06,430
I would like you to keep offering the True Angel service, too.

64
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,760
Listen to me, Mr. Korn.

65
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:17,150
I'm not a philanthropist.

66
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,826
So let me think about it first.

67
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:29,740
I'll make a decision at Demo Day. Okay?

68
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,219
Of course.

Hello.

Ms. Rose, this is urgent.

Mr. Ji is unwell. He's going to the hospital.

I need some advice on what to do.

77
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,519
Mr. Ji already sent a message saying he'd like to resign from being a judge today.

00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,421
Hello, everyone,
­[Sandbox: Demo Day]

82
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:30,126
it's been over five months since our five new startups

83
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:34,239
of the 9th Sandbox come up with new business models

84
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,670
to change the world.

We now have investors here and online from many countries around the world.

86
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,936
They are waiting to hear your ideas.

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:59,150
The winner of Demo Day will receive an extra 5 million baht in capital.

88
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,193
For the teams that don't win,

89
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:08,892
you still have a chance to get the attention of other investors.

90
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:13,103
Good luck to all teams on Demo Day.

91
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,936
Hello, I'm Alice from Alice Company.

92
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:27,800
At present, in this country,

93
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,541
there are CCTV cameras installed everywhere for crime prevention

94
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,370
and to ensure the safety of life and property.

95
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,270
Unfortunately,

96
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:43,093
many of them aren't really utilized until after the crimes take place.

97
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:44,599
Most importantly,

98
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:50,679
it's the human eye that has to monitor all these CCTV screens, 24-7.

99
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,656
But imagine what it would be like if our CCTV

100
00:07:54,656 --> 00:08:00,066
could help us prevent emergency situations just in time.

101
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,559
To overcome current limitations,

102
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:10,940
our company has developed AI Technology Solutions called the "Security Smart Camera."

103
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,903
Everyone can simply call it a Smart CCTV.

104
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:27,301
It has sensors to detect suspicious activities or sounds of distress.

105
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:35,078
Our CCTV will alert police stations or relevant parties immediately.

106
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:39,477
Our sensor system can even detect in the dark.

107
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,299
Just one small camera can replace ten traditional ones.

108
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,247
Most importantly, it covers a full 360-degree view.

109
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:51,274
To enhance the camera's capabilities,

110
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:55,143
we've integrated an Ultrasonic Sensor

111
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:58,520
to increase the accuracy of object detection.

112
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,611
The ultrasonic waves penetrate and assess the thickness and type of objects,

113
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:08,446
providing more precise identification than standard image scanning.

114
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,520
Let me tell you. This camera is remarkable.

115
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,259
By combining machine learning

116
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:14,918
and image processing technology
[Image Processing: Digital technology for processing images, resulting in usable data]

117
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:18,560
with the Ultrasonic Sensor,
[Image Processing: Digital technology for processing images, resulting in usable data]

118
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,500
we've achieved a detection accuracy...

119
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,520
of 93.2%.

120
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:37,836
93.2%?

121
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:41,640
Our team's accuracy is currently at 92.4%.

122
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,496
Sounds like bullshit?

123
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,720
Of course.

124
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,823
I don't think so.

125
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:54,628
Based on their IR report, they can go up to 99.98%.

126
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,720
What would you do if competitors copied your products?

127
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,939
Of course, the product design might be copied,

128
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:16,023
but the camera accuracy cannot be imitated.

129
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,937
We will develop our technology rapidly

130
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:24,516
in such a way that other competitors won't be able to match our accuracy.

131
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:25,543
Thank you.

132
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:26,740
Thank you.

133
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,883
How effective will it be in terms of reducing labor costs?

134
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:37,127
Theoretically, the labor costs will be one-sixth of what they used to be.

135
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:38,784
In the case of The Best department store,

136
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:45,370
our technology could save labor costs by 20 million baht per year.

137
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:56,903
And do you know what the impacts of your technology will be?

138
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,560
Oh, Dad!

139
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,276
Korn, your dad is here.

140
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,879
Yeah.

141
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,359
No. Those who are not involved cannot ask questions.

142
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:16,279
I'm the one who's involved, maybe the most.

143
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,620
My men and co-workers are about to lose their jobs because of that company.

144
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,260
Korn!

145
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,319
Damn it.

146
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:34,979
Who has more right to be here than I do?

147
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,376
It's okay.

148
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:39,279
Let him ask questions.

149
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,316
So, I would like to ask you.

150
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:48,520
When capitalists like you say you can save just a bit of 20 million?

151
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,716
It's by 20 million, not "just a bit" of 20 million.

152
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,453
Okay,

153
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:56,840
20 million baht,

154
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:03,680
but have you ever thought about

155
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,336
how many families who lose their income would be affected by it?

156
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,450
Some are fathers who are breadwinners.

157
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:19,660
Some are mothers with children who go to school.

158
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:26,880
Some are brothers and sisters who leave school to earn money for their younger siblings.

159
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,890
These people are about to starve.

160
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:34,690
You're killing them indirectly. Don't you realize it?

161
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:42,303
Please tell me if the technology you developed helps or destroys.

162
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:52,773
Some people said something similar about 200 years ago.

163
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,300
When trains first appeared,

164
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,530
rickshaw pullers and horse carriage drivers protested like you're doing now.

165
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,743
If we had complied with their demands,

166
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:15,343
would we have trains now?

167
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,588
Do you want the world to stop developing?

168
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:23,263
Is that what you want?

169
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,239
I wish to make this world a better place. That's why I'm doing this.

170
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:37,436
So our children and descendants can live well, safely, and comfortably.

171
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,140
That is my answer.

172
00:13:55,219 --> 00:14:00,330
And I believe that is your son's answer as well.

173
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,520
Actually, your son is in the same field as me,

174
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,720
and he has also come up with a downsizing solution using AI.

175
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,600
So why attack me when your son has chosen the same path?

176
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:20,380
It's like she's throwing bombs here.

177
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:37,423
Even though my son's chosen the same path,

178
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:42,530
I have to oppose what you guys are doing anyway.

179
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,139
If everyone in this world were like you and my son,

180
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,759
sure, the world would rapidly change.

181
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,840
But it will destroy the lives of those who cannot adapt.

182
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,160
A tremendous number of them.

183
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:07,959
Those people will be left behind.

184
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,039
That's why someone like me has to put on the brakes,

185
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,036
to slow down change.

186
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:27,389
So everyone can adjust and adapt their thoughts,

187
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:34,819
their lives, and walk together in the world of reality.

188
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:47,719
My son's path and mine may not be the same.

189
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,559
My son fights for the future,

190
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:58,216
but I'm fighting for today's world.

191
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,999
Maybe we'll find the right pace for this change...

192
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,703
without having to hurt anyone.

193
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,950
I hope so.

194
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,300
Dad.

195
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:39,610
See, you can look people in the eye.

196
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,939
I want to invest 50 million in Alice Company,

197
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,703
in exchange for 51% of stocks. Is Miss Alice interested?

198
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,780
No, sir.

199
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:20,740
Today, I'm not here to secure additional investment.

200
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,259
I can run the company alone with the sales alone.

201
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:31,559
But I'm here to look for a global partner for collaboration.

202
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,359
Thank you,

203
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,743
I am very interested.

204
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,179
However, there's another team we're considering.

205
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,223
Sure, thank you.

206
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,039
I think he meant us.

207
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,679
Of course.

208
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,680
Hello, I'm Oak, CEO & Co-Founder of Carsup Company.

209
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,960
The best secretary for the cars you love.

210
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,900
Prakan is an intelligent AI solution to help you manage risk,

211
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,560
both in life and property.

212
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:17,600
Taste Map is a platform that connects foreign tourists with local market retailers.

213
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:22,871
Hey.

214
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:26,660
Should we bump up the accuracy rate in our presentation a little bit?

215
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,683
Is that a good idea?

216
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,510
Korn, what should we do about the percentage?

217
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,560
Let's brag firstand let Korn increase the actual rate later.

218
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,679
Korn can do it, right?

219
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,783
Are you going to lie?

220
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,090
If we don't lie, we will lose.

221
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,159
But if we lie, 92.4%

222
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,620
will immediately become fake.

223
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:25,100
Hello, I'm Pafun from Samkorn Thai Tech.

224
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,520
Today, technology in our world is making great leaps and bounds,

225
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,580
making life easier for all of us. Right?

226
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,159
But at the same time,

227
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,660
these technologies can make some people's lives more difficult

228
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,643
as they struggle to adapt to change and keep up with technology.

229
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:50,359
Samkorn Thai Tech believes that good technology should help people live in harmony.

230
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,660
This is the beginning of True Angel.

231
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:06,870
Angie, please read this message to me.

232
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:18,219
True Angel is an AI-based service developed to assist the elderly

233
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,059
who need help with day-to-day activities.

234
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:23,359
True Angel can be used

235
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,039
with both Android and iOS systems and can also be linked with accessories

236
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,640
such as watches to increase detection accuracy.

237
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,790
Thank you, Angie.

238
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,963
True Angel serves as a personal angel

239
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:49,279
to take care of our parents, grandparents, and those we love.

240
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,420
It connects our world with theirs.

241
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,579
So, let's see how True Angel takes care of the people we love.

242
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,039
Grandma, you're exerting yourself too much.

243
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,520
Your heart rate is increasing.

244
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,139
I suggest you take a rest.

245
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:18,079
The voice command function can accurately capture your voice.

246
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,920
Even if the patient cannot speak clearly,

247
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,140
they can still tell True Angel

248
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,439
to help in many ways, such as describing the path ahead,

249
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:31,520
reading directions using the app's camera and sensors,

250
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,159
reminding them to take medicine, sleep, train their memory,

251
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,550
exercise, and do physical therapy.

252
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:43,039
Additional watch functions can also track sleep patterns,

253
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,039
blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature.

254
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,079
What's even more special is that it can detect vibrations

255
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,540
and abnormal movements if the patient falls, faints,

256
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,039
or feels dizzy.

257
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,439
Grandma, what's wrong? Did you fall? Please answer me.

258
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:07,970
If you don't answer, Angie will call the hospital and inform your child.

259
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,479
Grandma is okay. No need to call.

260
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:15,159
Then Angie won't call the hospital,

261
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,880
but it will report to Grandma's daughter

262
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,099
that Grandma walked a lot today and took her medicine late.

263
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,379
If there is an accident,

264
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:32,139
the system will notify the patient's relatives and nearby hospital immediately,

265
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:36,399
including the coordinates of the hospital and the patient.

266
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:41,523
Is the solution too specific for some groups?

267
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:45,579
Our target is not just the elderly and patients in the country,

268
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:48,800
we're aiming for users worldwide.

269
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:56,010
We offer services in a variety of languages to prepare for the aging society of the future.

270
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,059
I am very interested in the technology of Samkorn Thai Tech.

271
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,810
I would like to know the human recognition accuracy rate.

272
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,400
Our app's accuracy rate is 92.4%.

273
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:45,370
So, that means it is a bit lower compared to Alice Company.

274
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,800
Not necessarily.

275
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,600
The accuracy rate is not just about numbers alone.

276
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,783
We have to look at other factors and the environment as well.

277
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:19,939
As everyone knows, True Angel is an application used on mobile phones and watches,

278
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:24,703
so we have to minimize battery usage so that users can use it for as long as possible.

279
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:28,279
For this reason, we need to find middle ground between the accuracy rate and

280
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:30,936
reducing the app size.

281
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:39,279
Did we calculate the mean value?

282
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,510
We did. It's always the incompetent ones that talk a lot.

283
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,223
Then, how about we do this?

284
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:52,359
Let's have someone from Alice Company come on stage

285
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,559
and have a challenge with Samkorn Thai Tech.

286
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,296
So we can see their results.

287
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,720
Of course.

288
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:38,763
In 300 meters, turn left into the hospital.

289
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,276
We're ready.

290
00:26:21,276 --> 00:26:24,840

It's a fake gun.

295
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,139
Your system should be able to differentiate between fake guns and real guns.

296
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,639
What the heck?

297
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,961
Next, we will test the True Angel system. Mr. Pakaphon, please move around.

298
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:49,280
We will let the system work and see how it is.

Your blood pressure is very low.

Your temperature is 40 degrees.

310
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,780
If you don't rush to the hospital, you may go into shock.

311
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,623
Into shock?

312
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:28,320

They said 92.4%. This doesn't even reach 50%.

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,400
and putting my number on True Angel's emergency list.

358
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,300
It's very thoughtful.

359
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,700
You bet.

360
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:54,200
Who would have thought the app I was against would be so useful?

361
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,500
Well, it was your job.

362
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,100
Grandma!

363
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,800
Grandma!

364
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,700
I did it. My team got 1st place!

365
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,500
1st place! Oh, good job!

366
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,800
At first, I told Alice that I would outdo her within three years.

367
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,800
But this hasn't even been three years yet.

368
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
In hindsight, I may have underestimated myself big time, Grandma.

369
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:37,100
Yes, my grandchild is the best. The most generous.

370
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,600
You can excel at everything. You are an angel.

371
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,000
Okay, Grandma. You're acting strange today.

372
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,400
How strange? No, I'm not.

373
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,200
It's so strange. Normally, you aren't this sweet to me.

374
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Is something wrong? You look suspicious.

375
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,500
Nothing.

376
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,400
Grandma.

377
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,500
What is Mom doing here?

378
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,100
Dream.

379
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,800
Dream.

380
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,400
Wait a minute. I'll talk to her myself.

381
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,500
Dream.

382
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,900
Grandma, why did you let her stay?

383
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,200
Don't you resent her? She left Dad.

384
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,500
Why should you resent her?

385
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,200
It's me who should be angrier than you.

386
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,500
Then, why did you bring her here?

387
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,200
Dream, if we cut ties with everyone we don't like,

388
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,200
we'd be left all alone in the end.

389
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,900
I don't know. I'm not you. I can't understand you.

390
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,700
I don't know why you brought her here. Tell her to leave.

391
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,700
Dream,

392
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,000
your mom's new husband doesn't seem like a good person.

393
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm afraid if we chase her away, your mother might get hurt.

394
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,000
So I brought her here.

395
00:35:51,500 --> 00:36:00,100
I think your mom's life hasn't been as easy as we thought.

396
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,500
Let's forgive her, child.

397
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,800
Just wait for our son.

398
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,000
Dear, you went all out with shrimp, shells, crabs, and fish.

399
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,300
Only a gourd is missing.

400
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,100
My son's team won. How can it be less than this?

401
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,900
It has to be something special, you know?

402
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,200
Okay, special.

403
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,700
- Dad.
- Yes?

404
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,800
Did you meet Pafun?

405
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,100
How was she?

406
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,400
She's cute, smart,

407
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,200
and well-spoken with great leadership skills.

408
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,100
Then should we tell Korn to…

409
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,900
to make a move on her?

410
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,000
Not a bad idea.

411
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,700
Korn and Pafun, a business merger. Keeping it in the company.

412
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,100
You are a sly plotter.

413
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,800
Dear, you must teach your son.

414
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,600
Find a way to cut it short.

415
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,700
Then Korn can merge the shares into one.

416
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,100
Clever.

417
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,900
What are you doing?

418
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,000
When did you arrive?

419
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,500
There's plenty of food.

420
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,900
Come. Come quickly.

421
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,000
- I'll change my clothes first.
- Yes.

422
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,700
So you can eat in comfort.

423
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,100
Dad,

424
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,200
teach me how to cut it short.

425
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Yes, it's my job to do so.

426
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,900
So you overheard what we were talking about?

427
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,800
It means you like that woman, right?

428
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,500
You like her. Look at your eyes. She's your type, right?

429
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,800
She is his type.

430
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
- I'm eating.
- Wait!

431
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,100
- What are we waiting for?
- Wait for our son.

432
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,500
Mother, take the medicine.

433
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Is this your medicine?

434
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,100
It is.

435
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,000
Thanks.

436
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,100
Take medicine before meals first, Mom.

437
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,400
Well, then I'll prepare breakfast.

438
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,200
Okay.

439
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,000
Grandma, Mr. Ji was sick yesterday,

440
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,500
but he still came to cheer us on.

441
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,900
Luckily, we had True Angel;

442
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,800
otherwise, I don't know what would have happened.

443
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,800
But now he's safe in the hospital.

444
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,500
I already visited him. Angie called me.

445
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,100
This boy always makes me worried.

446
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,200
Grandma,

447
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,600
I want to know how you and Mr. Ji met.

448
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,900
It was when you were in eighth grade.

449
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,920
He was an orphan

450
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,100
but received a moral award.

451
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,200
No wonder you call him a good boy.

452
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes. At that time,

453
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,900
he helped me with housework like sweeping and cleaning.

454
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,200
He also helped me save money.

455
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,800
He's both smart and kind-hearted.

456
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,500
I know that.

457
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,300
Congratulations.

458
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,600
For what?

459
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
That you won.

460
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,300
If you don't feel it, just keep it to yourself.

461
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Think about what you like.

462
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,400
Mom is living with Grandma now.

463
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,400
How come? And Grandma let her stay?

464
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,800
She does.

465
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,900
I should ask you. Why has Mom come to stay with me?

466
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,600
Good Goal offered to buy Samkorn Thai Tech for 90 million baht.

467
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,500
90 million.

468
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,700
90 million?

469
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:23,000
And following the acquisition, you will work at our HQ in Silicon Valley for 3 years.

470
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,200
Is that okay?

471
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,800
The US.

472
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,100
After that, we can still continue to offer the True Angel service, right?

473
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:40,400
Yes, we all still want to continue True Angel.

474
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,800
Of course!

475
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,200
This is the contract. Please feel free to revise it.

476
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:56,400
So, we will go through this,

477
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,800
and will get in touch with you in no time.

478
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,200
All right!

479
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,500
I hope I'm getting a positive answer soon.

480
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,200
See you guys at Silicon Valley.

481
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
What does it mean?

482
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,300
All right, yeah!

483
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,700
Bye-bye, guys.

484
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,800
Let's boom, come on.

485
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,900
Samkorn Thai Tech!

486
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,200
What are they so happy about? It's annoying.

487
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,100
What's so great about Samkorn Thai Tech?

488
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,700
Why are they getting offered 90 million?

489
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,900
Isn't it strange?

490
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,700
Yes, it is.

491
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,700
I can't believe the fortuneteller was right.

492
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,600
He said our work would skyrocket, and it did.

493
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:06,100
That came true, but the part about love hasn't.

494
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,800
You bet.

495
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,800
Speaking of love, you might have already found it.

496
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,800
You just don't realize it yet.

497
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,600
Just sit far away from me.

498
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
You're cutting it short again.

499
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Do you believe in fortunetellers, too?

500
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,200
I've been superstitious from the start, dude.

501
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,900
Really?

502
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,100
Well, everyone, we're going to the US.

503
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,000
Let's practice speaking English.

504
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,900
Let's talk in English at the office to get used to it. Good idea?

505
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,100
It's a piece of cake for us.

506
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,000
This friend of mine speaks English effortlessly.

507
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,500
The color of the sun is? Yellow!

508
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,900
- Your favorite fruit?
- Mango!

509
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,259
- Knife?
- Swiss!

510
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:47,700
Oven?

511
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,700
Microwave…

512
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,900
You ruined the joke!

513
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
What's wrong with you?

514
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,500
When I think about Samkorn Thai Tech not being around anymore,

515
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,100
it makes me feel hollow.

516
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,500
Don't be dramatic.

517
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,100
Samkorn Thai Tech is about to go global.

518
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,300
Keep it in mind, Korn, 90 million.

519
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,300
But it feels really hollow. We put so much effort into it.

520
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,900
I really want to see your old company.

521
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,700
You guys must have a lot of memories there, right?

522
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,000
Do you want to come by?

523
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,900
We'll take you there.

524
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,300
Why not?

525
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,300
So, let's have a BBQ party, shall we?

526
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,300
Okay, but it's on the CEO.

527
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,200
You will be rich soon but are still stingy.

528
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,600
I'm not rich yet. Let's go quickly.

529
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,000
- Let's go.
- Okay, it's on me.

530
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,400
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

531
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,870
- You said it.
- Leave the computer here. Let's go.

532
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:55,500
[Samkorn Thai Tech]­

533
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,100
We're here, sir. Oh, printer. Oh, dust.

534
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,000
They're all in the same spot.

535
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,800
- Hey, Bank.
- What?

536
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,100
The comics are still here.

537
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,600
- Oh, there's tons of dust.
- And the fridge still smells the same.

538
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,200
What's in there?

539
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,600
Supposed to be nothing.

540
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,900
Hey, everyone, listen up!

541
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,500
This is our Samkorn Thai Tech Company.

542
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,700
Initially, it was called Korn Thai Tech.

543
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,300
But then, Korn agreed to change it to include all three of us.

544
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,000
Right.

545
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,300
So the two of us could all be part of it.

546
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,400
Originally, the logo was just one color. With us three, it became three colors.

547
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,800
RGB, like this. Do you like it?

548
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,900
Nope. Do you like me?

549
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,500
And what's what around here?

550
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,700
My bad. This one was Bank's table.

551
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,820
That part was Korn's table.

552
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,000
And that was mine.

553
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,200
We used to have a gaming chair too,

554
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,000
but we sold it for a good price.

555
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,100
Miss Yaya, I'll grill this for you. Here you go.

556
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,200
Thanks.

557
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,700
That's my pork. Key.

558
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,500
Bank, why do you always pull my leg?

559
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:11,400
Hey, after three years in Silicon Valley,

560
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,500
what do you think we'll be like?

561
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,900
Beats me.

562
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,800
I'll work hard and save up.

563
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,800
I want to build a family home and settle down.

564
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,100
Before building a home, you need a wife.

565
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,900
Don't worry.

566
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,200
I've got someone in mind.

567
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,900
And you, Bank? What's your plan?

568
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,100
I think I'll buy a Government Saving lottery ticket for my mom.

569
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,600
My mom's going to win every draw. How about that?

570
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,500
Old-fashioned. Crypto's the trend now.

571
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,000
You think my mom knows crypto?

572
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,100
True. Just like my mom.

573
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,400
And you, Dream, what about you?

574
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,000
Me?

575
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,400
What do I want to do? It's a tough one.

576
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,000
What's on your mind?

577
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,100
I mean… I want us all...

578
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,800
to try another business venture.

579
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,500
Something different.

580
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,700
What kind of business?

581
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,200
I want to create a Miracle World.

582
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Miracle World?

583
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,100
Yeah… I envision it developed from True Angel.

584
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,200
So, Angels can be hidden in the house or anywhere,

585
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,600
wherever our loved ones are.

586
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,600
That way, we can be sure they're safe.

587
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,200
Sounds too idealistic, doesn't it?

588
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,500
No, sounds like a miracle, doesn't it?

589
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,400
- Really?
- Guys,

590
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,800
remember what Albert Einstein once said.

591
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,200
"Imagination is more important than knowledge.

592
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:13,800
Because knowledge has limits, but imagination is limitless."

593
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Where'd you dig up that quote?

594
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,400
Why?

595
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,900
So, is this Miracle thing possible?

596
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,000
It's possible.

597
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,500
We've got 90 million.

598
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,900
Yeah.

599
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,600
All right, what if this Miracle thing pans out?

600
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,900
I won't tie the knot just yet.

601
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,200
Hold on a little longer.

602
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,900
Count me in.

603
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,700
Me, too.

604
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,400
Why not?

605
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,700
Okay.

606
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,200
That settles it.

607
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:04,100
I also want to design a full-service home for seniors and patients.

608
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,000
Mr. Ji, are you better now?

609
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,300
Are there any updates?

610
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,800
Samkorn Thai Tech is signing an acquisition deal with Good Goal today.

611
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,500
Acquisition deal?

612
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,900
Yes.

613
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,500
It's acquisition, not an investment?

614
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,300
Yes, it's acquisition.

615
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,800
Mr. Ji.

616
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,700
How do I look? Am I looking strong?

617
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,700
Is something the matter, Mr. Ji?

618
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,300
Where are Dream and Korn?

619
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,000
They are signing the deal at Good Goal.

620
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,100
Good morning, guys.

621
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,800
Hello.

622
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,700
You're early. I've got the contract ready. Should we go?

623
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,900
Is everything all right?

624
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,000
Got a copy of the contract? Let me give it a once-over.

625
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,700
Yeah, from what I can tell, it's all good.

626
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,600
Why the worried look then?

627
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,100
Any issues?

628
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,600
Nothing.

629
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,500
Then we're good to go.

630
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,900
That's the problem.

631
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,700
We need to halt the signing.

632
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,300
Why?

633
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,600
Hold up. If everything's fine, why stop them?

634
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,200
Doesn't it strike you as odd?

635
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,100
Why would they drop 90 million on a small start-up?

636
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,200
No help is unconditional in business. They must have some ulterior motive.

637
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,300
Sounds like jealousy to me.

638
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,300
You're just upset that Korn and Dream are headed to the US.

639
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,600
So you are trying to stop us.

640
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,400
I'm not that petty.

641
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,600
Mr. Korn, sign here. And Pafun, right here.

642
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,100
Sure.

643
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:48,000
I am afraid that they are not acquiring your company for its value.

644
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,500
All they want is to recruit engineers.

645
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,500
[Dev: Software developer]

646
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,200
How?

647
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,400
This is an acquihire.

648
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,300
[Acquihire: Acquiring a business to hire skilled workers, rather than for the product.]

649
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,700
Ac-hi, what?

650
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,600
The moment the contract is signed,

651
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,300
your team will be disbanded.

652
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,500
Welcome to Good Goal.

653
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,400
Thanks a lot.

654
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,500
Thank you.

655
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,800
You said you'd take us the whole team.

00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,400
This is fraud.

657
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,600
I tried to convince the Head Office,

658
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,700
but I don't have the authority to make this decision.

659
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,200
I was giving my opinion as an investor.

660
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,400
If it sounded like nitpicking, it's a shame.
