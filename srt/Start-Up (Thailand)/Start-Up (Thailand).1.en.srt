Hello, I'm Thanakorn.

57
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,179
I have something I want to ask Ms. Alice.

58
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,720
Go ahead.

59
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,311
I want to ask. How do you feel about people gossiping that you are successful

60
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:31,710
because your father is a wealthy businessman?

61
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,560
Shouldn't true success start from scratch,

62
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,556
like building from a sandbox. Right?

63
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:43,660
First of all, Ms. Rose,

64
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,720
could you explain this platform again?

65
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,039
Why is it called "sandbox"?

66
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,394
Sandbox is a platform that supports a new generation of entrepreneurs,

67
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:59,820
preventing them from getting hurt when their business fails.

68
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,200
Thank you. I'm fortunate to work with a father,

69
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,720
who supports me like a sandbox and always takes care of me.

70
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,140
Therefore, I didn't need to start from scratch here.

71
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,539
As for the question about people gossiping,

72
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,099
I don't think I can satisfy everybody.

73
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:23,139
Then again, I don't really pay attention to the comments on social media.

74
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,200
The online world has its good and bad.

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,639
Fake news and real news.

76
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,260
It's important for viewers to filter true stories from fake ones,

77
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,256
and consume news mindfully.

78
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
Yes.

79
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,016

Ms. Alisa?

85
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,850
Yes, I have taken a selfish path.

86
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:40,263
But with time, it became evident thatI had made the right choice.

87
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:48,359
I believe in using the brain more than the heart when making decisions for success.

I'm resigning because I want to start my own business.

136
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,579
A business that will leave us in debt and to starve.

137
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,923
If it's successful, our family will be better off.

138
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,122
You can do them both. I don't see any need to resign.

139
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:04,115
Let's be realistic. How many years have you had this dream?

00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:05,919
I haven't seen anything substantial at all.

141
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,083
That's why I want to resign and make it successful!

142
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:15,860
You are selfish! Your salary alone can't even cover our family's expenses.

And your crazy business, when will it be profitable?

I've had enough of it, enough!

148
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:35,059
Being a dog with an owner is better than being a stray dog on the street.

Do you understand? At least he still has food to eat.

He doesn't have to endure the rain, starving to death on the street.

151

I can't let our children starve to death!

Can you please calm down?

153
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:46,065
I can't watch my child starve to death. Do you understand?

154
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:53,465
Fine! If you're still thinking about resigning, just quit being the head of the family!

159
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,400
Well, Dad doesn't want to work there anymore. He is unhappy.

Hey! So where will we get money to live?

161
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:37,920
That's a matter for adults. Children don't have to fight.

Yes.

00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,540
Why?

524
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,459
I have seen many businesses focus only on profit,

525
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,432
but forgetting to maintain the user base.

526
00:48:51,432 --> 00:48:53,619
It is similar to hoping to reap what you sow.

527
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:55,301
And we hurry to collect the fruits and eat them.

528
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:57,219
It may give us a stomach ache.

529
00:48:57,219 --> 00:48:59,360
But if you do this,

530
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,499
it's like you're floatingin the middle of the sea.

531
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:04,900
One day, you will die of hunger.

532
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,709
Won't you think of drinking seawater instead of waiting for the rain to fall?

533
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,760
We can't drink seawater anyway.

534
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,719
Why don't we wait for it to rain first?

535
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:18,299
And then we drink rainwater all at once. Isn't it better?

536
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:24,900
You are right that trying to make a profit right from the start

537
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,259
of a new business is compared to drinking seawater,

538
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,299

You called those people to come after me.

It's difficult. I didn't think it would be this difficult.
