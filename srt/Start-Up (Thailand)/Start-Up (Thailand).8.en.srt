00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:49,795
Hi there, Grandma.
[Previously]

3
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:53,281
Please, don't tell Dream about my illness.

4
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,272
Yes.

5
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,081
And if you have to pick one, which Korn do you like better?

6
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:00,674
You should put our logo on your main page.

7
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,698
I picked your company out of all the candidates.

8
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:05,710
It was for your mother.

9
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,060
I'm sorry, Dream, but we're not taking this job.

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,283
What do you like about me?

11
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:26,796
Let me think…

12
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,599
Hmm…

13
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,399
Well.

14
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:36,750
I'd say it's your hands.

15
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:44,265
They're always there for me, protecting…

16
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:50,440
and supporting me as I pursue my dreams.

17
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,859
So, make sure you take good care of them.

18
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,160
Korn.

19
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,820
What's on your mind?

20
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,320
Yes.

21
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,000
You know, I've just realized how awesome my hands are.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,015
Imagine that! That wound of yours is pretty noticeable.

23
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:17,339
How did you get it?

24
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:24,280
Aw, check him out. He's totally smitten.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,260
Korn, we definitely need to backup our data, buddy.

26
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,233
Your heart could use one, too.

27
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:37,499
It's important to have backups. You know, the heart isn't easy to restore like data.

28
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:39,460
Are my words philosophical?

29
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,444
Where's that coming from?

30
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:43,156
Just a thought that popped into my head.

31
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:45,860
Don't worry about me, focus on yourself.

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,840
Did you back up your data from last week?

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,379
- Man!
- Or history will repeat itself again.

34
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,519
So, have you done the backup yet?

35
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,980
Not yet. I'll do it when I get back.

36
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,339
Oh boy, we're all doomed if you don't hurry! Get back to it and do it, quickly!

37
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:58,410
Got it!

[Episode 8: Back Up]

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,500
Everyone, let's exercise together. Start with position one.

40
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
A lot of folks don't realize how serious Parkinson's disease is compared to other illnesses.

41
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,610
But the truth is, it really throws a wrench in daily life, messing with balance,

42
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,099
walking, talking, and even something as simple as eating.

43
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,520
Basically, it's a brain condition that messes with movement.

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,670
That's why folks with Parkinson's are more accident-prone, and it can be life-threatening.

45
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,379
So, can we scope out the area first?

46
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:37,300
Of course.

47
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,419
Thank you so much.

48
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,500
I'm looking to interview the elderly who are interested.

49
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Okay, sure.

50
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:22,179
Any idea?

51
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,800
Well, we need to make it stand out among other apps for people with disabilities.

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
It should be easy to use, convenient,

53
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,047
and practical.

54
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:42,943
And most importantly, it should be safe and address both physical and mental well-being.

55
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,120
Imagine having a personal guardian angel looking out for you as you age

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,779
and nurses aren't available to take care of you around the clock.

57
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:57,621
That's the kind of support I'd want when I'm older.

58
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:01,399
It could remind me to take medicine.

59
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,603
Your idea is brilliant.

60
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:10,339
So, let's develop AI that works across devices like phones, glasses, or watches.

61
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:13,060
It'd be easier for patients and the elderly.

62
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,260
And…

63
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,419
It's like having a personal guardian angel by their side.

64
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,179
Hey, what about a mobile app?

65
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:22,300
Think it'd work? What do you think?

66
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:29,710
That sounds good and let's name it…

67
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,360
True Angel. What do you think?

68
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,650
Sounds promising. Having "angel" in the name adds a nice touch.

69
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,820
If Ms. Yaya likes it, I like it too. True Angel.

70
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,639
Good idea, I like it.

71
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,090
Then I'll try to secure funding in case there are any investors interested in our project.

72
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,600
- Good.
- Great.

73
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,803
I'd better start working.

74
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:54,403
Come on.

75
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:56,978
You're always snacking.

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,539
I won't agree. It's an intensive service technology but not lucrative.

77
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,420
How can a small startup like you achieve that?

78
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:10,690
Why? Why can't we?

79
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,300
Do you want to hear a painful truth or a lie filled with hope and dreams?

80
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,759
The painful truth.

81
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,339
Try calculating the expenses of True Angel.

82
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,859
How much would the cloud, server, and transaction fees cost yearly?

83
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:32,099
So where can we get that much money?

84
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,260
From advertisements… From investors.

85
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,700
If DAU or Daily Active User is 1,000, it costs 1 million.
[DAU: Daily Active User ]

86
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,160
If DAU is 10,000, then 10 million.

87
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,099
The more users, the higher the costs.

88
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,960
Who'd invest such an amount of money?

89
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,400
There must be someone who is interested in our business plan.

90
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,020
No, the only thing that attracts investors is money.

91
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,839
But for some people, money may not be everything.

92
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,180
Even I am not convinced. How can you convince others?

93
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:15,792
And if I can convince you?

94
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,300
No way.

95
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:32,400
If I manage to convince you, it'll light up.

96
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,600
Let me tell you about my childhood memory.

97
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,181
You are already wrong before you begin.

98
00:07:57,181 --> 00:08:01,713
You need to approach investors with data and facts, not a story.

99
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:03,940
Please listen to me first.

100
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:11,760
I used to have a penpal.

101
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,396
He once wrote to me about his dog passing away.

102
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:21,636
He said…

103
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,157
"The dog I love has left this world."

104
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:34,183
Losing Lucky suddenly like that...

105
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:41,800
made him see how unpredictable life is.

106
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,219
We could be here today, gone tomorrow.

107
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,936
Nobody knows.

108
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,890
That letter taught me one thing.

109
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,523
If we want to do something,

110
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:07,059
we've got to give it our all,

111
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,983
so we don't regret a thing later.

112
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,130
I lost my dad suddenly, too.

113
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,683
Heart attack.

114
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:34,513
I thought...

115
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:38,276
if only there was some warning,

116
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,159
maybe he'd still be here.

117
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,083
That's why I wanted to create True Angel.

118
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:02,130
So that no one will lose their loved ones like I did.

119
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:18,679
It's for those who can't live their lives like we do.

120
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,516
Even if it's just a small improvement each day,

121
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,903
that's reason enough to keep going.

122
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:39,580
See!

123
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:43,983
You're on board with me!

124
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:54,820
Your mouth says "no," but your heart says "Wow".

125
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,440
Anyway, big thanks for backing me up all the way.

126
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,016
I'll give it my all, I promise. I've got to run now.

127
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,216
Wait a minute.

128
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,559
Please think again. It's full of hardship.

129
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,003
While trying to help people, you might die with them.

130
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:30,496
I've thought it through.

131
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:37,863
I guess I'm probably a person who enjoys hardships.

132
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,920
I'll leave.

133
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:55,939
I was like this when I was young.

134
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:58,100
The more successful the business,

135
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,386
the harder the CEO will have to work,

136
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:05,443
since everything has to rely on investment.

137
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,823
I became more like a beggar day in and day out.

138
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:13,430
That's it.

139
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,226
But the heart that wants to do it is very powerful.

140
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:23,596
If you let your heart guide you, the rest will follow.

141
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,743
Like the girl on the swing?

142
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,259
Exactly.

143
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:41,583
Ms. Rose, actually Pafun and Alice are sisters.

144
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,819
When they were kids, their parents got divorced.

145
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:48,179
So they grew up separately.

146
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,000
Pafun lived with her father and Alice with her mother.

147
00:12:55,283 --> 00:13:04,565
Then… the girl on the swing might be Pafun, is what your saying?

148
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,660
Yes.

149
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,536
Your father seemed very disappointed that you left the company.

150
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,403
You really don't plan to go back to that house anymore?

151
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,886
I came out to find my own place. I feel happier.

152
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,859
Besides, it's close to Sandbox and easy to commute.

153
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,920
I thought you should swallow your pride and go back.

154
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,000
He seems to really want you back.

155
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,440
I'm afraid people will talk badly behind you.

156
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,939
If you keep talking like this,

157
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:45,260
I won't talk to you anymore.

158
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,916
Okay, I won't mention it again.

159
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,779
If you're happy and comfortable with it, then do whatever makes you happy.

160
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,679
I understand.

161
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,519
Just finish your meal.

162
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,799
You can't display advertisers or charge your users.

163
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,230
The only way to make money is through a CSR budget from large companies.
[CSR = Corporate social responsibility: contributing to society to build a good brand image]

164
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,819
So, I made a list of companies with high CSR budgets this year.

165
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:22,990
I already emailed them to you.

166
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,100
There are a lot of them, Mr. Ji.

167
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,220
The ones in blue are interested in the welfare of the handicapped.

168
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,335
The ones in red need to work on their images,

169
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:36,140
because owners have issues like tax evasion and rumors.

170
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,576
Bring that up, and they will listen to you.

171
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,899
What?

172
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,250
Thank you very much.

173
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,679
For what?

174
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,859
You usually put the brakes on what we do.

175
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:59,619
But this time, you are stepping on the gas.

176
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:02,360
Well, your guys' car doesn't have a brake.

177
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,900
So, I have to push the gas so that it rams into a wall to a stop.

178
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,600
That's good. Now step on it so hard

179
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,903
that we can go through the wall.

180
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,819
You really are something.

181
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,659
But I was serious, Mr. Ji. I deeply appreciate that

182
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:24,340
you've helped us all along.

183
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,380
I want to buy you something for your birthday.

184
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,299
Yes.

185
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,980
When is your birthday?

186
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,199
It's May 7th.

187
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:37,723
I missed it.

188
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,070
Your birthday is the same day as Korn's?

189
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,290
Yes, our birthdays are the same day.

190
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:53,320
What a coincidence.

191
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,399
Yes, our company has created True Angel to help the elderly and Parkinson's patients.

192
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,199
We, therefore, think this service is suitable for your company's CSR.

193
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,663
Let me think about it first.

194
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,539
This is project information. And this is our name card.

195
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,860
I'll try to present it to the executives.

196
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,860
Please consider it.

197
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,000
Hello, I'd like to meet Mr. Wang.

198
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,059
I'm not sure if the president is available.

199
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:55,619
Well, the president isn't here. He went to a CSR event in another province today.

200
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,459
Another province?

201
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,359
Yes.

202
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,579
Which province?

203
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,041
Our True Angel app has been developed

204
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,960
to meet the needs of the elderly and Parkinson's patients,

205
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,480
helping them live life more easily and comfortably.

206
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:24,140
It's a Niche Market's service.

207
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,019
And what can your True Angel do?

208
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:30,780
Our app reminds the elderly to take medicines on time,

209
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,140
and also take care of exercise,

210
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,900
blood pressure, check blood and kidney values, ​​and even stress, too.

211
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,143
Hey! Be careful.

212
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:44,180
Are you all right?

213
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,680
It's okay. Thank you.

214
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:51,839
True Angel can warn you that it's slippery.

215
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,463
Just hang tight for a bit. Help will be here soon.

216
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,161
You're really putting in the effort.

217
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,279
Should I scrub anything else?

218
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,679
- There.
- Right away.

219
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,599
- Thank you.
- Sure, no problem.

220
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,500
Did you have fun?

221
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,440
Yeah, it was enjoyable. I liked it.

222
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,339
- All right, thanks.
- Yes.

223
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,100
Okay, done.

224
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,900
Your application is impressive.

225
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:26,036
But this year, we've allocated our budget to sea turtle conservation across the country.

226
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,070
I see. That's okay, I understand.

227
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,820
So, maybe next year?

228
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,659
Yeah, I'll definitely keep it in mind.

229
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,016
Thank you very much.

230
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:40,140
You're welcome.

231
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,000
Director, please change your clothes over there.

232
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,100
So, I have to change.

233
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,060
Of course, sir.

234
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,859
Good luck.

235
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:49,879
Thank you so much.

236
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,580
Yes, Mr. Ji.

237
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,060
Are you still at the turtle pond?

238
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,839
Yes.

239
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:11,370
Wait there. I'll pick you up.

240
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,300
Mr. Ji, how did you know I was here and decided to give me a call?

241
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,379
Mr. Wang called me up.

242
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:49,203
I happened to be in the area, so I dropped by.

243
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:53,939
What brings you all the way to Chonburi?

244
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,259
Crabs!

245
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:06,219
I'm a sucker for freshly caught crabs.

246
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,213
So?

247
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:11,240
So, are you finished now?

248
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,280
Yep, all done.

249
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,660
Where would you like to go?

250
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,839
I need to go pray.

251
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,519
To pray?

252
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,779
Then, let's change first.

253
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:38,379
Mr. Ji, thank you so much.

254
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:40,939
I'll be back in a jiffy.

255
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,239
Yes.

256
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,620
What is your birth year?

257
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,820
91.

258
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,280
No, I mean the Chinese zodiac: the Year of the Dog, Pig, et cetera.

259
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,419
Probably the goat.

260
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:01,799
Goat.

261
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,750
Goat. So it means this year is not a jinx year for you and for me.

262
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,120
Let's go and pray.

263
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,530
All right.

264
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:51,479
Thank you very much, Mr. Ji, for taking me on a trip today.

265
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:56,923
I felt very discouraged, but now I feel much better.

266
00:21:56,923 --> 00:22:00,340
Don't worry about it. It's been ages since I got to unwind like this.

267
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,599
It's good for me, too.

268
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,330
You know, watching the sunset like this reminds me of my dad.

269
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,340
On those days, whenever either of us felt down,

270
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,399
we'd do exactly this, just watch the sunset.

271
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:33,559
And he'd always treat me to something tasty afterward, just like this.

272
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:38,372
Hang on a second.

273
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:42,013
Am I turning into a dad now?

274
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:46,080
You're starting to sound like one, especially when you complain.

275
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,381
Dad always used to say,

276
00:22:57,381 --> 00:23:00,639
"It's okay, we'll take another crack at it tomorrow."

277
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:05,540
He believed as long as we were breathing, there's hope in life.

278
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:19,100
I bet your dad's still cheering for you on from up there.

279
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,476
You think so?

280
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:34,779
You know, you're actually really nice. Why do you play the tough guy act?

281
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,316
Me? Tough?

282
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,563
You really want me to spell it out?

283
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:45,659
I shouldn't have dragged her along on this trip.

284
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,160
Pardon?

285
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:50,065
Nothing.

286
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:58,031
♫ Oh please ♫

287
00:23:58,031 --> 00:24:02,092
♫ For this lonesome night ♫

288
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:08,747
♫ I can't handle this moonlight alone ♫

289
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:13,723
♫ Oh please ♫

290
00:24:13,723 --> 00:24:19,164
♫ Read those words in my eyes ♫

291
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:25,594
♫ Saying it has always been you ♫

292
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:30,030
♫  All this time ♫

293
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,859
We've arrived.

294
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,100
When did I fall asleep?

295
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,700
Well,

296
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,990
from the first ten minutes.

297
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,960
You slept and snored so loudly that

298
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,640
I didn't dare to wake you up.

299
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,516
- Really?
- Yeah.

300
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:59,056
So, was I drooling, too?

301
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,419
Just a little.

302
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,693
Mr. Ji, I'm sorry.

303
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:09,119
Nevermind.

304
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,019
Okay.

305
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:21,300
You, you really want to pull it off, don't you?

306
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,420
It requires a lot of money.

307
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:30,559
Yes. I've thought it through. I'll do it no matter what.

308
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
But, Mr. Ji,

309
00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:41,340
please don't tell Korn that I still haven't found an investor.

310
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:48,690
I want him to focus on his work. I don't want him to worry about money.

311
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,386
Thank you very much, Mr. Ji.

312
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,039
Then I'll go first.

313
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,979
Thank you also for the ride.

314
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:08,179
Sure.

315
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,763
Hey, Dream is finally back.

316
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,019
Why are you wearing this outfit?

317
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:50,619
My clothes were dirty, so I changed.

318
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,059
How are you doing? Has anyone shown interest?

319
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,870
Oh!

320
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,240
There are a lot of investors interested.

321
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,196
But they said they have to think first.

322
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:10,171
They'll get back to us soon.

323
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,960
Anyway, how is it going on your end?

324
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,559
We've finished the final test.

325
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:23,779
Really? How was the recognition rate?

326
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,359
Very good.

327
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,976
Very good?

328
00:27:27,976 --> 00:27:31,280
Hey, now that we're all together.

329
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,070
Let's publish True Angel in the store.

330
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,813
Come on!

331
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:38,492
Let's do it!

332
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,840
Wait a minute!

333
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,880
Before uploading, I'd like to pray first.

334
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,180
What?

335
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,640
It's a lucky stone.

336
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,200
Let's start!

337
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,900
Hey, wait a minute, friend! Wait a moment.

338
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:15,299
It's okay. Don't be alarmed, it's a special technique.

339
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:21,758
Before uploading, why don't we make a bet?

340
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:26,060
Guess how many times our app will be uploaded within a week?

341
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,041
Are you okay? Let me blow your hand.

342
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,263
Okay. I'm in.

343
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,500
The winner treats everyone to barbeque.

344
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,779
I guess it will be 100.

345
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,499
That's too little. I say over 1,000! Believe me!

346
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:55,300
- 1000?
- Of course!

347
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,396
We can do it.

348
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:04,980
Yes, we can.

349
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,136
Yes, we can do it. Right?

350
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:13,540
Of course, so let's go.

351
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,980
Go ahead.

352
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:24,300
Are you ready, everyone? Launch. Now!

353
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,713
- True Angel!
- Gel!

354
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:29,540
Have you pressed yet?

355
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,480
It's done.

356
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,660
Lord of Success, I know my prayer might seem selfish,

357
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,399
but True Angel must not be too successful.

358
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,879
Please keep True Angel's Daily Active Users under 1000.

359
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:52,100
Why are you praying so desperately?

360
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,739
Can't spill the beans, Grandma. Then it won't come true.

361
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:58,219
Got it. I'll go ahead, then.

362
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:01,776
All right, I'll catch up in a bit.

363
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:04,390
Sure thing.

364
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,639
Walk carefully, Grandma.

365
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,870
Amen!

366
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,259
Grandma.

367
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,860
Grandma, are you all right? You seem off.

368
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,540
I'm fine, just a bit dizzy. Don't worry.

369
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,219
Maybe you should sit down for a bit.

370
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,079
Here, let me hold your bag.

371
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,750
Let's find a seat.

372
00:30:56,263 --> 00:30:58,363
There we go.

373
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,130
Okay!

374
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,939
You haven't eaten much, have you?

375
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:13,470
Let me give you a massage. You'll feel better.

376
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:22,503
Grandma, where's your phone?

377
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:24,780
In the basket.

378
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,520
Just a moment.

379
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,355
I will load the application called True Angel for you.

380
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:36,820
It's an app for the elderly and especially Parkinson's patients.

381
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,720
It's our company's creation. You should definitely have it.

382
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,140
Why Parkinson's?

383
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,759
It's Korn's idea.

384
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,480
Korn?

385
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,280
Yes.

386
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,323
Okay. The download will take a moment.

387
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:02,060
Right now, the app can only be used on phones.

388
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:07,483
But in the future, it'll work on watches and glasses, too.

389
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,910
There we go.

390
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:22,380
Hello, I'm True Angel, your angel, or you can call me Angie.

391
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:29,240
Grandma, hold the phone up to my face and ask Angie.

392
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,370
Who is this, Angie?

393
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,483
A cute young woman smiling right in front of you.

394
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:39,879
That's good.

395
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:42,480
Grandma, what do you think? Pretty cool?

396
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,083
Now, you'll always have an angel looking out for you.

397
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,425
But I'm a bit disappointed. Not many people have downloaded it yet,

398
00:32:51,425 --> 00:32:54,058
so we haven't got much feedback.

399
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,700
What's feedback?

400
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:05,400
Uh, feedback… is basically what users think about the service

401
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,336
or if there's anything they don't like about the app.

402
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,720
Lord, remember what I asked.

403
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,780
Let's head home.

404
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,920
Now?

405
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,940
Here, let me help you up. Take it slow.

406
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,019
There we go.

407
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:31,819
Just a moment.

408
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,040
All right, follow me.

409
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,180
- Are you feeling hungry?
- Got it.

410
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,336
Stop refreshing. That doesn't change the number of downloads.

411
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,700
Why isn't the download count moving?

412
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,960
Be patient, you guys.

413
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:04,499
Hello, everyone.

414
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:07,900
I'm here to collect feedback for the emotion machine.

415
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:16,600
It seems like everyone is emotional except Dream.

416
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,999
It's because the download number hasn't gone up. So they're a little bit discouraged.

417
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,760
I thought it was a marketing issue.

418
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,499
Definitely a PR marketing issue. Need any help?

419
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,260
I can guarantee those numbers will go up.

420
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,639
Go up or go down, what's the deal?

421
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:36,740
Don't you trust me? Hey! If you don't, just give me the devices back.

422
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,780
Take it back.

423
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,779
Hold it.

424
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:50,570
Don't underestimate me. I'm telling you, in three or four days,

425
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:55,959
you'll be thanking me. You'll be bowing down in front of me.

426
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,039
What's the app called again?

427
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,460
It's True Angel.

428
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,979
True Angel and God Sepsin. It's bound to be a hit.

429
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:11,119
Just like that.

430
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,499
I'm curious, too.

431
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:18,239
Here come the special drinks for everyone. Come on, cheers!

432
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,759
- Cheers.
- There!

433
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,565
It's warming.

434
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:32,639
Don't worry, everyone. It's early days for our app.

435
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,470
It's normal for the downloads to be low. Let's not stress about it.

436
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,980
Eat up, everyone.

437
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,099
Hey, ten people have already downloaded it. Look.

438
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,280
Where? Oh, that's great!

439
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,459
We should be happy?

440
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:46,308
That's a whopping ten.

441
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:47,820
Just ten.

442
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,139
Let's see it as a positive start, folks.

443
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:51,239
It's too good.

Excuse me! Could you bring us another round, please?

445
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:56,861
- Do you want more?
- Yes. Isn't it delicious?

Thank you so much for bringing Dream home. You must be a bit tired, right?

451
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:48,699
Not at all. I'm not tired.

452
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:54,336
Dream says True Angel was your idea?

453
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:58,643
Thank you very much, son. It's amazing.

454
00:38:03,676 --> 00:38:05,376
Here.

455
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,863
I wrote you my feedback. I heard that you haven't gotten many.

456
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:32,180
Thank you so much. I'll try to adjust it as you suggested.

457
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:37,320
When I saw your picture in the newspaper,

458
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,300
you looked smart and kind, too.

459
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,639
And now, are you disappointed with me?

460
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:53,920
No, you are smarter and kinder than I thought.

Thank you.

It's late, you should go home now.

463
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,148
So I'll look into this.

464
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:07,848
All right.

Goodbye.

- Hey, come see this is. Korn.
- What?

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,380
Come on. Wake up. Quickly.

Here… It's Buakao.

470
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:43,059
More than ten years ago I gave boxing gloves to a kid and told him to follow his dreams.

471
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:47,060
Today that child has grown up. Now, he created an application.

472
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,881
True Angel is that app.

473
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:55,459
It is an application for people with Parkinson's disease and the elderly.

474
00:39:55,459 --> 00:40:00,039
Your father is very happy. He's sent this clip to all our relatives.

475
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,100
It reminds us to take medicine, and teaches us physical therapy.

476
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,100
And if we fall, it will warn us.

477
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:17,100
I've tried using this app. It's very good and great.

478
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:23,500
I believe that in the future, True Angel will give new hope to Parkinson's patients.

479
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,400
Buakao? How come he's talking about True Angel?

You know, it hurts my heart, friend.

That's it. Must you do it while I'm not looking?

00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,600
It was like listening to the news on the radio. Absolutely amazing.

533
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,900
Day 2: Today, my hands started shaking more frequently without me even noticing.

534
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,200
The symptoms of Parkinson's are starting to show.

535
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,800
It's time to take your medicine, Grandma.

536
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,700
Thank you, Angie.

537
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:39,200
Luckily, Angie reminded me to take my medicine.

538
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:50,000
Day 3: This morning, I could barely walk, my limbs were all stiff.

539
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,600
Angie suggested some exercises to stretch my muscles,

540
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,400
and I felt much better afterward.

541
00:45:04,419 --> 00:45:11,059
Day 4: Today, my Parkinson's symptoms worsened to the point where I almost fell.

542
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:13,517
Thankfully, Angie is still functional.

543
00:45:13,517 --> 00:45:19,700
But if I do fall, will Angie call Dream for me?

544
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,100
Grandma has Parkinson's disease.

545
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,900
Why didn't I know it?

546
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,100
Maybe Grandma prefers to see your smile.

547
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Do I look like I'm not crying yet?

548
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,330
Okay.

549
00:47:05,466 --> 00:47:07,307
Grandma.

550
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,800
Dream…

551
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,800
How are you feeling?

552
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,300
It's nothing major. Just a small stumble.

553
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this.

554
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,600
Grandma, I should be the one apologizing.

555
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,000
I've been so focused on work that I didn't notice your condition.

556
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:54,500
That's okay. You have your own responsibilities.

557
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,900
It isn't a big deal.

558
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,300
I'm sorry.

559
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,600
If something were to happen to you, I'd feel so guilty.

560
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,100
I am still fine. Why are you crying?

561
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,500
Because if something were to happen to you,

562
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,000
who would I have left?

563
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,600
You're my whole world.

564
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,400
Then why cry? I'm still here.

565
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,500
I promise I'll improve True Angel

566
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,200
so you won't have to suffer. Okay?

567
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,700
I'll support her. Don't worry.

568
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:47,900
From now on, tell me if something's wrong.

569
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,100
Don't make me worry like this.

570
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,700
Come on, stop crying. There's no need for tears anymore.

571
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,300
Hello.

572
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,100
You're calling me after so many years.

573
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,100
I need your help.

574
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:53,500
Today, he has a seminar at Sandbox. He's probably in the dressing room right now.

575
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,300
Thank you so much for bringing me to him.

576
00:49:57,939 --> 00:50:01,549
Do you think if I talk to him for you, he'll be less angry?

577
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,600
He might just get angrier.

578
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,300
Why? Aren't you on good terms?

579
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:16,200
Never mind. But you're begging him for forgiveness.

580
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,800
Where is your pride?

581
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,700
Pride doesn't fill your stomach.

582
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,300
And besides, I'm at my wit's end.

583
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:30,300
I can't afford to worry about my pride.

584
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,000
Then let's go.

[Pay It Forward]

586
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:03,500
Korn, what are you doing here?

587
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:08,000
You're here too. What are you here to beg for?

588
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,600
Morning Group has filed a lawsuit for property damage.

589
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,000
Korn doesn't want to go through with a lawsuit,

590
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,600
so he came to ask us to compromise.

591
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,800
So what are you doing here?

592
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,700
I was going to ask the Morning Group to provide the CSR budget

593
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:40,200
to support Sam Korn Thai Tech's True Angel application.

594
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:45,200
Do you still have the nerve to beg? You are so shameless.

595
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,900
If you kneel down and beg me, I might consider it.

596
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,400
Dad, don't you think that's a bit too much?

597
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,100
Why?

598
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,300
I want to teach these new entrepreneurs.

599
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,900
Let them learn to be modest.

600
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,200
It's the price of not watching your mouth when your pockets are empty.

601
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:15,700
Let them learn how cruel the business world is.

602
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,700
Yes, the business world is cruel.

603
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,100
We don't know what might happen,

604
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,600
so we need to prepare.

605
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:52,800
Hiring such many part-time will cost too much.

606
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,200
Plus, they won't know what kinds of images we'd need.

607
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,600
Your guys are more skilled and will save us money.

608
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,000
You recorded that?

609
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,900
[Mr. Ji: Are you talking with Buntoon? Record his voice in case it's useful.]

610
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Hello.

611
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,400
Hello.

612
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,000
There's more.

613
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:38,500
You promised to pay a budget of 1 million baht for a solution.

614
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,600
I just offered it for marketing.

615
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,300
I checked your website and it is pretty bare.

616
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:54,000
You should put our logo on your main page, "Morning Group's strategic partner".

617
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That's worth a lot more than 1 million baht.

618
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,200
There's quite a crowd outside.

619
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,900
We've got the new generation of kids who look up to you as their idols: journalists and investors.

620
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,600
If they catch wind of this clip,

621
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,900
it's going to be quite the spectacle.

622
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,600
A senior executive of a major company says he supports the dreams of the new generation,

623
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,500
but behind the scenes, he's taking advantage of them.

624
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,800
How's that for a headline?

625
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,300
- It's bound to be a hit.
- Hey, are you blackmailing me?

626
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,500
Let's call it a negotiation.

627
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,500
I think it's wise for you to allocate us a CSR budget.

628
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,400
Otherwise, your company's reputation will take an even bigger hit.

629
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,100
Pafun!

630
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,000
I think you should take her seriously, Dad.

631
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,300
If this audio clip gets out,

632
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,500
the damage could be significant.

633
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:04,500
And repairing the company's image would take time and cost more than a million.

634
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:13,900
And settle things with Korn, too. Thank you.

635
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:44,100

It's a token of gratitude for helping secure CSR funding.

00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,200
It's also a belated birthday present.
