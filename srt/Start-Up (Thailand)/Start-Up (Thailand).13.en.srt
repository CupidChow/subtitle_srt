Of course, I don't like that you're focused on manpower reduction.

00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,701
Really?

184
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:55,820
And don't forget this pose.

185
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,699
Bing!

186
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:57,500
Bing!

187
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,860
- Ready.
- Yes.

188
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,939
Look at this camera.

189
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:02,379
- Ready?
- Ready?

190
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:06,679
Three… two… one… Action!

191
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,779
Hello, I'm Alice, CEO of Alice Company.

192
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:13,819
We're committed to developing AI…

193
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:19,220
Over the past three years, we've employed AI in controlling smart CCTVs.

194
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,000
We've been ranked fifth and have been named the industry's fastest-growing company in Asia.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,620
Now, with our expertise in CCTV monitoring,

196
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,494
Alice Company is investing in a new business.

197
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:34,036
That is… Miracle World.

198
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,159
Hi there, I'm Pafun, the CEO at Sunshine Company.

199
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,260
We're the brains behind Miracle World,

200
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,001
an innovative AI realm where seniors

201
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:49,159
and people dealing with health conditions can lead safe,

202
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,160
comfortable lives.

203
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,255
This is a Smart Home with a guardian angel to look after your loved ones.

204
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:55,201
Bank.

205
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,064
What?

206
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:59,480
- Look at this.
- An angel constantly keeps us updated

207
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,000
- What?
- about our family members' well-being.

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,921
Everyone can enjoy life together in happiness.

209
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:09,480
So, Dream is actually bringing Miracle World to life?

210
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,279
Absolutely.

211
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,019
Want a sneak peek?

212
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,140
No thanks, I'm good.

213
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:18,525
Why bring that up now?

214
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,779
Well, I'm planning on heading back home this summer.

215
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,120
I've been missing my dad and mom quite a bit.

216
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,199
Plus, I'd love to enjoy the Songkran festival.

217
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:28,819
Count me in. I'd love to go to the festival, too!

218
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:31,080
Could you book my spot as well?

219
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,719
You never went back when you took time off before.

220
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:42,699
Just handle it for me anyway.

221
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:44,040
Okay.

222
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,839
He's acting weird.

223
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,100
Sorry, I'm late.

224
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,960
I had to go on-site for the Feng Shui class.

225
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,060
Wait, are you learning Feng Shui?

226
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:07,699
So, you're planning to become a fortuneteller instead of a surgeon?

227
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:09,419
I'm just exploring different things.

228
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,839
By the way, I saw your Miracle World.

229
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,380
It is miraculous.

230
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,879
Are you interested in working on it together?

231
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:25,199
I am, but my family is pushing me to open a clinic.

232
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,659
So how are you and Ji doing?

233
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,779
Are you going to give in,

234
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:37,800
or do you just see him as a brother?

235
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:41,159
I don't have much time to think about love right now.

236
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,059
Excuses.

237
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:46,156
It's true.

238
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:52,479
I really want to make Miracle World a success quickly so my grandma can use it.

239
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:00,912
Hello, everyone!

240
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:03,150
Today, we are here to celebrate our latest project, which earned us

241
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,114
- If you've been secretly following him,
- the Best Developer Team of the Year Award.

242
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,057
why not send him a message?

243
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:09,032
So, we've been rewarded with a one-month vacation.

244
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:12,366
Why don't you send Korn one then?

245
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,020
Shall we look together?

246
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,616
Korn's in the clip, too.

247
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,319
I'm good.

248
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,739
What a cute guy!

249
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,001
An angel constantly keeps us updated

250
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:45,980
about our family members' well-being.

251
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,303
Everyone can enjoy life together in happiness.

252
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:54,682
We will create this miraculous world for everyone.

253
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,638
I'm coming to make good on my promise.

254
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,580
I hope you're still waiting.

255
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:23,402
Is she beautiful?

256
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:26,581
The work is beautiful.

257
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:27,980
Oh, the work is beautiful.

258
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,499
Speaking of work, please sign these papers, Mr. Ji.

259
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:35,080
It won't take long.

260
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,240
Since the ad launched, Dream's become so popular.

261
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,259
Many guys in Sandbox are after her.

262
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,900
So many?

263
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,660
Are you stunned? Done signing yet? I'll be taking these.

264
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,221
If you like Dream that much,you should make a move.

265
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:01,173
What're you waiting for? It's been three years now.

266
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:03,310
Don't talk about that.

267
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:05,943
Why?

268
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,739
Finish the job before Songkran!

269
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:16,150
Why are you taking it out on me?

270
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,833
Can't you handle a little teasing?

271
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,260
Ji, wait for me.

272
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,040
Let me join you.

273
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,019
Yea… yeah.

274
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:34,179
I saw the clip.

275
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,356
Do you like it?

276
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:37,319
It was nice.

277
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,879
So you are drinking two glasses of coffee?

278
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,039
Isn't that too much?

279
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,340
No, another glass is for Alice.

280
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,264
She asked me to buy one.

281
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:50,039
It's for Alice?

282
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,891
Yes.

283
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:53,391
Let's go.

284
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,679
Do you have any plans for Songkran?

285
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,419
No, I'm staying with Grandma.

286
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:03,720
Are you coming to see her,

287
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,040
pouring water on her for blessings, and making merit together? What do you think?

288
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,280
I'm definitely coming.

289
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,520
Okay, then we'll meet.

290
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,380
This year, my neighborhood will have a temple festival, too.

291
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,403
Those are the basic details.

292
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,590
Think it over.

293
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,085
I will.

294
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,306
What did he talk to you about?

295
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:45,565
Spying on something?

296
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:48,100
He came to ask about Alice.

297
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,336
My sister?

298
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,240
Alice's father probably asked him to come.

299
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,020
Please excuse me.

300
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,459
Has this list been sent yet?

301
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:16,459
Except for Mr. Danat. There is only Mr. Danat left.

302
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,540
I'll call his customer again.

303
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,219
Okay, just send another email to make sure.

304
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,860
Of course, I will send him another email to confirm.

305
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,140
Hello! Lemon tea.

306
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,110
Thank you. Put it there.

307
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,079
Okay, is there another file?

308
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,319
By the way, sister.

309
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,019
I'm going to make merit for Dad

310
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,659
to sprinkle water on the Buddha image and pour water on Grandma for blessings.

311
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,459
You're joining me?

312
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,699
I'm very busy with work. I won't have free time.

313
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:46,820
What? Are you busy again?

314
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,580
Spare some time for family.

315
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,119
You take that responsibility.

316
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,300
And I gave you a day off. What more do you want from me?

317
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,140
You can send it to me.

318
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,576
Yes, thank you.

319
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,820
But only one day.

320
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,640
After being a good grandchild,

321
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,580
come back and be a good executive as well.

322
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,499
What does that mean?

323
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,299
It means,

324
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:20,860
we invested more than ten million

325
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,070
and we cannot fail.

326
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:25,313
You know?

327
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:30,519
You're so mean! You are heartless and don't care about your family.

328
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,939
Are you going to force your team to work on holidays?

329
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,459
I will report that to the Department of Labor

330
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:37,519
and I'll tell Dad, too.

331
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,923
Will you report me to anybody else?

332
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,196
I wish you good health.

333
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:12,779
Thank you for forgiving me, Mom.

334
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,279
I'm sorry for everything.

335
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,140
What are you apologizing for every year?

336
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,178
Anyway, I wish you happiness,

337
00:21:25,178 --> 00:21:26,921
and may all your wishes come true.

338
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:30,798
Be happy and healthy.

339
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,079
It's my turn now.

340
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:44,419
I wish Grandma good health.

341
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:47,820
May you stay with me for a hundred or even a thousand years.

342
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,039
That's too long. I can't live that long.

343
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,019
Why not? I want to be with you forever.

344
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:59,720
May you be happy, free of troubles, and healthy.

345
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,480
May all your work be as successful as you wish.

346
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,128
May it be so!

347
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:07,828
Here you are.

348
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,859
There.

349
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:27,340
I also wish Grandma good health.

350
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:33,930
I promise to be your good boy forever.

351
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:39,060
You are like one of my grandchildren.

352
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:43,919
Whenever you feel lonely, you can stop by anytime.

353
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,380
You're not alone in this world, you know?

354
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,216
Yes, Grandma.

355
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:52,653
Yes, Grandma.

356
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,240
Grandma, are you okay?

357
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,032
Slowly.

358
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:04,832
Grandma,

359
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:07,316
let's build sand pagodas over there.

360
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:10,820
You guys can go. I'll stay here with your mom.

361
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,203
Go ahead, I will take care of Grandma.

362
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:17,213
Okay.

363
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:22,180
Well, good boy, just take this naughty girl with you.

364
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,440
Naughty girl?

365
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,719
Good boy. Naughty girl. Just go.

366
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,679
I'll take care of her.

367
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:30,600
Be careful.

368
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,760
Shall we go, good boy?

369
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:40,020
There are a lot of people.

370
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Hey! Just one more.

371
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:45,459
I don't like water! Kids!

372
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,900
Enough!

373
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,500
Enough.

374
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:56,803
Come on. I have tissues.

375
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,459
It's all over your face.

376
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,527
The tissues are sticking to your face.

377
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:42,452
All gone.

378
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,856
Abnormally high heart rate.

379
00:24:55,256 --> 00:24:58,887
This angel is Doctor Know-it-All.

380
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:00,907
She always does that to me, too.

381
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:05,500
Thank you, Dream, for inviting me to come every year.

382
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,140
Since getting back together with Grandma and you,

383
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,256
I don't have to sit alone in my room.

384
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,939
No need to thank me.

385
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:15,043
Grandma also sees you as one of her grandchildren,

386
00:25:15,043 --> 00:25:17,339
like a part of the family.

387
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:21,816
For me, you're like an older brother.

388
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,179
- Come on.
- Pour it now?

389
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:32,879
Yes.

390
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,800
Slowly.

391
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:42,540
By the way, since Grandma closed her pancake business,

392
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,723
how is she? Is she bored?

393
00:25:45,723 --> 00:25:47,240
She seems so.

394
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,640
She seems lost.

395
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,480
But anyway, Angel is there to talk to her as a friend.

396
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,140
But the doctors said that patients with this kind of disease should work.

397
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,780
It helps enhance memory and brain function.

398
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,512
That's right,

399
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:06,839
but I can't help but worry.

400
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,179
I don't want her to work with the stove for too long.

401
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,450
Now I just hope that Miracle World

402
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:18,850
will be in place so Grandma can live a more comfortable life.

403
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,801
But if Grandma wants to start something, just tell me.

404
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,144
I'll help.

405
00:26:24,144 --> 00:26:26,759
Hey, how can that be?

406
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,160
I am Grandma's number one grandchild.

407
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,636
I can do it…

408
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:35,663
but thank you anyway, grandchild number two.

409
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,810
What I told you,

410
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,923
I meant it.

411
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,670
I want to be by your side.

412
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,359
I want to be the first person to come to your mind...

413
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,600
when your life gets tough.

414
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,236
Yes, brother.

415
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,180
You know,

416
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,760
I don't want to be just your brother.

417
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,499
We'd better go. Grandma's waiting.

418
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Is something wrong? Did it get in your eyes?

419
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,743
Let's take a look.

420
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:40,503
Are you okay?

421
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,090
No…

422
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:52,894
Wipe your eyes.

423
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,659
Are you home, Mr.Ji? Anything I can help you with today?

424
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,960
Ai-oon. It's not dark yet. Turn off the two lights.

425
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,060
Here's your fortune for today.

426
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,179
There you go again.

427
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:22,212
You're a faint-hearted boxer…

428
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:25,519
You've got some jokes.

429
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:30,900
Afraid of missing the target, you're unable to even swing a punch.

430
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,979
But if you continue to hesitate, you will lose.

431
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,160
So, I have to fight. Right?

432
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,519
Yes, go ahead, Mr. Ji. In life, you have to fight,

433
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,160
fight for your dreams, fight for victory.

434
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,979
Swing your fist with all your might.

435
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,584
Would you like some more?

436
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,390
- Korn.
- Yes.

437
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,340
- Dad. Mom.
- Welcome home, son.

438
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,419
- Hello.
- Hello.

439
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:35,848
Hey, good.

440
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:37,179
Dad, where's my amulet?

441
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:39,203
It's in my car. I didn't forget.

442
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:41,839
Here are garlands to welcome you. I made them with my own hands.

443
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,090
Thank you.

444
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,599
The sound's crackling.

445
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,759
He bragged…

446
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,740
he bought them at the flower market this morning.

447
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,820
I knew it.

448
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,448
- Hey, are these glasses from the US?
- Of course, Dad.

449
00:29:56,448 --> 00:29:59,919
- Let me try them.
- Very suitable. Try them.

450
00:30:00,307 --> 00:30:02,459
Oh my! They fit you like a glove. Take them, Dad. I'm giving them to you.

451
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:03,681
- Thank you very much.
- I missed you so much. Let me kiss you.

452
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:05,000
I missed you too.

453
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,780
I'm so happy. You guys look more handsome.

454
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,659
We must celebrate!

455
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:12,690
Let's go celebrate!

456
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,800
­[Sandbox]

457
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,000
Hello, doctor.

458
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,100
May I ask if you have time today?

459
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,800
I just want to inquire about some medical advice.

460
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,400
That's good. Yes, I'm coming now. Thanks a lot. See you.

461
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,700
Dream.

462
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,919
Where are you going?

463
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,428
To see a doctor.

464
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:40,259
What's wrong?

465
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm not sick, I'm just going to do some research about applying for a patent.

466
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,500
Let Pim go for you.

467
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,300
I assigned Pim to coordinate this project.

468
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,800
Yes, Ms. Dream. Let me do it.

469
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,900
It's okay. I'd rather find out myself. Thank you very much.

470
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,500
Where are the new hire DEVs?

471
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,100
He asked to work from home.

472
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,100
You know we cannot fail in this project.

473
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,000
It involves safety systems.

474
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
On demo day, check every single point thoroughly.

475
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,600
Okay, I understand. I'm sorry.

476
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,400
But could you please stop your sermon?

477
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,100
I won't be able to make it in time.

478
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,000
I have to get going. Bye.

479
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,900
Friends, today we are coming to join the water fight during Songkran.

480
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,400
With Bank, we will station at this point.

481
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Who would like to splash water on me?

482
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,300
You can come right away. I'll wait right here.

483
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Okay, goodbye. That's all for now. Let's splash!

484
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,500
- Key.
- What?

485
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,200
I can't hold it anymore. I'm going to the restroom. You just go ahead.

486
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,100
Number 2?

487
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,800
Yes!

488
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,200
Did you just fart?

489
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,000
Ganging up on me? Come here!

490
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,900
Ms. Yaya.

491
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,500
Hey, since when have you been back to Thailand?

492
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,900
I'm on vacation. Incredible that I meet you here.

493
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,600
I came to Songkran with my friends, but I lost them.

494
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,000
I called, and they didn't answer.

495
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,700
This is like a Disney movie.

496
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,200
So you came alone?

497
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,600
Yes. I'm here alone.

498
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,300
Ms. Yaya, I think we'd better play together.

499
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,600
Okay?

500
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
I don't know what's wrong with the computer.

501
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
What's wrong this time?

502
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,700
It keeps disconnecting and it's really slow.

503
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,700
Let me see.

504
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,700
It's locked.

505
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,480
­[Fafad Dev]

506
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,300
What's up?

507
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,500
Is something wrong?

508
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,700
What?

509
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:23,400
Okay. Do what you can, I'm hurrying in right now.

510
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,900
Why did you come alone today?

511
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
Where's Bank?

512
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,900
Actually, we came together, but Bank rushed to the toilet.

513
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,600
So, I'm lucky to have some time with you like this.

514
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,400
What a wonderful time. Right?

515
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,700
You've been in the US for 3 years. Your English must be much better.

516
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,500
No, actually, just enough to get by.

517
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,000
Where we live, I only speak Thai with Korn and Bank.

518
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,500
And at the company, I hardly talk to anyone.

519
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,100
Sometimes I felt lonely too.

520
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,500
Before going back, I might need to find a tutor.

521
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,600
Why now?

522
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,900
How about I tutor you?

523
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,800
Really?

524
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,300
If so, can you tutor me every day?

525
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
I don't know if I'll have time every day.

526
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,200
If I'm not available, just hand in your homework instead.

527
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,300
Sure! What kind of homework?

528
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,000
You send me messages in English every day.

529
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,500
Tell me what you're doing and where you're going.

530
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,900
Like sending a girlfriend report or something?

531
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,000
Don't try to be sneaky.

532
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,900
You hit the bull's eye.

533
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,800
I just want you to practice your English.

534
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,100
All right. If that's the case,

535
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,200
I'll send messages in the morning, at lunch, and in the evening.

536
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,600
Just don't get annoyed with my messages.

537
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
What's up, Dream?

538
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,800
Yaya, do you know any good DEVs?

539
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,100
Or any programmers or hackers?

540
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:24,539
Wait, calm down. What's going on?

541
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:26,719
My company has been attacked by ransomware.

542
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,700
They want 10 million

543
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,800
within 12 hours in exchange for the decryption key.

544
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,000
Did you call the police?

545
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Yes, but they said they can't take care of it now.

546
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,700
If you know anyone, please tell me.

547
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,900
I'll ask around and call you back right away.

548
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,300
What's the matter?

549
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,500
I understand. But can you reach the team leader who removed the ransomware?

550
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Okay. Call me back quickly. Thank you.

551
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,300
No calls yet?

552
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,600
Not at all.

553
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,900
Any progress?

554
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,300
Access Denied.

555
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Everyone, they'll double the amount if we don't send them the money today.

556
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,100
Double!

557
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,600
Double it? 20 million?

558
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,500
Just pay the ransom,

559
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,800
we invested 60 million.

560
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Losing 10 million is better than losing 60 million.

561
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,180
­[Mr. Ji]

562
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,500
I want to be the first person that comes to your mind

563
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,000
when your life gets tough.

564
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,200
Hello.

565
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,400
Dream, it's me.

566
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:38,466
Korn?

567
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah.

568
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,200
Yaya already told me about it.

569
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,800
I'll be right there.

570
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Don't worry.

571
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:16,050
[Sandbox]­

572
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,500
Did you leave your port open?

573
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,600
What the hell are you doing here? What are you going to do?

574
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,199
We hired a developer who works from home.

575
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,400
He might have left port 22 open.

576
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,700
Can we just let an outsider handle this?

577
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,800
Did you back up the files?

578
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
We couldn't. We were in a rush.

579
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,400
No matter how rushed you are, you should have backed them up.

580
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,500
Is it that hard?

581
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,300
Then you do it yourself.

582
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,000
Let's not fight right now!

583
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,790
Huh?

584
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,100
Just let him do it!

585
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,400
Korn, where are we now?

586
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,500
The hacker got into the system through Secure Shell.

587
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,200
They used brute force to log in and then changed the root password.

588
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,600
So, we can't access the files.

589
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,100
Key, check if root login is allowed via the internet.

590
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
Got it.

591
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,500
I'm sorry.

592
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,800
Go ahead.

593
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,400
Whose computer is this? May I use it?

594
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,000
Of course.

595
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,100
How is it?

596
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,500
Bank, check suspicious files in system logs.

597
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,400
Got you. Do you have a computer I can borrow?

598
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Just a moment.

599
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,954
Ms. Alice, we need to go to the police station ourselves.

600
00:40:58,954 --> 00:40:59,979
Okay.

601
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:01,920
Dream, I'll leave things here to you.

602
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,389
I'll report to the police.

603
00:41:03,389 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay.

604
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,700
I'm counting on you.

605
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,800
You guys,

606
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,600
I combed through the Library and System log.

607
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,000
A suspicious file was executed 3 hours ago.

608
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,700
But that file is gone now.

609
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
It must've been deleted.

610
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,600
Well, if you find it, send it to me.

611
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,400
Okay.

612
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,800
Why does this feel like deja vu?

613
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,900
Of course, it does.

614
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,900
When I had to deal with the ransomware attack,

615
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,300
you were the one who saved me.

616
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,400
These character strings look familiar.

617
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,700
I found it. They hid it in another partition.

618
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,900
I'll send it to you.

619
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,200
I found the decryption key.

620
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Really? Yes!

621
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,700
Yes!

622
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,700
Access approved.

623
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,800
Yes!

624
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,900
The decryption key works.

625
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,000
All the files will be restored in about 30 minutes.

626
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,500
Korn,

627
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,000
thank you so much.

628
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,400
No problem.

629
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,000
Key, let's grab some coffee, shall we?

630
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,400
Sure, go ahead. I'm wide awake anyway. Damn jetlag.

631
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,900
Man, I could use a drink. Let's head out.

632
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,500
All right.

633
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,600
You're having coffee now?

634
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,400
You're still dull and slow as before.

635
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
What did I do wrong?

636
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
Just keep being dull.

637
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,700
It's getting late. I should head back home.

638
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,200
Remember to submit your homework. Okay?

639
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,100
Of course!

640
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,100
Since we're already out, why not grab a bite to eat?

641
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,200
Key.

642
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,800
- What?
- What homework?

643
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,000
Not spilling the beans. You're not her student. So it stays with me.

644
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,400
Which subject? What homework?

645
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,200
My lips are sealed.

646
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,300
Give it up already.

647
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,400
Nope. It's one-on-one tutoring stuff.

648
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,900
Are you keeping secrets from me now?

649
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,800
It's a private lesson.

650
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,400
When did you start the lessons, Key?

651
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,400
What?

652
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,500
So,

653
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,800
when are you heading back?

654
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,100
End of this month.

655
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,200
How about you?

656
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,600
It's fine, but I've been a little busy lately.

657
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,700
You look a bit pale, though.

658
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,300
Really?

659
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,200
I heard that the K. Jones Foundation acquired True Angel because of you?

660
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,400
Well, it was a collective effort.

661
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,800
Mr. K deeply resonated with True Angel's core concept.

662
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,800
Thank you very much,

663
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,000
for True Angel...

664
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,200
and today.

665
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,000
You helped me again.

666
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,700
Just like that day.

667
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,200
Thank you.

668
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,000
Why are your hands so cold?

669
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,000
Would you like to take a break first?

670
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,700
I should.

671
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,300
Dream.

672
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,900
A lot has changed, guys.

673
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,400
Yes.

674
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,800
Do you think the BBQ restaurant downstairs is still there?

675
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Yes. I saw it.

676
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,800
- Really?
- Yes!

677
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,200
- You didn't tell me.
- You didn't ask me.

678
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,900
Come on.

679
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,600
Coffee for you.

680
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,700
Thank you.

681
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,000
Thanks.

682
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,500
Today, if it weren't for both of you,

683
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,200
our company would be in trouble.

684
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,500
Thank you very much.

685
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,300
You're welcome.

686
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,700
So, if the two of you have some time,

687
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,400
I invite you to a meal as compensation.

688
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,000
Sure thing. If it's free, I'm all for it.

689
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,100
Your favorite, isn't that so?

690
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,100
- Just a moment.
- Yes.

691
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:40,543
Hey, coffee, dude.

692
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,500
Hello?

693
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,600
Wait a minute, where are you?

694
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,700
You quit after making mistakes?

695
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,400
The test is coming up. What are we going to do without a developer?

696
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,500
Hello, Fafad?

697
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,000
I have to excuse myself to take care of work first.

698
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,800
Of course.

699
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,800
What just happened?

700
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,100
Did Fafad quit?

701
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,500
What's up?

702
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,400
Mr. Ji, Sunshine Company was attacked by ransomware last night.

703
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,700
It was all a mess.

704
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,800
I'm coming now.

705
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:28,030
♫ The moment I messed up, I didn't mean to make you cry ♫

706
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,410
♫ Just know that it's hard for me, too ♫

707
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:41,960
♫ The way that things ended, I know it's been a little while ♫

708
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,260
♫ Still longing to be with you ♫

709
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:53,000
♫ So don't tell me I never cared ♫

710
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,200
What's up?

711
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,000
Seeing Dream fills your heart so much that you're not even hungry.

712
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,400
No. I'm worried about Dream.

713
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,800
Yes, I know, but you need to hurry down here and pay for the grilled pork for me first.

714
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,200
I only have dollars. Hurry.

715
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,000
Okay. I'm coming.

716
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:22,030
♫ Because when it starts to rain, I know the thunder is just a phase ♫

717
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:27,900
♫ Because I have faith I will find my way back to you ♫

718
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,100
Would you like to try?

719
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,100
No. I'm stressed now.

720
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,200
Korn, come quickly.

721
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,100
- Quickly. The merchant is in a hurry.
- Did you guys wait for me until morning?

722
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,700
Well, we have to stick together. Waiting to eat grilled pork.

723
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,300
- We survived.
- Keep the change.

724
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,300
60 baht more.

725
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,000
Oh, really?

726
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,900
Which store did you order from?

727
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,000
I don't know.

728
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Thank you.

729
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,700
Thank you, sir.

730
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,939
Very expensive.

731
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:07,961
Why didn't you order grilled pork at the front of the building?

732
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:10,600
Because we don't have any cash.

733
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,300
So I ordered via the app and had you pay. Smart, right?

734
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,500
Take one, dude.

735
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,100
No.

736
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,200
Well, Korn,

737
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,300
I have something to ask you all about.

738
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,700
What?

739
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,500
You want to renew the contract with Good Goal

740
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,600
and stay in San Francisco.

741
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,100
Or do you want to come back to Thailand?

742
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,600
Brother Ji.

743
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,500
Get up slowly.

744
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,700
How are you?

745
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,400
Are you okay?

746
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:36,000
Okay, but maybe I was sleep-deprived. So I just fainted.

747
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,900
And what about the ransomware?

748
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,800
All the files have been recovered.

749
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,300
Korn came to help just in time.

750
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:04,200
But back in Thailand, I feel I'm happy and thrilled,

751
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,400
and it's much more reassuring.

752
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,700
- But what I'm going to tell you is...
- What?

753
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,400
this place is our home.

754
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,700
I think we'd better vote.

755
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,800
You have now the casting vote.

756
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,200
Because I want to stay here,

757
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,700
and you want to go back because the money is so good.

758
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,700
Who said I want to go back? I want to stay here, too.

759
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,000
So, your vote doesn't count. It's two to one.

760
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,400
Okay.

761
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,500
Are you serious?

762
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:47,800
Well, it's not like you guys wanted to go to the US.

763
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,000
You were forced to go because it was my dream.

764
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,100
Thanks for not resenting me.

765
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,000
Don't touch me. It's disgusting. You jerk.

766
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,500
Sorry.

767
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,400
You hurry up and go upstairs.

768
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,400
Dream must have woken up. So you can tell her.

769
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,900
So, I'll get going.

770
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,400
Yeah.

771
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,300
It's three-zero anyway.

772
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,900
My "dream" is here.

773
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,300
As if!

774
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,500
Hurry and run.

775
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,600
He's acting cool.

776
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,100
So cool!

777
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,600
You look better.

778
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,200
What's the matter?

779
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,300
As someone who came first,

780
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,900
I recommend you go back.

781
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,300
But I came back to do what I said three years ago.

782
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,100
In the last three years, things changed.

783
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,100
You changed.

784
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,900
I changed.

785
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
Dream changed.

786
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,000
You don't want to confuse Dream, do you?

787
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:52,179
Alice. Dream. Have you seen the news about Morning AI yet?
[Next Episode]

788
00:54:52,179 --> 00:54:54,774
Morning AI also launched a Smart Home project.

789
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:56,400
You guys have a competitor.

790
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,500
Get Samakorn to join us or I'll fire you.

791
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,800
When you can't throw something away

792
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,900
but can't keep it either, what should you do?

793
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,300
I want to ask you to develop Miracle World.

794
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,800
If you don't really care about him,

795
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,400
stop making him confused.

796
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:42,100
♫ It’s like the stars have been snuffed out ♫

797
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,990
♫ It’s not the same, they’re not shining enough for me to see the way ♫

798
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:51,860
♫ The fading sky ends up in darkness ♫

799
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:56,730
♫ There’s no hand for me to hold from someone who was once beside me ♫

800
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:01,630
♫ I’m going in circles in the same place ♫

801
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:06,570
♫ Where we used to be before you abandoned me ♫

802
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:11,440
♫ However much I run, whatever I do ♫

803
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,980
♫ I find only exhaustion ♫

804
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,640
♫ When I close my eyes, I still see your image ♫

805
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:26,640
♫ Whichever way I look, I still see you ♫

806
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:33,660
♫ I still don’t know how to endure this, I still don’t know ♫

807
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,730
♫ When will the stars in the sky return and shine again? ♫

808
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:43,630
♫  ♫

809
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,860
