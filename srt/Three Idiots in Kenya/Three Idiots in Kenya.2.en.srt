00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:12,838
THREE IDIOTS IN KENYA

2
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:14,471
Should we eat here?

3
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:16,638
WHAT ARE THEY EATING NOW?

4
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:17,938
It might taste bitter.

5
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:20,238
AN UNEXPECTED PILE OF FRUIT APPEARS

6
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:22,338
Welcome. How many in your party?

7
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:24,371
WHERE DID IT ALL COME FROM?

8
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:28,105
THAT CAFE EARLIER

9
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,505
HAD A FRUIT STORE NEXT DOOR

10
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:35,538
FULL OF KENYAN FRUITS

11
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:36,971
These must be avocados.

12
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,105
-Yes, I think so.
-Let's try one.

13
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:40,538
Are you getting bananas?

14
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:42,138
Doesn't this look good?

15
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:43,471
How do you take it out?

16
00:00:43,538 --> 00:00:46,405
-They're small, but they look good.
-They do.

17
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:50,471
Mango.

18
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:53,238
A BOWL FULL OF FRUIT

19
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:54,605
Let's buy some peanuts.

20
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,571
You want them in the shell
or ready to eat?

21
00:00:56,638 --> 00:00:59,171
-Ready to eat.
-Okay, let's buy this one.

22
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:02,871
HE PEELS THE MANGO WITH HIS CLEAN HANDS

23
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:07,638
FULL-ON PEELING MODE

24
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:10,305
Who peels a mango like that?

25
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,138
OH…

26
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,438
Ji-won.

27
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:14,571
OH, NO

28
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,071
The seed.

29
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:17,138
A TOTAL MESS

30
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:18,505
It's like filleting a fish.

31
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:21,371
Just try it like this. Try it.

32
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,205
HE FILLETS A KENYAN MANGO

33
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:27,338
HE TASTES IT FIRST

34
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:28,738
The banana was delicious.

35
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:31,371
Hey, it's really good. Try it.

36
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,905
-It doesn't look that ripe.
-Just try it.

37
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:34,971
Ji-won, try it.

38
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,071
A BIG BITE

39
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:39,805
This doesn't taste like
any mango I've had.

40
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:41,905
What kind of mango did he have?

41
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,971
-It kind of tastes like petroleum.
-What?

42
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,971
That's crazy. Don't be ridiculous.

43
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:48,371
ACTUALLY

44
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:50,438
IT'S NOT THAT RIDICULOUS

45
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:51,505
FRUIT TRIVIA

46
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:54,838
AS MANGOES RIPEN, THEY PRODUCE COMPOUNDS
THAT SMELL LIKE PETROLEUM

47
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:58,105
KENYA'S NGOWE MANGOES

48
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:01,538
ARE ESPECIALLY KNOWN
FOR THEIR UNIQUELY STRONG SMELL

49
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:02,738
It tastes like petroleum.

50
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:05,938
-This is the freshest mango I've ever had.
-Petroleum? That's funny.

51
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:07,905
There we go.

52
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,038
NEXT UP, THE GIANT AVOCADO

53
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:11,871
Check out how big the avocado pit is.

54
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,605
-This is the avocado pit.
-What?

55
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,105
The avocado pit is this big.

56
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:19,805
A HIGH-YIELDING PRODUCE IN KENYA

57
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:23,438
KENYA IS THE LARGEST EXPORTER
OF AVOCADO IN AFRICA

58
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:25,505
DIRECTOR NAH TASTES THE AVOCADO FIRST

59
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:26,638
JI-WON TRIES A PEANUT

60
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:27,705
IMPRESSED

61
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:30,171
Really? What's so great about an avocado?

62
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:31,771
I'm having this with drinks tonight.

63
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:34,271
-I've never seen one this big.
-It's cheaper here.

64
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,405
I bet the viewers
haven't seen one this big either.

65
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:37,805
-It's good.
-It really is.

66
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,805
EXCLAIMS AT HOW SAVORY IT IS

67
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,438
Take a break, guys.

68
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:42,338
-Okay.
-Okay.

69
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:44,005
I'll come and get you in an hour.

70
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:47,271
VITAMIN BOOST COMPLETE
NOW RECHARGING THEIR ENERGY

71
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:48,938
Are you sleeping?

72
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,371
THE ELDEST IDIOT IS ON THE PHONE

73
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,205
It's not even 5 p.m. yet.

74
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:55,571
SURPRISED

75
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:56,571
We'll have dinner soon.

76
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,905
It's been a long day
since we started at 6 a.m.

77
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,671
You must be so tired, honey.

78
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:02,171
Get some rest.

79
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:04,305
Okay, you too.

80
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:05,605
I will.

81
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,438
NEXT TO THE LONG-DISTANCE COUPLE

82
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,871
THE YOUNGER MEMBERS ENJOY QUALITY TIME
WITH MODERN CIVILIZATION

83
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:14,238
This world-class sprinter
races against a giraffe.

84
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:17,138
Giraffes can run up to
60 kilometers per hour.

85
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:19,938
LEARNS ABOUT ANIMALS
BEFORE THE SAFARI TRIP

86
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:23,271
However, running alongside a giraffe
is only a warm-up.

87
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:26,371
Because soon, he will be facing a zebra
that runs at 55 kilometers per hour.

88
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:28,338
Let's go.

89
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:32,305
-Get ready.
-We're ready to go.

90
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:34,805
You're not going to tell us
what we're having?

91
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:39,205
-We probably won't get to eat anyway.
-You'll find out when we get there.

92
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:42,005
What could it be?
Could it be bibimbap with wild greens?

93
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,771
FROM A FARAWAY LAND,
HE LONGS FOR THE TASTE OF HOME

94
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:46,638
It's dinner,
so it must be something special.

95
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:48,705
I think Kenya's known for naengmyeon.

96
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,271
Pyongyang-style naengmyeon
with giraffe meat.

97
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:54,938
THEY ARRIVE AT THEIR DESTINATION

98
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:56,705
-I think we're here.
-We're here.

99
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,771
-K'osa… K'osewe?
-It's K'Osewe.

100
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:00,905
Do they sell noodles?

101
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,805
Feels like a traditional Korean restaurant
but Kenyan style.

102
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:04,771
Yes, you're right.

103
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:05,805
I'm so curious.

104
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,305
It's a traditional restaurant
that locals go to.

105
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,205
-It's a traditional place.
-We have to go.

106
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,005
-It's a local restaurant?
-Yes.

107
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,371
A traditional Kenyan meal.

108
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:15,805
-I'm glad we're here.
-A traditional Kenyan meal?

109
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:19,038
A FEAST FOR THE EYES AND MOUTH
K'OSEWE RANALO FOODS

110
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,105
VARIOUS KENYAN DISHES

111
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:29,338
A PLACE TO ENJOY LOCAL DISHES
STEEPED IN EAST AFRICAN CULTURE

112
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,405
A FULL KENYAN MEAL FOR THE IDIOTS

113
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:35,505
-Go on in.
-The food's laid out already.

114
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:38,105
-The food is already here.
-Have a seat.

115
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:39,205
It looks delicious.

116
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:40,838
Is this finally… What?

117
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,938
This is driving me crazy.
I want to try this.

118
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:45,405
-It looks good.
-Look at the stir-fried potatoes.

119
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:46,971
There's galbijjim.

120
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:51,338
EXOTIC DISHES FILL THE ENTIRE TABLE

121
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:53,371
Should I explain each dish?

122
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:56,138
-I'm switching to battle mode.
-This is a traditional Kenyan meal.

123
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,938
Starting from Ji-won's side.
This is a plate of chicken wings.

124
00:04:59,005 --> 00:04:59,838
It's chicken.

125
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:01,071
They're chicken wings.

126
00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:03,271
EVERYONE LOVES CHICKEN WINGS

127
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:06,605
And this drink is called dawa.

128
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:09,138
It's a cocktail made
with honey, ginger, and lemon.

129
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:10,938
-A cocktail?
-A cocktail sounds nice.

130
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:12,338
DAWA
TRADITIONAL COCKTAIL

131
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:15,805
-In Swahili, dawa means medicine.
-Medicine?

132
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:17,638
-It's medicine.
-It must be good for colds.

133
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:19,505
It's good for colds, coughs,
and sore throats.

134
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:20,771
This is a wet fish.

135
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:22,738
-Wet.
-It's wet.

136
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:23,805
Yes, it's wet.

137
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:28,005
This fish comes from Lake Victoria,
the largest lake in Africa.

138
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,905
It's a fish called tilapia.

139
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:33,371
They fried it whole
and poured tomato sauce over it.

140
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:35,271
I'm confident Ji-won will like this.

141
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:36,738
These are samosas.

142
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:37,871
SAMOSA

143
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,638
KENYAN RENDITION OF INDIAN FRIED DUMPLINGS

144
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:41,371
This is kachumbari.

145
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:44,138
It's a tomato salad
eaten all across Africa.

146
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:47,038
-You wanted this.
-I've been looking for this dish.

147
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:49,138
Fried rice. Chao fan.

148
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:51,805
SU-GEUN'S FAVORITE, FRIED RICE

149
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:53,605
TOMATO BEEF STIR-FRY

150
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,538
SAUTÉED POTATOES

151
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,905
This looks like galbijjim.

152
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:00,138
-It's beef.
-Guess what that is, Kyuhyun.

153
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:01,405
It's beef galbijjim.

154
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,638
-Did you say beef?
-Yes.

155
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:04,371
WHAT IS IT?

156
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:08,171
It's called mbuzi stew. Mbuzi means goat.

157
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:09,738
-Goat.
-It's braised goat ribs.

158
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:13,238
-That sounds good.
-But we also eat goat in Korea.

159
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:15,038
I think it'll be tender.

160
00:06:15,638 --> 00:06:17,771
-I'll pass.
-You don't want it either?

161
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:20,438
I'll pass too.

162
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:22,338
BOYCOTTING THE GOAT

163
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:23,638
This one's a pass.

164
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,538
You can take that dish out first.

165
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:27,871
Get rid of the baekseolgi.

166
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,771
-What is that?
-It looks like baekseolgi.

167
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:34,971
Is it someone's first birthday?
Who's having a birthday party?

168
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,938
-That dish is important.
-It's baekseolgi.

169
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:40,538
The dish that looks like baekseolgi
is called ugali.

170
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,905
-Ugali?
-It's made with corn.

171
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:44,605
-Ugali?
-It's made with corn?

172
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,305
Why don't you like goat meat?

173
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,705
-I haven't had goat meat.
-I haven't either.

174
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:52,371
-I'll decline the mbuzi.
-We should try it.

175
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:54,571
Even my father hasn't tried it yet.

176
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,505
-Your father hasn't tried any of these.
-I…

177
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,505
-Play rock-paper-scissors.
-Okay.

178
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:01,071
The winner should try it.

179
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,371
Rock-paper-scissors.

180
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:03,538
Damn it.

181
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:05,738
SU-GEUN GETS TO TRY THE MBUZI

182
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,271
-If it's salty, eat it with rice.
-I'm so sorry,

183
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:11,271
-but it's my first time trying goat meat.
-There's a first for everything.

184
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:14,838
AFTER 50 YEARS,
HE TAKES HIS FIRST BITE OF GOAT MEAT

185
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:18,405
Why are you shaking?

186
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,238
How is it? Be honest.

187
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:24,038
WOW

188
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:25,871
-What's wrong?
-It must be good.

189
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:30,571
It tastes like top-quality jangjorim.
I was so surprised.

190
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:32,771
-I told you it would be good.
-Hey.

191
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:34,238
Should we get rid of it?

192
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,371
-No!
-He said it was delicious.

193
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:39,071
Goat can sound off-putting,
so let's call it mbuzi.

194
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:41,471
-Don't call it a goat. Call it mbuzi.
-Mbuzi.

195
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:43,605
-It's so good.
-Give it a try.

196
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,605
This is so delicious.

197
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:49,138
There's a reason
why people enjoy goat meat.

198
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:52,805
It's been a while,
so to remember the old days,

199
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:54,638
let's play Continue the Phrase.

200
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:56,071
Great. It's just us three.

201
00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:57,438
Continue the Phrase. East, west?

202
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:59,005
-South, north.
-Yes, that's it.

203
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:01,638
-But there are only three of you.
-Yes.

204
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:04,471
-Ji-won, scoot over.
-Will a local person be joining us?

205
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:07,338
Since it's just us three,
the blame game will be intense.

206
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,838
This means Su-geun
will have to answer the most questions.

207
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:11,905
-Why, you ask?
-Why?

208
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:15,571
Su-geun goes first,
then Kyuhyun, and Ji-won, right?

209
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:22,271
After Su-geun answers the first question,
he has to run to the fourth seat.

210
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:23,671
HAS TO GO TO THE 4TH SEAT

211
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:25,605
Let's say Su-geun gets it right again.

212
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,138
-You have to come back.
-You have to return to the first seat.

213
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:31,005
-It's not that big of a deal.
-Is it over if I answer it?

214
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:32,838
-You have to get three right.
-Okay.

215
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,405
-We have to get two.
-Let's go.

216
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,071
-It sounds doable, right?
-It's not bad.

217
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:37,938
-Should we start the first round?
-Wait.

218
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,271
Give us the theme.

219
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:40,438
What's the theme?

220
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:45,505
The person who knows the theme best
can go to the first seat.

221
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:49,405
-If we don't know…
-The first theme is Bestsellers.

222
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,471
-I don't read books.
-Book titles?

223
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:53,205
Is it books?

224
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,505
A DEEP GROAN

225
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:57,071
-Seriously.
-They're well-known, right?

226
00:08:57,138 --> 00:09:00,405
That's right. All of these books
have been number one bestsellers.

227
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:03,005
This may come as a surprise,
but I read books.

228
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:04,605
-What have you read recently?
-What?

229
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,405
-What book?
-I read Lee Kyeong-kyu's book.

230
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:08,605
I've also read all of Han Kang's books.

231
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,938
-What did she write?
-For example, The Vege?

232
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:12,005
Tarian.

233
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,638
Yes, I've read them all.

234
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:15,038
We can totally do this.

235
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:17,005
-What other bestsellers do you know?
-What?

236
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,005
What do you know?

237
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:20,738
I know if they prompt me.
I don't know them off the top of my head.

238
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:23,805
-Are you ready to run over?
-They're planning to give me a hard one.

239
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:25,005
Kill me with your best shot.

240
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:26,371
OKAY, HERE'S THE KILLER QUESTION

241
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:31,471
The Miracles of the Namiya?

242
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,871
The Miracles of the Namiya Boom Boom.

243
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:36,205
Hey.

244
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:39,105
Nami and Boom Boom?

245
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,538
DANCE GROUP FROM THE '90S

246
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:41,671
Wait, time out!

247
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:44,038
You can cuss me out
if you know the answer.

248
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:48,305
I don't know the answer.
I heard it for the first time.

249
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,938
You said you were good at this!

250
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:52,438
Nami? Nami and?

251
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:55,305
I don't even know what Namia is.

252
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:56,971
Which country is this book from?

253
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:59,071
-It's from Japan.
-Oh, Namiya.

254
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:02,205
-But how would we know a Japanese book?
-That's not fair.

255
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:04,105
It's a very famous bestseller.

256
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,105
Is Namiya a name?

257
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,805
The name of the store
is Namiya General Store.

258
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,005
-Namiya?
-Yes.

259
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,938
-What was the title?
-The Miracles of Namiya?

260
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:12,305
General Store.

261
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:14,271
I've never heard of that before.

262
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,638
What is it about?
What kind of miracle was it?

263
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:18,371
I'm sure it was something good.

264
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:20,005
Maybe they became successful.

265
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:22,671
NAMIYA GENERAL STORE,
A HOT SPOT IN SEONGSU

266
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,905
That was funny,
so we'll give you another chance.

267
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,138
ONCE AGAIN

268
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:29,305
-Here we go. Are you ready?
-No, I'm not ready.

269
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:31,871
I'm wiped out after Namiya General Store.

270
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:33,105
NAMIYA KNOCKED HIM OUT

271
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:34,205
Seriously.

272
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:37,038
-I won't even remember what I know.
-All right, Su-geun.

273
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,371
Human?

274
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:41,038
Being.

275
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:43,738
SILENCE

276
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:45,338
-Incorrect.
-Beings?

277
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:48,838
-Human Acts?
-You said you like the writer Han Kang.

278
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:50,138
Human Acts.

279
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:51,805
-You said Beings.
-You did.

280
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:55,038
Did I say that? Isn't that close enough?

281
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:58,471
I haven't seen these two
look so lifeless in a long time.

282
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:01,905
You can take the fish.
It's lifeless, just like us.

283
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:04,505
THE WET FISH IS OUT

284
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:07,505
-Let's switch when he tells us the theme.
-Here's the theme.

285
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:11,138
The theme is Every Brand in the World.

286
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:14,371
-If it's brand names…
-That's Kyuhyun's specialty.

287
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:17,105
-Me? Don't you know better?
-I don't know brand names.

288
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,871
-Don't you know a lot?
-I don't know that many brand names.

289
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:21,871
-Kyuhyun, you can do it.
-I don't know that many.

290
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:24,805
If they're brand names,
they should have name value.

291
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:25,771
That's right.

292
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:29,071
If we've never heard of the brand,
it doesn't count.

293
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:29,971
SUDDENLY SO LOGICAL

294
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,638
Don't give us unknown brands.

295
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,438
-We wouldn't do that.
-You won't, right?

296
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:35,605
-You should go second.
-Me?

297
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:38,305
Yeah, you should see
how nerve-racking it is.

298
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:41,138
Let's go! We should pump ourselves up.

299
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:42,705
-Three, two, one. Let's go!
-Let's go!

300
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:45,038
Is there a cheer in Swahili?

301
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,105
Is there a cheer in Kenya?

302
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:50,271
-Tuko pamoja means "We are one."
-It's too long.

303
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:52,205
-Tuko pamoja.
-Tuko pamoja.

304
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,038
Let's do that. One, two, three.

305
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:55,571
-Tuko pamoja!
-Tuko paboja!

306
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:57,905
-That's not it.
-Tuko pamoja.

307
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:58,971
-All right.
-Tuko pamoja.

308
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:00,605
-Sounds like, "Took a punch at you."
-Right.

309
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:01,805
-Took a punch!
-Took a punch!

310
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,038
You bastards.

311
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:05,371
-Okay, brand names.
-Tuko pamoja.

312
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:07,505
The first question.

313
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:09,771
Lulu?

314
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:11,371
-Lala.
-Incorrect!

315
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:15,005
Looloo Bidets.

316
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:16,671
-Is it bidets?
-Lulu…

317
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:18,138
Lemon?

318
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,005
-That's it.
-It's not Looloo Bidets?

319
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:21,938
-It's not Looloo Bidets?
-Lulu?

320
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,338
Lululala is a brand.

321
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:26,438
-Was Looloo Bidets wrong?
-Looloo Bidets is correct too.

322
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:28,138
Lululala is a thing.

323
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,605
-What is it?
-It's a channel.

324
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:31,938
What channel?

325
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:34,271
-It's a YouTube channel.
-Come on.

326
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,771
I filmed at Lululala.
I did a show with them.

327
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:40,271
-Is it a big studio?
-It is a studio.

328
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:42,438
FACT CHECK

329
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:44,271
It's a really big studio.

330
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,071
They're called Lululala!

331
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:48,905
-Okay, we'll give you one more chance.
-Whatever.

332
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,738
-The studio does exist.
-There was?

333
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,005
So…

334
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,038
-Okay, here we go.
-Okay.

335
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:55,438
ROUND 2 REMATCH

336
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:58,671
Mercedes?

337
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,438
-Benz.
-Correct.

338
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:02,138
The North?

339
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:03,371
-Damus.
-Incorrect!

340
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:04,571
-What?
-The North Face!

341
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:06,638
THE NORTH FACE

342
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:08,905
What in the world is North Damus?

343
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:11,038
I thought it was Nostradamus.

344
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:13,371
Then you should've said that.
What's North Damus?

345
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:16,271
What is North Damus?
Is that the name of a place?

346
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,905
-Seriously.
-You should've just said Nostradamus.

347
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:21,271
-The North Damus.
-Gosh. North…

348
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:24,238
What was the point
of setting an extra chair?

349
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,405
What are we going to do about North Damus?

350
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,671
THEY HAVEN'T REACHED THIS CHAIR

351
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:29,805
North Damus predicted
that we won't get to eat.

352
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:32,571
-That caught me off guard.
-Take something out.

353
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:35,138
-Let's get rid of the drink.
-Okay, take it out.

354
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:38,238
-Can I take a sip?
-I don't have a sore throat.

355
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:39,671
SLURPS

356
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,605
-It has alcohol in it.
-Take it away.

357
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:44,438
The ginger…

358
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:46,705
The ginger is making me shudder.

359
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:47,771
THE DAWA IS OUT

360
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:49,238
It'd be good if it were hot.

361
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:50,871
-The ginger must be strong.
-Yes.

362
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:53,405
-I can't…
-Let's try brand names again.

363
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,171
Please give us something easy.

364
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:58,371
-I'll give you an easy one.
-Something only an idiot would miss.

365
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,238
-Don't be discouraged.
-Shake it off and sit up straight.

366
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:03,338
Let's go in swinging.

367
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:06,171
-Tuko… punch at you.
-What?

368
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:08,205
Tuko punch! Just yell it out loud.

369
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:09,105
Tuko maboja.

370
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:11,038
THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY
WHAT THEY LEARNED EARLIER

371
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:12,505
-Tuko punch!
-Tuko punch!

372
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:14,038
IT'S TUKO PAMOJA

373
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:15,705
Okay, here we go.

374
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,238
-Starting with Kyuhyun.
-Okay.

375
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:22,438
I think Kyuhyun will get this one right,
but Ji-won…

376
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,071
-He'll get it wrong.
-Really?

377
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:25,305
What's wrong with you?

378
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:27,671
-Get it together.
-I didn't do anything.

379
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:29,238
I was just waiting for my turn.

380
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:32,071
They just said you'd get it wrong.

381
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:36,005
Hold on. What's wrong with you?
I was just waiting for my turn.

382
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:38,371
-They said you'd get it wrong.
-Don't let them do this.

383
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:39,938
-Let them do what?
-Treat you like this.

384
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:40,971
-Don't let them.
-Come on.

385
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:43,038
Ji-won knows a lot of brand names.

386
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:45,605
I was just sitting here.
Why are you picking on me?

387
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:46,971
ROUND 3 RESUMES

388
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:48,971
-Let's start with Kyuhyun.
-Okay.

389
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:51,971
Ralph?

390
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,405
-Lauren.
-Correct.

391
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:54,305
Car?

392
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:56,071
-Bona.
-No!

393
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:57,738
-Cartier.
-Incorrect!

394
00:14:57,805 --> 00:14:59,038
No!

395
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,671
-What are you doing?
-Incorrect!

396
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:02,171
-Cartier.
-What are you…

397
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:04,871
Why doesn't he know Cartier?

398
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,071
-What did he say?
-Carbona?

399
00:15:07,138 --> 00:15:08,238
I just…

400
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:09,705
Carbs on a plate?

401
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,538
-Carbona?
-Are these carbs on a plate?

402
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:13,738
Is it carbonara?

403
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:16,705
That's enough. Just take something out.

404
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:18,471
Carbonara.

405
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:20,138
That's the name of a pasta, man!

406
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,505
-Isn't that a brand?
-No, it's not.

407
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,038
-It's the name of a dish.
-It's a dish.

408
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:26,105
It's like bibimbap.

409
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:28,538
-Should we take the rice out?
-We should.

410
00:15:28,605 --> 00:15:29,605
Let the tomatoes go first.

411
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:31,638
THE KACHUMBARI IS OUT

412
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:34,971
-What's the theme?
-Let's do Daily Four-Syllable Words.

413
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,038
-I can do this.
-You're good at this.

414
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,338
I'll go first. I'm confident.

415
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,705
Was he good at this?

416
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:42,805
Just let him try. He says he's confident.

417
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:43,871
It's everyday words.

418
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:47,238
-I can tell them I use those words.
-It just has to make sense.

419
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:49,271
-You said it's daily words, right?
-Right.

420
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:50,971
FULL OF CONFIDENCE

421
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:52,738
Here we go.

422
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:55,671
Loa?

423
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:56,771
Los Angeles?

424
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:59,171
-It's loaches!
-Loaches!

425
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,305
Damn it.

426
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:01,371
FLABBERGASTED

427
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:04,905
Everyone here knew what it was.
Why'd you get it wrong?

428
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:09,171
His pronunciation was really good.
He said it better than an anchor would.

429
00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:10,538
What's wrong with you?

430
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:13,938
I thought he was saying "Los Angeles."

431
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,105
I swear!

432
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,938
-Seriously? What's wrong with you?
-I promise.

433
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:19,305
How did you know the answer?

434
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:22,038
I'm just curious.
Why'd you say you were good at this?

435
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:24,305
-He said it was daily words.
-Why were you so confident?

436
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:26,438
This is the one theme I'm decent at.

437
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:27,838
It's okay. You did well.

438
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,271
-Give it one more try.
-We have to take one out.

439
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:32,571
We had too much chicken.
Let's get rid of it.

440
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:33,938
No, not the chicken.

441
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:35,005
Take this away.

442
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,171
-That looks so good.
-I'll buy you some later.

443
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:40,171
THE CHICKEN WINGS ARE OUT

444
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,671
Let's go, Ji-won. You can do it.

445
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:45,505
Even if I get it right,
I'd have to go back and forth.

446
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,405
Right.

447
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:47,705
So, this isn't good.

448
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:49,538
-Su-geun should go first.
-I'll go.

449
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:52,005
If I go first, we're basically giving up.

450
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,305
-Let's go. How hard is it?
-Ready?

451
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,805
This is practically a freebie.

452
00:16:58,871 --> 00:16:59,838
-Daily life?
-Okay.

453
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:02,371
-Are they words from daily life?
-Yes, daily life.

454
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:04,705
-Okay, go.
-Here we go.

455
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:07,271
Noise between?

456
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:08,871
-Floors!
-Correct.

457
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:09,971
Banquet?

458
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:10,871
House.

459
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:12,905
Well, that makes sense.

460
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:14,971
It's a four-syllable word. Incorrect!

461
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:16,405
When did you say that?

462
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:19,705
-I told you before!
-When did you say four syllables?

463
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,471
It just had to make sense.

464
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:24,071
-When did you say four syllables?
-I didn't hear it.

465
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:25,604
LET'S REPLAY THE VIDEO

466
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,138
-Are they words from daily life?
-Yes, daily life.

467
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,938
HE DIDN'T MENTION FOUR SYLLABLES

468
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:33,005
When did you? It just had to make sense.

469
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:35,805
-It has always been four syllables.
-For ten years.

470
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:37,805
-But you didn't say so this time.
-You didn't.

471
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:39,505
I really thought he got it right.

472
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:41,005
What did you say?

473
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:42,238
-Banquet house.
-Banquet house.

474
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:44,238
Sure, there are banquet noodles.

475
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:49,705
-It could've been banquet noodles, but…
-Is banquet house even a thing?

476
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:52,171
I'm sorry,
but is banquet house even a thing?

477
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,505
What's a banquet house?

478
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,238
Where do you eat banquet noodles?

479
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:56,605
At a banquet house.

480
00:17:57,338 --> 00:17:58,338
HE PROVES HIS POINT

481
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,938
At weddings or old…

482
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:03,138
-Where do you eat banquet noodles?
-At a banquet house.

483
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:04,238
-Right?
-A banquet house.

484
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:07,271
That's what I'm saying.
We use that word in our daily life.

485
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:09,538
This is your final warning.
It's four syllables.

486
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,571
Where do you eat banquet noodles?

487
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:12,905
At a banquet house.

488
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:15,905
That's exactly our point.

489
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,638
ROUND 5 REMATCH

490
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:20,305
It's Daily Four-Syllable Words.
It has to be four syllables.

491
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:22,938
-Here we go.
-Hey, your eyes…

492
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,505
Take off your glasses.

493
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,338
I feel so out of it.

494
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,905
HE LOOKS DRAINED

495
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:28,805
Let's do this.

496
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:29,871
ROUND 5 REMATCH

497
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:31,438
Papa?

498
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:32,805
Go! Gogogo.

499
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:34,271
PAPAGO! GOGOGO

500
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:36,905
See? It's paparazzi!

501
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:39,305
-It's easy when it's not your turn.
-Paparazzi!

502
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:40,571
-Incorrect!
-It's not Papago?

503
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:41,938
-Papa?
-Gogo.

504
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:43,905
-What's that?
-Papago.

505
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:44,971
The translation…

506
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:47,038
-Papa…
-It's paparazzi.

507
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,238
It's easy when it's someone else's turn.

508
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:51,971
-Paparazzi.
-I've been using Papago a lot lately.

509
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:53,271
-What's Papagogo?
-Take a dish out.

510
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:55,038
I'm sorry. Kyuhyun, you go first.

511
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:56,871
Let's give them the goat.

512
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,705
-But this…
-Let's choose the goat.

513
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,271
Without rice, these potatoes
aren't a great bar snack.

514
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:03,771
-I meant to say side dish.
-It's not a bar snack.

515
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,338
-We don't need it.
-We know what potatoes taste like.

516
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:07,738
-Right, it's…
-It's nothing new.

517
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:09,738
-We don't have much rice.
-Okay, fine.

518
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,805
You can taste it before handing it over.

519
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:13,138
Rock-paper-scissors.

520
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:14,605
I always lose at times like this.

521
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:17,305
-You should've just stepped out.
-Sorry, go on.

522
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:18,671
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.

523
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:21,138
-Potatoes?
-You dip it in here.

524
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,271
-This looks good.
-Let's keep it if it's good.

525
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:24,905
-Tell us if it's good.
-It's a bit dry now.

526
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:27,571
-You eat it with this sauce.
-If it's good, choose another dish.

527
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:29,105
There you go.

528
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:31,738
You can't go wrong with chili sauce.

529
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,338
-How is it?
-You want to take this out?

530
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,838
-It's so good.
-I told you.

531
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:37,538
-Let's take this out.
-We have to keep that dish.

532
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:39,971
Why do you even want to eat this?

533
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,238
-What will you eat it with?
-It's the staple here.

534
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:44,338
-But it's not ours.
-Still--

535
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,505
-We have to eat that.
-He's right.

536
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:49,738
We're here for a week.
What will they think if they watch this?

537
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,638
They'll see it after we leave.

538
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:54,605
This isn't our staple food.

539
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:57,971
I thought if we filmed today,
it would air tomorrow.

540
00:19:58,038 --> 00:19:59,171
It's not like that.

541
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:02,138
IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S STAPLE FOOD
UGALI IS OUT

542
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:04,605
The next theme is right up your alley.

543
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,338
-What is it?
-What's the theme?

544
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,438
ROUND 6 THEME

545
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:08,971
Let's go with Drama Titles.

546
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:10,838
-This is--
-I'm really bad at this.

547
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,971
-Why?
-I don't watch TV, so I don't know.

548
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:14,238
Then, go to the end.

549
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:15,738
-I'll be over here.
-Okay.

550
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:18,771
-Do you want to do a practice round?
-Better you than me.

551
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:21,771
If we do a practice round,
can you guess the title?

552
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:23,505
-I'll try.
-Whisper it in his ear.

553
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:24,771
WARM-UP

554
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:26,305
No, just say it.

555
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:29,371
-Honjeo.
-Opseoye.

556
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,638
-That's right.
-Is it?

557
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:31,871
But what is that?

558
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,371
-I don't know.
-What is that?

559
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:35,805
Is that a drama title?

560
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,405
-Honjeo opseoye…
-That's not a drama.

561
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,471
The one with IU.

562
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:42,605
-When Life Gives You Tangerines.
-I meant When Life Gives You Tangerines.

563
00:20:44,238 --> 00:20:46,638
-Honjeo…
-Where did even that come from?

564
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,138
-I'm so sorry.
-That's enough.

565
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:54,471
-If you're going to do it like that, stop.
-I'm sorry. I was just watching it.

566
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:57,805
I watched two episodes,
but I don't know where that came from.

567
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:00,138
-Let's do it.
-I just watched it.

568
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:01,871
Pa… Pama…

569
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:04,338
-To go.
-Let's take it to go.

570
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:05,471
THEY FORGOT IT AGAIN

571
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:06,471
EQUALLY

572
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:08,105
FORGETFUL

573
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:09,305
Okay, here we go.

574
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:11,638
Starting with Kyuhyun.

575
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,371
The Trauma Code?

576
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:15,838
-Heroes on Call.
-Correct!

577
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:16,805
Soonpoong?

578
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:18,338
-Clinic.
-That's correct!

579
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,771
JI-WON'S FIRST CORRECT ANSWER

580
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:21,771
Reborn?

581
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:23,538
-Rich.
-Correct!

582
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:24,838
My Girlfriend Is?

583
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:26,205
-A Gumiho.
-Correct!

584
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,705
THEY MAKE IT PAST THE HALFWAY POINT

585
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:30,438
Strong Girl?

586
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:32,271
-Bong-soon.
-Correct!

587
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:35,305
-What is this?
-You jerks.

588
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:37,671
The World of?

589
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:38,671
No, wait.

590
00:21:38,738 --> 00:21:41,138
-The World of?
-The World of the Time.

591
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:42,505
-Incorrect!
-What was that?

592
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:44,838
-The World of the Married.
-How could you get that wrong?

593
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:46,638
I couldn't remember.

594
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,271
What's The World of the Married?

595
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:51,405
-The pace… Tell him.
-You threw my pace off.

596
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:54,538
You had plenty of time.
I gave you enough time to answer.

597
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,471
-You did. We have nothing to say.
-He did.

598
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:58,605
ZONING OUT

599
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:00,138
Nothing's going right thanks to Ji-won.

600
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:03,505
Which of the remaining dishes
do you like best?

601
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:04,771
-What do you want?
-Everything.

602
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:06,671
-Pick one dish.
-That one.

603
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:07,805
Let's take it out.

604
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:10,305
-Okay, take it out.
-Not that one.

605
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,471
-I feel bad.
-The goat.

606
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,105
-No, not the mbuzi.
-I've tried it already.

607
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:17,471
MBUZI STEW IS OUT

608
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:19,405
We have four rounds left.

609
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,338
I don't think we can do drama titles.

610
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:23,638
-Ji-won doesn't watch dramas.
-I don't.

611
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:24,971
I have no interest in them.

612
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:30,005
I know Ji-won doesn't watch dramas,
but I've heard he watches movies.

613
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:31,271
-Yes, he does.
-Movies?

614
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:33,538
-He watches movies.
-He can get it right.

615
00:22:33,605 --> 00:22:34,638
I'm not sure.

616
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:38,705
Let's try it. Okay, starting with Kyuhyun.

617
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:40,605
12.12?

618
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:41,838
I know this one.

619
00:22:41,905 --> 00:22:43,171
-The Day.
-Correct.

620
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,171
-Isn't it "Moon"?
-That's the title of a drama.

621
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:47,238
Is it "The Day"?

622
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:48,505
Decision to?

623
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:49,571
-Go.
-Leave.

624
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:50,471
Incorrect!

625
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:53,138
-What was that?
-Decision to Leave.

626
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,338
-Leave?
-Seriously?

627
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:56,105
-Decision to Go?
-What is that?

628
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,371
I don't know that movie.

629
00:22:57,438 --> 00:22:59,271
I hope this is the last round.

630
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:02,405
-What's the theme?
-Foreign Celebrities and Stars.

631
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:04,305
Correct! Timothy?

632
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,638
-Timothy?
-Chal…

633
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:08,071
-I've never heard of him.
-Incorrect!

634
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,571
Timo Who?

635
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,771
Come on, dude.

636
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,771
CLUELESS ABOUT HOLLYWOOD

637
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:14,005
What movie was he in?

638
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:15,105
-You don't know?
-Dune.

639
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:16,238
He was in Dune.

640
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,571
-June?
-Dune.

641
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:19,638
It's not "June."

642
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:22,038
TOMATO BEEF STIR-FRY AND SAMOSAS ARE OUT

643
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:25,371
We have to get it right now.
We've gotten enough laughs.

644
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:28,038
THEY GOT SO MANY LAUGHS
THAT ONLY TWO DISHES REMAIN

645
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:29,805
Let's do Daily Four-Syllable Words.

646
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:32,938
-I'm ready to roll with it.
-Let's relax a bit.

647
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:35,105
We just need to calm down
and take it easy.

648
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:37,538
-It's four syllables.
-Okay, four syllables.

649
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:39,738
-You can do this.
-We're just a bit tense.

650
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:41,505
-Four syllables.
-Let's go.

651
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:43,005
I'm getting so annoyed now.

652
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:44,805
-Don Qui?
-Xote.

653
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:45,971
Correct.

654
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:47,471
-Ana?
-Conda.

655
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:48,838
That's correct!

656
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,105
-Pyongyang?
-Naengmyeon.

657
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:51,171
Correct.

658
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:53,471
ALMOST AT THE HALFWAY POINT

659
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:54,471
Tira?

660
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:56,505
-Misu.
-That's correct!

661
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:58,471
-Sphi?
-Nx.

662
00:23:58,538 --> 00:23:59,371
Correct!

663
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,705
IT'S JI-WON'S TURN

664
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:03,405
Chat G?

665
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:06,338
-Check G?
-Chat G.

666
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,738
Chatty?

667
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:09,271
Chat G.

668
00:24:09,338 --> 00:24:10,738
PT.

669
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:13,105
JI-WON GETS IT RIGHT

670
00:24:13,171 --> 00:24:14,805
Last question. Birch?

671
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:15,871
Tree.

672
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,871
Isn't that right? Birch tree.

673
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:19,171
Correct!

674
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:22,671
Birch tree. I got it right.
That was the answer, right?

675
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:25,738
I thought you'd get it wrong
and say something funny.

676
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:27,138
I was surprised you got it right.

677
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:30,471
-When he said "Chat G," I heard "Chug it."
-Oh, come on.

678
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,638
-Anyway, you guys did it.
-We did it.

679
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,738
-Good job.
-That was a tough one.

680
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:36,805
-Let's eat what's left.
-Can you heat it up?

681
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:38,971
-Yes, we'll heat it up for you.
-Thank you.

682
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:45,105
HE TAKES A BITE OF FRIED RICE,
HIS STAPLE FOOD

683
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:47,805
-The smell…
-It's intense.

684
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:49,038
TOO BOLD FOR HIS PALATE

685
00:24:49,105 --> 00:24:51,205
I'm hungry, so it doesn't bother me.

686
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:52,438
It's good.

687
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:55,305
Kenya really suits you, Su-geun.

688
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:57,605
You usually eat like a bird.

689
00:24:57,671 --> 00:24:59,471
-It's tasty.
-You've changed.

690
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:02,438
-This is a familiar taste.
-It is.

691
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:05,238
There's shrimp in here.

692
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:07,271
We went through all that just for this.

693
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:09,905
We came to Kenya for sautéed potatoes.

694
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:12,871
THE GOOD FOOD'S GONE,
AND IT'S DOWN TO A BASIC MEAL

695
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:16,271
We had a layover in Bangkok,
then flew for another ten hours.

696
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:19,038
All of that to eat sautéed potatoes.

697
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:24,671
Whenever we get together,
this kind of thing always…

698
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:27,605
-I'm grateful to be eating.
-Me too.

699
00:25:29,138 --> 00:25:32,338
THEY FINISH THEIR SIMPLE DINNER

700
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:34,071
DINNER GAME RECAP

701
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:35,571
Nami… What was it?

702
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:37,471
Nami and… No, Namiya.

703
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,405
Was it The Secret of Namiya General Store?

704
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,571
-The Miracles of the Namiya General Store.
-Miracles.

705
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:44,571
I usually forget things like this.

706
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:46,338
It sounds like an animation title.

707
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:47,305
SELF-AWARE

708
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:49,271
What was Lulu again?

709
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:50,271
Lemon.

710
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:52,605
I've never heard of it before.

711
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:53,871
Have you?

712
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:54,938
NEVER HEARD OF IT

713
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:56,538
Lululemon is just…

714
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:58,771
I should look that up.

715
00:25:58,838 --> 00:25:59,671
SEARCHING

716
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:02,638
They sell bags, women's clothes…

717
00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:04,705
It's like a live stream shopping channel.

718
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,505
BAGS AND WOMEN'S CLOTHES
= LIVE STREAM SHOPPING?

719
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:07,405
Before…

720
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:09,571
I've heard of the brand,
but never checked their site.

721
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:13,271
AFTER THEIR SOMEWHAT SLOPPY RECAP

722
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:16,538
THEY ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL

723
00:26:18,305 --> 00:26:19,871
SIGHS

724
00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:21,271
Why did I not…

725
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:26,205
At the airport…

726
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:28,138
What?

727
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:30,671
Nothing, I was just blaming myself.

728
00:26:30,738 --> 00:26:31,738
For what?

729
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:34,971
I don't know why
I didn't put it in my pocket.

730
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:37,838
-What?
-My phone.

731
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:40,071
KYUHYUN IS STILL NOT OVER HIS LOSS

732
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:41,971
I thought you let that go.

733
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:43,605
It keeps popping up in my mind.

734
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:46,505
HE TRIES TO FORGET, BUT HIS HEART ACHES

735
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,538
Is it your first time losing your phone?

736
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,605
-This is the first time.
-Oh, really?

737
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:55,571
Then it must be pretty jarring.

738
00:26:57,338 --> 00:27:01,671
I lost it for the first time ever,
and it had to be in Africa, of all places.

739
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:04,438
KYUHYUN LOST HIS OTHER HALF
IN A FOREIGN LAND

740
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:06,905
I think I would've found it
if I'd lost it in Korea.

741
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:09,871
Do you think so?

742
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:10,938
I think so.

743
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,871
HE KEEPS FEEDING HIS POINTLESS WHAT-IFS

744
00:27:13,871 --> 00:27:17,371
THE FIRST BREAKUP IS ALWAYS THE HARDEST

745
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:21,571
KYUHYUN GETS OUT OF THE SHOWER

746
00:27:22,671 --> 00:27:24,471
DISTRAUGHT

747
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:30,505
HE CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT HIS OTHER HALF

748
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:33,338
HE TRIES TO DISTRACT HIMSELF

749
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:37,738
TRUDGING

750
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:40,405
WHIRRING

751
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:43,738
MAY THE WIND BLOW AWAY THE PAIN

752
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:50,805
MAY YOU SLEEP SOUNDLY
AND LET THE SADNESS DRIFT AWAY

753
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:55,205
DAWN BREAKS ON THE SECOND DAY

754
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:59,605
GOLDEN RAYS SPILL OVER THE CITY

755
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:06,738
FILLING NAIROBI'S MORNING WITH ENERGY

756
00:28:07,238 --> 00:28:09,571
IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP

757
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:11,238
THE IDIOTS GET READY

758
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:12,305
We have your mics…

759
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:13,971
What?

760
00:28:14,838 --> 00:28:16,005
Cafe!

761
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,038
Cafe!

762
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:20,071
THE STAFF COME TO MIC THEM UP

763
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:22,238
GIVE US FOOD!

764
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:24,538
SU-GEUN OFFERS A GREETING
IN HIS OWN UNIQUE WAY

765
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,771
Does the hotel give us breakfast?

766
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,705
That's for the staff.

767
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:30,071
Shouldn't we get some too?

768
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:33,271
-I woke up early to eat--
-We're going out to eat soon.

769
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,705
-But we--
-Just wait a bit.

770
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:36,538
-We can't eat!
-We don't get to eat!

771
00:28:36,605 --> 00:28:37,505
I meant us.

772
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:40,638
-What will we do at the restaurant?
-It's meaningless.

773
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:43,171
I'm sure they'll let us eat today.

774
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:45,505
He thinks they'll let us eat.

775
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:47,405
Why is he so optimistic?

776
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:50,205
-They didn't let us eat yesterday.
-You were pessimistic

777
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,638
when you lost your phone.

778
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:53,738
You were so pessimistic.

779
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:55,238
THEY START TEASING HIM AGAIN

780
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:56,905
Will they give us breakfast?

781
00:28:58,005 --> 00:28:59,171
I doubt it.

782
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,171
AT THAT MOMENT

783
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:11,171
A STAFF MEMBER RETURNS FOR SOME REASON

784
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:17,571
Kyuhyun, your mic was switched.

785
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:19,771
-You have bags under your eyes.
-What?

786
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,905
-Are you wearing glasses?
-Here's your mic.

787
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:22,971
Leave that company.

788
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:24,105
Is this a backup mic?

789
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:25,971
Go somewhere nicer.

790
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:26,871
FLUTTERS

791
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:28,538
Do you want to come to my company?

792
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:29,938
-What is this?
-I can help you.

793
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,638
That would be nice.

794
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:35,305
COME TO ROOM 342 WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT

795
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,271
AWKWARD AS IT WAS,
THE RENDEZVOUS POINT WAS PASSED ON

796
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:40,571
AND AT THAT LOCATION

797
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:43,405
SOMEONE EAGERLY AWAITS KYUHYUN

798
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,005
HE'S BEEN SUMMONED

799
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:47,738
Lift your heels up and down
while standing.

800
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:49,538
THEY'RE EXERCISING IN FRONT OF THE DOOR

801
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:50,571
1ST OBSTACLE: THE SHARP GUY

802
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:52,105
2ND OBSTACLE: THE CRAZY GUY

803
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:54,238
You can really feel the burn back here.

804
00:29:54,305 --> 00:29:56,205
THEY UNINTENTIONALLY BLOCK THE DOORWAY

805
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:58,538
This is the best exercise, Su-geun.

806
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:00,538
VYING FOR HIS CHANCE

807
00:30:00,871 --> 00:30:04,005
HE CAREFULLY GETS UP

808
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:05,771
Should I wear sunscreen?

809
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,505
-You have to put it on.
-I didn't.

810
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:09,371
-Did you bring it?
-Yeah, but I didn't put it on.

811
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:10,638
THE QUESTION DERAILS HIM

812
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:12,071
You'll get bitten by bugs.

813
00:30:13,138 --> 00:30:15,571
-If I wear sunscreen?
-Yes, it attracts bugs.

814
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:17,105
-Wearing sunscreen?
-Yes.

815
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:18,805
JI-WON MAKES A BIZARRE CLAIM

816
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:20,505
The scent attracts bugs.

817
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:21,871
-Sunscreen does?
-Yes.

818
00:30:21,938 --> 00:30:26,738
People who spray sunscreen
tend to get a lot of bug bites.

819
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:27,805
CREEPING AWAY

820
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:29,605
Really?

821
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:31,071
SCURRIES

822
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:33,938
-Don't shave while we're here.
-I didn't shave today.

823
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:39,438
HE'S TALKING TO THEM,
BUT HIS MIND IS ELSEWHERE

824
00:30:42,238 --> 00:30:45,238
JI-WON FOLLOWS HIM OUT

825
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:46,905
Do you know what this is?

826
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,971
ENGAGES IN SMALL TALK AGAIN

827
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:51,771
-Yeah, you eat it.
-That's right.

828
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:54,105
-It's really minty.
-I almost died eating one.

829
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:55,371
It's so intense.

830
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,971
Can I have one? I like how it tastes.

831
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,305
TRIES TO SEND HIM AWAY

832
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:02,738
It's way too strong.

833
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:05,905
CHEWING FRANTICALLY

834
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:09,971
What do you mean you like how it tastes?

835
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,005
-It tastes good.
-Su-geun.

836
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,471
GOES BACK AFTER A GOOD LAUGH

837
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:15,538
Su-geun.

838
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:17,138
HE FLEES

839
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:18,605
-Su-geun.
-Yes?

840
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:19,805
Try this.

841
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:25,571
HE SLIPS OUT OF THE ROOM UNNOTICED

842
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,505
What is it?

843
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:31,805
Just eat it.

844
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,405
SUCKS ON THE MINT

845
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:36,105
-It's minty.
-Yeah, it's really refreshing.

846
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,805
It's so strong.

847
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:46,405
AT THAT VERY MOMENT,
KYUHYUN ENTERS THE RENDEZVOUS POINT

848
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:52,771
Come on.

849
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:54,805
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

850
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:58,171
I had a mint, and it's so strong.

851
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:01,871
Cut it out, man.

852
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:03,905
HE PURIFIES THE AIR WITH HIS MINTY BREATH

853
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:06,005
There's a reason why I called you here.

854
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,871
-It must be a mission.
-You bet.

855
00:32:07,938 --> 00:32:10,005
It's a secret mission, just for you.

856
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,805
Chostradamus'…

857
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:13,738
Prediction?

858
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:16,305
CHOSTRADAMUS' PREDICTION

859
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:18,805
-We'll be going out for breakfast soon.
-Okay.

860
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,838
And you will be Chostradamus.

861
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:25,438
From the moment we pass the boom gate

862
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:28,938
to the moment we take our seats
at the breakfast location,

863
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:35,338
think about what the two of them
will say or do.

864
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,805
And fill in this bingo board.

865
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:39,738
A 4X4 BINGO GAME
BASED ON WORDS AND ACTIONS

866
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:40,738
THE MISSION STARTS

867
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:42,638
THE SECOND THEY LEAVE THE HOTEL ENTRANCE

868
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,671
AND ENDS THE MOMENT THEY ARE SEATED

869
00:32:44,738 --> 00:32:46,971
CLEAR THE MISSION
FOR A BOWL OF KENYAN SOUP AND RICE

870
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:49,871
-I have to write what I think they'll do?
-That's right.

871
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:51,405
Can I write what I will do?

872
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,471
That's a new approach.

873
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,271
-No, you can't do that.
-Right.

874
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:58,805
You have to predict what they'll do.

875
00:32:58,871 --> 00:33:01,071
If you get three bingos,
all of you can eat.

876
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:04,305
If you only get two bingos, only…

877
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:05,905
-Only two of us can eat?
-Yes.

878
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:08,405
-Who are those two?
-Seniority comes first.

879
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:10,238
Oh, the elders go first.

880
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:12,071
That means they have an advantage.

881
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:15,738
This is a group mission.
You're Chostradamus.

882
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:17,538
MEAL WINNERS: IN ORDER OF SENIORITY

883
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:19,871
WHICH MEANS,
HE MIGHT END UP DOING THEM A FAVOR

884
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:21,871
This is actually really simple.

885
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:23,771
-Did you bring them coffee?
-Not yet.

886
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,205
If you haven't, don't give them any.

887
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,605
-You have three minutes.
-Okay.

888
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:30,738
Three minutes? That's too short. Okay.

889
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:33,305
-They'll get suspicious.
-Okay.

890
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:37,005
Saying "Cafe" still counts as "Coffee."

891
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:39,905
You have to be clear.
Is it coffee or cafe?

892
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:43,938
SQUARE 1: CAFE!

893
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,838
THEY SAY IT ALL THE TIME

894
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:47,671
Can I put "Whoa"?

895
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:48,871
TARGETS EXCLAMATIONS

896
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:50,705
-Sure, go ahead.
-Okay.

897
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:52,971
-But they have to say it the same way.
-Sure.

898
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:54,371
4TH SQUARE: WHOA

899
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,105
Filling up 16 squares isn't easy.

900
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,238
What else is there? Can I write fa--

901
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:01,138
NO, YOU CAN'T

902
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:04,371
LET'S KEEP OUR LANGUAGE CLEAN

903
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:05,671
-No.
-Okay.

904
00:34:05,738 --> 00:34:08,005
This may be Netflix,
but that's taking it too far.

905
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:09,338
I understand.

906
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:12,138
Can I say they'll tease me
for losing my phone?

907
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:14,105
7TH SQUARE: TEASE ME FOR LOSING MY PHONE

908
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:15,538
"What did you have for breakfast?"

909
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:17,371
14TH SQUARE:
WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR BREAKFAST?

910
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:19,405
HE GETS AN IDEA

911
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:21,505
-What's that?
-They'll talk about Tinya.

912
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:22,671
-Tinya?
-Yes.

913
00:34:22,738 --> 00:34:23,704
Tinya or Tanya?

914
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,204
-It's Tinya.
-Okay.

915
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,071
-Talk about Tinya.
-If they call her Tanya, it won't count.

916
00:34:28,138 --> 00:34:29,971
ONCE AGAIN, IT'S TANYA

917
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:31,438
BUT THEY HAVE TO SAY TINYA

918
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,771
Here's a shout-out for Su-geun.
He'll fart.

919
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:36,771
Is that a shout-out?

920
00:34:37,271 --> 00:34:38,671
3 MINUTES ARE UP

921
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:40,738
I need you to confirm this.

922
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:43,405
-It's not coffee. It's cafe.
-Cafe.

923
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:48,371
"Where are we going? What are we eating?
Whoa. Talk about giraffes. Su-geun."

924
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:50,671
Tease you for losing your phone.

925
00:34:50,738 --> 00:34:53,738
"Tinya. The weather is nice."

926
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:57,005
"Su-geun's phone suddenly goes off."
I don't know about that.

927
00:34:57,071 --> 00:35:00,005
"I'm hungry. Ji-won. Kyuhyun.
What did you have for breakfast?"

928
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:02,838
"Hippos." They'll talk about hippos.

929
00:35:02,905 --> 00:35:06,805
"He'll fart."
How many decibels will that be?

930
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,205
Even with all of his clothes on,
you can still feel the gas next to him.

931
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:12,171
-You can hear it clearly.
-All right.

932
00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:14,871
-Here's one last new rule.
-Okay.

933
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:17,605
-You know they're sharp as knives.
-If I get caught?

934
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:19,971
-If they suspect you three times…
-Three times?

935
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:24,405
…the mission ends there,
and we'll come back to the hotel.

936
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:27,138
3 SUSPICIONS AND IT'S OVER

937
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,705
EX) HE'S UP TO SOMETHING, ETC.

938
00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:31,071
Do you think I can memorize this?

939
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:32,538
You can take a picture.

940
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:35,271
Take a picture…

941
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:36,438
TEASE ME FOR LOSING MY PHONE

942
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:37,638
I'm so sorry!

943
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:40,705
WE'LL GIVE YOU THIS PHONE

944
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:45,205
Chostradamus, the members' breakfast
depends on your abilities.

945
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:47,105
-We're leaving in ten minutes.
-Good luck.

946
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:49,138
I'm sure they're getting suspicious.
You should go.

947
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:50,205
SCURRIES AWAY

948
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:53,005
I can't say I went for a smoke.
What should I say?

949
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:55,538
THE STRUGGLES OF A NON-SMOKER

950
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:59,938
HE HEADS BACK
WITH THE HEAVY BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY

951
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:04,105
-The weather is so nice.
-It is.

952
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,471
-It was also nice yesterday.
-Do you want some tea?

953
00:36:07,538 --> 00:36:09,638
-Tea?
-There's some over there.

954
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:13,505
Just have some. I boiled some water.

955
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,105
Did you have coffee?

956
00:36:15,171 --> 00:36:17,105
-I had coffee.
-The coffee smells good.

957
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:21,238
The cup is on top of the fridge.
Rinse it out first.

958
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:24,738
-I'm sure they'll give us good food.
-I'm sure they will.

959
00:36:25,238 --> 00:36:26,605
When did they ever?

960
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:28,071
-What?
-They don't do that.

961
00:36:28,138 --> 00:36:29,871
They didn't yesterday,
so they should today.

962
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:30,838
Why would they?

963
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:33,738
It's only going to get tougher from here,
so don't get your hopes up.

964
00:36:33,805 --> 00:36:35,371
You're too skeptical.

965
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:36,605
It's like losing your phone.

966
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:39,271
You hoped they'd give it back,
but they didn't.

967
00:36:39,771 --> 00:36:42,705
TEASE ME FOR LOSING MY PHONE

968
00:36:42,771 --> 00:36:45,038
PRACTICALLY A PSYCHIC

969
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:46,838
AND IT DIDN'T STOP THERE

970
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:51,438
Su-geun.

971
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:54,005
No, that wasn't a fart. I was beatboxing.

972
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:55,238
HE'LL FART

973
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:56,371
SO TALKATIVE

974
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:58,105
Kyuhyun.

975
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:00,838
-Yes?
-Kyuhyun.

976
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:03,938
HE SAYS KYUHYUN'S NAME,
BUT IT DOESN'T COUNT AS A POINT YET

977
00:37:05,138 --> 00:37:06,338
FRUSTRATED

978
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:08,971
They're doing everything now,
like calling my name.

979
00:37:09,538 --> 00:37:10,938
He even farted just now.

980
00:37:12,238 --> 00:37:13,638
They've already done it all.

981
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:14,838
THEY'RE NOT HELPING

982
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:17,138
Will Su-geun be able to fart again?

983
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:19,205
WORRIES ABOUT SU-GEUN'S ABILITIES

984
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,705
They even had coffee.

985
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:29,638
DOES IT START WHEN WE PASS THE GATE?
THEY'RE ALREADY DOING EVERYTHING

986
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,805
YES, AFTER YOU PASS THE GATE

987
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:32,038
TRAGEDY UNFOLDED IN 5 MINUTES

988
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:33,838
SO THEY SET OFF RIGHT AWAY

989
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:37,371
-I smacked the boom gate yesterday.
-Okay.

990
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:39,671
-It's solid.
-What is?

991
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:42,205
-The boom gate is completely solid.
-It's rock solid.

992
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:44,071
Why did you even check?

993
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:46,605
-Didn't you say it was hollow?
-Who did?

994
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:49,905
Let's film a video here later, Kyuhyun.

995
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:51,138
-By the boom gate?
-Yes.

996
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:53,271
-Why?
-For Han Moon-chul's Dashcam Review.

997
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,705
IT'S SWEET WHEN HE SAYS "KYUHYUN"

998
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:58,671
-You'll use this on the show?
-This is a boom gate in Kenya.

999
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:01,438
I think it's for the tanks
that sometimes come by.

1000
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:03,271
THEY EXIT

1001
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:04,938
Okay. Nice.

1002
00:38:05,305 --> 00:38:06,305
THE MISSION BEGINS

1003
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:07,571
Hello.

1004
00:38:07,638 --> 00:38:10,138
-Shouldn't we eat there today?
-Did you sleep well?

1005
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,738
Let's go to Ti…

1006
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:13,805
We'll stop by on our way back
if we don't get to eat.

1007
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:15,705
-What was her name?
-Tinya.

1008
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,238
-Tinya.
-That's right.

1009
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:18,671
PULLS IT OFF EFFORTLESSLY

1010
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,371
Where are you off to, Tinya?

1011
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:23,138
-Are you running away from me?
-I'll skip Tinya's food today.

1012
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:25,371
-Okay, we shouldn't eat it too often.
-Really?

1013
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:27,738
1 SQUARE DOWN

1014
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:29,938
THEY HEAD FOR THE RESTAURANT

1015
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:31,738
Let's go have breakfast.

1016
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:33,505
Where are we going?

1017
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:35,271
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

1018
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:37,371
NICE

1019
00:38:37,638 --> 00:38:39,138
HIS FINGERS MOVE SWIFTLY

1020
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:41,171
BUT HIS FACE IS STIFF

1021
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:43,571
CURRENT SCORE: 2 SQUARES

1022
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:46,005
TANYA'S PLACE IS OPENING

1023
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:47,938
Oh, Tinya! Good morning!

1024
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:49,805
MENTIONS TINYA'S NAME TWICE

1025
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:51,771
-Good morning, Tinya!
-We have to say hi.

1026
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:53,238
-Is she there?
-Good morning!

1027
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:54,205
IT'S TANYA, NOT TINYA

1028
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:56,038
She's opening up.

1029
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:58,005
What was the restaurant called?
Bones Soup?

1030
00:38:58,071 --> 00:38:59,971
-Bonds Garden.
-Bonds Garden.

1031
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,971
-It's bones.
-A garden of bones.

1032
00:39:03,038 --> 00:39:06,938
-It could be something like galbitang.
-A garden of bones?

1033
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:09,538
Galbitang has to have short ribs.

1034
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:11,571
THEY DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO ASK
"WHAT ARE WE EATING?"

1035
00:39:11,638 --> 00:39:13,805
-Don't add anything weird.
-Like what?

1036
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:14,938
Like goat or…

1037
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:19,705
If it's goat soup,
you should just tell us.

1038
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:21,071
Galbitang is…

1039
00:39:21,138 --> 00:39:22,938
-If it's testicle soup…
-Right.

1040
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:24,671
Galbitang should have ribs in it.

1041
00:39:25,671 --> 00:39:29,005
BURDENED WITH BREAKFAST,
HE DOESN'T HEAR A THING

1042
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:32,205
-Kyuhyun, are you in a bad mood?
-No, I'm just…

1043
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:35,205
He was upset all morning
because his new phone doesn't work.

1044
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:37,438
-He can't make calls.
-He should be able to.

1045
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:40,938
He kept ranting about the phone plan
and that it was a cheap one.

1046
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:44,238
He also said he's going to leave the phone
at the restaurant.

1047
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:47,605
Get him a separate room.
He's gotten so mean these days.

1048
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:52,005
-Kyuhyun isn't like how he used to be.
-He's like the Joker now.

1049
00:39:52,071 --> 00:39:54,705
I have a favor to ask.

1050
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:56,738
Could you please feed us breakfast?

1051
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:57,671
FILES A COMPLAINT

1052
00:39:57,738 --> 00:40:00,071
We're going to the restaurant now.

1053
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:04,938
Don't lay all the food out
and turn it into some weird game.

1054
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:07,371
Just let us eat our breakfast in peace.

1055
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,905
THEY'RE ALREADY PLAYING BINGO

1056
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,271
You've been saying the same thing
for 20 years.

1057
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:15,571
I've been drilling it into their ears.

1058
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:18,671
-That drill is rusty.
-He's been saying it since 2 Days 1 Night.

1059
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:21,005
He's been asking for breakfast
for 20 years.

1060
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:23,338
Then he asks for lunch at noon.

1061
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:26,671
He'll then say he hasn't eaten all day
and then ask for dinner.

1062
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:28,138
I've heard it so many times.

1063
00:40:28,205 --> 00:40:29,871
PLEASE, LET'S HAVE SOME BREAKFAST

1064
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:31,338
Gosh, today…

1065
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:33,738
-What?
-The weather…

1066
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:34,671
What about today?

1067
00:40:34,738 --> 00:40:38,505
-Why is it so cloudy?
-You think you'll find your phone today?

1068
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:40,971
I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE
TO FIND SOME BREAKFAST

1069
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,038
Since we're near the airport,
let's drop by and find Kyuhyun's phone.

1070
00:40:44,605 --> 00:40:46,138
-Which animal is the strongest?
-What?

1071
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:47,238
Which one's the strongest?

1072
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:48,605
The top killer is a hippo.

1073
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:49,905
A hippo.

1074
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:51,438
The staff breakfast…

1075
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:55,071
What did you have for breakfast?

1076
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,205
Are we going to the giraffe hotel?

1077
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:01,738
There's another place we can see giraffes.

1078
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:03,371
They still have to do business.

1079
00:41:03,871 --> 00:41:06,071
CURRENT SCORE: 6 SQUARES

1080
00:41:06,138 --> 00:41:08,271
BUT STILL NO BINGO

1081
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:11,271
I think we'll arrive at around 9:10 a.m.

1082
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:12,671
In ten minutes?

1083
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:14,371
CURRENT TIME: 9 A.M.

1084
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,171
10 MINUTES LEFT

1085
00:41:16,238 --> 00:41:18,038
We had to get yellow fever shots,

1086
00:41:18,105 --> 00:41:21,038
but we wouldn't have needed them
if we'd stayed in the city.

1087
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,305
That lasts a lifetime.

1088
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:23,538
-After one shot?
-Yes.

1089
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:24,605
Even if it's been a while…

1090
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:27,005
EVEN WITH ALL THE TEASING,
HE'S GLUED TO THE BINGO BOARD

1091
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,905
-Can I go to Africa anytime?
-Yes, for life.

1092
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:30,038
You can come anytime.

1093
00:41:30,105 --> 00:41:31,438
Ma'am, can we come…

1094
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:34,705
We can ask our coordinator.
She's the expert.

1095
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:35,805
Ma'am.

1096
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:39,138
Can we visit Africa anytime
after that one shot?

1097
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,738
-Yes, you can go anywhere.
-Oh, really?

1098
00:41:41,805 --> 00:41:43,271
Whoa, where should we go?

1099
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:44,971
WHOA

1100
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:46,938
Whoa, where should we go?

1101
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,405
STARTLED

1102
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:50,438
AN UNEXPECTED WIN

1103
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:52,538
Where should we go next?

1104
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:54,405
Let's do an African special.

1105
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,538
WHOA

1106
00:41:57,271 --> 00:42:00,871
-But we don't have a reason to come.
-Take a cruise to South Africa.

1107
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,271
-That sounds great.
-Is there one?

1108
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:04,671
-There's a cruise to South Africa?
-Look it up.

1109
00:42:04,738 --> 00:42:05,805
Really?

1110
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:07,571
She says it goes by there. Let's go.

1111
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:09,005
ONCE AGAIN, HIS LIFE IS IN HIS HANDS

1112
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:10,871
The title would sound cool.

1113
00:42:10,938 --> 00:42:13,438
-Three Idiots on a Cruise.
-Exactly.

1114
00:42:15,105 --> 00:42:16,671
By the way, isn't the weather nice?

1115
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:18,771
-He's in a different world.
-He is.

1116
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:20,205
It's just really nice.

1117
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,205
He lost his motivation.

1118
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:24,605
Come on, he's family.

1119
00:42:24,671 --> 00:42:25,838
Isn't the weather nice?

1120
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:27,305
It was the same yesterday.

1121
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:29,471
Isn't it better than yesterday?

1122
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:32,638
-No, it's all cloudy up there.
-Look behind us.

1123
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:35,838
-The sunlight is so nice.
-Who travels while looking back?

1124
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:37,005
You could take a look.

1125
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:38,838
I can't see anything. It's blocked.

1126
00:42:38,905 --> 00:42:40,738
Look at all these clouds up ahead.

1127
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:42,438
GLOOMY SKIES

1128
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:44,371
I don't get seasick.

1129
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:45,771
AND GLOOMY HEARTS

1130
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:47,138
I don't get seasick.

1131
00:42:48,405 --> 00:42:51,238
-Coffee!
-What?

1132
00:42:51,305 --> 00:42:52,671
-Where?
-Coffee!

1133
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:53,905
Cafe!

1134
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,771
CAFE!

1135
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,238
Give me some cafe!

1136
00:42:59,005 --> 00:43:01,105
COFFEE FRENZY STRIKES

1137
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:02,938
Cafe!

1138
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:05,638
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE

1139
00:43:05,705 --> 00:43:07,971
THANKS TO THE OUTBURSTS FOR COFFEE

1140
00:43:08,038 --> 00:43:10,271
HE SECURES 8 SQUARES

1141
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,571
Every time we traveled,
Kyuhyun would get a nickname.

1142
00:43:15,205 --> 00:43:16,671
You know, like Pierrot Cho.

1143
00:43:16,738 --> 00:43:18,771
Bird that cries on New Year's Day,
Cho Magpie.

1144
00:43:19,771 --> 00:43:22,638
-The surname Cho is so easy to tease.
-Cho is the best.

1145
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:24,571
I NEED YOU TO CALL ME KYUHYUN TODAY

1146
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:25,805
You know what?

1147
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:30,805
We gave him so many nicknames
that he just gave up.

1148
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:33,571
-Didn't he give himself nicknames?
-He made them up himself.

1149
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:36,671
HE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW PRECIOUS HIS NAME WAS BACK THEN

1150
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:39,638
I asked Kyuhyun if he wanted to open up
a tonkatsu place with me.

1151
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:41,771
KYUHYUN

1152
00:43:42,505 --> 00:43:45,038
WHEN JI-WON CALLED HIS NAME

1153
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:46,771
He said, "I'll make one called Cho Katsu."

1154
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:48,438
HE CAME TO JI-WON AND BECAME BREAKFAST

1155
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:50,838
ADDS BINGO CHO TO THE LIST OF NICKNAMES

1156
00:43:50,905 --> 00:43:51,871
Cho Katsu is funny.

1157
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:54,171
He said, "I'll make one called Cho Katsu."

1158
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:57,738
I'm so hungry.

1159
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:00,871
I don't think we ate much yesterday.

1160
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,938
Seriously? I'm still digesting the food.

1161
00:44:03,438 --> 00:44:04,438
Are you serious?

1162
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:06,438
1ST MEAL: IN-FLIGHT MEAL ON KOREAN AIR

1163
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:08,571
2ND MEAL: DINNER ON KENYA AIRWAYS

1164
00:44:08,638 --> 00:44:10,938
3RD MEAL: BREAKFAST ON KENYA AIRWAYS

1165
00:44:11,005 --> 00:44:12,705
4TH MEAL: NYAMA CHOMA FOR LUNCH

1166
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:14,538
5TH MEAL: A TRADITIONAL KENYAN DINNER

1167
00:44:14,605 --> 00:44:16,071
THEY DID EAT A LOT

1168
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:18,138
What did you eat yesterday?

1169
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:21,771
I still haven't fully digested the meals
I had on the plane.

1170
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:23,038
CHUCKLES

1171
00:44:23,105 --> 00:44:24,271
Aren't you hungry?

1172
00:44:24,338 --> 00:44:26,338
-No.
-You must have regular bowel movements.

1173
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:27,638
2 SQUARES GOT BLOCKED

1174
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:29,738
I'M FULL, CLOUDY WEATHER

1175
00:44:30,305 --> 00:44:31,871
We're five minutes away.

1176
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:35,271
AT THIS RATE, THEY'LL STARVE TOGETHER

1177
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,538
Are we having beef galbijjim today?

1178
00:44:37,605 --> 00:44:39,438
We're having gukbap, not galbijjim.

1179
00:44:39,505 --> 00:44:41,138
Is that all we're having?

1180
00:44:41,205 --> 00:44:43,971
-You'll eat it with rice.
-Rice and beef soup.

1181
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:47,005
-Since it's quite hot here…
-Will you give us that baekseolgi?

1182
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:50,271
PLEASE BE QUIET

1183
00:44:50,505 --> 00:44:52,138
PLEASE STOP TALKING

1184
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:54,238
HE'S ALL ALONE IN THIS LONELY BINGO FIGHT

1185
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:56,405
-We're one minute away.
-Okay.

1186
00:44:56,471 --> 00:44:59,038
What do you want us to do? Do a countdown?

1187
00:44:59,105 --> 00:45:00,405
What? No.

1188
00:45:00,471 --> 00:45:03,505
Fifty-eight, fifty-seven, fifty-six.

1189
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:06,238
HE COUNTS DOWN,
OBLIVIOUS TO KYUHYUN'S FEELINGS

1190
00:45:12,705 --> 00:45:13,671
I got much slimmer.

1191
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:14,605
APPLIES PHYSICAL FORCE

1192
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,038
You have to massage your belly
so you can fart like before.

1193
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:20,138
-Massages are good for digestion.
-I get massages too.

1194
00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:23,438
-I keep passing gas as I get it.
-Really?

1195
00:45:23,505 --> 00:45:27,338
They don't ask if I want a belly massage
because I fart before I get one.

1196
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:30,471
Whoa, it's a huge garden.

1197
00:45:30,538 --> 00:45:33,005
-What is that?
-It's a wire fence.

1198
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:36,038
Whoa, look at the restaurant.
I want to stay here longer.

1199
00:45:36,105 --> 00:45:37,805
They even serve welcome tea.

1200
00:45:38,471 --> 00:45:40,871
No, that's not welcome tea.
It's hand sanitizer.

1201
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,071
-Welcome tea?
-It says welcome. Karibu.

1202
00:45:43,138 --> 00:45:44,338
Welcome.

1203
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:45,805
That's not hand sanitizer.

1204
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,005
HE STILL HAS 0 BINGOS

1205
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:50,538
-Aren't you hungry?
-No, I'm not that hungry.

1206
00:45:51,905 --> 00:45:55,605
You shouldn't have told them
what the menu was.

1207
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:58,005
They would've asked what we're eating.

1208
00:45:58,071 --> 00:46:01,105
-You already told him, so--
-He asked what we were having.

1209
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:02,738
He's also not hungry.

1210
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:04,371
He asked where we were going.

1211
00:46:04,438 --> 00:46:06,438
-He didn't ask what--
-Just get off.

1212
00:46:06,505 --> 00:46:07,338
Really?

1213
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:09,171
He's not hungry,
and he doesn't like the weather.

1214
00:46:09,238 --> 00:46:10,571
Thank you. Goodness.

1215
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:14,138
SU-GEUN AND JI-WON GET OFF

1216
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:19,671
It's hand sanitizer, not welcome tea.
I told you it was hand sanitizer.

1217
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:23,105
The belly rub that Kyuhyun gave me…

1218
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:26,705
-Damn it!
-What's wrong?

1219
00:46:27,438 --> 00:46:29,738
WITH THE ADDITION OF THE BODILY FUNCTION

1220
00:46:29,805 --> 00:46:32,205
1 GAS BOMB, 1 BINGO
SU-GEUN GETS TO EAT

1221
00:46:33,438 --> 00:46:34,671
-He farted.
-What?

1222
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:35,738
He farted.

1223
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:36,871
-He did?
-Yes.

1224
00:46:37,605 --> 00:46:39,838
HE FINALLY GETS HIS SMILE BACK

1225
00:46:39,905 --> 00:46:42,471
-Su-geun, did you fart?
-Yes, because of your massage.

1226
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:43,838
Massages are helpful.

1227
00:46:43,905 --> 00:46:46,105
CURRENT SITUATION

1228
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,505
THEY ALL GET TO EAT
IF THEY GET 2 MORE SQUARES

1229
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:51,738
CHECKS THE BINGO BOARD

1230
00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:53,705
-Until we sit down?
-Yes.

1231
00:46:53,771 --> 00:46:54,838
SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION

1232
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:56,638
THE TABLE IS 20 METERS AWAY

1233
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,305
IT'S JUST ACROSS THE YARD

1234
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:01,271
HERE

1235
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:04,038
THEIR TABLE IS WAY IN THE BACK

1236
00:47:04,105 --> 00:47:06,071
I love this season. There are no bugs.

1237
00:47:06,138 --> 00:47:07,271
THEY HEAD TO THE TABLE

1238
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:09,405
HE LOOKS DOWNCAST

1239
00:47:11,271 --> 00:47:13,005
-Whoa.
-Let's go all the way to the back.

1240
00:47:13,071 --> 00:47:14,805
-The farthest table?
-Are we eating outside?

1241
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:17,238
-Yes, we are.
-This is nice.

1242
00:47:17,305 --> 00:47:20,005
The palm trees make it feel like
we're in the jungle.

1243
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:21,505
This place is so nice.

1244
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:25,838
A RESTAURANT SURROUNDED BY
THE BEAUTY OF NATURE

1245
00:47:25,905 --> 00:47:27,805
Why did the palm tree grow like that?

1246
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:28,971
CAN'T ENJOY IT AT ALL

1247
00:47:29,038 --> 00:47:30,971
I should take a selfie here.

1248
00:47:31,471 --> 00:47:33,171
I think the weather is nice.

1249
00:47:33,238 --> 00:47:34,938
THE WEATHER IS SO NICE

1250
00:47:35,005 --> 00:47:36,705
I think the weather is nice.

1251
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:38,905
I'll take one for you.

1252
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:40,305
HE DOUBTS HIS EARS

1253
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:42,138
-I'll take it for you.
-My face is puffy.

1254
00:47:42,771 --> 00:47:45,405
THANKS TO SU-GEUN'S ADMIRATION
FOR THE WEATHER

1255
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:48,471
2 BINGOS, JI-WON GETS TO EAT

1256
00:47:49,205 --> 00:47:50,871
There are some bugs here.

1257
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,538
It's a good table to play games on.

1258
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,505
There are a few bugs.

1259
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,105
-Ji-won.
-Yes?

1260
00:47:56,938 --> 00:47:57,938
What is it?

1261
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:00,171
THE GAME IS OVER IF HE SITS DOWN

1262
00:48:00,771 --> 00:48:03,171
DRAGS THE GAME ALONG
SINCE HE MIGHT NOT GET ANY FOOD

1263
00:48:03,238 --> 00:48:04,338
What?

1264
00:48:04,405 --> 00:48:06,238
-What?
-What?

1265
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:07,971
What?

1266
00:48:08,038 --> 00:48:09,505
EVERYONE'S CONFUSED

1267
00:48:09,571 --> 00:48:10,571
What is it?

1268
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:13,505
-Nothing. Let's sit.
-Are you up to something?

1269
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:15,671
1ST WARNING

1270
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,405
What is it?

1271
00:48:19,471 --> 00:48:20,438
2ND WARNING

1272
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:24,071
He's so mysterious sometimes.

1273
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:25,338
What do you mean?

1274
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:27,405
I just don't get him sometimes.

1275
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,438
SU-GEUN AND JI-WON GET TO EAT

1276
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:33,871
HERE COMES THEIR BREAKFAST

1277
00:48:33,938 --> 00:48:35,238
It looks exactly the same.

1278
00:48:35,305 --> 00:48:36,705
OXTAIL BONE BROTH AND CHUNKS OF MEAT

1279
00:48:36,771 --> 00:48:37,871
Look at the ribs.

1280
00:48:38,938 --> 00:48:39,971
A SAVORY BONE SOUP

1281
00:48:40,038 --> 00:48:42,571
It would be awesome with black pepper.

1282
00:48:43,638 --> 00:48:47,205
-Look at those amazing ribs.
-It smells so familiar.

1283
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:49,605
-It's like they added a whole cow.
-It's just like galbitang.

1284
00:48:50,105 --> 00:48:51,805
-Why are there only two?
-There are only two.

1285
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:53,105
I'm sure it's on the way.

1286
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:55,071
Look at the beef.

1287
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:57,505
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT KYUHYUN'S SACRIFICE

1288
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:59,038
Why are there only two?

1289
00:48:59,105 --> 00:49:00,405
-What?
-Why only two?

1290
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,538
You only ordered two.

1291
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:03,605
What does that mean?

1292
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:06,071
-I don't understand.
-Me neither.

1293
00:49:06,138 --> 00:49:09,771
You may not understand, but Kyuhyun does.

1294
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:12,038
-What's going on?
-What's he saying?

1295
00:49:12,105 --> 00:49:15,638
We carried out
a secret mission this morning.

1296
00:49:15,705 --> 00:49:16,871
What utter nonsense.

1297
00:49:16,938 --> 00:49:19,271
The code name was Chostradamus.

1298
00:49:20,038 --> 00:49:22,005
-Predictions?
-Chostradamus?

1299
00:49:22,071 --> 00:49:25,205
Kyuhyun had to predict
what you guys would say or do

1300
00:49:25,271 --> 00:49:27,738
-and fill out a four-by-four bingo board.
-Okay.

1301
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:32,471
Your words and actions on the bus
filled up the bingo board.

1302
00:49:32,538 --> 00:49:33,805
Really?

1303
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:36,371
If you hit three bingos, everyone eats.

1304
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:39,638
Two bingos, and the two older members eat.

1305
00:49:39,705 --> 00:49:41,771
One bingo, and only Su-geun eats.

1306
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:43,505
Only the two older members?

1307
00:49:44,505 --> 00:49:46,505
Did you say the two older members?

1308
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:48,671
-If we got two?
-I guess we got two bingos.

1309
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:54,405
Yes, out of 16 empty squares,
you had two bingos.

1310
00:49:56,238 --> 00:49:59,138
Whoa! Thanks, Kyuhyun!

1311
00:50:00,605 --> 00:50:03,405
-You two can enjoy your meal.
-Thank you!

1312
00:50:03,471 --> 00:50:06,371
-Whoa, this is…
-I'll take a bite of the meat.

1313
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:08,405
RUBBING SALT IN HIS WOUNDS

1314
00:50:10,305 --> 00:50:12,571
We've been doing this for so long

1315
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:14,938
that we don't feel bad
for those who can't eat.

1316
00:50:15,238 --> 00:50:16,905
FOR EXAMPLE, SOMEONE LIKE HIM

1317
00:50:16,971 --> 00:50:18,305
You kept saying you were hungry.

1318
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:20,371
What were we supposed to say?

1319
00:50:20,438 --> 00:50:21,671
I'm hungry.

1320
00:50:21,738 --> 00:50:22,771
Didn't we say that?

1321
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:24,271
He said he was hungry,

1322
00:50:24,338 --> 00:50:27,371
but you said you were still digesting
the in-flight meal.

1323
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:28,838
I think I was hungry.

1324
00:50:28,905 --> 00:50:30,371
You were!

1325
00:50:30,438 --> 00:50:32,071
Whatever I say, you say the opposite.

1326
00:50:32,138 --> 00:50:34,205
The weather is nice.
"No, the weather is bad."

1327
00:50:34,771 --> 00:50:35,838
-I'm hungry.
-Ji-won…

1328
00:50:35,905 --> 00:50:38,471
Kyuhyun was asking
a lot of questions today.

1329
00:50:38,538 --> 00:50:40,905
You should've said the opposite, Kyuhyun.

1330
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,605
Look at this.

1331
00:50:42,671 --> 00:50:44,438
Doesn't this look like sand?

1332
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:47,271
I personally like long-grain rice.

1333
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:48,738
PERFECT COMBINATION OF RICE AND BROTH

1334
00:50:48,805 --> 00:50:50,871
You can pretend that we're back in Korea.

1335
00:50:51,438 --> 00:50:53,705
Kyuhyun, I was hungry.

1336
00:50:53,771 --> 00:50:55,671
This is the bingo board.

1337
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:57,471
I should've said I was hungry.

1338
00:50:57,538 --> 00:51:00,238
If you had just said you were hungry…

1339
00:51:00,305 --> 00:51:02,938
-No, he had to say Su-geun's name.
-If you had called Su-geun…

1340
00:51:03,505 --> 00:51:06,405
-"What are we eating?" That was--
-We said that.

1341
00:51:06,471 --> 00:51:08,271
No, you asked where we were going.

1342
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:10,938
But then he told us everything
we were going to eat.

1343
00:51:11,005 --> 00:51:14,138
-Why didn't you say Ji-won's name?
-You don't call each other by your names.

1344
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:16,605
We've known each other for so long,
we don't even use names.

1345
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:17,838
What do you call him?

1346
00:51:17,905 --> 00:51:20,971
I'm really sorry,
but this is better than all of us eating.

1347
00:51:23,438 --> 00:51:26,271
-Don't you agree?
-Look this over and reflect on it.

1348
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:28,871
-Ji-won, eat your fill.
-Okay.

1349
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:32,005
-Su-geun, eat up.
-Yes.

1350
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:33,605
Weren't you starving today?

1351
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:35,238
-I was.
-I'm still hungry.

1352
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:38,105
Bingo! You just completed another line.

1353
00:51:38,171 --> 00:51:41,738
-What else are we having after this?
-You just completed the bingo.

1354
00:51:41,805 --> 00:51:44,571
BINGO COMPLETE

1355
00:51:44,638 --> 00:51:47,538
-What is this?
-They brought one for Kyuhyun.

1356
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:50,405
-You came all this way, so have some.
-You should try it.

1357
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:53,438
-He has to try it.
-Actually, Kyuhyun is an epicure.

1358
00:51:53,505 --> 00:51:55,105
Seriously, let me have some.

1359
00:51:55,171 --> 00:51:58,471
-This mini-game is for Kyuhyun.
-Okay.

1360
00:51:58,538 --> 00:52:01,005
-You have to speak in one voice.
-What does that mean?

1361
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:04,105
-The three of you must say the same word.
-Say the same thing.

1362
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:05,605
Whatever it is.

1363
00:52:05,671 --> 00:52:07,371
-We have to say the same thing?
-At once?

1364
00:52:07,438 --> 00:52:08,871
-At once.
-Yes.

1365
00:52:08,938 --> 00:52:11,471
THE SAMPLE BOWL ROUND

1366
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:14,205
Hey, ask us anything.

1367
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:16,538
-Continue the Phrase.
-Let's get it right this time.

1368
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:18,171
-Just be confident.
-Okay.

1369
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:19,671
Don't tell us off.

1370
00:52:19,738 --> 00:52:20,971
Here we go.

1371
00:52:22,771 --> 00:52:23,638
Häagen?

1372
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:24,705
-Giraffe!
-Giraffe!

1373
00:52:25,705 --> 00:52:26,971
-Häagen giraffe?
-Yes.

1374
00:52:27,038 --> 00:52:28,138
That's a thing.

1375
00:52:28,205 --> 00:52:29,671
3 MINUTES AGO

1376
00:52:30,238 --> 00:52:32,805
-Hey, let's decide.
-What?

1377
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:34,971
-We can decide it in advance.
-Decide what?

1378
00:52:35,538 --> 00:52:38,305
We just have to say the same word, right?

1379
00:52:38,371 --> 00:52:39,938
-Giraffe.
-Keep it simple.

1380
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:42,138
TAPPING

1381
00:52:42,205 --> 00:52:43,438
Giraffe.

1382
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:44,505
EYEING THE STAFF

1383
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:46,871
Just say giraffe, okay?

1384
00:52:46,938 --> 00:52:47,905
A SECRET PLAN

1385
00:52:47,971 --> 00:52:50,771
-Hey, eat up.
-They planned it.

1386
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:51,838
-You idiots.
-Eat.

1387
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:53,071
We use our noggins too.

1388
00:52:53,138 --> 00:52:54,771
CLEVER STRATEGY

1389
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,638
-I had no idea. When did you plan that?
-When?

1390
00:52:57,705 --> 00:53:01,438
Ji-won and I had planned it first.

1391
00:53:02,105 --> 00:53:04,405
But when we told Kyuhyun,
we almost got caught.

1392
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:07,271
-How is it? Is it good?
-Do you like it?

1393
00:53:07,338 --> 00:53:11,138
I don't care
if this is oxtail or elephant tail.

1394
00:53:11,205 --> 00:53:13,138
It's so good! It melts in my mouth.

1395
00:53:13,205 --> 00:53:16,938
The cartilage is so good. It's so chewy.

1396
00:53:17,905 --> 00:53:19,838
You caught me off guard.

1397
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,271
-They're not easy opponents.
-I know.

1398
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:25,871
-You planned that in that short time?
-We did.

1399
00:53:25,938 --> 00:53:27,671
You guys are something else.

1400
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:30,005
We had a great meal thanks to Kyuhyun.

1401
00:53:30,505 --> 00:53:33,205
-Thanks, Kyuhyun!
-Thanks, Kyuhyun.

1402
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:36,038
You gave the youngest member
such a hard task.

1403
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,538
-We had a great meal.
-I almost had it.

1404
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:39,938
My heart was racing.

1405
00:53:40,005 --> 00:53:41,738
If you had called each other by name…

1406
00:53:41,805 --> 00:53:45,271
We've aged,
but we still can't read the room.

1407
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:49,105
Our title is Three Idiots in Kenya,
but we're also making you eat three meals.

1408
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:53,871
We should experience the culture
and see how the people live.

1409
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:55,071
I'm curious.

1410
00:53:55,138 --> 00:53:57,938
The place we're heading to
is near our hotel.

1411
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:59,605
It's called Westlands.

1412
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:02,138
We're going to a shopping mall there.

1413
00:54:02,571 --> 00:54:04,971
THE DONGDAEMUN OF KENYA, WESTLANDS MARKET

1414
00:54:05,705 --> 00:54:09,471
FULL OF ALL KINDS OF CLOTHES
AND ACCESSORIES

1415
00:54:10,138 --> 00:54:13,538
THERE'S SO MUCH TO SEE
AT THIS LOCAL MARKET

1416
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:17,338
THERE ARE 4 WHOLE FLOORS

1417
00:54:17,405 --> 00:54:20,438
It's the equivalent
of Dongdaemun in Korea.

1418
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:22,338
It's where they sell local fashion.

1419
00:54:22,405 --> 00:54:25,505
You will get fully dressed
in Kenyan style.

1420
00:54:25,571 --> 00:54:26,738
It's a competition.

1421
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:30,071
AFTER RECEIVING 10,000 SHILLINGS EACH

1422
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:32,505
THEY'LL GO SHOPPING FOR 30 MINUTES

1423
00:54:32,571 --> 00:54:34,971
THEN THEY'LL HAVE A FASHION SHOWDOWN
WITH THEIR PURCHASES

1424
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:39,138
The first and second places
have already been immersed in the culture,

1425
00:54:39,205 --> 00:54:41,605
so they will get a free afternoon.

1426
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:44,605
You can have coffee and hang out with us.

1427
00:54:44,671 --> 00:54:46,538
-The person who comes in last
-Yes?

1428
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:49,305
hasn't been fully immersed
in Kenyan culture.

1429
00:54:49,371 --> 00:54:52,805
So he'll get a chance to receive
a Kenyan skin and hair treatment.

1430
00:54:52,871 --> 00:54:55,138
They'll change you into a total Kenyan.

1431
00:54:55,805 --> 00:54:57,538
Will 30 minutes be enough?

1432
00:54:58,705 --> 00:54:59,871
-Yes.
-Thirty minutes.

1433
00:54:59,938 --> 00:55:01,205
Let's do this in 30 minutes.

1434
00:55:01,671 --> 00:55:03,271
TIME LIMIT IS 30 MINUTES

1435
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:06,205
SHOPPING BEGINS

1436
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:07,838
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1437
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,105
Careful, you might bump into someone.

1438
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:12,671
-There are four floors.
-Should we go straight up?

1439
00:55:12,738 --> 00:55:15,371
Let's go to the top and make our way down.

1440
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:21,405
I'm going for a bold look
with a clear concept.

1441
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:26,938
Should I go to the kids' section?
Kids' clothes sound good.

1442
00:55:27,405 --> 00:55:32,071
-This is super stylish once you put it on.
-Throw it on?

1443
00:55:32,138 --> 00:55:33,738
A FORMER IDOL WITH FASHION SENSE

1444
00:55:33,805 --> 00:55:36,171
Swimsuits sound good.
Should I go with swimwear?

1445
00:55:36,738 --> 00:55:37,905
ONLY CONCERN IS TO BE FUNNY

1446
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:39,471
As long as it's funny, right?

1447
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:41,405
LET'S CHECK OUT THE FASHION SENSE

1448
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,071
OF THESE THREE VERY DIFFERENT IDIOTS

1449
00:55:43,138 --> 00:55:44,338
This is too expensive.

1450
00:55:44,405 --> 00:55:45,771
1. THE THRIFTY TYPE

1451
00:55:55,671 --> 00:55:57,138
THE DISCOUNT CHASER

1452
00:55:59,038 --> 00:56:00,738
HIS GO-TO PHRASE: TOO EXPENSIVE!

1453
00:56:06,038 --> 00:56:08,138
CREATES A NEW FRIENDSHIP OUT OF NOWHERE

1454
00:56:08,671 --> 00:56:11,438
THE MOST OUTGOING GUY IN KENYA TODAY

1455
00:56:13,738 --> 00:56:15,071
I SEE

1456
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,405
2. THE EASILY PERSUADED TYPE

1457
00:56:17,471 --> 00:56:19,505
-Maasai.
-Shirts?

1458
00:56:19,571 --> 00:56:21,338
-Maasai…
-Shuka?

1459
00:56:22,638 --> 00:56:23,738
She'll show me something.

1460
00:56:23,805 --> 00:56:24,771
THE TYPE WHO JUST GOES IN

1461
00:56:30,105 --> 00:56:32,205
LISTENING CAREFULLY AS IF HE'S MESMERIZED

1462
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:35,438
FASCINATED

1463
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:37,038
YOU'RE RIGHT

1464
00:56:37,438 --> 00:56:39,271
WE HAVE THIS TOO

1465
00:56:41,538 --> 00:56:42,938
I SEE

1466
00:56:43,271 --> 00:56:44,738
I'LL TAKE EVERYTHING

1467
00:56:45,271 --> 00:56:46,238
A NEW PRODUCT APPEARS

1468
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,171
Maasai rungu.

1469
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,638
-Lungo?
-Yes, Maasai…

1470
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:51,138
You use this to hit?

1471
00:56:51,205 --> 00:56:52,405
-No.
-No hit?

1472
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:53,671
NOT A WEAPON

1473
00:56:54,105 --> 00:56:55,771
EXCITED

1474
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:59,071
KYUHYUN COULDN'T LEAVE THIS SHOP
FOR 30 MINUTES

1475
00:57:00,205 --> 00:57:01,071
HE BOUGHT EVERYTHING

1476
00:57:01,138 --> 00:57:02,871
And shuka.

1477
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:03,871
AND THE FINAL TYPE

1478
00:57:04,438 --> 00:57:05,671
What about a swimsuit?

1479
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:07,838
3. JUST SU-GEUN

1480
00:57:11,738 --> 00:57:13,805
YEARNING TO LOOK YOUNGER

1481
00:57:13,971 --> 00:57:15,105
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

1482
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:16,105
This is for girls.

1483
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:20,371
HE'S DRIPPING WITH TESTOSTERONE

1484
00:57:23,738 --> 00:57:26,238
HE ENDS UP AS A MAASAI BOY,
THE EPITOME OF A KENYAN YOUNG MAN

1485
00:57:26,871 --> 00:57:29,505
FITS IN PERFECTLY

1486
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:34,005
AFTER SHOWING OFF
THEIR DIFFERENT SHOPPING STYLES

1487
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:36,538
TIME IS UP

1488
00:57:36,605 --> 00:57:39,905
Seriously, Su-geun?
You said you wouldn't do that.

1489
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:42,538
Look who's talking! You bought it too.

1490
00:57:42,605 --> 00:57:44,471
Gosh, what is this?

1491
00:57:44,538 --> 00:57:45,438
BONUS CLIP

1492
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:47,605
There's one that I made at camp.

1493
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:49,371
It was called Animal Kingdom Camp.

1494
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:52,605
The blue sky and clear sounds of water

1495
00:57:52,671 --> 00:57:55,705
The cute mountain birds sing a song

1496
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:58,705
We are the animal family in the woods

1497
00:57:58,771 --> 00:58:01,871
We sing a song with our beautiful voices

1498
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:11,771
A country with dreams and fairy tales

1499
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:13,971
Animal Kingdom Camp, ta-da!

1500
00:58:14,038 --> 00:58:14,971
