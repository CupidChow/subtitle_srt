1
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:18,138
THEY WANTED TO GO SEE GIRAFFES

2
00:00:20,338 --> 00:00:22,138
Is that real?

3
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:23,205
-Wait, it's real.
-It is.

4
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:25,605
-Really?
-I thought it was a statue.

5
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:26,938
No way.

6
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:29,705
What's this? Look, this is so pretty.

7
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:30,971
HOWEVER, NO ONE KNEW

8
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:36,171
THAT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A TRAGEDY

9
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:43,405
IS WHERE THEY'RE HEADED

10
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:45,471
-Two, three. Tuko pamoja!
-Two, three. Tuko pamoja!

11
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:48,838
This is amazing. Look at that.

19
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:03,738
You did that on purpose.

20
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:05,938
It was on purpose. I felt it!

Lincoln, damn it.

26
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,838
Gosh, I should've answered.

27
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:15,471
-Respecting the elderly.
-Respecting.

28
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:17,005
AVERAGE AGE OF 44.6
A CAST OF COMPLAINERS

29
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:19,938
You're even worse than the Mafia.
A piece of trash citizen.

30
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:21,738
You're the Mafia, but a dumb one.

31
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:23,605
-What did I do?
-You…

32
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:26,205
If you're heading that way,
why bother coming for me?

33
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:27,805
Because you can't come with me, stupid!

34
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,338
Then, how will you go on your own?

35
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:30,838
-Just switch places!
-What are you saying?

36
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,471
How are you going alone right now?

37
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:35,238
A JOYFUL TRIP AWAITS

38
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:37,471
COMING SOON!

39
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:44,371
THREE IDIOTS IN KENYA

40
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,971
DAY OF DEPARTURE, INCHEON AIRPORT

41
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:49,605
THE OLDER IDIOTS CAME EARLY

42
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:50,738
Look at those shorts.

43
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,471
He wore camouflage to survive.

44
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:55,371
How did I end up wearing this pattern?

45
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:56,905
SAFARI-FRIENDLY LEOPARD SHORTS

46
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:59,138
-He'll die in these.
-Why?

47
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,105
HORRIFYING COMMENT

48
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:03,105
Because they'll assume
you're taking their food.

49
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:05,738
Lions kill any leopard they encounter,
even if they don't eat them.

50
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:07,205
-Lions kill leopards?
-Yes.

51
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:08,971
-This is leopard print.
-No, it's not.

52
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,705
-What else could it be?
-It's a cat.

53
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:13,038
There's no cat with fur like this.

54
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:15,805
Isn't it a sea cucumber?
That's what it is.

55
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:17,471
SUDDENLY BECOMES AN INVERTEBRATE

56
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,771
-Do you know all the animals?
-I've seen many.

57
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:22,005
-Well, the animal quiz…
-Are you an animal expert?

58
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,005
I know quite a lot,
including their behavior.

59
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:26,171
What's the difference
between a leopard and a cheetah?

60
00:02:26,238 --> 00:02:27,405
They're the same thing.

61
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:29,305
What are you saying?

62
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:32,038
-They're the same thing!
-Are they the same?

63
00:02:32,105 --> 00:02:36,671
A jaguar is called pyobeom in Korean,
and the cheetahs are in that family.

64
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,705
For example, among tigers,
there are white tigers

65
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,438
and Siberian huskies…

66
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:42,605
No, not Siberian huskies.

67
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:44,538
-Siberian tigers.
-You have Siberian tigers.

68
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:46,571
-They're all tigers.
-Baekdusan tigers.

69
00:02:46,638 --> 00:02:47,971
But they're called tigers.

70
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:49,605
-How much will you bet?
-Like money?

71
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,105
It's no fun without a bet.
How about skipping the in-flight meal?

72
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:56,138
We have to shoot that, so no.

73
00:02:57,705 --> 00:03:00,005
I starved so I could eat on the plane.

74
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,938
Ji-won got better at thinking on his feet.

75
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:04,205
We have to shoot that, so that won't do.

76
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:05,938
THE YOUNGEST IDIOT ARRIVES

77
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,871
It's good to see you. Goodness.

78
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,205
A BIT LATE
COMING BACK FROM A CONCERT ABROAD

79
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:12,738
-I'm not sure.
-Sorry, guys.

80
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:14,471
-You should bet.
-Hey, Kyuhyun.

81
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:16,005
-Seriously.
-You must be tired.

82
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,005
Make a bet.

83
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,005
-What?
-Have a seat.

84
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:18,938
-A bet.
-Place a bet.

85
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:19,871
-Why?
-A cheetah…

86
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,538
-I made a bet.
-Listen.

87
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:23,271
Are cheetahs and leopards the same?

88
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:24,371
-What's the difference?
-What?

89
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:28,371
How are cheetahs and leopards different?
Are they the same or not?

90
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:29,971
-They're different.
-Why?

91
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,871
-Aren't cheetahs and leopards
-What are they?

92
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,605
two different species?

93
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,538
Why? What's a leopard then?

94
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:37,471
-The leopard you know… Yes.
-What's a leopard?

95
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:38,471
AN EXASPERATED CHUCKLE

96
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:41,305
I don't know. Is it a tiger?

97
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:42,805
Here's the answer.

98
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:44,105
-What is it?
-The answer is…

99
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:46,705
First, they are all in the cat family.

100
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:48,138
-The cat family.
-That's true.

101
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:49,271
Not the cheetah family.

102
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:52,071
Leopards, jaguars, and cheetahs are
all different species.

103
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:54,138
-They are.
-It's leopard, jaguar, cheetah in English.

104
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,305
-What?
-They're different species.

105
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:57,438
The animal we call pyobeom is a leopard.

106
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,538
CONCLUSION: NOTHING WAS CORRECT

107
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,238
-A leopard?
-It's not a jaguar.

108
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:03,971
In the past, they couldn't look things up,
so you could insist you were right.

109
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:05,605
Kyuhyun hit the nail on the head.

110
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,605
In today's world of unrestricted search…

111
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,738
You can't argue anymore.

112
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:12,971
-Yet, he always does.
-When they tell us,

113
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:15,238
I accept it and follow along.

114
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,538
Hey, that's the answer.

115
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,238
-You can't not accept it.
-I know.

116
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,705
THAT IS COMMON SENSE

117
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,305
Anyway, Kyuhyun, I heard about yesterday.

118
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:23,371
Do they have your passport?

119
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:26,138
-What happened yesterday?
-I heard something happened.

120
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:30,938
We returned at 7 a.m. this morning.
I unpacked, took a nap, and woke up,

121
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,038
-but I woke up a bit late.
-That's wild.

122
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:34,805
You should've just gone straight to Kenya.

123
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,571
Hey, but what did you go for?

124
00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:38,838
-A concert.
-SMTOWN.

125
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:40,071
You're not in SM, though.

126
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:41,371
CURRENT AGENCY: ANTENNA
FORMER AGENCY: SM

127
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:43,538
-What are you saying?
-You're in Athena now.

128
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:46,505
-Then, Super Junior… Athena?
-I mean Anthenna.

129
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:49,438
Antenna, okay?

130
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,271
-Yes, Antenna.
-Yoon Jong-shin will be sad

131
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:52,671
if you keep going to SMTOWN.

132
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:54,838
-Why would he be sad?
-Isn't he in Antenna?

133
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:57,171
-That's MYSTIC.
-Oh, really?

134
00:04:57,238 --> 00:04:58,938
-You Hee-yul would be sad.
-Who's in Antenna?

135
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:00,371
-What you said…
-It's Hee-yul.

136
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:02,371
-Right, Hee-yul.
-This guy…

137
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:05,438
It must be nice to work like you, Ji-won.
You just say whatever you want.

138
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,838
This was like the cheetah thing too.

139
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:08,038
A VERY RECENT DÉJÀ VU

140
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:10,771
-Hee-yul will be sad.
-Why would he be?

141
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:12,705
It's a win-win situation for us both.

142
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,371
Why look at it through such a narrow lens?

143
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:17,438
-Then…
-You should've stayed at SM.

144
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:18,605
LOOKING AWAY

145
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:20,271
They're nicer to him over there.

146
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:21,438
Anthenna is nicer.

147
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:23,771
-That's not exactly…
-They gave him a TV with antennas.

148
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:25,405
Stop calling it "Anthenna."

149
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:27,271
STOP BICKERING AND LET'S GO

150
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,638
INCHEON
THEY FLY FOR 6 WHOLE HOURS

151
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,538
BANGKOK

152
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,638
SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFERRED TO KENYA AIRWAYS

153
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:35,971
SNORING

154
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:38,138
SLEEPING THROUGH A 14-HOUR FLIGHT

155
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,638
IN-FLIGHT MEAL INTERRUPTS SWEET SLEEP

156
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,005
Aren't you eating breakfast?

157
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:57,671
-Are you going to eat?
-What?

158
00:05:58,538 --> 00:05:59,705
Of course, I am.

159
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:02,738
-We have to shoot that part.
-That's right.

160
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:03,638
WHAT A PROFESSIONAL

161
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:07,671
THIS ONE IS TOTALLY PASSED OUT

162
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:16,038
RUMMAGING AROUND TO FIND SOMETHING USEFUL

163
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,605
What do you call this? Amenities?

164
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,971
CORRECT, KENYA AIRWAYS' AMENITIES

165
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:23,571
NICELY PACKED WITH 6 ITEMS

166
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,671
TAKES OUT THE FIRST ITEM

167
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:27,071
Hey, socks.

168
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:30,671
LONG BLACK SOCKS

169
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,038
PUTS THEM ON RIGHT AWAY

170
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:33,471
What are you wearing?

171
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:34,638
Black Panther.

172
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,505
THE POSE LOOKS SIMILAR

173
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,505
NEXT ITEM

175
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:47,771
A FINE WOODEN COMB
PERFECT FOR BRUSHING YOUR BEDHEAD

176
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:51,071
Made with natural wood from Kenya.
It's actually wood.

177
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:53,238
-Is it wood?
-It is.

178
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:56,105
-It feels good. Try it.
-It is wood.

179
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:57,105
BRUSHING

180
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:58,805
-Hey, but…
-It feels refreshing.

181
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,971
-It's actually real wood.
-It wakes you up.

182
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,705
-This is nice.
-Exactly.

183
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:04,005
A BASIC ITEM, PEN

184
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:07,138
All of these look nice.
This is made of wood too.

185
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:11,371
THE TOOTHBRUSH IS WOODEN AS WELL

186
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:14,938
-I guess this airline doesn't use plastic.
-Yes, eco-friendly.

187
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:17,405
-They don't use any plastic.
-Yeah, you're right.

188
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:21,638
-The bag itself…
-Oh, this is something like cork.

189
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:24,338
When I saw this,
I was detailed enough to say it.

190
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:27,105
They must not use any plastic.

191
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:28,971
GAZES INTENTLY

192
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:31,205
-You use all sorts of plastics.
-Because…

193
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:32,505
NO FIGHTING

194
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:35,471
IT'S TIME FOR A PEACEFUL BREAKFAST

195
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:38,671
HE'S TOTALLY KNOCKED OUT

196
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:44,005
THEY LET KYUHYUN SLEEP MORE
AS HE MUST BE TIRED FROM HIS CONCERT

197
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,271
WORN OUT DESPITE HAVING NO CONCERT

198
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:50,638
ORANGE JUICE AS APPETIZER

199
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,371
SIGHS

200
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,405
BUT HE IS STILL TIRED

201
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:56,471
This is my breakfast.

202
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:59,638
HE GRABS THE CAMERA,
DRIVEN BY RESPONSIBILITY

203
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:00,638
For breakfast…

204
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:01,638
BLINKS SLEEPILY

205
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:03,538
…there is orange juice.

206
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:05,538
A SLOW BLINK

207
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,671
Morning fruit.

208
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:12,471
A RADICAL ANGLE
THAT REPRESENTS HIS FATIGUE

209
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:13,505
Fruit.

210
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:19,971
Okay, is it something like yogurt?

211
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:22,371
OWING TO HIS FATIGUE,
HIS REVIEW IS MOSTLY FACTUAL

212
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,705
HE MUST NOT BE DONE YET

213
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:31,238
RELYING ON THE VIDEO
AS HE HAS NO STRENGTH TO TALK

214
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:34,038
WHAT'S ON MY TABLE?
THE END

215
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,205
HEADACHE

216
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:41,105
THE LONG-AWAITED MORNING COFFEE

217
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,871
That's how we say "thank you" in Korean.

218
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:53,805
-Gamsahapnida.
-Yes, gamsahapnida.

219
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:02,338
-Asante.
-Asante.

220
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:04,038
EXPRESSING GRATITUDE
IN THEIR OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, SWAHILI

221
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:05,671
-In Kenya?
-That's "thank you" in Kenya.

222
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:06,638
Asante?

223
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:08,138
-Asante.
-Yes, asante.

224
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:11,405
THIS GUY IS STILL DETOXING
FROM HIS PREVIOUS TRIP

225
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:16,605
HE SLEEPS THROUGH THE WHOLE FLIGHT
DESPITE HIS NOISY NEIGHBORS

226
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:23,205
Did he twist his ankle?

227
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,171
LAUGHS

228
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,505
His ankle looks broken.

229
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,405
NIKE SYMBOL

230
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:30,638
Turn it back for him. Turn it this way.

231
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:32,271
It looks broken.

232
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:35,438
Yes, his ankle is twisted around.

233
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:36,838
Shouldn't we set it right?

234
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:40,005
We have ten minutes left.
Should we wake him?

235
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:43,538
TOUCHING

236
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:44,905
PRESSES

237
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:48,138
GOING UP

238
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:52,738
LAUGHS

239
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:54,438
Kyuhyun, we have ten minutes remaining.

240
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:57,605
CAPTAIN MAKES THE ARRIVAL ANNOUNCEMENT

241
00:09:57,671 --> 00:09:59,771
-We have arrived.
-We're here.

242
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:00,971
We made it, everyone.

243
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:02,571
Yes, we made it.

244
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:04,538
ARRIVED AFTER 16.5 HOURS IN TOTAL

245
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,838
NAIROBI, THE CAPITAL OF KENYA

246
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:11,505
A BUSTLING CITY

247
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,605
COEXISTING WITH THE BEAUTY OF NATURE

248
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,138
IT'S CALLED SILICON SAVANNAH
FOR SILICON VALLEY PLUS SAVANNAH

249
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:18,471
LOCATED ON HIGH GROUND

250
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:20,971
THE CITY BOASTS MILD WEATHER ALL YEAR LONG

251
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,638
KENYAN BARBECUE, NYAMA CHOMA

252
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:26,371
FAMOUS FOR KENYA AA COFFEE

253
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:29,805
A CITY WHERE YOUR EYES
AND MOUTH GET TO FEAST

254
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,305
THEY'LL BE TRAVELING HERE

255
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:34,438
WELL, THAT WAS THE PLAN

256
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:37,305
-Wait.
-Why?

257
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:38,571
I lost my phone.

258
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,771
-What?
-His phone.

259
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,105
Your phone?

260
00:10:41,171 --> 00:10:42,571
I'm in trouble.

261
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:45,005
-It's not here.
-It's not?

262
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:46,205
This is bad. Did I lose it?

263
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:48,105
You don't have your phone?

264
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,505
You should look around your seat.

265
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:51,538
Did you bring it off the plane, Kyuhyun?

266
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:54,838
-You can't remember, can you?
-No.

267
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,538
I reminded you about your headphones
when we got off.

268
00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:00,738
I did remember those.
I must've forgotten my phone.

269
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,571
EVEN BEFORE SETTING FOOT ON NAIROBI

270
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:06,138
CHO KYUHYUN LOSES HIS PHONE

271
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:08,871
I think I lost it.

272
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:13,605
You can't just lose a phone
and be so nonchalant.

273
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,005
I can't do anything about it.

274
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,871
I mean, why…

275
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:18,138
GLOOMY

276
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:20,938
How did you lose it?
Why would you forget your phone?

277
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:23,038
That's enough.

278
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:25,071
Didn't you forget your passport?

279
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:27,705
-Why would I forget that?
-I reminded you to take yours.

280
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,138
What are you saying?

281
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:32,205
You were about to leave it
in your seat pocket.

282
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:34,938
-When?
-So, I said, "Ji-won, your passport."

283
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,371
-Make sure you don't lose your passport.
-Okay.

284
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:40,438
-You were grateful.
-It's okay to lose a passport.

285
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:43,171
That's nonsense.
It's worse to lose your passport.

286
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,571
Losing your passport is the worst.

287
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,571
If you lose your passport,
you get more screen time.

288
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:51,205
LOSING A CELL PHONE IS THE SAME

289
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:53,838
I have a bad feeling I've lost it.

290
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:57,738
-Which model is your phone?
-A Galaxy phone.

291
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:00,071
-The Z Fold that goes like this.
-The Fold.

292
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:01,171
The Fold…

293
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:02,171
TRYING TO REMAIN CALM

294
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:03,638
It opens to the side.

295
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:04,571
AN EXPENSIVE MODEL AT THAT

296
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:08,338
This really makes no sense.

297
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,905
RUMMAGING

298
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:16,171
Gosh, seriously.

299
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:20,071
KYUHYUN WITH A LOST PHONE DEMONSTRATES

300
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,971
THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF

301
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:24,271
This can't be.

302
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:26,305
STAGE 1: DENIAL

303
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,638
This is the worst.

304
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,705
STAGE 2: ANGER

305
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:31,238
I wish it would turn up right now.

306
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:33,271
STAGE 3: BARGAINING

307
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:34,838
I can't help it.

308
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:36,871
STAGE 4: DEPRESSION

309
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:41,271
STAGE 5: ACCEPTANCE

310
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:45,138
I even checked my seat at the end.

311
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:50,571
WASTING AWAY BY THE MINUTE

312
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,605
Did you use your phone on the bus?

313
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,605
-Then…
-If not, it has to be…

314
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:57,238
Since you won't need your headphones,
can I have them?

315
00:12:57,305 --> 00:12:58,438
You don't have a phone, so…

316
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:00,838
I WANT YOUR BLUETOOTH EARBUDS

317
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,371
-What do you want?
-His headphones.

318
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:03,371
Why?

319
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:06,238
Don't you remember where you left it?

320
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:10,171
At the end, I turned on my roaming,
and as I was grabbing my bags…

321
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:13,805
I always look at my phone,
but I didn't today.

322
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,305
-So, you don't remember where you put it?
-I guess not.

323
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:20,038
As I was grabbing my bags,
I put them down somewhere.

324
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:21,605
IT'S A Z FOLD THOM BROWNE EDITION

325
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:22,838
I'VE LET THEM KNOW, WE MUST WAIT

326
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:23,838
REQUEST SUBMITTED

327
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:26,238
THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AN HOUR NOW

328
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,038
Hey, the sun is up.

329
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,905
IT WAS DARK WHEN THEY LANDED

330
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,605
THE SUN ROSE WHILE THEY WERE WAITING

331
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,205
The sun is so intense.

332
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:39,405
Look over there.

333
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:41,571
Wow, it's piercing through.

334
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:42,471
THE STRONG SUNSHINE

335
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:45,405
AND A SINGLE DARK SHADOW BELOW

336
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:46,538
-My eyes hurt.
-It's so bright.

337
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:48,238
-The sunrise in Africa.
-Right.

338
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:51,138
Along with Kyuhyun's grief-ridden face…

339
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,605
As if it'll melt everything.

340
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:55,705
There's something going on
between this team and my phone.

341
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:57,171
Right, the screen shattered last time.

342
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,771
What a stunning sunrise in Africa.

343
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:04,905
However, even before that burning sunrise,
his face is overshadowed.

344
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:08,671
THE STRONGER THE SUNLIGHT,
THE DARKER THE SHADOW

345
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:11,205
Do I have to pay
for "At Gwanghwamun" again?

346
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:12,571
I think I'll have to.

347
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:19,371
IN A FAMILIAR SITUATION,
WE PLAY THIS FAMILIAR SONG

348
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:21,171
I should've put on my contacts.

349
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:24,305
Right, since you couldn't see well…

350
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:26,771
-What can he do when he can't see?
-Right.

351
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:29,005
That's what happens
when you can't see well.

352
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:30,438
THE MOST PESSIMISTIC CELEBRITY

353
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:31,571
I've never seen him like this.

354
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,438
-He's usually not like this.
-I know.

355
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,971
-This isn't like him.
-I agree.

356
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,505
FOR SOME REASON, I WAS A BIT

357
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:40,938
TIRED ON THIS FLIGHT

358
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,805
CHO KYUHYUN, AGE 37
LOST HIS PHONE

359
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:48,238
I'm usually glued to my phone,
but I was focused on the shoot.

360
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:49,705
Yes, sure.

361
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:50,905
HE JUST HAD TO FOCUS ON THE SHOOT

362
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:53,205
We were looking at the sunrise in awe.

363
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,805
THE SUNRISE HAPPENED TO BE PRETTY

364
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:59,671
YOU WERE SO USEFUL

365
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:02,271
THE SELFIES THEY TOOK TOGETHER

366
00:15:02,338 --> 00:15:03,938
They gave me some seafood.

367
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,071
FILMED A REVIEW OF HIS MEAL

368
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:09,905
THEY ALL BELONG TO SOMEONE ELSE NOW

369
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:12,205
I feel like I've seen this scene before.

370
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:14,938
THIS GLOOMINESS FEELS LIKE DÉJÀ VU SOMEHOW

371
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,005
Kyuhyun doesn't need a mic.

372
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:19,471
I don't think he'll talk much
for the next three hours.

373
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:21,705
Will you be okay? Are you going to talk?

374
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,971
Well, I could sigh or something.

375
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:27,771
THE KING OF PESSIMISM RETURNS

376
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:32,205
Actually, I just got a message,
but I don't want it to upset you.

377
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:36,105
-It's not on the plane?
-It's not in your seat.

378
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,705
Let's go, then. I think it's lost.

379
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:42,205
Kyuhyun's memories
from his life are all gone.

380
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,438
-Stop it, you idiot.
-So, it's time

381
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:48,571
to make new memories in Nairobi.

382
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:51,005
-Let's get going.
-All right, let's go.

383
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:53,105
THEY SET OFF TO MAKE NEW MEMORIES

384
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:56,171
We have finally arrived in Kenya.

385
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:02,405
It took 17 hours, plus another 2 hours
here and there, so 19 hours in total.

386
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:03,971
We've come outside in 20 hours.

387
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,805
The weather couldn't be better.

388
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:07,238
This temperature is

389
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:09,305
-It's not humid.
-like early fall in Korea.

390
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:12,838
The temperature is perfect,
and the sunshine is crisp,

391
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,571
but I have a shadow next to me.

392
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:18,038
-I know, I sense the gloom.
-There's a shadow over here.

393
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,971
Everyone, you probably know how it feels.

394
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:23,571
Your phone is like an extension of you.

395
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:25,938
-Losing that is like--
-Stop talking about it.

396
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:27,338
We said we'd stop.

397
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:28,771
-No, but really--
-Stop it.

398
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,705
ENOUGH

399
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:33,371
-Please get in the back row.
-Okay.

400
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:35,738
THEY BOARD THE BUS

401
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,171
Put all your phones on silent.

402
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:39,705
If your phone rings,
Kyuhyun will be irritated.

403
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:41,471
YOU SAID YOU'D STOP

404
00:16:41,538 --> 00:16:42,871
Put it on silent mode.

405
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:45,205
-So, Director Nah.
-Yes?

406
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,071
Please brief us on today's schedule.

407
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:48,738
I haven't asked you this in a while.

408
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:50,871
First, we're going
to the hotel in Naiborobi.

409
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:52,471
It's not Naibory.

410
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:54,238
-Did I say that?
-Not Naibory.

411
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,671
-I keep…
-So, where are we, Ji-won?

412
00:16:56,738 --> 00:17:00,638
-Kenya.
-What is the capital of Kenya?

413
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:03,705
Isn't it Naibory?

414
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:05,605
-My goodness.
-That sounds like Haneulbori.

415
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:09,104
-The brain of our group, Kyuhyun?
-What?

416
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:11,571
-Never mind. I won't ask.
-The capital…

417
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,771
I won't ask if you answer in that tone.

418
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,238
-The capital of Kenya
-Naboiri?

419
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:16,371
is called Z Fold.

420
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:18,038
Seriously.

421
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:21,038
-This is Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.
-That's what we said.

422
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:24,338
Anyway, does it take about 30 minutes
to reach downtown Nairobi?

423
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:26,271
Yes, it takes about 30 minutes.

424
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,038
Since you've had a long trip,
you should wash up and get changed.

425
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:32,938
But I'm so happy.
The time difference isn't too big.

426
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:36,371
Usually, I feel extremely sleepy
when I get off the plane.

427
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:39,971
-Jeong-heon, you look rather out of it.
-No, I'm fine.

428
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:42,505
-Did you lose your phone?
-No.

429
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:43,405
UNEXPECTED CURVE BALL

430
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:45,238
Someone might think you lost your phone.

431
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:47,138
THAT'S ME

432
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:48,471
Come on.

433
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:50,738
Hey, there it is. An S25 Ultra.

434
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,071
Let's go there instead.

435
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,205
IMMACULATE TIMING

436
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,405
A BRAND I'M GLAD TO ENCOUNTER TODAY

437
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:56,771
Let's go over there.

438
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:58,871
Come on. Give it a rest.

439
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:02,005
I haven't seen him this down in a while.

440
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,838
-What's that?
-What?

441
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:05,105
On the billboard?

442
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:06,671
-It's a bird.
-What is that?

443
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:09,105
-Isn't that an archaeopteryx?
-It's massive.

444
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,938
-It's a condor…
-It's a real bird.

445
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:11,871
Did you film it?

446
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,638
-I did, but not clearly.
-On the billboard.

447
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:14,538
Look there.

448
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:16,505
Oh, that's a condor.

449
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:19,138
-Is it a real bird?
-An eagle.

450
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:20,771
THEY LOOK SIMILAR, BUT IT'S NOT A CONDOR

451
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:23,438
MARABOU STORK

452
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:26,771
1.5 METERS TALL
WITH A WINGSPAN OF 3 METERS

453
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,671
DUE TO THEIR NATURE
OF EATING CORPSES OR TRASH

454
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:31,471
THEY CAN BE SPOTTED THROUGHOUT THE CITY

455
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:34,305
-Over there! There are so many!
-There too!

456
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:36,205
-Right there!
-On top of the tree!

457
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:37,105
SO HAPPY TO SEE THEM

458
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:38,805
They're so big.

459
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:42,805
They have street food.
It's a banana with something ground up.

460
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,305
-Can't we stop and have some?
-No.

461
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:48,638
-What's this stuff? Is this what you want?
-Yes.

462
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:50,371
It's something with eggs.

463
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:53,471
Look, with the raw egg.
I mean, a whole boiled egg goes in.

464
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:55,838
-A whole egg mashed up.
-It's mashed.

465
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:58,605
-That looks so good.
-Right?

466
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,305
Let's try it if we find it near the hotel.

467
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:03,671
There's sausage under it.
There's a bunch of stuff.

468
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:05,938
There's another one. And another!

469
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,938
-That's the same one.
-It must be a street food.

470
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,738
I think we're near our hotel.

471
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,471
-There it is again.
-We can go and have some.

472
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:16,905
It's right here. No, this is fruit.

473
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:19,238
They manually record
the security camera footage.

474
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:20,805
That's our staff.

475
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:22,038
"We're staff."

476
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:25,171
-Let's get off.
-Should we walk over quickly?

477
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:28,205
-What do you say?
-First, let's unpack before we go.

478
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:29,771
Asante.

479
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:32,638
THEY DON'T FORGET TO SAY THANK YOU
BEFORE GETTING OFF

480
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,305
THEY FINALLY ARRIVE
AT THEIR FIRST HOTEL IN KENYA

481
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:38,505
You could play foot volleyball here.
The parking lot is huge.

482
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:41,471
A SENSE OF OPENNESS IN THE PARKING LOT
BIG ENOUGH FOR FOOT VOLLEYBALL

483
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:44,705
A SENSE OF COZINESS
IN THE NATURE-FRIENDLY INTERIOR

484
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:47,871
A BEAUTIFUL SUNRISE IN THE MORNING

485
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:52,271
AND FANCY LIGHTS THAT DECORATE THE NIGHT

486
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:55,305
A CHARMING RESIDENCE HOTEL

487
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:56,238
Is this it?

488
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:57,971
-Isn't this an apartment building?
-Asante.

489
00:19:58,038 --> 00:19:59,038
AMAZED

490
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:00,171
What is this?

491
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:03,871
-It's a peculiar layout.
-It's an apartment.

492
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:05,771
Look here. There's more this way.

493
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,471
-What?
-Like this.

494
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:10,371
-It's a balcony.
-We each get our own bed.

495
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:11,638
-Really?
-Is that right?

496
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:14,505
-Oh, nice.
-They're slightly small.

497
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:15,571
BEDROOM FOR 3
PERFECT FOR GETTING CLOSE

498
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:17,938
-All three of us are in here together.
-Yes.

499
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:20,838
-You guys can choose a bed.
-I don't care.

500
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:22,738
This must be a real hotel, though.

501
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:24,505
There's a safe in there.

502
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:25,571
A HOTEL REQUIREMENT

503
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,471
There's a balcony, Ji-won.

504
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:31,771
A BALCONY WITH A NICE VIEW

505
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:34,705
IMPRESSED

506
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:35,705
Did you see the bathroom?

507
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,038
-The bathroom?
-Is it nice?

508
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:38,271
EVEN THE BATHROOM IS PERFECT

509
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:42,338
We could even sleep here
if we put down some blankets.

510
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:45,671
A SHORT BREAK

511
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:47,738
SLAPS

512
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:50,905
-Kyuhyun.
-Yes.

513
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,005
Are you okay?

514
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:54,371
No.

515
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:56,105
-You're not okay?
-I'm not.

516
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,438
Losing your phone is so annoying.
You're not saying much,

517
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:02,371
-but I'm sure you're annoyed.
-Well…

518
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:04,105
I can't blame anyone else.

519
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:05,638
Are you okay, Kyuhyun?

520
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:08,538
He's not. I asked already.

521
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:11,005
-He was like, "No."
-Of course not.

522
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:12,871
Gosh, kiddo.

523
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,771
-I regret what I did.
-Why regret it?

524
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:18,205
THEY ALL TEASED HIM
BUT WERE WORRIED FOR HIM

525
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:21,371
Kyuhyun, do you want
a glass of morning whiskey?

526
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:23,005
NO THANKS

527
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:25,171
Then, can we tease you about your phone?

528
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:26,505
Aren't you already doing that?

529
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:30,705
I feel bad about it,
so I want your permission.

530
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:32,238
THEY OFFER WORDS OF COMFORT
IN THEIR OWN CLUMSY WAYS

531
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:34,805
Aren't we already teasing him plenty?

532
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:38,071
Sorry, it may be tough on you,
but for the show…

533
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:39,171
-Sure.
-Right, Kyuhyun.

534
00:21:39,238 --> 00:21:41,471
-It may sound harsh, but it's…
-I'm sure it's hard on you,

535
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:43,438
but it wasn't bad for our program.

536
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:46,405
-When are we leaving?
-Let's go have fun.

537
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,105
-We were…
-Egg is Company…

538
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:49,605
Let's go to Egg is Company.

539
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:55,071
We were going to unpack, wash up,
and rest before going out to lunch.

540
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:56,405
Oh, we can't have snacks, then.

541
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:58,471
No, it's only 8:30 a.m.

542
00:21:58,538 --> 00:22:00,871
-Lunch is much later, then.
-It's much later.

543
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:04,138
-Then we should go to Egg is Company.
-That's not what it's called.

544
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:06,405
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, really?

545
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:09,605
All right. Let's go.
Let's eat Egg is Coming.

546
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:12,405
Gosh, the weather is incredible.
Is this even real?

547
00:22:12,471 --> 00:22:15,471
-Gosh, it's chilly.
-It's so nice and cool. I love it.

548
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:17,505
This is so nice.

549
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,505
-It's so nice. I love it.
-I didn't think Africa would be this cold.

550
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:23,038
SHIVERS

551
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:26,105
It's like winter here.
No wonder everyone's wearing long sleeves.

552
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,305
Hey, we're here.

553
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,438
-Is this it?
-Yes.

554
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:30,838
THEY ARRIVE AT THE FOOD STALL
OUTSIDE THE HOTEL

555
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:31,738
Here it is.

556
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:33,138
-This isn't it.
-Yes, it is.

557
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:34,338
-They don't have eggs.
-It is.

558
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:35,771
-It's not.
-They give you eggs too.

559
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:37,238
-They do have eggs.
-It is right.

560
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:39,171
This is the same thing.

561
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:41,571
-I want one with a sausage.
-This is it.

562
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:44,471
STRUGGLING TO GET A WORD OUT

563
00:22:44,538 --> 00:22:46,071
THEN, HE BECOMES SILENT

564
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:48,305
Let's just stay back.

565
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,571
Let's see how he orders.

566
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:05,171
Cardboard?

567
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:09,638
-"Cardboard."
-Yes, one cardboard.

568
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:12,271
-A raw egg?
-No, a boiled egg.

569
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:13,238
TAPS

570
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:15,271
Look at how she peels it.

571
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:18,171
-With a spoon.
-I've never seen that before.

572
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:19,538
The egg is hot.

573
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:22,071
-She peeled it so quickly.
-That's smart.

574
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:24,871
-It's like a wrap.
-Like morning toast.

575
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:27,571
-I'm so curious about the taste.
-It must be brunch food.

576
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:29,905
-That's spicy.
-Here…

577
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:31,371
-Is it ketchup?
-Chili, I think.

578
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:32,705
-Chili.
-Chili.

579
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:35,205
-And hot sauce.
-Hot sauce?

580
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:36,605
ADDING A BUNCH OF HOT SAUCE

581
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:40,371
-She doesn't use her hand. It's so neat.
-It's like a taco.

582
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:41,638
-Let me try it.
-Go on.

583
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:43,005
-Finally…
-Hurry up.

584
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,071
Local street food.

585
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:48,538
So, this is chapati? Cardboard?

586
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:53,971
-Chapachi?
-Chapachi.

587
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:55,438
-Chapachi?
-Smocha.

588
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:56,938
THE OUTER WRAP IS A CHAPATI

589
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,638
THE FOOD ITSELF IS CALLED SMOCHA

590
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:02,005
They all have separate names.
But if you combine everything…

591
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:04,205
In Korea, it would be similar to…

592
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:06,438
HE GETS IT

593
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:08,305
-Like Chagyechi.
-That's right.

594
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:09,605
It's a compound name.

595
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:11,571
It's like Chagyechi. I see.

596
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:14,371
Is the wrap similar to hotteok?

597
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:16,438
-How is it?
-Is it like hotteok?

598
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,338
The wrap is good too.

599
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:21,371
-Is it like a crepe?
-Yes, it's seasoned and a bit salty.

600
00:24:22,238 --> 00:24:24,105
-It's seasoned.
-Yes, it is.

601
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,038
It's so good.

602
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:28,271
Is it tasty?

603
00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:31,405
You know how you get hot dogs
with toppings at Costco?

604
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,938
That's what it tastes like.

605
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,005
The smell… This looks really good.

606
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:38,538
-I think this is the kicker.
-Isn't this the salsa?

607
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:40,838
The thing with tomatoes and onions?

608
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:42,605
AN EAST AFRICAN SALAD CALLED KACHUMBARI

609
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:46,005
-It's seriously good. I'm not lying.
-Really?

610
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,405
I'll try it myself.

611
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:49,505
-I love this kind of food.
-Yes.

612
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:52,405
CURIOUS ABOUT THE BOSS

613
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:59,471
Is she your girlfriend?

614
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:00,671
What are you saying?

615
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:02,305
I'M A COWORKER

616
00:25:02,371 --> 00:25:04,305
-Kenyans and Koreans have similar palates.
-Totally.

617
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:06,571
I think I'm going to move here.

618
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,838
WILD DECISION

619
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:14,638
-You have to eat this every day here.
-Right.

620
00:25:14,705 --> 00:25:16,338
I'm glad that Kyuhyun likes it.

621
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:18,538
Isn't the Z Fold this big
when you open it?

622
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:20,538
THE COMEDIAN NEVER MISSES A BEAT

623
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:22,338
-Hello?
-I had forgotten for a moment.

624
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:24,871
-Hello?
-I had forgotten because I was happy.

625
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:27,005
If this can help you forget, anytime.

626
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:28,271
Have it tomorrow too.

627
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:29,638
Let's find the Big Five.

628
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:32,338
-We found one. Four more to go.
-All right.

629
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,605
-Let's find our Big Five.
-Okay.

630
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:36,205
-This is number one.
-It is.

631
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:37,205
-For real.
-Really.

632
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,271
THE BIG 1, REGISTERED!

633
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,071
AFTER A SATISFYING BREAKFAST

634
00:25:42,438 --> 00:25:43,905
A DROWSY MOMENT OF REST

635
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,105
SU-GEUN IS HUMMING A SONG AS USUAL

636
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,705
-I think I'll have to tell them. Right?
-Yes.

637
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:52,838
Shouldn't I tell them?

638
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:54,105
WHAT IS IT NOW?

639
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:55,171
Tell us what?

640
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:58,971
Netflix is really strict
about music copyrights.

641
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:00,738
So? I only sang a bit.

642
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:04,371
-What…
-If you can tell which song it is,

643
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,471
we have to pay for it.

644
00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:06,538
Which…

645
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:09,071
WARNING

646
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:11,405
Can I sing an improvised song?

647
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:12,771
-That's fine.
-Okay.

648
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,205
THINKING

649
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:17,705
THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB APPEARS

650
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:20,938
I told you to steal my heart

651
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:23,871
But why did you steal my phone?

652
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:26,738
"SHE PREFERS THE Z FOLD TO MY LOVE"
SONG BY SU-GEUN

653
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:31,171
Please give it back

654
00:26:31,238 --> 00:26:34,171
I said not to turn off the power

655
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:37,571
Did you turn it off to sell it?

656
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,571
Please pick it up

657
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:42,371
Please say something

658
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:43,571
That's good.

659
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:45,171
-This might work.
-You think so?

660
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:46,738
This might be a hit.

661
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,005
-I'm serious.
-A hit, my damn ass.

662
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:50,271
HE'S DAMN ANGRY

663
00:26:50,338 --> 00:26:52,871
Kyuhyun, if you sing this,
it would totally work.

664
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:54,105
-It won't.
-You don't think so?

665
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:55,238
PESSIMISTIC

666
00:26:55,305 --> 00:26:57,638
People who have lost their phones like me…

667
00:26:57,705 --> 00:26:58,905
PESSIMIST CHO
5 HOURS SINCE HE LOST HIS PHONE

668
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:01,438
…will frown upon this song.

669
00:27:01,505 --> 00:27:03,171
No, they'll listen as they cry it out.

670
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:05,771
Can you sing this really sorrowfully?

671
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:10,738
-Please?
-I told you to steal my heart

672
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,971
THE SONG HAS GOTTEN MUCH SADDER

673
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,238
Hey, that's great. Let's make this song.

674
00:27:16,305 --> 00:27:17,238
Please give it…

675
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:20,471
Please give it back

676
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,871
Please

677
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:25,638
Kyuhyun, this sounds so good.
This could be a hit.

678
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:27,905
I told you to steal my heart

679
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:29,638
"I wanted to give you my heart."

680
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:32,471
-But why did you steal my phone?
-Steal my phone?

681
00:27:32,538 --> 00:27:35,071
Please give it back

682
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:38,638
Only take my heart

683
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:41,838
I'm still paying off the phone

684
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:43,505
THE 2ND VERSE IS QUITE REALISTIC

685
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,705
To her, am I

686
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:48,071
Only good for six months?

687
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:49,271
Why does it keep changing?

688
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:50,605
THEY GO EAT LUNCH!

689
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,438
Did she go home? Maybe not yet.

690
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,705
-What do you mean?
-But our friend is…

691
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:56,871
-Tinya.
-Tinya.

692
00:27:56,938 --> 00:27:58,871
ACTUALLY, IT'S TANYA

693
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:00,305
-She's here.
-Tinya.

694
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:01,471
-Tinya?
-Tinya.

695
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:03,005
HI

696
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:04,105
-She can't see us.
-Tinya.

697
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:06,171
-She said hi.
-She recognized us.

698
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:08,005
She knows us now.

699
00:28:08,571 --> 00:28:10,871
-Tinya knows us now.
-We're friends. This is fun.

700
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:14,205
-This place is so beautiful.
-Right?

701
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:17,438
The clouds are set so low.
If you look to the left,

702
00:28:17,838 --> 00:28:19,105
it's just like…

703
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:21,471
It's as if you can see
the entire Earth at once.

704
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:25,305
I finally understand what a horizon is
now that I'm here.

705
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,171
Korea is surrounded by mountains,

706
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,971
-so we don't have that.
-It's blocked.

707
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:31,171
I thought that was a drone. Is it a kite?

708
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:32,638
Is it a kite or what?

709
00:28:33,138 --> 00:28:34,238
Hey, it's an eagle.

710
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:37,538
-I mentioned bald eagles about ten times,
-What are they?

711
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:39,071
but Jeong-heon didn't get a single shot.

712
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:40,638
He's always five seconds late.

713
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:41,771
JUNG JEONG-HEON
ALWAYS 5 SECONDS LATE

714
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:45,271
WHEN THEY FIRST MET THE STORK

715
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:47,705
-Did you film it?
-I did, but not clearly.

716
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:49,738
1ST TRY, COULDN'T FILM IT WELL
SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME

717
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:52,638
HIS SECOND CHANCE CAME LIKE A MIRACLE

718
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:56,705
2ND TRY, COULDN'T FILM IT
SINCE IT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE

719
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:59,371
AND JUST NOW

720
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:02,005
3RD TRY, COULDN'T FILM IT
SINCE HE WAS ON HIS PHONE

721
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:04,605
-It's sitting over here.
-It's just sitting.

722
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:07,638
They sit on top of billboard signs.

723
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,305
Always on top of trees or signs.

724
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:12,571
There was a spot
with a bunch of them earlier.

725
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:14,271
BUT HE COULDN'T FILM THE STORKS
UNTIL THE VERY END

726
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:16,771
Anyway, we're on our way to have lunch.

727
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:21,605
The restaurant is called Carnivore.
It's a Kenyan barbecue restaurant.

728
00:29:21,671 --> 00:29:22,505
IMPRESSED

729
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:26,371
There's a traditional Kenyan dish
called nyama choma.

730
00:29:26,438 --> 00:29:29,971
It means grilled meat.
So, that's what we'll be eating.

731
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:32,338
Think of it as an all-you-can-eat place.

732
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,371
NAIROBI'S POPULAR RESTAURANT, CARNIVORE

733
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:41,071
GRILLED OVER A CHARCOAL FIRE
SO THE FAT DRIPS DOWN

734
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,838
THEY WILL TRY KENYA'S NATIONAL DISH,
NYAMA CHOMA, THE TRADITIONAL BARBECUE

735
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:48,671
HERE, THEY CAN STUFF THEMSELVES
WITH ALL SORTS OF MEAT

736
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:54,538
EAT YOUR FILL
THE MEAT JUST KEEPS ON COMING

737
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:56,538
ENTERS

738
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:58,271
AMAZED

739
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,238
THE BARBECUE ZONE LOOKS SO IMPRESSIVE

740
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:04,305
There's pork, duck, and turkey.

741
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:05,438
I think it's turkey.

742
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:09,505
Well, it's okay
since this is a restaurant, but…

743
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:11,138
I don't think there's anything weird.

744
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:15,105
WILL THAT

745
00:30:15,838 --> 00:30:18,471
REALLY BE THE CASE?

746
00:30:19,105 --> 00:30:22,938
-Why do you have cue cards?
-If you just get to eat,

747
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:24,238
it might be boring.

748
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:25,705
-Oh, my. You're here.
-Of course.

749
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:27,205
Let's begin.

750
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:29,771
Whatever it is, let's begin.

751
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:32,605
-I'm 100 percent sure.
-If you just eat, it might be boring.

752
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:34,505
It's boring. So boring!

753
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:36,605
-How boring.
-It might be boring.

754
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:39,305
Since we're in Kenya,

755
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,005
we'll play a simple trivia.

756
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:42,105
Trivia.

757
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:44,338
-I'm a trivia expert.
-Give us history questions.

758
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:45,905
-You're on a world history show.
-We are

759
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,338
-history buffs.
-The questions are set.

760
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:48,571
He can't suddenly change them.

761
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,971
So, they'll bring the meat here.
When they do, they'll carve it up.

762
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:55,471
-Don't eat. We do the quiz first.
-Okay.

763
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:58,871
So, if Kyuhyun gets it right,
you can eat and keep going.

764
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:00,371
This reminds me of the old days.

765
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:03,271
What happens if we get it wrong?

766
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:05,271
-Keep going until you do.
-We can't eat.

767
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:07,505
-Only those who get it right can eat?
-Yes.

768
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:09,138
-Why?
-You know the drill, Ji-won.

769
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:11,405
Ji-won, haven't you played
this type of game recently?

770
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,771
I haven't. Where would I play it?

771
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,871
Ji-won only does intellectual shows.

772
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:18,071
He is good at this.

773
00:31:18,138 --> 00:31:20,071
IN AWE

774
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:23,705
-He has great skin.
-So, it's barbecue, mint,

775
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:26,105
-chili,
-Chili,

776
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:29,238
-fruit salsa.
-fruit salsa…

777
00:31:43,005 --> 00:31:44,005
A HUGE SPOILER

778
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,805
-There's a crocodile.
-Crocodile meat?

779
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:51,205
-Asante sana.
-Karibu sana.

780
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:52,238
LANGUAGE SKILLS TO SHOW INTELLIGENCE

781
00:31:52,305 --> 00:31:53,405
"Karibu sana."

782
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:55,405
Gosh, I'm practically Kenyan already.

783
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:56,371
Asante.

784
00:31:56,438 --> 00:31:57,871
How long have you been
on the history show?

785
00:31:57,938 --> 00:31:59,138
-Us?
-Ji-won knows a lot.

786
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:01,138
-How many years?
-Over four years.

787
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:02,505
-Four years?
-About four years?

788
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:04,471
We learned a lot about Africa too.

789
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:06,838
Then, what's the capital of Ethiopia?

790
00:32:07,371 --> 00:32:10,038
-They don't teach us that.
-Why don't you know that? I do.

791
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:11,138
I know.

792
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:13,805
-What is it?
-Addis Ababa.

793
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:16,638
-What's that?
-The capital of Ethiopia.

794
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:18,305
-What?
-What happened?

795
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,838
I know lots of stuff like that.

796
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:22,105
-Why do you, though?
-I just do.

797
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:25,605
I'm looking forward to this.
I think the food will be good.

798
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:29,305
Can't we try some Kenyan beer?

799
00:32:29,371 --> 00:32:30,205
Can we have some?

800
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:32,505
Then, should we order some Tusker beer?

801
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,405
Should we have them play for it first?

802
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:35,705
Tusker.

803
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,305
It's a lager.

804
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:39,571
-His voice is like a rapper's.
-Su-geun.

805
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:41,771
COME ON

806
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:43,471
Liano suddala bum.

807
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:44,371
Addis Ababa.

808
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:46,205
It's perfect.

809
00:32:46,271 --> 00:32:48,938
Rock-paper-scissors for a single sip?

810
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:51,305
-That's no fun.
-A practice question.

811
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,871
-Just a sip. A little bit.
-A sip.

812
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,405
-Hey, that…
-This is a sip.

813
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:56,438
Let's play for this.

814
00:32:56,505 --> 00:32:58,671
-Let's each try a sip.
-Try it to see if we'll play.

815
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:00,805
-Let's do this.
-Let's go.

816
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:03,971
A SIP OF BEER THEY EXTORTED BY FORCE

817
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:08,038
We should play. Give us the question.

818
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:09,138
Bring it on.

819
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:11,071
-It's refreshing.
-Here it is.

820
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:12,271
-For the beer?
-Yes.

821
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:13,638
An easy first question.

822
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:20,105
Kenya uses English and Swahili
as official languages.

823
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:21,305
I've never heard of it.

824
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:22,271
Same here.

825
00:33:22,338 --> 00:33:24,405
-Swahili?
-Swahili.

826
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:27,138
-Swahili.
-Simply put, it's an African language.

827
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:32,471
In Swahili, which phrase means,
"No problem, it'll all be okay"?

828
00:33:32,538 --> 00:33:33,971
-Su-geun.
-Yes, Su-geun?

829
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:35,905
-Can I just go for it?
-Go for it.

830
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:37,138
Hakuna matata.

831
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:39,805
-Correct.
-Yes, thank you.

832
00:33:39,871 --> 00:33:40,871
CORRECT ANSWER IN LIGHTNING SPEED

833
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,038
IN A DAZE

834
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,938
What happened, World History Brothers?

835
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,305
What, you idiots?

836
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:46,338
LAUGHS

837
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:48,438
-What's that got to do with history?
-Yesterday,

838
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:49,971
he kept watching The Lion King.

839
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:53,071
-Hakuna matata. Was that good?
-Of course.

840
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:54,438
Is that what it means?

841
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:55,438
-I didn't know.
-It'll all be okay.

842
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:58,505
Timon and Pumbaa sing "Hakuna Matata."

843
00:33:58,571 --> 00:33:59,538
I didn't know.

844
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:00,805
No, I can't sing it.

845
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:03,605
-That song should be…
-It's Disney. We'll be in big trouble.

846
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:04,538
It was a different song.

847
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:05,738
Laguna

848
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:07,271
-Laguna
-Laguna

849
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,105
-I want some tuna
-Tuna

850
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:10,038
It's good you stopped.

851
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:12,771
I told you I wanted some tuna

852
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:14,605
But you came back with a banana

853
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:16,038
Shouldn't the meat be here?

854
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:17,371
The meat isn't here

855
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:18,738
Here it comes.

856
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:21,871
THE FIRST NYAMA CHOMA IS SERVED

857
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:23,505
-This is chicken.
-Chicken.

858
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:26,771
Yes.

859
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:29,805
This looks good.

860
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:31,838
CHICKEN

861
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,905
Anyone can tell this looks delicious.

862
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,771
-We have to have this.
-Barbecue chicken.

863
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:36,805
It has to be good.

864
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:37,905
All right.

865
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:42,704
The gravity of a black hole is so strong
that even light can't escape.

866
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:44,038
I'm sure it can't.

867
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:45,238
Monkey!

868
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:47,505
A baby monkey. It's so cute!

869
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:48,405
-Really?
-Did you see?

870
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:49,605
A baby monkey. Go outside.

871
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,505
-Jeong-heon.
-The black hole doesn't matter.

872
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:53,471
-Jeong-heon?
-The baby is this big.

873
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:54,771
Did you miss it again?

874
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:57,204
-Gosh, he gets nothing.
-Jeong-heon, the monkey.

875
00:34:57,271 --> 00:35:00,171
-Jeong-heon.
-You got it, right? Isn't the baby pretty?

876
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:02,671
-Right?
-Your senior is filming it instead.

877
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:05,205
-What are you doing?
-The baby is only this big.

878
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,805
THE BABY ON THE ROOF

879
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,138
Anyway, it's so strong
that even light can't escape.

880
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:14,938
But around the black hole,
there is an invisible boundary.

881
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:15,971
Yes, that's right.

882
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:18,138
-What do you call it?
-Kyuhyun.

883
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:19,805
-Kyuhyun?
-A white hole?

884
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:21,505
WHITE HOLE

885
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:22,471
-Incorrect.
-I know.

886
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:23,471
Yes?

887
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:25,238
Armageddon.

888
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:26,505
MADNESS IN HIS EYES

889
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:28,505
-Incorrect.
-What is it?

890
00:35:28,571 --> 00:35:29,905
As we rode the bus here,

891
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:31,571
-we went like, "Gosh."
-We did.

892
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:33,471
-I know!
-Yes?

893
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:35,271
The horizon.

894
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:36,271
HORIZON

895
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:37,605
-That's not it.
-Incorrect!

896
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:38,505
Horiz…

897
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:40,838
Horiz… Ho…

898
00:35:42,305 --> 00:35:43,471
-All right. Yes?
-I know!

899
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:44,771
An event horizon?

900
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:47,705
-Correct!
-What?

901
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,471
What kind of… I said…

902
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:53,371
Well, it's a horizon anyway!

903
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:55,671
-No, this is totally different.
-Is it?

904
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,271
Younha's song, "Event Horizon."

905
00:35:57,338 --> 00:35:59,405
-Is that what it means?
-Yes.

906
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:00,305
UNDERSTOOD THE ARTIST'S INTENT

907
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:01,971
-I thought he was kidding
-I never knew.

908
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:03,605
-when he said event horizon.
-That's funny.

909
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:05,138
-What's this?
-My goodness.

910
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,871
KYUHYUN GETS THE CHICKEN

911
00:36:06,938 --> 00:36:08,171
-This is…
-We can't eat?

912
00:36:08,238 --> 00:36:09,438
That's the old way.

913
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:10,338
SURPRISED

914
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:11,538
-What?
-The monkey came down!

915
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:14,605
-It came down!
-What's it doing there?

916
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:15,638
It climbed down the rope.

917
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:18,371
Sorry, but if I come down like that,
can I have a piece of chicken?

918
00:36:18,438 --> 00:36:19,938
I'll go up there.

919
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:20,838
HUNGRIER THAN HE IS FASCINATED

920
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:22,271
-Try it!
-Just like that.

921
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:24,338
-It rappelled down.
-Right.

922
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:26,138
-What was that?
-It's fascinating.

923
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:29,271
THE NAIROBI MONKEY KNOWS ITS CAMERA ANGLES

924
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:30,505
Chili might go well with it.

925
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:31,871
Is it dry? It has to be moist.

926
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:33,505
-The fat has dripped away.
-Yes.

927
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:35,471
-It's smoked chicken.
-Right.

928
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:36,371
AMAZED

929
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:37,738
-It's good, right?
-What?

930
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:41,105
-How is it?
-First, it has such a pleasant aroma.

931
00:36:41,571 --> 00:36:43,405
The juice spreads in your mouth.

932
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:45,005
It totally does. It's so good.

933
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:47,305
If you had your phone,
you could've taken a photo.

934
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,238
He should've taken one before eating.

935
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:50,571
THIS GUY KEEPS REMINDING ME

936
00:36:51,238 --> 00:36:52,238
The next meat is here.

937
00:36:52,305 --> 00:36:53,205
THE NEXT NYAMA CHOMA IS SERVED

938
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:54,905
-Ribs.
-Salt and pepper…

939
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:56,605
-Pork ribs.
-They're pork ribs.

940
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:57,838
Wow, the smell…

941
00:36:57,905 --> 00:37:00,971
PORK RIBS

942
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:03,538
-I don't have to stay in place, right?
-Why?

943
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:05,938
-Are you going to pass gas?
-No.

944
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:08,071
-Why?
-I'm going to listen here.

945
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:09,038
What are you saying?

946
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:09,938
All right.

947
00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:13,271
-Mackerel, which we all love.
-Yes, a blue-backed fish.

948
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:15,438
-A baby mackerel is called a tinker.
-Right.

949
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:16,905
-Really?
-Yes.

950
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:18,971
-I had no idea.
-What?

951
00:37:19,038 --> 00:37:20,638
-Did you not know?
-I didn't.

952
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,271
-A tinker?
-I'd never have guessed.

953
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:24,471
-I thought that was a bird.
-Me too.

954
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:26,305
We have to name a baby?

955
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,705
A baby mackerel is called a tinker.

956
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:31,038
Then what is a baby pheasant called?

957
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:33,405
I know!

958
00:37:33,471 --> 00:37:35,771
-A hen.
-That's just the female.

959
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:36,938
Incorrect.

960
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:40,438
Wait a minute.
We've talked about pheasants a lot.

961
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:43,971
Is it three syllables? Or was it two?

962
00:37:44,038 --> 00:37:45,205
FISHING FOR HINTS

963
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:47,605
A min… Midal?

964
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:49,038
-I know.
-Yes?

965
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:49,971
KYUHYUN'S CHANCE

966
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:51,805
A peasant?

967
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:52,738
PEASANT

968
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:53,971
A peasant?

969
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,871
-What's he doing?
-A peasant?

970
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:57,905
-Not even close.
-It sounds similar.

971
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:00,238
Did you just take
a letter out of the word pheasant?

972
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:02,838
-A baby pheasant.
-Peasant.

973
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:06,371
-A baby mackerel is a tinker.
-Okay.

974
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:07,971
-If it's a pheasant,
-Is it similar?

975
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:10,405
think of a similar word.

976
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:13,138
Mackerel and tinker
already sound different.

977
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,905
-It's not even similar. I know.
-Yes?

978
00:38:15,971 --> 00:38:16,971
A tinker.

979
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:18,838
-That's not it.
-No.

980
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:21,271
-That's a baby mackerel.
-That's a mackerel.

981
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,871
But it must be similar.

982
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:24,805
Is it like a pinker or something?

983
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:26,705
-What?
-A pink…

984
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:27,971
Pinky?

985
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:29,205
What are you saying?

986
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:30,838
-I know.
-Yes?

987
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:32,571
-Blinker.
-Blinker? Incorrect.

988
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:33,671
-I know.
-Yes?

989
00:38:33,738 --> 00:38:35,338
-Foot Locker?
-Foot Locker.

990
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:36,605
FOOT LOCKER?

991
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:37,505
That's a brand name.

992
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:41,405
Why is he so funny today?
He lost his phone and his mind.

993
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:42,538
Su-geun!

994
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:43,638
That's incorrect.

995
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:44,905
-Su-geun.
-Su-geun.

996
00:38:44,971 --> 00:38:46,738
No one has said it yet, right?

997
00:38:46,805 --> 00:38:48,638
-Actually, someone mentioned it.
-Really?

998
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:49,538
A chick.

999
00:38:49,605 --> 00:38:50,638
CHICK

1000
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:51,805
-Correct!
-Yes!

1001
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:54,405
-A chick?
-A chick?

1002
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:56,205
A CHICK AS IN A BABY BIRD

1003
00:38:56,271 --> 00:38:57,405
-That was hard.
-It's warm.

1004
00:38:57,471 --> 00:38:58,871
Eat it while it's warm.

1005
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:00,038
I remembered it was just a chick.

1006
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:00,938
SU-GEUN GETS PORK RIBS

1007
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,471
I've been saving my beer
so I could have it with food.

1008
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:07,671
The chili sauce is like mustard.

1009
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:09,505
I'll try it.

1010
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:10,638
-Why?
-What?

1011
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:12,005
It's like jangjorim.

1012
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:15,171
It's unbelievably tender.
Do they add something special?

1013
00:39:15,238 --> 00:39:16,171
RIGHT!

1014
00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:17,071
HE ALMOST FORGOT

1015
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:18,005
The beer!

1016
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:19,338
What was that?

1017
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:22,071
-He's the winner right here.
-The beer is the best.

1018
00:39:22,138 --> 00:39:24,838
He won the beer. That was a good move.

1019
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:27,905
I don't care
if this gives me gout or hell.

1020
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:30,371
THIS IS WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT

1021
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:31,971
We could've won in rock-paper-scissors.

1022
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,238
-Here's another one.
-Should we put it here?

1023
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,638
What's that?

1024
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:40,705
CROCODILE

1025
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:42,905
I totally lost my motivation.

1026
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:44,038
I'm curious, though.

1027
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:47,838
-People say it tastes like chicken.
-It's really tender like chicken.

1028
00:39:47,905 --> 00:39:49,405
-I want to try it.
-Never.

1029
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:51,071
-This…
-But Ji-won…

1030
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,571
We'll get lots of weird guesses.

1031
00:39:52,638 --> 00:39:54,705
-A French proverb--
-Yes, there was.

1032
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:55,605
I…

1033
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:57,838
What? I haven't even said it.

1034
00:39:57,905 --> 00:39:58,971
-Okay.
-Try it.

1035
00:39:59,038 --> 00:40:00,005
-I know.
-What is it?

1036
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:01,205
A time between dog and wolf.

1037
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:02,538
What are you talking about?

1038
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:04,271
-What…
-I think that was a saying.

1039
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:09,071
A French proverb says
kissing a man without this

1040
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:10,805
is like a meal without cheese.

1041
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:12,138
-Man, this is hard.
-I know!

1042
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,205
Yes?

1043
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:18,171
-What?
-What's with your hand?

1044
00:40:18,238 --> 00:40:20,171
The precious…

1045
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:21,738
OMITTING THE REST

1046
00:40:21,805 --> 00:40:24,405
-Never mind.
-What are you saying, you crazy bastard?

1047
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:26,738
-This--
-Oh, I know!

1048
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:27,771
-Yes?
-Tongue.

1049
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:30,038
IDEA BASED ON THE ESSENCE OF KISSING

1050
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:30,938
Incorrect.

1051
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:32,805
Su-geun. Should I go for it?

1052
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:37,105
-You can't kiss a man without manners.
-Yes?

1053
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:38,238
SURE THING

1054
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:39,271
Incorrect.

1055
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:42,671
-I guess not.
-It is a part of the body.

1056
00:40:42,738 --> 00:40:44,905
-It has to be the tongue.
-I think I've heard of this.

1057
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:46,271
-Su-geun!
-Su-geun.

1058
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:49,871
A man without chest hair.
He doesn't deserve to kiss anyone.

1059
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:52,805
I've heard that French men
often have hairy chests.

1060
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,405
-It's close, but incorrect!
-I'm close?

1061
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:57,105
A man without a happy trail?

1062
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:58,271
Don't go there!

1063
00:40:58,338 --> 00:40:59,638
-I know.
-Yes?

1064
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:00,838
A mustache.

1065
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:02,571
Correct!

1066
00:41:02,638 --> 00:41:03,705
CONGRATULATIONS, JI-WON GETS CROCODILE

1067
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:04,605
It was hair.

1068
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,205
You have to eat the crocodile in the end.

1069
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:10,138
-Fine, I'll try it.
-You can give it to someone.

1070
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,038
You have to chew it.

1071
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:15,571
It doesn't smell.
Just remember it's a crocodile.

1072
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:20,671
I knew you'd say it was good.

1073
00:41:20,738 --> 00:41:24,405
It has a texture like lamb, you know?

1074
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:26,605
That's not it.

1075
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:28,771
-Describe the taste. Is it good or not?
-How is it?

1076
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:29,871
It tastes like chicken.

1077
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:31,571
-Does it really?
-Yes.

1078
00:41:31,638 --> 00:41:33,405
-Really?
-That's what I've heard.

1079
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:37,638
-The taste doesn't put me off.
-Oh, that's good.

1080
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:43,405
I'm a man who has tried crocodile meat.

1081
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:45,671
Haven't you tried crocodile meat in Kenya?

1082
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:46,838
There's a Kenyan proverb.

1083
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,738
Don't kiss a man
who hasn't had crocodile meat.

1084
00:41:49,805 --> 00:41:52,138
Did you come to Kenya
to have just chicken?

1085
00:41:52,205 --> 00:41:53,305
Yeah, sorry.

1086
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:55,805
-Seriously, man.
-I do want to try it once.

1087
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:57,605
-I heard it was chewy.
-Juicy and chewy.

1088
00:41:57,671 --> 00:41:58,905
What's this?

1089
00:41:59,538 --> 00:42:00,938
-This is the real deal.
-What is it?

1090
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:07,338
GRILLED WHOLE OVER CHARCOAL
AND CARVED AT THE TABLE

1091
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:10,038
BEEF ROUND STEAK

1092
00:42:10,105 --> 00:42:14,571
-Okay, this is a beef round steak.
-The rear end.

1093
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:16,105
Mommy

1094
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:18,671
-My bottom is on fire
-Don't sing that song.

1095
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:20,105
Is it okay now?

1096
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,738
We have two singers here.

1097
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:22,638
THE BEEF ROUND ROUND

1098
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:25,305
-Mencius, as in Confucius and Mencius.
-Yes, Mencius.

1099
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:27,605
This is a word from his book.

1100
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:32,438
This word means,
"Something similar but not."

1101
00:42:32,505 --> 00:42:33,605
Su-geun!

1102
00:42:33,671 --> 00:42:34,605
Three syllables.

1103
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:35,505
Then I'm wrong.

1104
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:37,205
-This word…
-I was thinking, "Maybe so."

1105
00:42:39,005 --> 00:42:40,771
-Maybe so…
-I know!

1106
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:42,005
Confusing?

1107
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:43,405
Confusing? Incorrect.

1108
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:44,338
I know.

1109
00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:45,371
Yes?

1110
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,271
-Iffy.
-Iffy?

1111
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:49,938
-Incorrect.
-It's kind of iffy.

1112
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:51,305
-It's similar.
-It is.

1113
00:42:51,371 --> 00:42:52,305
It's similar?

1114
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:54,405
-"Is that it?"
-Exactly.

1115
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,805
"No, that's not it."

1116
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,805
-"That's…"
-It's similar.

1117
00:42:56,871 --> 00:42:58,138
DISAPPOINTED

1118
00:42:59,238 --> 00:43:01,305
Is it like cruddy?

1119
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,838
-My gosh, this is driving me crazy.
-What is it?

1120
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:04,871
NO CLUE EVEN WITH THE HINT

1121
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:06,705
-Three syllables.
-Can we have one letter?

1122
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:07,605
What do you think?

1123
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:09,605
-The Chinese character for "Not."
-What?

1124
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:10,905
The Chinese character for "Not."

1125
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,738
-I know.
-Yes?

1126
00:43:12,805 --> 00:43:13,738
Yaburi?

1127
00:43:14,405 --> 00:43:15,805
YABURI: SLANG MEANING A LIE
LET'S USE STANDARD KOREAN

1128
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:18,771
-Incorrect!
-You were so sure you had it right.

1129
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:19,905
-You're great.
-That was hilarious.

1130
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:22,071
Isn't bu the Chinese character for "Not"?

1131
00:43:22,138 --> 00:43:23,105
Yaburi…

1132
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:25,171
-For "Not," it would be…
-Or is it bi?

1133
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:26,371
Bi as in "Not"?

1134
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,938
Bi!

1135
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,205
Bi, meaning "Not."

1136
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:30,505
Bismuri? Bi.

1137
00:43:30,571 --> 00:43:31,738
-Bi.
-"Bismuri"?

1138
00:43:31,805 --> 00:43:33,005
Three syllables?

1139
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:34,738
-Kkaribi?
-Akkabi.

1140
00:43:34,805 --> 00:43:36,938
-Nakkabi?
-Akkabi?

1141
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:38,205
What did you say?

1142
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:39,205
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1143
00:43:39,271 --> 00:43:40,305
-It's similar…
-May"bi" so?

1144
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:41,571
He looks similar.

1145
00:43:41,638 --> 00:43:43,338
-Is that?
-Hey, that's…

1146
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:44,471
RANDOMLY STARTS A SKIT

1147
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,005
-Isn't that Kyuhyun?
-That bi…

1148
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:47,638
Kka… Ssaribi? Kkaribi?

1149
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:49,438
-Kkaribi?
-Nurikkiribi?

1150
00:43:49,938 --> 00:43:51,805
-Kkaribi?
-Akkabi?

1151
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:53,638
THROWING ANY WORD WITH BI

1152
00:43:53,705 --> 00:43:55,105
Which bi word haven't I tried yet?

1153
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:57,205
-Yabsabi?
-That's not it.

1154
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:58,305
Wait, what?

1155
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:00,338
-I know!
-Gosh, you scared me.

1156
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:01,671
Saibi.

1157
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:02,805
Correct!

1158
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:03,838
KYUHYUN GETS THE BEEF ROUND STEAK

1159
00:44:03,905 --> 00:44:05,838
I wasn't even close.

1160
00:44:05,905 --> 00:44:07,405
Saibi?

1161
00:44:07,471 --> 00:44:08,638
Is that a Chinese word?

1162
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:10,438
-Take all of this.
-Go on.

1163
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:12,738
WHAT DOES SAIBI MEAN?
TRADITIONAL IDIOM MEANING "IN NAME ONLY"

1164
00:44:12,805 --> 00:44:15,305
He's taking the beef and chicken.

1165
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:17,605
That's insane. That's the best part.

1166
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:19,138
And eat it with barbecue sauce?

1167
00:44:19,205 --> 00:44:20,171
NOM

1168
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:22,605
I bet it's good. Is it nice and salty?

1169
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:25,138
-It's good, isn't it?
-It's still hot.

1170
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,638
It's perfectly seasoned.

1171
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,438
-That's why.
-I'm sure.

1172
00:44:28,905 --> 00:44:31,405
-Asante sana.
-You know, we have to eat while it's hot.

1173
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:33,538
So, how about we answer
the questions first?

1174
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:34,971
Should we?

1175
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:36,971
THE RANDOM MEAT ROUND

1176
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:38,938
BUT FOR 2 POINTS

1177
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:41,538
Eat it hot off the plate.
Here's the question.

1178
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:43,871
This is a stock-related term.
Who invests in stocks?

1179
00:44:43,938 --> 00:44:44,771
-Not me.
-I do.

1180
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:45,671
I know!

1181
00:44:45,738 --> 00:44:46,571
-What is it?
-I knew this.

1182
00:44:46,638 --> 00:44:48,005
-Day trading.
-I know!

1183
00:44:48,071 --> 00:44:49,705
I know. Retail investor.

1184
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,871
That's incorrect.

1185
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:51,938
Speed is key.

1186
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:55,905
To prevent greater losses in daily life,

1187
00:44:56,538 --> 00:45:02,505
you tolerate small losses
and stop doing certain actions.

1188
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:03,605
-What is--
-I know.

1189
00:45:03,671 --> 00:45:05,138
-Loss cut.
-Loss cut.

1190
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:06,071
Correct!

1191
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:08,538
Kyuhyun, if you get this right…

1192
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:11,271
That was good.

1193
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:12,671
-Do you want the second question?
-Yes.

1194
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:15,471
This is an easy one. Speed is key.

1195
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:18,605
So, if the stock you purchased
drops in price…

1196
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:21,005
I don't know about stocks. Not at all.

1197
00:45:21,071 --> 00:45:24,905
You buy more of that stock at a low price

1198
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:26,871
to lower your average purchase price.

1199
00:45:26,938 --> 00:45:29,071
-Yes, people do that.
-What is this called?

1200
00:45:29,138 --> 00:45:30,538
-I just say I lowered it.
-I know.

1201
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:31,805
-Yes?
-Su-geun.

1202
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:33,838
-Add to position?
-Right.

1203
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:35,271
-Incorrect.
-I know.

1204
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:38,271
-Stockpiling.
-Stockpiling? Incorrect.

1205
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:40,105
You just say you lowered the average.

1206
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,205
-I know.
-Yes?

1207
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,438
Matching the unit cost?

1208
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:43,471
Incorrect.

1209
00:45:43,538 --> 00:45:46,005
-I doubt it's a phrase.
-People use this often.

1210
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:47,405
You would've heard of it.

1211
00:45:47,471 --> 00:45:49,105
-Prices dropped.
-Unit purchase…

1212
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:51,471
Unit per… Unit buying?

1213
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:54,938
So, I bought stocks
for 100,000 won per share.

1214
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:57,338
Let's say, I notice
the price dropped to 80,000 won.

1215
00:45:57,405 --> 00:45:59,971
Then, I shouldn't buy more
since the price dropped,

1216
00:46:00,038 --> 00:46:01,305
but I buy more.

1217
00:46:01,371 --> 00:46:02,571
To lower your average.

1218
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:04,771
What do you call that?

1219
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:06,171
-I know.
-Yes?

1220
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,271
-An adventure.
-What?

1221
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:10,305
An adventure.

1222
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:11,871
AN ADVENTUROUS ANSWER

1223
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:12,805
Incorrect.

1224
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,171
-Well, it is an adventurous move.
-It is.

1225
00:46:15,238 --> 00:46:18,471
For example, when we drink hard liquor,

1226
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:19,638
it's way too strong.

1227
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:21,271
You lower it by mixing. Dilute.

1228
00:46:21,338 --> 00:46:23,005
-I know!
-Yes?

1229
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,405
-Dilute.
-Dilute? Incorrect.

1230
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:29,038
-Wari.
-Wari? Incorrect.

1231
00:46:29,105 --> 00:46:30,871
-What's that?
-Mizuwari.

1232

MIZUWARI: A JAPANESE WORD
FOR MIXING ALCOHOL WITH WATER

1233
00:46:33,205 --> 00:46:34,071
I don't know.

1234
00:46:35,038 --> 00:46:35,905
JI-WON'S CHANCE

1235
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:37,338
-I know.
-You got one?

1236
00:46:37,805 --> 00:46:40,338
-Mix one up?
-Mix one up?

1237
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:41,338
It's close!

1238
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:43,138
-Incorrect! It's similar.
-Close?

1239
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:45,371
Your iced Americano is bitter.

1240
00:46:45,438 --> 00:46:46,371
-Bitter.
-Bitter?

1241
00:46:46,438 --> 00:46:47,505
Come on!

1242
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,405
I know!

1243
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:50,305
-Average down!
-Oh, he's right.

1244
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:51,438
Correct!

1245
00:46:52,805 --> 00:46:54,038
Average down, like water down.

1246
00:46:54,538 --> 00:46:57,671
I had to rack my brain
to get that question right.

1247
00:46:57,738 --> 00:46:59,105
It was average down.

1248
00:46:59,171 --> 00:47:00,638
-Impressive.
-"Mix one up."

1249
00:47:01,105 --> 00:47:02,405
Was this an official term?

1250
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:04,371
-I thought it was a casual term.
-Same.

1251
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:05,771
Gosh, this was…

1252
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:06,738
RANDOM MEAT ROUND 1
THIRD QUESTION

1253
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:08,038
Okay, a trivia question.

1254
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:14,038
In the US, there is a former president

1255
00:47:15,505 --> 00:47:17,371
who has a Kenyan father and grandfather.

1256
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:18,338
What?

1257
00:47:18,405 --> 00:47:20,238
His father was a Kenyan economist,
and his grandfather--

1258
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,371
I know.

1259
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,238
-Yes?
-Barack Obama.

1260
00:47:24,005 --> 00:47:24,971
Correct!

1261
00:47:25,038 --> 00:47:26,005
KYUHYUN WINS

1262
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:28,971
-So, you each have a point.
-No, I got two questions right.

1263
00:47:29,038 --> 00:47:30,105
What did you get right?

1264
00:47:30,171 --> 00:47:32,071
-Saibi.
-That's right, you did.

1265
00:47:32,138 --> 00:47:33,371
Wasn't that for the last dish?

1266
00:47:33,438 --> 00:47:34,405
What's this?

1267
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:35,505
-You can eat.
-Go on.

1268
00:47:35,571 --> 00:47:36,938
They brought it early.

1269
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:38,805
What is this?

1270
00:47:38,871 --> 00:47:40,171
-What is it?
-I don't know.

1271
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:46,271
-Ox… Damn it.
-So, they are ox balls.

1272
00:47:46,338 --> 00:47:47,905
They're actually ox balls.

1273
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:49,071
HE GETS COW PARTS

1274
00:47:49,138 --> 00:47:51,305
Hey, eat it while it's still warm!

1275
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:53,738
STEAMY

1276
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,405
I'm sure Kyuhyun got it right.

1277
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:57,705
-That's right.
-You know what's so funny?

1278
00:47:57,771 --> 00:47:59,538
When he asked what the next dish was,

1279
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:02,571
I said, "Balls, probably,"
and they really are balls.

1280
00:48:02,638 --> 00:48:04,405
-Probably zebra balls.
-This won't do.

1281
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:05,938
What if it's zebra ball meat?

1282
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:07,605
INCREDIBLE FORESIGHT

1283
00:48:07,671 --> 00:48:09,138
He answered a question that suited him.

1284
00:48:09,205 --> 00:48:11,005
You can't get ox balls anywhere.

1285
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:11,905
-Right.
-Hurry up.

1286
00:48:11,971 --> 00:48:12,971
SCREAMING

1287
00:48:13,038 --> 00:48:14,038
Smell it!

1288
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:15,471
Come on, just smell it.

1289
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:17,171
SHARING THE PAIN

1290
00:48:17,238 --> 00:48:19,905
This smells okay. Pig balls really stink.

1291
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:21,305
-This stinks too.
-Like skates?

1292
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:22,738
-No, I…
-Smell it.

1293
00:48:22,805 --> 00:48:24,605
-Let's see.
-I enjoy grilled pig balls.

1294
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:26,271
What is an ox, by the way?

1295
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:27,671
-It's kind of like…
-A bull?

1296
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,305
-Yeah, a bull.
-A bull.

1297
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:32,571
Well, in Korea,
it would be like eating skate.

1298
00:48:32,638 --> 00:48:33,871
It's like the skate of meat.

1299
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:38,105
-Just eat it.
-You just have to chow them down.

1300
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:39,871
Then, the rest…

1301
00:48:39,938 --> 00:48:41,871
They're tasty and chewy.

1302
00:48:41,938 --> 00:48:43,871
-Right?
-The texture is…

1303
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:46,038
It feels like I'm eating…

1304
00:48:46,105 --> 00:48:49,071
It's kind of like salted pollack roe.

1305
00:48:49,138 --> 00:48:50,138
It's sucky.

1306
00:48:50,205 --> 00:48:51,438
I mean…

1307
00:48:51,505 --> 00:48:53,171
-Salty and funky.
-Yes.

1308
00:48:53,238 --> 00:48:54,071
-It's salty.
-He ate it.

1309
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:55,805
I would've enjoyed it if I didn't know.

1310
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,338
DIRECTOR NAH TRIES IT

1311
00:48:58,405 --> 00:48:59,438
How is it?

1312
00:48:59,505 --> 00:49:02,405
Isn't it kind of salty and funky?

1313
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:04,238
It tastes like seafood.

1314
00:49:04,305 --> 00:49:06,005
It tastes like seafood?

1315
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:07,905
SU-GEUN WORKS UP HIS COURAGE TO TRY

1316
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:09,771
It would be good with some bread.

1317
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:11,971
Kind of salty, right? You get what I mean?

1318
00:49:12,038 --> 00:49:13,105
NODS

1319
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:14,971
-Dried seafood.
-Right, dried.

1320
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:16,638
What will come after testicles?

1321
00:49:17,305 --> 00:49:19,971
Here we go. This one is a great question.

1322
00:49:20,038 --> 00:49:22,405
-Netflix feels like an educational show.
-All right.

1323
00:49:22,971 --> 00:49:26,838
In the past, the Maasai tribe
attempted this act

1324
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:29,471
to distinguish brave warriors

1325
00:49:29,538 --> 00:49:31,905
-in traditional coming-of-age ceremonies.
-Su-geun!

1326
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:35,471
They jump down from about 11 meters high.
With no equipment.

1327
00:49:35,538 --> 00:49:36,438
Along those lines,

1328
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:37,671
-Right?
-but incorrect.

1329
00:49:37,738 --> 00:49:39,738
-They did this during the ceremony?
-Yes.

1330
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:42,138
They were recognized as the best warriors

1331
00:49:42,205 --> 00:49:43,838
-if they stood this challenge.
-Right.

1332
00:49:43,905 --> 00:49:45,371
I've seen something about jumping down.

1333
00:49:45,438 --> 00:49:47,638
-What was this act?
-What was it?

1334
00:49:47,705 --> 00:49:48,538
Su-geun!

1335
00:49:48,605 --> 00:49:51,771
Spitting in your father's face.

1336
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:53,271
Is that the best warrior?

1337
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:55,105
-It could be.
-Spitting?

1338
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:57,105
-I know.
-Yes?

1339
00:49:58,971 --> 00:50:02,171
Get bitten by a snake
and overcome the poison.

1340
00:50:02,671 --> 00:50:03,671
If you die,

1341
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:05,371
-you die.
-The end?

1342
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:08,405
If you live, you're a warrior.

1343
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:10,071
Wouldn't most people die, though?

1344
00:50:10,138 --> 00:50:11,938
Incorrect. It's not a snake.

1345
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:14,805
-What is it?
-Well, I know what it was in Sparta.

1346
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:17,538
-You have to survive in a wolf's den.
-You have to survive.

1347
00:50:17,605 --> 00:50:18,771
It's kind of like that.

1348
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:20,238
Like surviving in a wolf's den,

1349
00:50:20,305 --> 00:50:23,705
-the king of the African plains is--
-I know!

1350
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,205
Win a fight against a lion.

1351
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:28,471
-Win against a lion?
-That's impossible.

1352
00:50:28,538 --> 00:50:31,338
Try becoming a warrior
in the Maasai tribe.

1353
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:34,271
I'm sure it's not about fighting.

1354
00:50:34,338 --> 00:50:35,771
Oh, very keen.

1355
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:37,738
-In the wild jungle,
-Yes?

1356
00:50:37,805 --> 00:50:41,571
you must survive for a night on your own
and return the next day.

1357
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,438
Like 2 Days 1 Night?

1358
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:44,538
-One Night!
-Two Days.

1359
00:50:45,338 --> 00:50:47,005
-That's funny.
-"Let's survive here!"

1360
00:50:47,071 --> 00:50:48,638
-That's not it. I know.
-Yes?

1361
00:50:48,705 --> 00:50:49,838
JI-WON'S CHANCE

1362
00:50:49,905 --> 00:50:52,371
You see these things in lots of games.

1363
00:50:52,438 --> 00:50:56,038
You find your own pet eagle.

1364
00:50:56,105 --> 00:50:57,438
Come on, man.

1365
00:50:57,505 --> 00:50:59,305
-A hunting partner.
-That's just in movies.

1366
00:50:59,371 --> 00:51:00,471
-Is it?
-Yes.

1367
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:03,538
-Just bringing it…
-Guys, you have the right approach.

1368
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:06,471
If you do this act
against the top predator…

1369
00:51:06,538 --> 00:51:07,805
I GET IT

1370
00:51:07,871 --> 00:51:09,238
Oh, I know!

1371
00:51:09,305 --> 00:51:10,938
Bringing a lion's whisker.

1372
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:13,505
It's along those lines. Incorrect.

1373
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:15,638
Is that not it?

1374
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:16,971
-I know.
-Yes?

1375
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:19,071
Belling a lion?

1376
00:51:19,138 --> 00:51:21,705
Belling a lion?

1377
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:22,805
For a chief…

1378
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,038
You're incorrect.

1379
00:51:24,671 --> 00:51:28,371
So, like what you said earlier
about plucking a lion's whisker,

1380
00:51:28,438 --> 00:51:30,971
you can do this quickly and run back.

1381
00:51:31,038 --> 00:51:32,971
-A lion.
-It can't be a butt jab.

1382
00:51:33,571 --> 00:51:34,438
HUMILIATING A LION

1383
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:35,838
Do you have to pee on a lion?

1384
00:51:35,905 --> 00:51:37,071
Really?

1385
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:38,405
It must be grabbing its tail.

1386
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:39,738
Su-geun. I'm right, aren't I?

1387
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,971
Grabbing a living lion's tail.

1388
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:45,105
-Correct!
-That's it.

1389
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:47,605
I knew it. Grabbing its tail.

1390
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,905
-Wouldn't you die?
-I know.

1391
00:51:48,971 --> 00:51:50,538
-It would be so mad.
-Anyway…

1392
00:51:50,605 --> 00:51:52,338
You mean a lion can't tell
someone's approaching?

1393
00:51:52,405 --> 00:51:54,005
Well, like… I guess not.

1394
00:51:54,071 --> 00:51:56,005
-Sure.
-That's none of my business.

1395
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,038
-I got it right.
-That's so dangerous.

1396
00:51:58,105 --> 00:51:59,505
It means you should come back dead.

1397
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:00,538
"Come back dead"?

1398
00:52:00,605 --> 00:52:01,971
We never know. Should we do this?

1399
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:03,038
RANDOM MEAT ROUND 2
SECOND QUESTION

1400
00:52:03,105 --> 00:52:05,071
-It's about Kenya.
-Ji-won might know.

1401
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:07,138
-There's the food.
-Did Ji-won get any right?

1402
00:52:07,205 --> 00:52:09,138
-No, he has zero points.
-It might be okay.

1403
00:52:09,205 --> 00:52:11,471
He might not know, though.
I'll just try it.

1404
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:12,938
I'll give Ji-won a chance.

1405
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,205
All right.

1406
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:16,271
It'd be more annoying if I got it wrong.

1407
00:52:16,338 --> 00:52:17,171
AN OMINOUS FEELING

1408
00:52:17,238 --> 00:52:18,071
Double whammy.

1409
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,171
Will you be able to answer this correctly?

1410
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:21,538
It's African trivia.

1411
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,105
How would I know African trivia?

1412
00:52:24,171 --> 00:52:30,538
In Africa, which animal has killed
the most people?

1413
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,438
-I know.
-It must be too easy.

1414
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:33,871
-I know this too.
-Crocodiles.

1415
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:35,505
-He doesn't know.
-Crocodiles.

1416
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:37,005
-Su-geun.
-Incorrect!

1417
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,238
-Su-geun.
-That's wrong?

1418
00:52:38,305 --> 00:52:39,305
Hippos.

1419
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:43,238
-Correct!
-You said hippos were the scariest.

1420
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:45,405
-You always went on about hippos.
-Hippos.

1421
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:46,771
-You always said that.
-I did?

1422
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:48,271
I said giraffes.

1423
00:52:48,338 --> 00:52:49,605
-You said hippos.
-You did not!

1424
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:50,838
You said they were the scariest.

1425
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:52,338
Do you know why I said this?

1426
00:52:52,405 --> 00:52:54,238
I remembered what you said before.

1427
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:56,205
Do you know
why we said you'd get this right?

1428
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:58,171
-You always talked about hippos.
-You said so.

1429
00:52:58,238 --> 00:53:00,071
Ji-won has been saying this for years.

1430
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:02,771
-Seriously.
-The scariest animal on Earth is hippos.

1431
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:04,338
Hippos are ranked second.

1432
00:53:04,405 --> 00:53:05,871
They're second? What's first?

1433
00:53:05,938 --> 00:53:07,871
-They're first!
-They are?

1434
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:09,805
-Hippos are first!
-Hippos?

1435
00:53:09,871 --> 00:53:11,571
HE SAID IT HIMSELF

1436
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:13,405
Which animal's testicles are next?

1437
00:53:13,471 --> 00:53:14,671
I deserve to eat this.

1438
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:16,271
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

1439
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:17,438
We've already had testicles.

1440
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:19,005
-What can't we eat?
-Exactly.

1441
00:53:19,471 --> 00:53:22,638
It doesn't require carving,
so this might also be…

1442
00:53:22,705 --> 00:53:23,738
-What is this?
-They're ribs.

1443
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:25,205
-They're ribs.
-Lamb ribs.

1444
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:29,705
But why?

1445
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:32,071
Why serve beef ribs after testicles?

1446
00:53:32,138 --> 00:53:34,371
BEEF RIBS

1447
00:53:34,438 --> 00:53:35,905
-Gosh, this is…
-The ribs…

1448
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:38,538
I have to eat this
to forget the one before.

1449
00:53:39,538 --> 00:53:41,005
-Kyuhyun…
-My gosh.

1450
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:42,638
-It came right off.
-Goodness.

1451
00:53:42,705 --> 00:53:44,071
They're like galbijjim.

1452
00:53:45,205 --> 00:53:46,105
It's…

1453
00:53:46,938 --> 00:53:48,205
CHOKING UP

1454
00:53:48,771 --> 00:53:50,671
-What's so…
-Why? Is it hot?

1455
00:53:50,738 --> 00:53:53,171
-It's so good.
-Wow, they seem so tender.

1456
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:54,405
So tender. Try it.

1457
00:53:54,471 --> 00:53:56,005
The bone slipped right out.

1458
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:57,205
The grease is all gone.

1459
00:53:57,271 --> 00:53:59,871
-Is it tender or what?
-It's soft like jangjorim.

1460
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:02,071
-That sound delicious.
-Yes, but…

1461
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,538
JANGJORIM SOUNDS DELICIOUS

1462
00:54:03,605 --> 00:54:05,405
Should I give everyone a taste?

1463
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:06,605
You should each try this.

1464
00:54:06,671 --> 00:54:08,971
GENEROUS SU-GEUN SHARES THE BEEF RIBS

1465
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:11,138
-Can I have this?
-You can each have one.

1466
00:54:11,205 --> 00:54:13,038
-Let's try it.
-Try it with the sauce.

1467
00:54:13,505 --> 00:54:14,771
The meat is thick.

1468
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,038
THEY TASTE THE BEEF RIBS THANKS TO SU-GEUN

1469
00:54:17,471 --> 00:54:18,738
It slips right off.

1470
00:54:19,405 --> 00:54:20,605
These ribs are good.

1471
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,605
-They're so tender.
-They are, right?

1472
00:54:22,671 --> 00:54:23,738
This is my favorite.

1473
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:25,705
Right? Isn't it good?

1474
00:54:26,205 --> 00:54:27,371
I told you.

1475
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:29,971
Should we do one question

1476
00:54:30,038 --> 00:54:31,971
-for a special round?
-What is it?

1477
00:54:32,038 --> 00:54:35,805
Perhaps you guys might need it.

1478
00:54:37,971 --> 00:54:39,171
-What is it?
-Why?

1479
00:54:39,971 --> 00:54:42,105
I'll put up an unused cell phone

1480
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:44,338
-as the prize.
-That means

1481
00:54:44,405 --> 00:54:45,705
I have to win this.

1482
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:48,138
You can't use it if it's unused.

1483
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:49,738
We've activated the line.

1484
00:54:50,205 --> 00:54:52,571
It's been activated. I had an extra phone.

1485
00:54:52,638 --> 00:54:54,438
It's a number I don't use.

1486
00:54:54,505 --> 00:54:56,338
-I'm sorry, but then,
-Actually…

1487
00:54:56,405 --> 00:54:58,238
you'd never have to pay for service.

1488
00:54:58,305 --> 00:55:00,071
Woo-jung will pay for it.

1489
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:03,271
SPECIAL ROUND

1490
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:05,638
FOR A NEW CELL PHONE
WITH FREE SERVICE FOR LIFE

1491
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:07,805
-One or two questions?
-In German…

1492
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:09,071
Yes, in German.

1493
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:12,838
This means,
"someone who goes around in double."

1494
00:55:12,905 --> 00:55:16,238
Usually, others can't see this
in the same time and space,

1495
00:55:16,305 --> 00:55:19,238
but you see a vision of someone
who looks just like you.

1496
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:20,438
-What is this?
-I know.

1497
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:23,005
-An homage.
-What?

1498
00:55:24,005 --> 00:55:25,371
Well, okay. It's close.

1499
00:55:25,438 --> 00:55:26,938
-Incorrect.
-It's a movie title.

1500
00:55:27,005 --> 00:55:28,638
Hang on. Why can't I remember this?

1501
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:30,505
-Am I dumb?
-It's a movie title. Wait.

1502
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:32,105
-No, I know.
-Two of the same person.

1503
00:55:32,171 --> 00:55:33,371
-No, stop talking.
-I know.

1504
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:35,238
A clone.

1505
00:55:35,305 --> 00:55:36,238
-No!
-Incorrect.

1506
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:38,338
Wait, stop talking. Stop repeating it.

1507
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:39,238
What…

1508
00:55:39,305 --> 00:55:41,205
It would be beautiful
if Kyuhyun gets it right

1509
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:42,738
and wins the phone

1510
00:55:42,805 --> 00:55:43,938
-fair and square.
-For one question?

1511
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:46,505
-Be quiet! Why don't I know this?
-Is it a single question?

1512
00:55:46,571 --> 00:55:48,871
Why can't I remember this? Am I stupid?

1513
00:55:48,938 --> 00:55:51,671
The word that means a duplicate of myself.

1514
00:55:52,671 --> 00:55:54,838
-There's another person just like me.
-Su-geun.

1515
00:55:56,371 --> 00:55:57,338
Hurry up. Three…

1516
00:55:57,405 --> 00:55:59,171
-Rendezvous.
-That's not it!

1517
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:01,438
-No, thank goodness.
-It's kind of like that.

1518
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:03,438
-I know.
-It's not déjà vu.

1519
00:56:03,505 --> 00:56:04,905
-It's not déjà vu?
-No.

1520
00:56:05,771 --> 00:56:08,371
I was going to say that, but right then…

1521
00:56:08,438 --> 00:56:10,238
Did you have to kill the buzz?

1522
00:56:10,305 --> 00:56:11,805
I was just about to say that.

1523
00:56:12,671 --> 00:56:14,738
THE WORD THAT KYUHYUN
IS DYING TO REMEMBER IS…

1524
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:15,938
It's not déjà vu?

1525
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,471
DOPPELGÄNGER

1526
00:56:17,538 --> 00:56:19,305
SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU
AND IS ANOTHER VERSION OF YOU

1527
00:56:19,371 --> 00:56:22,071
-Kyuhyun, do you know this?
-Yes, I do.

1528
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:24,771
-It's a song title too.
-You can't meet.

1529
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:26,705
-You can't meet them.
-Right, if you do,

1530
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:28,738
-you die.
-You're not supposed to meet.

1531
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:30,771
Should I put it this way?

1532
00:56:31,238 --> 00:56:35,405
What is the German word for "double"?

1533
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:36,738
Can we phone a friend?

1534
00:56:37,471 --> 00:56:38,671
Who will you call?

1535
00:56:38,738 --> 00:56:40,538
-To soccer player Koo Ja-cheol.
-Why?

1536
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,771
-He's good at German.
-Go ahead.

1537
00:56:43,238 --> 00:56:44,705
It's at the tip of my tongue.

1538
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:47,571
That's what's so annoying to me.

1539
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:49,571
Soccer player Koo Ja-cheol.

1540
00:56:49,638 --> 00:56:51,538
CALLING

1541
00:56:52,338 --> 00:56:54,071
Hey, Su-geun, are you abroad?

1542
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:57,338
Ja-cheol, I'm in Kenya right now.
I'm shooting a show.

1543
00:56:57,405 --> 00:57:00,538
-Okay.
-Well, you speak German well.

1544
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:02,971
-Am I good at German?
-Yeah, so…

1545
00:57:03,038 --> 00:57:05,838
-Well, anyway.
-That's why I called you.

1546
00:57:06,471 --> 00:57:09,571
In German…
You know the English word "double"?

1547
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:10,905
-Like two.
-Yes.

1548
00:57:10,971 --> 00:57:12,671
What is that in German?

1549
00:57:13,238 --> 00:57:14,471
-Two of something.
-Well…

1550
00:57:15,471 --> 00:57:17,071
I think they just say zweimal.

1551
00:57:17,138 --> 00:57:18,071
No, it's not zwei.

1552
00:57:18,138 --> 00:57:20,271
Zwei just means two. Not that.

1553
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:21,738
Oh, doppel.

1554
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,738
-Oh, Su-geun!
-I know!

1555
00:57:23,805 --> 00:57:25,505
-Ji-won, what's your answer?
-Dog bull.

1556
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:26,605
What's that?

1557
00:57:26,671 --> 00:57:27,705
-I know!
-But I…

1558
00:57:27,771 --> 00:57:28,605
Doppelgänger!

1559
00:57:28,671 --> 00:57:29,871
Wait, no.

1560
00:57:29,938 --> 00:57:32,138
I said… We have to do this again.

1561
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:33,738
I was going to answer first.

1562
00:57:33,805 --> 00:57:34,905
-I was.
-What?

1563
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:37,271
-Oh, Su-geun!
-I know!

1564
00:57:37,338 --> 00:57:39,205
SU-GEUN WAS THE FASTEST IN THE FIRST PLACE

1565
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:40,571
Thanks, Ja-cheol.

1566
00:57:40,638 --> 00:57:42,438
Correct! Hey, you got it!

1567
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:44,271
Koo Ja-cheol, you're amazing.

1568
00:57:44,338 --> 00:57:45,838
Send me your address.

1569
00:57:46,438 --> 00:57:48,038
I'll send you ox testicles.

1570
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:52,238
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you!

1571
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:54,438
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks, Ja-cheol.

1572
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:57,038
-I didn't know.
-Let's forget about this question.

1573
00:57:57,105 --> 00:57:58,805
Since there was…

1574
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:00,371
Honestly, Su-geun, you didn't know.

1575
00:58:00,438 --> 00:58:01,638
-Great job.
-I knew doppelgänger.

1576
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:03,671
Good job, everyone.

1577
00:58:03,738 --> 00:58:06,371
-Because this might lead to arguments.
-Fine.

1578
00:58:06,905 --> 00:58:08,138
-Good job.
-Good job.

1579
00:58:08,205 --> 00:58:09,438
This cell phone

1580
00:58:09,505 --> 00:58:12,738
-Use it for another game.
-will pop up again randomly.

1581
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:14,838
No, no more chances.

1582
00:58:14,905 --> 00:58:15,838
What does that mean?

1583
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:18,605
Why should the prize always be
a benefit for just you?

1584
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:20,071
-What about us?
-You can choose.

1585
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:21,405
Don't you feel bad for me?

1586
00:58:21,471 --> 00:58:23,038
-Don't you feel--
-So, why did you lose it?

1587
00:58:25,238 --> 00:58:27,171
I'm going to be gloomy the whole time.

1588
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:30,905
He's threatening us.

1589
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:33,038
Since we've come all this way,

1590
00:58:33,705 --> 00:58:35,271
-it's dessert time.
-Okay.

1591
00:58:35,338 --> 00:58:36,705
You've had lunch.

1592
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:38,938
-I haven't had anything.
-So, Ji-won.

1593
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:41,171
-Kenya is--
-What lunch?

1594
00:58:41,238 --> 00:58:43,171
-You had crocodile meat.
-Didn't you eat?

1595
00:58:43,238 --> 00:58:44,805
-I didn't eat--
-You had a crocodile.

1596
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:45,838
RUSHING TO THE NEXT LOCATION

1597
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:47,871
You call that a meal?

1598
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:50,205
I'm sorry,

1599
00:58:50,271 --> 00:58:52,305
but do you have any candy, Woo-jung?

1600
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:54,871
-My breath still smells like…
-The balls…

1601
00:58:54,938 --> 00:58:56,471
We have balls in our mouths.

1602
00:58:56,538 --> 00:58:58,538
It keeps peeing from my mouth.

1603
00:58:59,171 --> 00:59:00,038
He keeps…

1604
00:59:00,105 --> 00:59:02,538
That's why I spat in the restroom earlier.

1605
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,271
STICKING TO PUBLIC HYGIENE RULES

1606
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:06,638
Does Kenya have a popular dessert?

1607
00:59:06,705 --> 00:59:08,105
-For Kenya… Ji-won.
-Isn't it coffee?

1608
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:09,905
-What is it famous for?
-What?

1609
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:11,571
Something Kenya is known for.

1610
00:59:11,638 --> 00:59:12,471
Ox balls.

1611
00:59:12,538 --> 00:59:14,005
LET'S TRY AGAIN

1612
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:16,871
-Kenya is known for coffee.
-That's right.

1613
00:59:16,938 --> 00:59:19,638
One of the finest coffees in the world.

1614
00:59:19,705 --> 00:59:22,171
-It's called Kenya AA.
-It has two As.

1615
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:27,105
KENYA AA
THE COFFEE FULL OF AFRICAN SUNSHINE

1616
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,505
AMONG THEM IS A CANDIDATE
FOR THE WORLD'S BEST

1617
00:59:31,138 --> 00:59:34,238
A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN TASTE
KENYA AA BEANS ROASTED ON SITE

1618
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:38,738
KENYA'S FIRST SPECIALTY ROASTERY CAFE

1619
00:59:39,238 --> 00:59:42,771
NAIROBI'S HOT SPOT FOR COFFEE
SPRING VALLEY COFFEE

1620
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:44,271
-This must be it.
-Is this it?

1621
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:45,171
THEY ARRIVE AT THE CAFE

1622
00:59:45,238 --> 00:59:48,271
Let's go and ask for three cups
of the most famous coffee.

1623
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:49,971
-All right.
-I want mine iced.

1624
00:59:50,605 --> 00:59:52,538
IN CHARGE OF ORDERING

1625
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:02,805
RECOMMENDATIONS:
ESPRESSO AND NURU COFFEE

1626
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:04,338
The espresso is probably strong.

1627
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:06,271
Don't they have iced coffee?

1628
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:20,705
We don't need any pastries, do we?

1629
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:22,138
-I want some.
-Aren't you hungry?

1630
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:24,138
-I want one.
-Can we get some cake?

1631
01:00:24,938 --> 01:00:26,371
This…

1632
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:33,971
THEY MANAGED TO ORDER DESSERT

1633
01:00:34,038 --> 01:00:35,438
Hey, this painting is nice.

1634
01:00:36,105 --> 01:00:37,838
-Su-geun, over here.
-Oh, here?

1635
01:00:38,371 --> 01:00:39,371
Are you here alone?

1636
01:00:39,871 --> 01:00:40,705
SURPRISED

1637
01:00:43,171 --> 01:00:45,205
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry,

1638
01:00:45,271 --> 01:00:47,071
-but did you order? You did?
-Yes.

1639
01:00:47,138 --> 01:00:50,338
The coffee you ordered will be served.
The best coffee.

1640
01:00:50,405 --> 01:00:51,705
He's about to do something weird.

1641
01:00:51,771 --> 01:00:53,605
But you know what they say. You guys,

1642
01:00:54,205 --> 01:00:56,271
even if we give you the best things,

1643
01:00:56,338 --> 01:00:58,171
but you didn't appreciate the taste…

1644
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,671
-Honestly, it would be…
-Right, meaningless.

1645
01:01:00,738 --> 01:01:04,671
So, if you guys pass a coffee smell test…

YOU GET A DIFFERENT HEALTHY DRINK

1668
01:01:51,805 --> 01:01:53,771
But he doesn't drink coffee.
What about him?

1669
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:55,938
I drink coffee for TV.

1670
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:57,671
-You do?
-Yes.

1671
01:01:58,205 --> 01:01:59,405
Strictly capitalist…

1672
01:01:59,471 --> 01:02:00,705
AROMA TEST BEGINS

1673
01:02:00,771 --> 01:02:02,371
Ji-won has allergies.

1674
01:02:02,438 --> 01:02:03,905
You have to remember this.

1675
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:06,205
LEE SU-GEUN, COFFEE ENTHUSIAST

1676
01:02:07,205 --> 01:02:08,871
Explain the aroma to us.

1677
01:02:09,505 --> 01:02:11,438
Gosh, I just want to drink this whole.

1678
01:02:11,505 --> 01:02:12,771
Is it that good?

1679
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:14,371
I can totally remember this.

1680
01:02:14,438 --> 01:02:16,238
Still, the viewers might be curious.

1681
01:02:16,305 --> 01:02:18,338
My only shortcoming is
I can't describe things.

1682
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,405
He put it in his nose.

1683
01:02:23,471 --> 01:02:25,805
-That's something you consume.
-What's wrong about it?

1684
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:27,838
-I hate it so much.
-So undignified.

1685
01:02:27,905 --> 01:02:29,505
What do you mean? What did I do?

1686
01:02:29,571 --> 01:02:32,405
-I hate it so much.
-No, I just can't smell really well.

1687
01:02:32,471 --> 01:02:34,605
-I have a sinus infection.
-I hate it.

1688
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:37,138
-So, did you smell it?
-I'm still smelling it.

1689
01:02:37,205 --> 01:02:39,038
-Just eat them.
-Eat what?

1690
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:40,005
There are several.

1691
01:02:40,071 --> 01:02:41,571
-This one is mine.
-Eat it.

1692
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:44,305
You can smell this one.

1693
01:02:44,371 --> 01:02:46,305
I hope you'll explain it properly.

1694
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:48,438
TAKES A LONG WHIFF

1695
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:49,405
EXHALES

1696
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:51,138
He's a well-known epicure.

1697
01:02:52,071 --> 01:02:53,438
A DEEP BREATH

1698
01:02:53,505 --> 01:02:55,905
DON'T BE MISTAKEN
THEY'RE JUST COFFEE BEANS

1699
01:02:56,505 --> 01:02:57,671
I'm done.

1700
01:02:57,738 --> 01:02:59,805
Please describe it for us.

1701
01:02:59,871 --> 01:03:00,771
THE EPICURE'S SMELL REVIEW

1702
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:02,271
So…

1703
01:03:02,338 --> 01:03:04,038
CHO KYUHYUN, AN EPICURE

1704
01:03:04,105 --> 01:03:05,438
So, this…

1705
01:03:06,171 --> 01:03:07,738
Do the other ones smell different?

1706
01:03:07,805 --> 01:03:08,971
-The other coffees?
-Yes.

1707
01:03:09,038 --> 01:03:11,371
The other coffees are made
with different beans.

1708
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:12,905
GAME START

1709
01:03:12,971 --> 01:03:14,438
HOWEVER

1710
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:16,038
UNLIKE THE STAFF'S EXPECTATIONS

1711
01:03:16,705 --> 01:03:18,538
EVEN SU-GEUN, THE COFFEE ENTHUSIAST

1712
01:03:19,538 --> 01:03:21,205
MR. STUFFY NOSE, WHOM THEY TRUSTED

1713
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:23,238
GUESSED CORRECTLY ON THEIR FIRST TRY

1714
01:03:23,305 --> 01:03:24,471
CRYING

1715
01:03:24,938 --> 01:03:27,638
If I had to describe it,
it's like drinking white wine.

1716
01:03:27,705 --> 01:03:29,038
THE ELDERS ENJOYED THEIR FEAST

1717
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,971
ONLY ONE PERSON REMAINS

1718
01:03:32,038 --> 01:03:33,605
-All right.
-Just stand there.

1719
01:03:33,671 --> 01:03:34,671
Stand there. Okay.

1720
01:03:34,738 --> 01:03:36,371
-Number one.
-Su-geun, mix them up.

1721
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,771
The smell is so strong.

1722
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:38,805
Where are you?

1723
01:03:38,871 --> 01:03:41,671
I don't think he'll know.
He doesn't know coffee.

1724
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:43,071
There you go.

1725
01:03:43,138 --> 01:03:44,471
-That was number one.
-Okay.

1726
01:03:44,538 --> 01:03:45,571
-Number one.
-Number one.

1727
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:46,905
MARVELING AT THE SCENT

1728
01:03:47,538 --> 01:03:49,105
COFFEE NUMBER 2 ENTERS

1729
01:03:49,571 --> 01:03:50,505
-Is it here?
-Yes.

1730
01:03:50,571 --> 01:03:52,071
This isn't it. Pass. Take it away.

1731
01:03:52,138 --> 01:03:54,138
That was my finger you were smelling.

1732
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,238
HIS SENSES CATCH THE UNPLEASANTNESS

1733
01:03:55,305 --> 01:03:57,738
Oh, that's not it. It smells burnt.

1734
01:03:57,805 --> 01:03:58,938
Number two.

1735
01:03:59,738 --> 01:04:00,705
This is number three.

1736
01:04:03,705 --> 01:04:05,071
That was a lower temperature.

1737
01:04:05,538 --> 01:04:10,505
It smells similar,
but that rich, condensed aroma is missing.

1738
01:04:10,571 --> 01:04:13,105
-Then, here's the last one. Number five.
-Okay.

1739
01:04:13,638 --> 01:04:14,938
-Is it here?
-Yes.

1740
01:04:17,871 --> 01:04:19,438
Wait a minute.

1741
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:21,038
TIME TO CHOOSE

1742
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:23,871
I'm thinking it's either one or five.

1743
01:04:26,705 --> 01:04:28,505
I'll go with number one.

1744
01:04:28,571 --> 01:04:30,505
All right. Number one.

1745
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:33,005
FINAL CHOICE, NUMBER 1

1746
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,038
Incorrect! You're wrong.

1747
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,271
-Really?
-Oh, dear.

1748
01:04:37,338 --> 01:04:38,505
Incorrect! You're wrong.

1749
01:04:38,571 --> 01:04:39,838
-Really?
-Oh, dear.

1750
01:04:39,905 --> 01:04:41,538
-Okay, you're wrong.
-This is bad.

1751
01:04:41,605 --> 01:04:42,805
COFFEE NUMBER 1
ITALY'S ILLY

1752
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:45,538
MADE APPROXIMATELY 8,507KM AWAY
FROM KENYA

1753
01:04:45,605 --> 01:04:46,571
You were wrong.

1754
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:48,605
-To those who were wrong,
-Yes?

1755
01:04:48,671 --> 01:04:50,705
you can rinse your palate thoroughly

1756
01:04:52,605 --> 01:04:55,005
with all of this hot water.

1757
01:04:56,471 --> 01:04:58,938
-You can only try again after that.
-That's too much.

1758
01:04:59,005 --> 01:05:01,338
That's too much water.
How can he drink it all?

1759
01:05:01,405 --> 01:05:02,705
That'll cook your tongue.

1760
01:05:03,405 --> 01:05:04,371
You even get dessert.

1761
01:05:04,938 --> 01:05:06,271
Hey, that's so nice.

1762
01:05:06,338 --> 01:05:08,705
-I mean, it's too much.
-But I'll get sick.

1763
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,305
Go and have some water.

1764
01:05:10,371 --> 01:05:12,571
-Go and drink that.
-But this will burn me.

1765
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:14,771
-Drink it.
-We want you to burn.

1766
01:05:18,771 --> 01:05:19,905
BENEFITS OF WARM WATER

1767
01:05:19,971 --> 01:05:21,138
ACCELERATES METABOLISM
AND BLOOD CIRCULATION

1768
01:05:21,205 --> 01:05:22,305
IMPROVES DIGESTIVE AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS

1769
01:05:22,371 --> 01:05:26,305
Anyway, Kyuhyun doesn't like coffee.
He might've done this on purpose.

1770
01:05:27,871 --> 01:05:30,271
Didn't I get what I ordered?

1771
01:05:30,338 --> 01:05:32,105
KYUHYUN STARTS ACTING ODD

1772
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:34,205
BATHING

1773
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:36,538
We'll enjoy the warm Kenya AA coffee,

1774
01:05:37,138 --> 01:05:39,771
but in Korea,
we say "iced coffee even in winter."

1775
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:41,471
How will the iced Americano taste?

1776
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:43,371
ASKING FOR TROUBLE

1777
01:05:44,738 --> 01:05:46,638
DUNKS IT AGAIN

1778
01:05:46,705 --> 01:05:50,505
-How do we describe the aroma?
-Actually, you need a bit of training.

1779
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:53,238
HE MUST'VE SUCCEEDED
IN FOOLING HIMSELF IT'S COFFEE

1780
01:05:53,305 --> 01:05:56,205
I've never tasted anything
like this iced coffee.

1781
01:05:56,671 --> 01:05:58,171
It's not dark.

1782
01:05:58,238 --> 01:06:01,138
It's smooth, but it's nutty.

1783
01:06:01,205 --> 01:06:02,905
It's not bitter either.

1784
01:06:02,971 --> 01:06:05,305
KENYA AA'S UNIQUE ACIDITY
AND BALANCED NEAT FLAVOR IS EXQUISITE

1785
01:06:05,371 --> 01:06:07,505
Starbucks coffee has a strong burnt taste.

1786
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:10,405
-Right.
-But this one has a certain tartness.

1787
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:11,905
It's a bit sour.

1788
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:13,138
Was there one from Starbucks?

1789
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:15,671
If you pick it out,
I'll give you your coffee.

1790
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:18,738
-Kyuhyun. Will you try it?
-He will try.

1791
01:06:18,805 --> 01:06:20,605
EXTRA GAME
FIND THE STARBUCKS COFFEE

1792
01:06:22,671 --> 01:06:26,971
MR. CHO EPICURE ENJOYS THE SCENTS AGAIN

1793
01:06:28,805 --> 01:06:30,038
He doesn't know.

1794
01:06:30,105 --> 01:06:31,138
TALKING BEHIND HIS BACK

1795
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:34,171
He doesn't even drink coffee.
How will he get it right?

1796
01:06:34,238 --> 01:06:36,238
Give him more water if he's wrong.

1797
01:06:36,971 --> 01:06:38,671
LAUGHS

1798
01:06:38,738 --> 01:06:41,371
Give him another glass of water.
He didn't even drink half of it.

1799
01:06:42,138 --> 01:06:44,471
If you get it wrong,
I'll fill up your glass.

1800
01:06:45,338 --> 01:06:46,371
Number one!

1801
01:06:46,438 --> 01:06:47,705
How does it smell?

1802
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:50,505
SNIFFS

1803
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:52,705
It's kind of…

1804
01:06:53,238 --> 01:06:54,238
You know…

1805
01:06:54,305 --> 01:06:55,138
SNIFFS AGAIN

1806
01:06:55,605 --> 01:06:57,338
When we go out for a barbecue,

1807
01:06:57,405 --> 01:06:59,505
-we grill and eat outdoors.
-Yes.

1808
01:06:59,571 --> 01:07:00,905
I smell that charred scent.

1809
01:07:00,971 --> 01:07:02,771
-The charred meat smell.
-Starbucks,

1810
01:07:02,838 --> 01:07:04,705
as a franchise, has a darker roast.

1811
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,638
Let's check it.

1812
01:07:06,705 --> 01:07:07,871
Coffee number one is…

1813
01:07:07,938 --> 01:07:09,205
He must be right.

1814
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:15,505
Vietnam's G7 Coffee.

1815
01:07:15,571 --> 01:07:18,071
Incorrect! Bring me your glass.

1816
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:19,338
VIETNAM'S G7

1817
01:07:19,405 --> 01:07:20,638
MADE APPROXIMATELY 7,889KM AWAY FROM KENYA

1818
01:07:20,705 --> 01:07:21,805
GOT CLOSER THAN ITALY

1819
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,805
This is so annoying.

1820
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:26,538
Coffee is all the same.

1821
01:07:26,605 --> 01:07:29,938
A REFILL FOR HIS SAME OLD WATER

1822
01:07:30,605 --> 01:07:31,771
This is fun.

1823
01:07:32,371 --> 01:07:34,705
JI-WON WANTS TO KNOW THE ANSWER

1824
01:07:34,771 --> 01:07:36,771
This smells like Starbucks to me.

1825
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:39,205
Why?

1826
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:43,638
I sometimes buy Starbucks coffee beans
to drink at home.

1827
01:07:43,705 --> 01:07:45,771
-This has lots of fat…
-If he says that,

1828
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:47,105
he'll get it wrong.

1829
01:07:47,171 --> 01:07:49,538
-Let me smell it too.
-Sure, go ahead.

1830
01:07:49,605 --> 01:07:51,005
It smells like Starbucks.

1831
01:07:52,071 --> 01:07:53,405
-Starbucks is…
-This is Starbucks.

1832
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,238
-Right?
-Yes, it's Starbucks.

1833
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:56,838
-Not this one.
-What's this?

1834
01:07:56,905 --> 01:07:57,838
DOESN'T KNOW THE ANSWER

1835
01:07:57,905 --> 01:07:59,538
-I think this is Starbucks.
-Right?

1836
01:07:59,605 --> 01:08:01,271
This is it 100 percent.

1837
01:08:01,338 --> 01:08:02,871
-If it's not…
-There is no Starbucks.

1838
01:08:02,938 --> 01:08:04,071
-We don't have it?
-No Starbucks?

1839
01:08:04,138 --> 01:08:07,038
-We don't?
-Isn't it that Spain one?

1840
01:08:07,105 --> 01:08:07,938
RUSHES TO CHECK THE ANSWER

1841
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:09,238
The one from Spain.

1842
01:08:09,305 --> 01:08:11,071
It's not here.

1843
01:08:11,138 --> 01:08:14,271
Starbucks wasn't in the options,
so why did he get penalized?

1844
01:08:14,338 --> 01:08:15,871
That water must be from Starbucks.

1845
01:08:15,938 --> 01:08:17,005
We don't have Starbucks.

1846
01:08:17,071 --> 01:08:18,738
Hey, sorry, Kyuhyun.

1847
01:08:18,805 --> 01:08:20,405
No Starbucks!

1848
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:21,971
-We don't have Starbucks.
-No Starbucks?

1849
01:08:22,038 --> 01:08:24,005
-Hey, sorry, Kyuhyun.
-No Starbucks?

1850
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:26,505
SO, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED

1851
01:08:26,971 --> 01:08:28,838
WHILE SETTING UP THE GAME

1852
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,505
Let's just do five.
It doesn't matter, right?

1853
01:08:30,571 --> 01:08:31,438
Do we need six?

1854
01:08:31,505 --> 01:08:34,005
YUNG-SUK TOOK ONE COFFEE OUT
TO MAKE IT EASIER

1855
01:08:34,871 --> 01:08:38,205
WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THE STARBUCKS ONE

1856
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,505
THAT'S HOW THE STARBUCKS GAME
WITHOUT STARBUCKS WAS BORN

1857
01:08:40,571 --> 01:08:42,371
SORRY, KYUHYUN

1858
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:44,938
Hey, sorry, Kyuhyun.

1859
01:08:45,005 --> 01:08:46,105
I was wrong. There was no Starbucks.

1860
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:48,805
You asked me to find Starbucks
when it wasn't there?

1861
01:08:48,871 --> 01:08:52,138
CHOOSE EVERYTHING HE LOST
1. PHONE, 2. CHANCE, 3. DESIRE

1862
01:08:52,205 --> 01:08:53,471
I can't even…

1863
01:08:54,305 --> 01:08:55,705
SHUFFLING

1864
01:08:55,771 --> 01:08:56,838
He didn't see it, right?

1865
01:08:57,638 --> 01:08:58,805
He didn't see it. Kyuhyun.

1866
01:08:58,871 --> 01:09:01,038
This is your last chance.
If you get this right,

1867
01:09:01,105 --> 01:09:02,071
I'll give you the cell phone.

1868
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,371
THE REAL, FINAL GAME
FIND THE STARBUCKS

1869
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:05,938
THE CELL PHONE IS ON THE LINE!

1870
01:09:06,404 --> 01:09:07,805
Gosh, but the thing is,

1871
01:09:08,605 --> 01:09:10,305
I've never had Starbucks coffee.

1872
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:13,738
LAUGHS

1873
01:09:14,471 --> 01:09:17,805
But up to now,
I've smelled the other five.

1874
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:19,605
-I just have to find the other one.
-Yes.

1875
01:09:20,071 --> 01:09:22,305
-Hey, that's wise.
-So smart.

1876
01:09:24,305 --> 01:09:27,271
SMELLS THE COFFEE MORE SERIOUSLY THAN EVER

1877
01:09:27,871 --> 01:09:29,038
PAUSES

1878
01:09:29,904 --> 01:09:34,871
HE CAN'T SEEM TO LET GO OF THE COFFEE CUP

1879
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:36,971
TILTS HIS HEAD

1880
01:09:37,938 --> 01:09:41,471
NOTHING IS EASY FOR KYUHYUN TODAY

1881
01:09:42,071 --> 01:09:43,771
Someone might think you lost your phone.

1882
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:46,871
ENDLESS TAUNTING

1883
01:09:47,771 --> 01:09:50,838
UNREASONABLE DEMANDS

1884
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:52,838
Let's make this song.

1885
01:09:53,738 --> 01:09:57,071
HE HAD A CHANCE TO TURN THE TABLES

1886
01:09:57,938 --> 01:10:01,038
BUT LOST THAT TOO

1887
01:10:01,105 --> 01:10:04,038
-Don't you feel bad for me?
-So, why did you lose it?

1888
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:05,771
THE COLD REALITY

1889
01:10:06,738 --> 01:10:10,071
AND MIRACULOUSLY, HE GETS A FINAL CHANCE

1890
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:11,871
WILL KYUHYUN GET THE PHONE?

1891
01:10:11,938 --> 01:10:13,071
Have you decided?

1892
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:16,971
FINAL DECISION

1893
01:10:17,705 --> 01:10:19,071
Number three.

1894
01:10:19,138 --> 01:10:20,038
