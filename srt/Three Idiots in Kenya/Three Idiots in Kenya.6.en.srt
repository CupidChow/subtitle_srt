1
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:12,838
THREE IDIOTS IN KENYA

2
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:14,105
-The squid earlier--
-What's that?

3
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:15,005
What is that?

4
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:16,905
-It is sundae?
-Is that bulgogi?

5
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:19,571
-Bulgogi.
-It's bulgogi.

6
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:22,138
This dish needs recognition.

7
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:26,271
A CLASSIC SWEET AND SALTY DISH

8
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:30,738
BULGOGI

9
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,305
I can drink two bottles with this.

10
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:34,538
THEY'RE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF FOOD

11
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:37,905
Let's change the game this time.

12
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,538
The category is animals.

13
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:41,171
Guess the Animal Quiz.

14
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,005
-I think we need to guess the names.
-Really?

15
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:44,471
-It's hard.
-I'm not good at this.

16
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:47,871
GUESS THE ANIMAL QUIZ

17
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:49,071
Like when we guess people,

18
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:51,138
-I'll show you animal pictures.
-Oh no.

19
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:52,505
NAME THE ANIMAL IN THE PICTURE

20
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:53,938
MONGOOSE

21
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:55,205
BUFFALO

22
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:56,505
Shall we start?

23
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:59,671
If Ji-won guesses correctly,
you will go over to that side.

24
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:00,638
Let's go.

25
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:03,371
-This will be easy.
-What was the animal that ran away?

26
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,205
-Gazelle.
-No, it was something bigger.

27
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:08,238
-Impala?
-That's right.

28
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:10,938
-What are you whispering about?
-He's a real expert.

29
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:12,638
-He knows everything.
-He's amazing.

30
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,205
I just like animals.

31
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:17,005
Why are you suddenly acting humble?

32
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,705
It doesn't suit you.

33
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:19,605
Hold on.

34
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:22,605
I saw him show off
and then get humiliated.

35
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:24,405
EXAMPLES:
LEONARDO DICAPRIO, ABRAHAM CADABRA

36
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:25,705
Okay, we'll start with Ji-won.

37
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:29,238
-I'll go slow this time.
-All right.

38
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:30,405
BULGOGI ROUND

39
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:32,771
-Three, two, one.
-Pumbaa.

40
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:33,871
Correct.

41
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:36,071
-Three, two, one.
-Hyena.

42
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,605
-Correct!
-What a relief.

43
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:39,438
Three, two, one.

44
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:40,838
-Fox rabbit.
-Incorrect!

45
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:43,771
-"Fox rabbit"?
-Did you say fox rabbit?

46
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,438
-It's a fennec fox.
-Isn't that from a cartoon?

47
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,905
-It's a fennec fox.
-We've never seen it here.

48
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:50,971
We chose commonly known animals.

49
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:53,971
-But…
-Not just the animals we see here?

50
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:56,205
In the Maasai Mara.

51
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:58,071
Look at them complaining too.

52
00:01:58,138 --> 00:01:59,738
"That's not fair."

53
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:00,705
FEELING WRONGED

54
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,238
-If only you had said "fox."
-Isn't it a fennec fox?

55
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:04,971
Where did the fox rabbit come from?

56
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:07,805
It's a fox that resembles a rabbit.

57
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:09,638
I was wrong.

58
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,238
Hey, why don't we try this?

59
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:14,638
There are four questions left.
You get to eat if Ji-won gets them all.

60
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:15,638
-Let's do it.
-Yes.

61
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:17,538
-Sure, I can do it.
-I'm counting on you.

62
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,138
Okay, I'll get them all.

63
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,005
I should know
since I've seen so many animals.

64
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:23,205
-He's a renowned animal expert.
-Okay.

65
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:27,205
He has done research on the Maasai Mara
for 24 years.

66
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,805
-He published a book recently.
-Yes.

67
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:31,671
Never Speak of the Things
You Saw in the Maasai Mara.

68
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:32,805
That's the book…

69
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:39,071
What's the point
of publishing a book then?

70
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:42,038
-It's Dr. Eun's dark side.
-That's hilarious.

71
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:46,071
-I've made many darkmentaries.
-Yes, he did.

72
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:47,638
They are dark documentaries.

73
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:49,238
-You can see his…
-Dark side?

74
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:50,871
-That's right.
-Definitely.

75
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,571
Never Speak of the Things
You Saw in the Maasai Mara

76
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:55,938
is a two-page book.

77
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,571
He can't write that well.

78
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,438
FAITHFUL TO THE TITLE

79
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:01,505
-Let's start.
-Let's do this.

80
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,305
-I can do this.
-This is Ji-won's challenge.

81
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,705
-Ji-won, relax.
-All right.

82
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,838
-We won't say anything.
-It's okay to get it wrong.

83
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:08,105
Hey, take a shot!

84
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,271
-Stop it.
-No way.

85
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:11,605
-I can't think clearly.
-Got it.

86
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:12,605
I get confused.

87
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:14,305
Let's go.

88
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:15,638
BULGOGI ROUND

89
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,971
-Three, two, one.
-Water strider.

90
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:18,871
Correct.

91
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:20,771
PASSED AN UNEXPECTED QUESTION

92
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:22,938
-That was unexpected.
-How did he get that?

93
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:23,905
Three, two, one.

94
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,771
The… That…

95
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:26,971
Red panda.

96
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,938
-Correct.
-Red panda?

97
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:32,638
-Three, two, one.
-That… ant…

98
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,271
-Anteater.
-Correct.

99
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,538
-What is that?
-This is insane.

100
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:40,038
-Dr. Eun.
-Wait, there's only one left.

101
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:42,271
-I can't believe this.
-He's awesome.

102
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:43,771
This is impressive.

103
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:46,171
Let's jump right into the last question.

104
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:48,105
They might give out a hard one.

105
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:49,238
Three, two, one.

106
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:50,905
That's a…

107
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,305
-Sloth!
-Correct.

108
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:55,638
-Wasn't it a gorilla?
-I thought it was King Kong.

109
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:56,538
-Am I right?
-Is he?

110
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:57,938
Correct!

111
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,771
-I got them all right.
-Dr. Eun.

112
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:01,571
Correct!

113
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:04,538
RESPECT

114
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:08,105
-Do I qualify as an expert?
-You surely do.

115
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:09,505
How did you recognize the sloth?

116
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:12,438
-I didn't know any of the others.
-Even the anteater.

117
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:15,405
-It's incredible.
-He sure is Dr. Dark Eun.

118
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:17,405
-Why don't you have a shot to celebrate?
-Me?

119
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,438
-Come here.
-Let's all make a toast.

120
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:20,771
-Of course.
-Sure.

121
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:21,705
For bulgogi.

122
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:23,538
Cheers to the darkmentary professor.

123
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,671
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

124
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,771
-You were great.
-To the darkmentary professor.

125
00:04:26,838 --> 00:04:28,371
WON THE BULGOGI

126
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:30,038
-He did great.
-That was awesome.

127
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:31,471
Ji-won, you're something else.

128
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,005
The pictures were hard to see.
I couldn't make out the water strider.

129
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:37,471
BULGOGI TIME

130
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,338
-I watch lots of animal videos.
-I can tell.

131
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:43,105
Hey, there are chilis inside.
It's so good.

132
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:44,971
MVP JI-WON TAKES A BITE

133
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:46,605
IT'S DELICIOUS

134
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:50,105
KYUHYUN EATS IT WITH RICE

135
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:51,838
IT'S DELICIOUS

136
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,671
I like that it's spicy.

137
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:55,871
AFTER DEVOURING THE BULGOGI

138
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:57,638
It looks like stew.

139
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:58,838
It's kimchi stew.

140
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:00,571
GOOD TIMING FOR STEW

141
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:02,238
-Let's eat this.
-Shouldn't you win this?

142
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:06,771
PERFECT FOR WARMING YOUR BELLY AND SOUL

143
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:12,571
KIMCHI STEW FILLED WITH MEAT

144
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:14,438
CHUCKLES

145
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:17,338
Honestly, I'm loving this right now.

146
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,238
I feel happy for some reason.

147
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:21,138
I'm just happy, even if I'm wrong.

148
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,505
THEY MUST BE DRUNK

149
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,871
Don't you just love this?

150
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:26,905
-Look at the sunset.
-You can catch a glimpse of the sunset.

151
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:28,205
THE TWILIGHT BRINGS THE MOOD

152
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:31,038
Well, I would appreciate it

153
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:33,538
if you ended the game
before the hippos come out.

154
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:36,038
Dr. Eun, when are hippos active?

155
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:40,671
-Hippos are active at night.
-After the sun sets…

156
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:43,538
-They come out to catch prey.
-Right.

157
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:47,438
-I thought they were herbivores.
-They are.

158
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:49,571
They won't eat us,
but they can kill us if we annoy them.

159
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:51,571
-Then shouldn't we report it?
-We should.

160
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:53,605
-We should be careful first.
-I see.

161
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,938
-Since we're in their territory?
-That's right.

162
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,705
-But they come up often.
-They do.

163
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:01,471
Because the sun is setting.

164
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:05,938
We'll get a bit drunk later,
and if the hippos come out…

165
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:09,738
Su-geun will spot them and say,
"Hey, Pumbaa."

166
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:14,438
He'll approach them and say,
"Pumbaa is so cute!"

167
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:17,571
-He will crawl toward the hippo.
-Excuse me.

168
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:20,671
-It's not dangerous if it's unintentional.
-Why?

169
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:21,738
They'd be surprised too.

170
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:23,338
"I've never seen a human

171
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:25,971
-come up to me."
-You're the first.

172
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,971
The hippo might even back off.

173
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:30,938
Did they come out?

174
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,071
They're coming!

175

What's the answer?

209
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,438
How about, "Rich dad is not my dad"?

210
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:41,505

00:11:58,205 --> 00:11:59,471
Ketchup.

358
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:00,471
Hotdog!

359
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:02,338
IN A CHEERFUL WAY

360
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:03,238
Exercise…

361
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:04,871
-Hotdog?
-Healthy dog?

362
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:06,571
-Myungrang Hotdog.
-Correct.

363
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:09,938
FINALLY GOT HIS CHEERFULNESS

364
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:10,838
SUBWAY

365
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:11,938
It's the last one.

366
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,538
-Let's get this one.
-What's that?

367
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:14,438
The freeway.

368
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:15,805
THAT'S RIGHT

369
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:17,605
LOOK AT THIS!

370
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:21,338
California rolls.

371
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:23,505
What is it? The boat.

372
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:24,605
Subway.

373
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,005
-That's right!
-Really?

374
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,471
-Correct!
-We got it.

375
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,638
I meant to say freeway in English.

376
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:33,671
You should've said that in English.

377
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,271
Isn't high road…

378
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,505
-Is it highway?
-Yes.

379
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:38,271
Subway's the same thing.
It doesn't matter.

380
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:39,638
We got it right.

381
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:41,038
We just understood you.

382
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:42,505
-Subway--
-How did you get it right?

383
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:44,538
Because the words are similar.

384
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,171
I figured it was something like that.

385
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:47,071
GOT LUCKY

386
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:49,238
Can you do NeNe Chicken again?

387
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:51,438
NE

388
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,005
NENE CHICKEN

389
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:54,638
AN ENCORE-DESERVING DESCRIPTION

390
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:57,738
That was an encore for NeNe Chicken.

391
00:12:57,805 --> 00:12:59,205
Congratulations.

392
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:00,271
Enjoy your meal.

393
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:01,805
-We did it.
-Let's eat.

394
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,271
TIME TO FEAST

395
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:04,338
Enjoy, everyone.

396
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:06,338
-Thank you.
-Hold on.

397
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:07,471
Should I eat first?

398
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,971
-You eat first.
-You can eat first. I'll grill the meat.

399
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,938
It's raining. Bring the umbrella.

400
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:15,871
This is…

401
00:13:19,138 --> 00:13:20,171
From both angles.

402
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:25,605
AMAZED

403
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,605
-This is happiness.
-Exactly.

404
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,438
This is true happiness.

405
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,905
-Let's toast.
-Sure.

406
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:34,238
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

407
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:35,305
SNEEZES

408
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:38,671
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

409
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,705
FEELS HEARTWARMING WITH GOOD FOOD

410
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:42,571
I'll make a wrap.

411
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:44,005
-We should eat a wrap.
-Of course.

412
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:45,205
SU-GEUN MAKES A LETTUCE WRAP

413
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:47,505
I should add two pieces of meat.

414
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:49,838
Add grilled kimchi on top.

415
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:52,305
-Shouldn't you add rice too?
-That's a must.

416
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:53,771
OPENS WIDE

417
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:55,271
It's too big for my mouth.

418
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:57,805
I want to wrap it in pickled radish.

419
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,371
OPENS WIDER

NOM

423
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:10,005
It's so good.

424
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:11,871
-It's better than any restaurant.
-Definitely.

425
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,205
SU-GEUN'S IMPRESSIVE GRILLING

426
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:15,038

TIME FOR KOREAN DESSERT

428
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:18,105
-Add kimchi.
-Okay.

429
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,071
WHAT'S HIS RECIPE?

430
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:21,405
1. CUT THE MEAT INTO PIECES

431
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:22,305
2. CHOP IT UP MORE

432
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:24,071
You have to film him making fried rice.

433
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:25,905
-Can you lower the heat?
-Sure.

434
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:27,305
Wow, Su-geun.

435
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:29,538
His scissors don't touch the frying pan.

436
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:31,871
3. STIR-FRY WITH RICE AND KIMCHI

437
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:36,471

440
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:45,238
-Did you run a barbecue place?
-Yes, I did everything.

441
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:47,338
HE'S EVEN HUMBLE

442
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:49,671
I want to be your son.

443
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:51,638
I would give you a big allowance.

444
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,305
Sprinkle a bit of pepper, please.

445
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:54,838
KOREAN DESSERT IS READY

446
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:57,371
-This is definitely tasty.
-Absolutely.

447
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,371
CHEF TAKES A BITE FIRST

448
00:14:58,438 --> 00:14:59,471
Thank you.

449
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:01,771
It's so good.

450
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:04,038
It's yummy.

451
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,005
KYUHYUN TAKES A BITE

452
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,905
Kyuhyun, it's great.

453
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,205
MOVED

454
00:15:09,271 --> 00:15:12,405
Are we still missing two of the Big Five?

455
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:15,338
-The rhino and the leopard?
-And the lion.

456
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:16,871
Oh, we haven't seen three yet.

457
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:19,038
Let me tell you tomorrow's schedule.

458
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:19,938
-Sure.
-Okay

459
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:22,038
-You did a game drive today.
-Yes.

460
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:26,405
We'll be in the sky
to see the wildlife tomorrow.

461
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:28,205
-Really? How?
-Is that true?

462
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:29,538
There's a hot-air balloon here.

463
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:30,505
NO WAY!

464
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:33,505
-I saw it.
-That's on my bucket list.

465
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:35,705
We won't be riding it just anytime.

466
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,471
It's great during the sunrise…

467
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:38,905
Early in the morning?

468
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:43,971
-You'll watch the safari as the sun rises.
-Wow, I think I'm going to cry.

469
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:47,471
HOT-AIR BALLOON SNEAK PEEK

470
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:49,705
After the hot-air balloon ride,

471
00:15:49,771 --> 00:15:53,471
we'll leave the eco-friendly lodge
and go to a luxury lodge.

472
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,305
Wow, thank you.

473
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,438
We're making great memories, right?

474
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:02,171
WRAPPING UP THE DAY
WITH HEARTY KOREAN FOOD

475
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:05,838
4:20 A.M. BEFORE THE CRACK OF DAWN

476
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:07,038
We need to wake up.

477
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,638
STIR

478
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:12,005
UP EARLY FOR THE SAFARI SUNRISE

479
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,305
HALF ASLEEP

480
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:19,438
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

481
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,805
Morning.

482
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:27,071
EVEN SLEEPYHEAD JI-WON WOKE UP

483
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,505
Where's the coffee?

484
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:33,271
POURS

485
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:37,105
POURING COFFEE INTO THEIR OWN TUMBLERS

486
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:39,771
-Oh, my hand.
-Be careful.

487
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:40,971
Did I spill?

488
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:43,371
Oh, I didn't spill.
This is just heating up.

489
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,005
The thermos is getting hot.

490
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,638
It's too thin. It's not a thermos.

491
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:48,871
A BOTTLE DISGUISED AS THERMOS

492
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:50,238
It's an ordinary bottle.

493
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:51,838
Do you think I'm lying?

494
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:54,371
TRY IT YOURSELF

495
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:56,271
He's telling the truth. It's hot.

496
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:59,838
I thought I had spilled it on my hand
while pouring it.

497
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:02,005
WELL, AT LEAST HE MUST BE FULLY AWAKE NOW

498
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,371
-This is no joke.
-Why is it so hot?

499
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:07,005
BURN HAZARD

500
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:11,371
TO THE YOUNGER IDIOT WHO ARRIVED LATE

501
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:14,938
I prepared this iced chocolate for you.

502
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:16,305
-For me?
-Yes.

503
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:18,505
Oh, my hands! Gosh, it's hot!

504
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,238
It's so hot!

505
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,438
IT WAS HOT ICED CHOCOLATE

506
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:25,005
I was shocked.

507
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:27,905
I thought I spilled coffee on my hand.

508
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:30,038
-Why does it get so hot?
-It really does.

509
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,338
Let's head out.

510
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:34,305
LEAVING THEIR FIRST LODGE IN THE SAFARI
TO RIDE THE HOT-AIR BALLOON

511
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:39,538
It might take a bit over an hour,
so get a good rest before we arrive.

512
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,571
WE WERE TOLD TO GET SOME REST

513
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:43,471
I don't think I can get a good rest.

514
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,238
SWAYS

515
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:50,271
-I won't be able to rest properly.
-Kyuhyun, rest up.

516
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,138
FLUTTERING LIKE A PAPER DOLL

517
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,738
-You didn't have enough sleep.
-That's right.

518
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:57,971
RIDING ON THE BUMPY OFF-ROAD TRAIL

519
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:00,538
-There are hyenas in front of us.
-Look at the hyenas.

520
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:01,805
Straight ahead.

521
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:02,871
I see their eyes.

522
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:04,671
-Wow, hyenas.
-Look at their eyes.

523
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:07,005
EXCITED BY THE UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER

524
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:09,871
-Spotted hyenas.
-They don't run away.

525
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:12,571
SPOTTED HYENA
NOCTURNAL ANIMALS OF KENYA

526
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:14,105
There are a few sitting down.

527
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:16,038
EXUDING A UNIQUE ALLURE

528
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:17,305
They're real hyenas.

529
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:21,105
HYENAS AT DAWN

530
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:23,005
This is unbelievable.

531
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:27,138
We're in the middle of the time
when animals are active.

532
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:30,205
RIDING AT DAWN IN THE WILD

533
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:34,505
IT'S DAYBREAK BEFORE YOU KNOW IT

534
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,571
THE THREE IDIOTS FELL ASLEEP

535
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,105
Wait, it's a giraffe.

536
00:18:39,838 --> 00:18:41,038
It's a giraffe.

537
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:42,038
-What?
-A giraffe.

538
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:44,505
-Look, there's a giraffe!
-Where?

539
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:49,405
TALL FIGURES ARE FAINTLY VISIBLE

540
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,338
On your right.

541
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:52,238
-They're on both sides.
-There it is.

542
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,671
-On my left.
-Here it is.

543
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:54,771
AMAZED

544
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:57,238
GIRAFFES THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

545
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:58,971
They're walking around at this hour?

546
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,738
Wow, it's a herd of giraffes.

547
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,005
A HERD OF GIRAFFES ON THE MOVE

548
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:05,238
JI-WON AND KYUHYUN ARE FASCINATED BY THEM

549
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:07,005
BLINKS

550
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:09,271
TRYING HARD TO STAY AWAKE

551
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,838
-There's a big one.
-It's huge.

552
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:14,071
MAASAI GIRAFFE
INHABITS KENYA AND TANZANIA

553
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:16,971
The sun is setting on the left.

554
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,005
THE SUN IS RISING, NOT SETTING

555
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:23,805
THEIR SILHOUETTES AT DAWN
LOOK LIKE A PAINTING

556
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:28,605
It looks abundant here
since there is water.

557
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:30,471
I guess they're here to drink water.

558
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:32,805
AFTER FINALLY ENCOUNTERING GIRAFFES

559
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,838
Look ahead.

560
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:36,638
The sun is rising.

561
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:39,105
FASCINATED

562
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,138
I've never seen a sun glow like this.

563
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:45,905
SUNLIGHT GRADUALLY PAINTS THE SKY
ABOVE THE HORIZON

564
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,438
-The hot-air balloons are over there.
-They're on my right.

565
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,805
APPROACHING THE MASSIVE HOT-AIR BALLOONS

566
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:52,905
They're amazing.

567
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:55,871
This is on a whole different level.

568
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:57,971
I'm excited.

569
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:00,271
We have arrived.

570
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:01,438
Jambo.

571
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:03,405
Wow, they're firing it up.

572
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:06,438
THE HOT-AIR BALLOON IS BEING INFLATED

573
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,771
-Do we have to lie down?
-No, we have to stand up.

574
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:10,738
BICKERING ONCE AGAIN

575
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:13,438
-We have to lie down like I said.
-Okay.

576
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,538
-What?
-We must lie down.

577
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,305
Oh, this is a bit different.

578
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:20,371
THE THREE IDIOTS BOARD THE HOT-AIR BALLOON

579
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:23,071
This is incredible.

580
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,005
Do you want me to hold a camera?

581
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:27,738
SU-GEUN'S CAMERA

582
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:29,305
How do you feel?

583
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:32,071
Honestly, I'm scared.

584
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:35,105
-Isn't this your first time?
-Yes, actually, this is…

585
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,371
NERVOUS

586
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:38,905
Wow, it's moving.

587
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,071
STARTING TO INFLATE THE HOT-AIR BALLOON

588
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:45,471
THE EXCITED THREE IDIOTS ARE ALL SET

589
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,371
It's going up.

590
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:50,605
ALL READY FOR TAKEOFF

591
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:51,571
It feels strange.

592
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:54,205
That pilot is awesome.

593
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:57,171
He looks like a fire bender.

594
00:20:57,238 --> 00:21:00,305
WITH HIS FLAMETHROWER SKILLS
AS THE FIRE BENDER

595
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,238
I think we're in the air.

596
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:04,571
We're rising.

597
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,105
THE HOT-AIR BALLOON GRADUALLY RISES

598
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:09,171
-We're up in the air.
-Yes, we are.

599
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:10,505
He told us to stand up.

600
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,505
ASTONISHED

601
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:15,505
It's insane!

602
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:16,905
This seat is amazing.

603
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,071
AMAZED

604
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:20,838
This is incredible. I can't believe it.

605
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,171
This is unbelievable.

606
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:25,671
THE HIGHLIGHT OF MAASAI MARA,
HOT-AIR BALLOONS

607
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:29,571
It's amazing how we are in the air.

608
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:31,405
It feels like a dream.

609
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:32,405
This is unreal.

610
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:38,705
-I'm speechless.
-The sun is rising on this side.

611
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:40,871
-Is it really?
-The sun is rising on the left.

612
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:41,938
STUNNED

613
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:45,238
BREATHTAKING EXPERIENCE WITH A SUNRISE

614
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:48,005
There are so many hot-air balloons around.

615
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:50,238
This is when they usually take off.

616
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:52,538
MOST POPULAR AT SUNRISE

617
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:55,938
I'm not anyone special,
but I highly suggest this for a honeymoon.

618
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:57,838
STUNNED

619
00:21:57,905 --> 00:21:59,405
The ride is very comfortable.

620
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:02,438
It feels like a waterbed or some sort of…

621
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:04,438
It feels soft. The ride is smooth.

622
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:05,538
It's such a stable ride.

623
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:07,105
TENSION FADES AWAY WITH A STABLE RIDE

624
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:09,438
Take a look below.

625
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:10,705
Are those gazelles?

626
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:14,071
A HERD OF GAZELLES

627
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:15,138
Look over there.

628
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:17,805
They're hopping around.

629
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:19,138
They are so cute.

630
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:24,171
-The hyenas are…
-They're following gazelles.

631
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:25,905
HYENAS FOLLOWING GAZELLES

632
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,571
They're running away from the hyenas.

633
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:31,871
The hyenas are going after an impala…
I mean, a gazelle for a meal.

634
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:35,171
-It would be great to see a lion.
-I really hope so.

635
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:36,471
AS THE IDIOTS WISH FOR A LION

636
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:39,071
-Are those birds?
-They are.

637
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:41,038
We are flying above the birds.

638
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:44,838
THEY GET TO SEE THE TOP OF THE HEADS
OF THE FLYING EGRETS

639
00:22:47,338 --> 00:22:49,738
-Where are the buffalo?
-Buffalo?

640
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:52,038
There are so many of them.

641
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:56,438
A HERD OF BUFFALO

642
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:59,671
-Look at the elephants near the trees.
-Wow, I see them.

643
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:02,171
THEY ENCOUNTER ELEPHANTS AGAIN

644
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:03,871
It's running.

645
00:23:03,938 --> 00:23:06,238
They're having a fight.

646
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:08,838
Look at them use horns.

647
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:12,505
They're going at it with their horns.

648
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:14,838
Why start the day off fighting?

649
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:16,338
You shouldn't be fighting.

650
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:18,538
EVEN TRIES TO STOP THE TOPI FROM FIGHTING

651
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,938
It seems like there aren't
as many lions today.

652
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:22,405
NOT A SINGLE STRAND OF MANE IS SEEN

653
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:23,705
They must be sleeping.

654
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,538
Yes, I…

655
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,838
You shouldn't sing.

656
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:29,605
I do

657
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:30,838
I made this song.

658
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:33,538
COPYRIGHT-FREE MADE-UP SONG

659
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:37,438
I wish I could fly up into the air

660
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:38,338
Stop it.

661
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:41,438
I have a dream

662
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:44,305
AS HE TRIES TO WOO THE LION

663
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:52,305
-There are lions near the buffalo.
-Where?

664
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:55,838
-Where?
-In front of the buffalo herd?

665
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:58,305
Where are the buffalo?

666
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,205
UNABLE TO LOCATE THE BUFFALO

667
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:02,738
LET'S GET A LITTLE CLOSER

668
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,071
LOOKING CLOSELY

669
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:07,738
-I see the lions.
-Where?

670
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,571
Do you see the black line of buffalo?

671
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:13,671
Find the black line.

672
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:14,938
They're just below it.

673
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:16,771
-Is it in front of the car?
-Yes.

674
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:19,271
-The lion is in front of the car.
-It is.

675
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:26,805
-He said the lions are by the car.
-Near the car.

676
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:28,171
A SMALL GROUP PASSING BY THE CAR

677
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:31,305
-I thought they moved solo.
-I see five or six of them.

678
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:33,771
-There are more than ten.
-Look at all of them.

679
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:34,938
A LARGER GROUP FOLLOWS THEM

680
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:38,371
Lions travel in groups known as a pride.

681
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:39,871
Four of them are walking by.

682
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,071
LION PRIDE PASSING BY

683
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:43,571
I see four or five of them moving across.

684
00:24:47,205 --> 00:24:48,905
AFRICAN LION
KING OF THE JUNGLE

685
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:52,171
REPRESENTATIVE CARNIVORES OF AFRICA
THEY LIVE IN PRIDES OF 20 LIONS

686
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:54,771
-Right there.
-The wind is taking us to the lions!

687
00:24:54,838 --> 00:24:57,805
-We are lucky.
-We are going toward the lions.

688
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:02,671
-They might go hunting.
-It looks like they are about to.

689
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:05,605
The lions are about to start their hunt.

690
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:10,738
The lioness is leading the group
moving toward that way to hunt.

691
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:12,938
With the wind blowing toward the buffalo,

692
00:25:13,005 --> 00:25:16,271
the lions wait for it to shift
to hide their scent.

693
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:18,271
The buffalo will run away
if they catch it.

694
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:21,938
They lie low
and wait until the wind shifts.

695
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:24,105
When do you think they'll start hunting?

696
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:25,805
I think it might take some time.

697
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:30,138
Like 20… Maybe in ten minutes?

698
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,471
-We hoped to see them hunt.
-Can we stay for ten minutes?

699
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:36,171
DESPERATE

700
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,938
ONLY IF THE WIND STOPS

701
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:44,138
LET'S GIVE UP
SINCE WE CAN'T DRIFT IN THE AIR

702
00:25:44,205 --> 00:25:46,538
We still got to see the lions.

703
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,405
GOT TO SEE THE LIONS ON THE LAST TOUR

704
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:51,805
The vibe they show is really something.

705
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:54,538
-It sure is different.
-They look laid back.

706
00:25:54,605 --> 00:25:57,071
They stroll leisurely along the road.

707
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:00,905
There's nothing that can stop them.

708
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:06,871
-They don't want to hurt their feet.
-Yes, the road is nicely made.

709
00:26:06,938 --> 00:26:09,471
And the pathway has been made.

710
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:11,771
Strolling on the road.

711
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:14,338
If I had to be born again,
I would choose to be a lion.

MY DREAM FOR MY NEXT LIFE

713
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:19,205
I get why they're kings of the jungle.

714
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:21,538
If born a gazelle,
you'd have to run all day.

715
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:25,171
They must always be cautious,
even when eating.

716
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:26,705
How about Pumbaa?

717
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:30,071
Pumbaa would be okay,
but I'm worried about my elbows.

718
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:30,971
I CHOOSE LION TO PROTECT MYSELF

719
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:33,405
-They eat leaning on their elbows.
-They're my favorites.

MOVING ALONG AFTER LION SIGHTSEEING

722
00:26:40,738 --> 00:26:42,438
We didn't get to see the rhinos.

723
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:44,405
I heard it's really hard to spot them.

724
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:47,705
-Did we see them during the site visit?
-We did.

725
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:51,271
-Did you not film during site visits?
-We did.

726
00:26:51,338 --> 00:26:55,305
Just give us some reaction by saying,
"Look at the rhinos."

727
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:57,471
Look, there are rhinos!

728
00:26:58,938 --> 00:26:59,771
Stop lying.

729
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:04,238
-We can edit this line into that footage.
-Is that what it is? I almost fell for it.

THE REMAINING BIG 5 MISSED BY THE IDIOTS

-Please get ready for landing.
-Seat belt, please.

753
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:05,138
We're close to the ground. That was fast.

754
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:08,905
SUCCESSFUL LANDING

00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:10,971
You are the best driver.

00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:13,505
Let's all clap. Everybody clap.

757
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:15,371
WE MADE IT

758
00:28:15,438 --> 00:28:17,171

Are we really enjoying our picnic here?

A PERFECT ACACIA TREE AHEAD

767
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:42,738
How was the hot-air balloon ride?

768
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:43,905
It was the best.

769
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:47,538
The safari definitely
looked different from above.

770
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:49,971
On most hot-air balloon rides,

771
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:54,938
you mostly look at scenery,
but we saw animals as well.

772
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:56,805
-The impression is still strong.
-Really.

773
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:59,805
-It's something…
-It's something you need to experience.

774
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,938
Seriously…

775
00:29:04,138 --> 00:29:06,005
Can we get eaten out of nowhere?

776
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:09,405
If you fall asleep, you might die.

777
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:12,771
If I have to sleep here,
I'm going to soak my hair in orange juice.

778
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:14,438
It lets them devour my head first.

779
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:17,771
That would be less painful.
Isn't that right?

780
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:20,771
Ants might attack you first.

781
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:22,271
Anything is fine.

782
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:24,905
Since the weather is nice
and we're having a picnic,

783
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,271
we should try something fun.

784
00:29:26,838 --> 00:29:32,971
Why don't we have a poetry contest
based on our experiences in Africa?

785
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,271

00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:50,605
The winner will receive
the Golden Coffee Beans left by Ji-won.

791
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:52,605
THE 1ST PLACE PRIZE

792
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:55,138
THE 2 GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

793
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:56,371
That sound good.

794
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:59,338
Don't we all have a sense of sensitivity?

795
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:00,638
The title is set as "Africa."

796
00:30:00,705 --> 00:30:01,605
TITLE: AFRICA

797
00:30:01,671 --> 00:30:02,771
Please be creative.

798
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,871
Dr. Eun has already started writing.

799
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,605
WRITING WITHOUT HESITATION

800
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:11,838
You're really quick.

801
00:30:11,905 --> 00:30:13,805
You shouldn't be cheating.

802
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:15,771
I'm sorry,
but that doesn't help me at all.

803
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:19,538
NO DESIRE TO CHEAT ON HIS WRITING

804
00:30:19,605 --> 00:30:21,271
Don't look at mine!

SUBMISSION COMPLETE

816
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:58,538
Were you in serious mode, Su-geun?

817
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:01,938
I wanted to do something with Pumbaa, but…

818
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:05,971
I prefer sincerity over humor for this.

819
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:08,105
Yes, since you mentioned that earlier.

820
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:11,438
Who would like to read first?

821
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:15,005
-I'll go first since mine is the shortest.
-Okay, let's give it up for him.

822
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:18,005
-I wrote it so we can all be part of it.
-Okay.

823
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:19,605
Please say the first letters together.

824
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,738
-You wrote an acrostic poem.
-Acrostic?

825
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:25,071
Title, Africa. Written by Eun Ji-won.

00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:29,205
"A beautiful scenery."

828
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:30,805
-F.
-F.

829
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:33,471
"Freely roaming animals across the field."

830
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:34,505
-Ri.
-Ri.

831
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,138
"Respect, Africa."

832
00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:37,105
Ah.

833
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:38,571
Ah.

834
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:41,838
-It's "ca." Why did you say "ah"?
-Ca…

835
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:43,605
Why do you spoil the fun?

836
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:45,571
-Just like how you express that sound.
-Right.

837
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:48,638
"Captivating moments fill the air."

838
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:49,705
Oh, okay.

839
00:31:49,771 --> 00:31:51,938
-That was great.
-I thought of this as well.

840
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:53,671
Could you share your inspiration?

841
00:31:53,738 --> 00:32:00,671
The poem sincerely expresses
my feelings about Africa.

842
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:01,805
My genuine feelings.

843
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:02,705
UNNATURAL TONE

844
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:03,605
I understand.

845
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,105
-Su-geun, please go ahead and read yours.
-Okay.

846
00:32:06,171 --> 00:32:07,338
SU-GEUN'S TURN

847
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:09,105

a soothing pause for the traveler.

The first flutter

852
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:29,771
Nature's roar stirs my passion
and brings back memories of my youth.

853
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:32,538
Youth, it's Africa."

STRUGGLES WITH SERIOUS MOMENTS

855
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:41,238
-He's just feeling embarrassed.
-I'm sorry.

856
00:32:41,305 --> 00:32:44,938
At last, Kyuhyun's turn.

857
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,071
He writes lyrics, so he'd be good.

858
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:50,405
-I only compose.
-Oh, you don't write.

859
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,105
Africa.

860
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,238
Written by Kyuhyun.

861
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:57,405
Put some feeling into it, please.

862
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,071
He should've written as Ostrich Cho.

863
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:02,071
AFRICA

864
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:03,538
-"That's right."
-"That's right"?

865
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:04,871
That's great.

866
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:07,505
"Everyone wants to be in the spotlight.

867
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:10,005
The king of the jungle, lion.

868
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,471
A hippo that can take down a lion.

869
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:14,738
A cheetah with speed.

870
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:17,405
A giant elephant.

871
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:21,405
But I have no desire for competition.

872
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:25,971
I prefer to humbly kneel down
and feed on the grass."

873
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,838
-It's Pumbaa.
-It is.

874
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:30,805
"That's right.

875
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:35,371
-I am Pumbaa."
-That idiot.

876
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:36,971
I knew it.

877
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:39,405
-"I am Pumbaa."
-That idiot.

878
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:40,471
I knew it.

879
00:33:40,538 --> 00:33:42,805
"A Pumbaa with dreams."

880
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:44,405
"A Pumbaa with dreams"?

881
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:47,571
-The story is…
-Why? What's wrong?

882
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:49,705
HEARTBROKEN PUMBAA CHO

883
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:53,071
As it got closer to the end,
I had a feeling Pumbaa would be mentioned.

884
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:56,305
Everyone sensed
that you were going to mention Pumbaa.

A BUILD-UP LEADING TO PUMBAA

886
00:33:57,605 --> 00:33:59,505

00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:05,705
-The three poems are not for us to judge.
-Okay.

889
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:09,005
We'll ask ChatGPT
to evaluate for us again.

890
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:10,705
-Should I read them to you?
-Yes.

891
00:34:11,705 --> 00:34:13,871
THE IDIOTS' POEMS WERE SENT TO CHATGPT

892
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:16,038
"Yes, Your Highness."

893
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:17,438
A TRAINED SKILL

894
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:22,505
"All three poems impressively
explored Africa in their own way.

895
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:27,938
I will rank and rate
each poem based on four criteria.

896
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:30,471
The criteria are creativity,

897
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:31,938
delivery of the theme,

898
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:34,471
emotional impact, and literary quality."

899
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:36,938
-There is no category regarding humor.
-Right.

900
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:39,105
I might score high in emotional impact.

901
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:40,738
I went more with humor.

902
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:42,405
FULL OF CONCERNS

903
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,538
FIRST CONTESTANT
EUN JI-WON

904
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:45,605
For our first contestant, Ji-won.

905
00:34:46,271 --> 00:34:52,038
"A rhythmic acrostic focused on wordplay
and onomatopoeic expressions."

906
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:53,871
-That's spot on.
-It recognized it.

907
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:55,105
LEFT A POSITIVE IMPRESSION

908
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:56,605
"In terms of creativity,

909
00:34:56,671 --> 00:35:00,838
the use of slang expressions
like 'respect' stands out,

910
00:35:00,905 --> 00:35:04,405
and 'Ca' adds a unique touch.

911
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:06,705
In terms of emotional impact,

912
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:12,271
it conveys excitement
but lacks depth in emotional layers.

913
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:13,671
In terms of literary quality,

914
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:17,505
it has rhythm
but feels like a humorous cliché."

915
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:19,171
Did it say cliché?

916
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:21,105
It said cliché.

917
00:35:22,305 --> 00:35:23,371
Why is it cliché?

918
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:26,305
AI CHALLENGED HIS PRIDE

919
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,571
What nonsense is this?

920
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:31,005
It comes across like clichés from ads.

921
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:32,171
I see.

922
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:36,138
"Overall, a witty and unforgettable poem,
much like a great advertising slogan.

923
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:41,005
I rate it 3 out of 5 stars."

924
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:43,205
It keeps rating mine three stars.

925
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:45,171
AI FOUND NO STRONG POINTS IN HIS POEM

926
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:47,571
Did you end up writing his name?

927
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:49,105
QUESTIONABLE FAIRNESS IN CONSISTENCY

928
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:51,371
It's not very giving of you.

929
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:53,938
For our second contestant, Kyuhyun.

930
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:59,938
"A self-exploratory poem
through animal metaphors."

931
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:02,271
Wow, it read my mind.

932
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:03,871
-It knows you well.
-Yes.

933
00:36:03,938 --> 00:36:05,471
A TRUE FRIEND FROM THE DIGITAL WORLD

934
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,438
It understands him so well.

935
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:08,571
"For creativity,

936
00:36:08,638 --> 00:36:13,238
impersonating an animal
to contrast social desires feels new."

937
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,405
TOUCHED

938
00:36:14,471 --> 00:36:15,571
It noticed.

939
00:36:15,638 --> 00:36:16,671
"For emotional impact,

940
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:21,671
the line 'I am Pumbaa'
blends humor and philosophy."

941
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:22,838
IMPRESSED

942
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,038
-It captured all the meanings?
-How did it know?

943
00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:26,738
INTERPRETATION BEATS THE DREAM

944
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:27,871
"I didn't even know."

945
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:32,138
"Overall, it's a humorous
and philosophical confession from Pumbaa."

946
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:35,038
"Confession from Pumbaa."

947
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:37,138
The rating is surprisingly good.

948
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:38,971
"I rate it 4.3 out of 5 stars."

949
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,738
SURPRISED

950
00:36:40,805 --> 00:36:42,338
A FRIEND'S GENEROUS TAKE

951
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:45,538
-"Confession from Pumbaa"?
-"Confession from Pumbaa"?

952
00:36:45,605 --> 00:36:49,238
-He was basically Pumbaa.
-I was immersed in the moment.

953
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:51,638
Why don't you embrace your inner Pumbaa?

954
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:53,505
-You should stay like that.
-Yes.

955
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:55,371
PUMBAA CHO THRILLED WITH THE HIGH SCORE

956
00:36:55,438 --> 00:36:57,605
Our last contestant, Su-geun.

957
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:02,438
"A narrative poem
that reflects on life and youth

958
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:05,105
-through the grandeur of nature."
-That's right.

959
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:06,838
"As for emotional impact,

960
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:11,338
emotions are conveyed in a deep,
resonant voice that is warm and sincere."

961
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,438
-Did it hear my voice?
-Did it?

962
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:14,838
"As for literary quality,

963
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:19,905
it is a prose poem
balancing metaphor and sensory details."

964
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,705
-Good interpretation.
-What's a prose poem?

965
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:23,271
-I've never heard of it.
-"Final note.

966
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,371
A poet in the later chapters of life…"

967
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:28,771
It was written before death.

968
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:32,238
"A poet in life's later chapter
finds youth in nature.

969
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:36,205
I rate it 4.5 out of 5 stars."

970
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:37,638
Su-geun wins!

971
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:38,538
POET LEE DEBUTS

972
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:40,771

Thank you.

981
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:01,171
MOVING TO THE SECOND LODGE

982
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,305
-This is our final lodge.
-Okay.

983
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:08,671
Since this is your last lodge,
we have prepared a luxurious one.

984
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:10,905
We're heading into the forest.

985
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:11,938
DEEP WITHIN THE FOREST

986
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:15,171
-What is that?
-What's that sound?

987
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:17,305
A NOISE COMING FROM FAR AWAY

988
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:18,705
They made them do that.

989
00:38:18,771 --> 00:38:20,171
I thought we weren't allowed music.

990
00:38:20,238 --> 00:38:22,505

Having the room by yourself
may not be the best option.

IDIOT WITH SEPARATION ANXIETY

1051

1065
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,405
IF YOU FIND MIKE

1066
00:41:40,471 --> 00:41:41,338
"NICE TO SEE YOU"

1067
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:43,238
WILL BE THE ANSWER

1068
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:46,471
AND WILL BE GIVEN THE INVITATION
TO THE SAFARI VIEW ROOM

1069
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,971
-I'm Mike.
-Mike.

1070
00:41:49,038 --> 00:41:50,538
DO THE IDIOTS REMEMBER?

1071
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:52,571
I know the answer.

1072
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:54,338
Just take the room. I have no idea.

1073
00:41:54,405 --> 00:41:56,538
We prepared some traits, just in case.

1074
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:58,405
-Should we just start?
-No, tell us.

1075
00:41:58,471 --> 00:41:59,905
APPEARANCE AND ATTIRE

1076
00:41:59,971 --> 00:42:03,505
The first trait is that
Mike is a person with a smile.

1077
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:05,271
MIKE'S TRAITS
1. A SMILEY FACE

1078
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:06,838
Everyone here is.

00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:10,305
ALL SMILES

1080
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:11,638
Everyone was smiling.

1081
00:42:11,705 --> 00:42:15,805
His head shape is quite beautiful,
and he's in a dress shirt and pants.

1082
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:17,305
MIKE?

1083
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:22,738
-Can he be avoiding us?
-No, he'll be working in his position.

1084
00:42:22,805 --> 00:42:25,305
THERE ARE MANY FIELDS OF WORK
IN THIS LODGE

1085
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:27,271

WHERE IS MIKE?

1093
00:42:41,938 --> 00:42:43,271
You can begin.

1094
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:44,205
THE GAME STARTS

1095
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,338
He won't be anywhere close to here.

1096
00:42:47,371 --> 00:42:49,805
Smiley face, a dress shirt, and pants…

1097
00:42:51,371 --> 00:42:52,638
ARRIVES AT THE BAR WITH HINTS

1098
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:56,938

HE DISCOVERED THE IDEAL CANDIDATE

1102
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,105
I'm sorry.

1103
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:16,205
EXCHANGED INTRODUCTIONS

1104
00:43:16,271 --> 00:43:18,138
BUT IT'S NOT MIKE

1105
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:20,538
SECOND ATTEMPT AT THE BARTENDER

1106
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:24,805
SENSE OF ANTICIPATION
WITH SMILES ON HIS FACE

1107
00:43:24,871 --> 00:43:26,038
I'm sorry.

1108
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:27,205
NOT MIKE

1109
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:34,971
LEAVING WITHOUT MUCH INFORMATION

1110
00:43:35,038 --> 00:43:36,338
What is this?

1111
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,471
Is it a baby Pumbaa?

1112
00:43:38,538 --> 00:43:42,305
It's a baby Pumbaa! Oh, dear me!

1113
00:43:44,771 --> 00:43:46,938
SORRY, I'M HYRAX

1114
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:47,838

CLOSE GENETIC RELATIVE OF THE ELEPHANT
STICKY PADS ON THEIR FEET

1116
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:52,338
It's cute.

1117
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:55,105
COMPLETELY FOCUSED ON THE HYRAX

1118
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:56,438

00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:09,105
THERE ARE JUST SO MANY

1124
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:10,871
Wait, hold on.

1125
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:15,371
FOUND A RED DRESS SHIRT

1126
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,571
I'm sorry.

1127
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:19,105
"I'm sorry"?

1128
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:20,571

EXPRESS THEIR APOLOGIES

1135
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:36,038
I'm sorry. Could he be hiding somewhere?

1136
00:44:36,105 --> 00:44:37,771
THEY'RE WEARING DRESS SHIRTS

1137
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:39,038
HELLO

1138
00:44:39,105 --> 00:44:40,505
Are you Mike?

1139
00:44:40,571 --> 00:44:41,971
-No.
-I'm sorry.

1140
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:46,605
A POLITE YOUNG MAN
WHO NEVER FORGETS HIS GRATITUDE

1141
00:44:46,671 --> 00:44:49,738
SU-GEUN VISITS THE SOUVENIR SHOP

1142
00:44:49,805 --> 00:44:51,305
Is there Mike?

1143
00:44:51,371 --> 00:44:53,838
-I'm sorry.
-"I'm sorry"?

1144
00:44:53,905 --> 00:44:56,405
Oh, Mike, where are you?

1145
00:44:57,971 --> 00:44:59,705
WONDERING IF HE'S DOING OKAY

1146
00:45:02,205 --> 00:45:03,471
No, I'm sorry.

1147
00:45:03,538 --> 00:45:04,605
DROWNING IN APOLOGIES

1148
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:06,071
I don't think he's here.

1149
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:07,871
Mike!

1150
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:10,938
Oh, Mike!

1155
00:45:19,705 --> 00:45:22,138
HE'S NOT MIKE

1156
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:25,638
IT WAS GREAT SEEING YOU THOUGH

1157
00:45:25,705 --> 00:45:27,571
THE IDIOTS ARE DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR HIM

1158
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:30,071
WHERE IS MIKE?

1159
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:32,571
IT'S ME

1160
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:33,971

SMILEY FACE, BEAUTIFUL HEAD,
IN A DRESS SHIRT AND PANTS

1162
00:45:36,371 --> 00:45:38,005
WHERE IS HE?

1163
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:41,105
IN THE BACK AREA OF THE RESTAURANT

1164
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,038
ORGANIZING DISHES

1165
00:45:44,105 --> 00:45:45,305
"Nice to see you."

1166
00:45:45,371 --> 00:45:46,338
PREPARES HIS KOREAN LINE

1167
00:45:46,405 --> 00:45:48,238
Was it "I'm sorry"?

1168
00:45:48,305 --> 00:45:50,405
EVEN HELPS OUT HIS COLLEAGUE'S KOREAN LINE

1169
00:45:51,038 --> 00:45:54,338
LOOKING AT THE IDIOTS PASSING BY

1170
00:45:54,905 --> 00:45:55,871
WAITING ENDLESSLY

1171
00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:57,305
He's nowhere to be found.

1172
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:00,438
JI-WON IS BACK AT FINDING MIKE AGAIN

1173
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:04,238
OVER THERE

1174
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:07,738
Restaurant? Oh, thank you!

1175
00:46:07,805 --> 00:46:08,838
Thank you, Owen!

1176
00:46:09,471 --> 00:46:11,905
FIGURED OUT MIKE'S WORKPLACE

1177
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:14,038
Where is it though?

1178
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:18,805
RUNNING TOWARD THE OUTSIDE

1179
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:22,705
RECEPTION IS THE PLACE FOR ANSWERS

1180
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:27,338
RESUMES RUNNING AFTER GETTING AN ANSWER

1181
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:30,671
REACHES THE RESTAURANT WITH HELP

1182
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:34,438
Mike?

1183
00:46:43,371 --> 00:46:44,238
I'm sorry.

1184
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:46,638
WAS SO CLOSE TO WINNING

1185
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:49,338
HE DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR

1186
00:46:49,405 --> 00:46:52,671
A MOMENT AGO…

1187
00:46:52,738 --> 00:46:56,405
HE LEFT AFTER GETTING HIS WORK DONE

1188
00:46:56,471 --> 00:46:59,571
ALMOST RAN INTO JI-WON

1189
00:47:00,405 --> 00:47:03,071
WHEN HE WAS RUSHING INTO THE RESTAURANT

1190
00:47:03,705 --> 00:47:06,671
HE LEFT THROUGH A DIFFERENT EXIT

1191
00:47:06,738 --> 00:47:10,338
AS JI-WON WALKED INTO THE RESTAURANT

1192
00:47:10,405 --> 00:47:14,338
MIKE IS ON HIS WAY TO THE LOUNGE BAR

1193
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:17,005
CURRENTLY WORKING AT THE BAR

1194
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:19,638
I'M SO BUSY

1195
00:47:19,705 --> 00:47:21,971
-Ji-won.
-I think he's hiding.

1196
00:47:22,038 --> 00:47:25,205
I can't find him anywhere.
I've been there.

1197
00:47:25,271 --> 00:47:27,605
SECRETLY ASKING FOR HELP

1198
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:31,438
Over there?

1199
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:35,371
SU-GEUN RUSHES OVER

1200
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:36,705
She said somewhere over there.

1201
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:40,938
JI-WON WAS LINGERING AROUND THE RESTAURANT

1202
00:47:42,305 --> 00:47:44,938
BOTH ARE VERY CLOSE TO MIKE

1203
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:47,905
AT THAT VERY MOMENT

1204
00:47:48,471 --> 00:47:51,371
MIKE STEPS OUTSIDE

1205
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,438
PASSES BY JI-WON

1206
00:47:56,505 --> 00:47:59,405
AN IDIOT WHO DOESN'T GET A CLUE

1207
00:47:59,971 --> 00:48:02,105
I can't find him anywhere.

1208
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:05,738
Mike!

1209
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:10,705
Jambo, Mike!

1210
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:12,305
You can't just call anyone Mike.

1211
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:13,871
I'm sorry.

1212
00:48:13,938 --> 00:48:15,971
APOLOGIZING ON BEHALF OF SU-GEUN
LIKE AN IDIOT

1213
00:48:16,038 --> 00:48:17,205
Mike!

1214
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:18,971
SU-GEUN RUNS REGARDLESS

1215
00:48:19,038 --> 00:48:20,205
Mike!

1216
00:48:21,438 --> 00:48:23,138
Are you Mike?

1217
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:26,638
-Nice to see you.
-"Nice to see you"?

1218
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:30,005
AFTER ALL THAT SEARCHING,
MIKE STANDS BEFORE HIM

1219
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:33,271
SU-GEUN WINS

1220
00:48:33,338 --> 00:48:35,605

1221
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:37,505
HERE YOU GO

1222
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:42,371
THE 1ST PRIZE IS AWARDED TO SU-GEUN

1223
00:48:42,871 --> 00:48:45,538
FINALLY FREE FROM ALL THE APOLOGIES

1224
00:48:45,605 --> 00:48:48,205
SAVORING THE VICTORY

1225
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:52,438
TODAY IS JUST ONE OF THOSE PERFECT DAYS

1226
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:54,671
Oh, man, Mike.

1227
00:48:55,905 --> 00:48:58,638
IT'S A SHAME

1228
00:48:59,205 --> 00:49:01,271
AND THERE IS PUMBAA

1229
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:04,138
CATCHING UP WITH THE SITUATION

1230
00:49:04,705 --> 00:49:05,638
Where was he?

1231
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:12,571
REVEALING THE WINNER'S ROOM

1232
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:15,405
AMAZED

1233
00:49:15,471 --> 00:49:17,005
The bed is…

1234
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:18,371
XXL SIZE BED JUST FOR SU-GEUN

1235
00:49:18,438 --> 00:49:20,638
-The view is just…
-It is great.

1236
00:49:20,705 --> 00:49:22,005
FASCINATED

1237
00:49:23,905 --> 00:49:26,038
THE MAIN FEATURE OF WINNER'S ROOM
THE SAFARI VIEW

1238
00:49:26,605 --> 00:49:29,505
WHEN YOU RELAX ON THE BED

1239
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:33,438
A GRASSLAND SCREEN STRETCHES OUT
IN FRONT OF YOU

1240
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:35,105
You can just sit and enjoy the view.

1241
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:36,905
MESMERIZED BY THE VIEW

1242
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:39,105
I love the fact that there is a fan.

1243
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:42,405
THE IDIOT LOVES THE FAN
AS MUCH AS THE VIEW

1244
00:49:43,071 --> 00:49:44,038
AMAZED

1245
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:45,005
Su-geun.

1246
00:49:47,105 --> 00:49:49,138
Come look at this.

1247
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:52,105
-The shower area is awesome.
-This is so cool.

1248
00:49:52,171 --> 00:49:53,371
-What is it?
-This is the place.

1249
00:49:54,138 --> 00:49:56,838
ENJOY A SHOWER IN THE HEART OF NATURE

1250
00:49:56,905 --> 00:49:58,538
You can relax while you poop.

1251
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:02,805
Wow, what is this?

1252
00:50:03,538 --> 00:50:04,505
Your poop view.

1253
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:06,538
It's a view for Pumbaa.

1254
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:09,005
-Come visit my place.
-What?

1255
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:10,471
-Leave your things.
-After I unpack…

1256
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:12,905
-Can I use the bathroom first?
-Take a rest.

1257
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:17,505
-Su-geun, record yourself in the bathroom.
-Okay.

1258
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:19,605
REQUESTING A BATHROOM VLOG

1259
00:50:19,671 --> 00:50:21,471
He wants me to record it?

1260
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:25,438
SOMEONE WHO CAN'T SAY NO

1261
00:50:25,505 --> 00:50:28,271
This is something…

1262
00:50:28,338 --> 00:50:31,038
Perhaps stepping outside
is a better option.

1263
00:50:31,105 --> 00:50:34,371
THEY ARRIVE AT THEIR ROOM

1264
00:50:34,438 --> 00:50:35,571
This is just as good.

1265
00:50:35,638 --> 00:50:39,505
-It's two individual beds.
-It's fine.

1266
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:42,605
I like this room.
The flowing water sounds nice.

1267
00:50:43,238 --> 00:50:46,771
FOREST VIEW WITH WATER ASMR

1268
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:49,238
The view is not bad.

1269
00:50:49,305 --> 00:50:52,405
-The sound of water is calming.
-Yes.

1270
00:50:52,471 --> 00:50:53,305
It's nice.

1271
00:50:55,238 --> 00:50:56,371
I'm satisfied.

1272
00:50:56,438 --> 00:50:57,671
PLEASED WITH THE SECOND LODGE

1273
00:50:58,238 --> 00:50:59,471
I'm going to swim.

1274
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:01,638
Today…

1275
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:05,271
I'm streaming from Kenya.

1276
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:10,405
Let's enjoy a session
of upper-body exercises this afternoon.

1277
00:51:10,471 --> 00:51:12,871
SU-GEUN'S SAFARI WORKOUT SESSION

1278
00:51:12,938 --> 00:51:14,238
Starting with a Pumbaa exercise!

1279
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:16,105
1. PUMBAA EXERCISE

1280
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:20,771
This exercise targets
your back and chest muscles.

1281
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:24,205
Stretch your back legs, bend your arms,

1282
00:51:24,271 --> 00:51:27,405
go straight down, and come back up.

1283
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:30,071
AN EXERCISE INSPIRED BY PUMBAA

1284
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:34,638
Get a body like this in just three months
with this workout.

1285
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:36,505
GAIN MUSCLES LIKE PUMBAA WITH THIS ROUTINE

1286
00:51:36,571 --> 00:51:38,405
2. ELEPHANT EXERCISE

1287
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:41,438
This is the most difficult one of all.

1288
00:51:41,505 --> 00:51:42,405
Oh, is it?

1289
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:44,471
Let me demonstrate.

1290
00:51:45,971 --> 00:51:49,371
You lower yourself with your arms twisted.

1291
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:52,238
It makes you work
the lower half of your body.

1292
00:51:52,305 --> 00:51:54,738
-Are you breathing okay?
-Yes, I mean…

1293
00:51:54,805 --> 00:51:56,638
OXYGEN-DEPRIVED WORKOUT

1294
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:58,505
3. HIPPO EXERCISE

1295
00:51:59,171 --> 00:52:03,271
Shape our arms like a hippo's large mouth.

1296
00:52:03,338 --> 00:52:05,738
On one, you open your arms wide.

1297
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:07,571
On two, squat and spread them wider.

1298
00:52:07,638 --> 00:52:11,171
One, two, three, and four.

1299
00:52:11,238 --> 00:52:14,371
MORE EFFECTIVE
IF THE ARMS ARE OPENED WIDER

1300
00:52:14,438 --> 00:52:17,671
-The hippo is moving in for a drink.
-One, two, three, and four.

1301
00:52:17,738 --> 00:52:20,471
One, two, three, and four.

1302
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,638
Hey, Pumbaa. Come on!

1303
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:25,505
You're already close.

1304
00:52:26,538 --> 00:52:29,238
DOOR-TO-DOOR SERVICE

1305
00:52:29,305 --> 00:52:30,605
Which one is Pumbaa?

1306
00:52:31,105 --> 00:52:32,671
EYE CONTACT

1307
00:52:32,738 --> 00:52:33,605
Damn it.

1308
00:52:33,671 --> 00:52:35,671
SCARED

1309
00:52:35,738 --> 00:52:38,638
-Were you intimidated?
-We made eye contact.

1310
00:52:40,038 --> 00:52:42,838
AFTER THE WORKOUT SESSION

1311
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:46,371
THE IDIOTS ARE GATHERED UNDER A TREE

1312
00:52:46,438 --> 00:52:49,471
-Since you've had a good rest…
-Yes.

1313
00:52:49,538 --> 00:52:52,571
-…we'll begin the final game.
-Sounds great.

1314
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:54,938
It looks like that person is in trouble.

1315
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:57,938
-He's already surrounded.
-It's already too late.

1316
00:52:58,005 --> 00:53:00,038
Do you know the one-word term for it?

1317
00:53:00,605 --> 00:53:01,505
"Ganged up."

1318
00:53:01,571 --> 00:53:02,405
LAUGHS

1319
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,871
-Hey, look at this one.
-What is it?

1320
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:07,205
It's called hy…hylet? We saw it before.

1321
00:53:08,405 --> 00:53:10,371
Hy… It's hyrax.

1322
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:11,771
-It's adorable.
-It's so cute.

1323
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:12,805
THE CUTIE WE SAW EARLIER

1324
00:53:14,605 --> 00:53:16,905
-Dr. Eun, you know everything.
-I just saw it.

1325
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:19,605
I asked a local about this animal.

1326
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:22,605
-Come here, hyrax.
-It looks like it wants to join.

1327
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:24,038
It's running away.

1328
00:53:24,105 --> 00:53:25,471
So, what was it again?

1329
00:53:25,538 --> 00:53:27,271
BACK TO THE MAIN POINT

1330
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:30,371
Do you remember
why we first came to Kenya?

1331
00:53:30,438 --> 00:53:32,638
-Yes, the giraffe hotel.
-We came to see giraffes.

1332
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:37,238
But since we haven't seen any giraffes,
we prepared a game.

1333
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:41,638
It's the "Glistening-eyed Giraffe Game."

1334
00:53:41,705 --> 00:53:43,771
The name doesn't really interest me.

1335
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,105
"The Glistening-eyed Giraffe Game"?
What could it be?

1336
00:53:47,171 --> 00:53:51,438
There is a legend
that makes its way across the Maasai Mara.

1337
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:58,571
It is said that a unique giraffe
wanders across the Maasai Mara plains.

1338
00:53:58,638 --> 00:54:01,205
It's the glistening-eyed giraffe.

1339
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,605
The Maasai say
that if you can find this giraffe,

1340
00:54:03,671 --> 00:54:09,671
you will gain a treasure
that sparkles like its glistening eyes.

1341
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:14,171
However, not just anyone
can obtain the treasure.

1342
00:54:14,238 --> 00:54:19,405
Only by overcoming five great trials
can one meet the glistening-eyed giraffe.

1343
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:24,538
Which idiot will discover the giraffe
and earn the gleaming treasure?

1344
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,705
Legend says that if you find the giraffe,

1345
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:31,505
-you will be rewarded with a diamond.
-Oh, really?

1346
00:54:31,571 --> 00:54:32,638
IT'S FICTION

1347
00:54:32,705 --> 00:54:38,205
If you visit all five animal houses
and complete their mission,

1348
00:54:38,271 --> 00:54:41,105
you will receive a hint
to find the glistening-eyed giraffe.

1349
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:44,005
-That's…
-That must be Pumbaa's house.

1350
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:45,238
I saw some holes.

1351
00:54:45,305 --> 00:54:47,038
THIS HOUSE BELONGS TO ANOTHER ANIMAL

1352
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:48,105
HOUSES OF FIVE ANIMALS

1353
00:54:49,405 --> 00:54:52,205
5 MISSION LOCATIONS
SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE LODGE

1354
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:57,671
If you come in first,
you'll receive a diamond from the giraffe.

1355
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:00,238
THE PERSON WHO MEETS THE GIRAFFE

1356
00:55:01,438 --> 00:55:07,705
WILL BE GIVEN A DIAMOND
THAT SHINES LIKE ITS GLISTENING EYES

1357
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,671
HOWEVER

1358
00:55:09,738 --> 00:55:10,971
The two who fail to find it

1359
00:55:11,038 --> 00:55:14,838
will get to have a friendly chat
with another giraffe tomorrow.

1360
00:55:14,905 --> 00:55:17,271
TOMORROW

1361
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:20,738
-Is this one?
-Kelly is all set for everything.

1362
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:24,905
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE PREPARED?

1363
00:55:25,738 --> 00:55:28,071
I'm going to give out the first hint.

1364
00:55:28,138 --> 00:55:32,038
Take a look and find the first location.

1365
00:55:32,105 --> 00:55:35,205
GIVEN TO THE IDIOTS

1366
00:55:35,271 --> 00:55:38,371
ARE A MYSTERIOUS CODE AND A MAP

1367
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:39,771
CODE: FOLLOW, FOLLOW, BUFFALO ME

1368
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:42,071
A MYSTERIOUS CODE

1369
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,538
LOUNGE (CURRENT LOCATION)

1370
00:55:45,938 --> 00:55:48,071
HOUSE NUMBER 27 MARKED WITH A STAR

1371
00:55:48,138 --> 00:55:50,238
You can start as soon as you are ready.

1372
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,471
LET'S CHECK OUT HOUSE 27

1373
00:55:52,538 --> 00:55:54,438
-Are we going to the same place?
-Yes.

1374
00:55:54,505 --> 00:55:57,338
The first mission is… Why are you running?

1375
00:55:57,405 --> 00:55:59,071
This way to the pool…

1376
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:00,371
These are all routes.

1377
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:03,205
SU-GEUN GOES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

1378
00:56:04,305 --> 00:56:07,271
THE IDIOTS HAVE SPLIT INTO TWO PATHS

1379
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:08,638
Is this the right place?

1380
00:56:08,705 --> 00:56:10,971
JI-WON AND KYUHYUN WALK THROUGH THE FOREST

1381
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:12,671
I don't think this is it.

1382
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:14,471
THEY REACH A DEAD END

1383
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,338
-I think something will jump out.
-Is this it?

1384
00:56:17,005 --> 00:56:18,271
I guess this isn't it.

1385
00:56:18,338 --> 00:56:19,805
THE YOUNGER ONES WANDER LOST

1386
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:23,238
GUIDED BY YEARS OF WISDOM,
THE ELDEST STRIDES FORWARD

1387
00:56:23,305 --> 00:56:25,771
Here it is. I found it

1388
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:28,971
COULD THIS BE THE FIRST ANIMAL'S HOUSE?

1389
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:31,271
Is this the place?

1390
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:34,138
What's the code?

1391
00:56:34,205 --> 00:56:35,805
"Follow, follow, buffalo me."

1392
00:56:35,871 --> 00:56:37,338
Wrong code.

1393
00:56:37,405 --> 00:56:39,471
THIS IS A DIFFERENT HOUSE

1394
00:56:39,538 --> 00:56:41,805
I found one house though.

1395
00:56:41,871 --> 00:56:44,471
WHILE SU-GEUN VISITS THE WRONG HOUSE

1396
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:46,705
KYUHYUN ESCAPES FROM THE DEAD END

1397
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:47,838
Oh, damn it.

1398
00:56:51,238 --> 00:56:53,305
THE HOUSE FROM THE MAP IS JUST AHEAD

1399
00:56:54,338 --> 00:56:55,905
KYUHYUN IS ALMOST AT THE FIRST LOCATION

1400
00:56:55,971 --> 00:56:56,971
Okay, this is it.

1401
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:00,271
SU-GEUN FINDS HIS WAY ONTO THE RIGHT PATH

1402
00:57:00,338 --> 00:57:01,738
There's a house over there.

1403
00:57:02,305 --> 00:57:03,471
We can't go?

1404
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,771
There's no path there.

1405
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:09,571
-We can go. We'll find a way.
-You're going that way?

1406
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:11,571
PROACTIVE STYLE

1407
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:12,471
I'm here.

1408
00:57:12,538 --> 00:57:15,105
WHO WILL BE THE FIRST CHALLENGER?

1409
00:57:15,671 --> 00:57:17,305
KYUHYUN ARRIVES FIRST

1410
00:57:17,371 --> 00:57:19,738
-What's the code?
-"Follow, follow, buffalo me."

1411
00:57:20,305 --> 00:57:22,705
JI-WON ARRIVES SECOND

1412
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:24,338
I almost had it.

1413
00:57:25,771 --> 00:57:27,705
SU-GEUN ARRIVES LAST

1414
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:30,938
The game is
"Part Buffalo's Hair Perfectly."

1415
00:57:31,438 --> 00:57:33,471
FIRST CHECKPOINT
BUFFALO'S HOUSE

1416

COUGH

1694
01:07:51,571 --> 01:07:54,305
Maybe you need to catch
something on a horn.

-Ready?
-Wait, I'm not ready yet.

1711
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:33,138

THEREFORE, NOTHING IS VISIBLE

1737
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,505

01:10:48,438 --> 01:10:49,938
Please check the capitalization.

1769
01:10:50,005 --> 01:10:54,771
Don't say that. Why would you be so anal?

1770
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:56,405
CHOKED UP

1771
01:10:56,471 --> 01:10:58,738
Do you really have to go that far?

1772
01:10:58,805 --> 01:11:00,171
I feel like throwing up.

1773
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:03,605
There's a pungent smell rising
from my stomach.

1774
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:06,105
FED UP WITH THE MONO DIET

1775
01:11:06,838 --> 01:11:08,905
Even the water tastes weird.

1776
01:11:08,971 --> 01:11:11,405
At least give me some soda.

1777
01:11:11,471 --> 01:11:15,438
Never drink lukewarm water
with boiled eggs.

1778
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,271
It's the worst combination.

1779
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:20,871
TAKES A BITE

1780
01:11:23,471 --> 01:11:26,005
My mouth is completely dry.

1781
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:28,438
A TOUGH BATTLE WITH EGGS

1782
01:11:29,005 --> 01:11:30,838
ENDURES THE PAIN FOR ANOTHER TRY

1783
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,638
I think this is the Lulu one.

1784
01:11:34,705 --> 01:11:36,171
FINALLY, AN EASY WORD

1785
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:37,271
Set, go.

1786
01:11:37,338 --> 01:11:39,105
BEGINS TYPING WITH DETERMINATION

1787
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,838
NOTICEABLY FASTER PACE

1788
01:11:43,905 --> 01:11:47,338
LULU…

1789
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:48,938
I can't see very well.

1790
01:11:49,005 --> 01:11:53,971
LULULEMON

1791
01:11:54,038 --> 01:11:55,538
PASS

1792
01:11:55,605 --> 01:11:57,338
SLICE OF LIFE OF A TYPING OSTRICH

1793
01:11:57,405 --> 01:11:59,338
I can actually do it really well.

1794
01:11:59,405 --> 01:12:01,671
-I won't forget what you did to me.
-Take the hint.

1795
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:03,505
What's the hint?

1796
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:06,671
FINALLY OUT OF THE OSTRICH'S HOUSE

1797
01:12:06,738 --> 01:12:08,405
RUNNING OFF

1798
01:12:08,471 --> 01:12:10,938
Oh, the chickens are growing!

1799
01:12:11,005 --> 01:12:13,271
They're growing bigger in my stomach!

1800
01:12:13,338 --> 01:12:14,905
READY TO LAY EGGS

1801
01:12:15,805 --> 01:12:17,171
OUT OF BREATH

1802
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:18,905
I'm too old to run now.

1803
01:12:18,971 --> 01:12:21,105
AN EMOTIONAL DAY FOR A 47-YEAR-OLD

1804
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:23,671
How did it get tighter?

1805
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:26,471
I don't get how it ended up so tight.

1806
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:27,405
ALSO STRUGGLING

1807
01:12:27,471 --> 01:12:29,738
It's faster if you untie it first.

1808
01:12:29,805 --> 01:12:31,505
Damn it.

1809
01:12:31,571 --> 01:12:33,571
Untie it first?

1810
01:12:33,638 --> 01:12:38,071
They snapped off the zipper pull.

1811
01:12:38,905 --> 01:12:41,005
JUST TO PREVENT ANY SNEAKY MOVES

1812
01:12:41,071 --> 01:12:43,705
They truly are something.

1813
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:45,938
Just untie them all?

1814
01:12:46,005 --> 01:12:48,405
TAKING THE DIRECT APPROACH
AFTER GIVING UP SHORTCUTS

1815
01:12:51,605 --> 01:12:53,205
JI-WON IS FINALLY HERE

1816
01:12:53,271 --> 01:12:56,538
"Catch a rhino, catch a cold. Cough."

1817
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,171
AT THE MOMENT

1818
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:00,738
-I put them on.
-Okay, pass.

1819
01:13:00,805 --> 01:13:02,338
KYUHYUN PASSES

1820
01:13:02,405 --> 01:13:03,738
CURRENT RANKING

1821
01:13:03,805 --> 01:13:06,171
1ST, 2ND, 3RD

1822
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:08,638
SU-GEUN HAS BEEN OVERTAKEN

1823
01:13:08,705 --> 01:13:10,238
EXHALES

1824
01:13:10,305 --> 01:13:12,438
You can grab the hint.

1825
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:14,171
CODE: I'M THE KING OF THE JUNGLE! ROAR

1826
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:16,838
CURRENT LOCATION
THE NEXT LOCATION IS VERY CLOSE

1827
01:13:16,905 --> 01:13:18,338
I believe it's over there.

1828
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:22,071
KYUHYUN FIGURED IT OUT IN ONE GO

1829
01:13:22,138 --> 01:13:26,405
"I'm the king of the jungle. Roar."

1830
01:13:26,471 --> 01:13:28,771
Welcome to the lion's room.

1831
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,305
The game is "Roar, Buy a Souvenir."

1832
01:13:31,371 --> 01:13:32,938
FOURTH CHECKPOINT
LION'S HOUSE

1833
01:13:33,005 --> 01:13:34,971
ROAR, BUY A SOUVENIR

1834
01:13:35,038 --> 01:13:37,638
CHECK OUT THE 4 SOUVENIRS

1835
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:42,071
FIND THE PRICE OF EACH WITHIN 2 MINUTES

1836
01:13:42,138 --> 01:13:45,738
CALCULATE THE TOTAL IN YOUR HEAD
AND GET IT CORRECT

1837
01:13:45,805 --> 01:13:48,938
IF YOU FAIL,
WAIT 1 MINUTE BEFORE TRYING AGAIN

1838
01:13:49,005 --> 01:13:52,471
The items you need to find are…

1839
01:13:52,538 --> 01:13:55,238
-What are these?
-You can find everything in here.

1840
01:13:55,905 --> 01:13:57,271
KYUHYUN'S COMBO

1841
01:13:57,338 --> 01:13:59,238

01:14:09,138 --> 01:14:11,238
You have two minutes. Ready, set, go.

1847
01:14:11,305 --> 01:14:13,171
THE GAME STARTS

1848
01:14:13,971 --> 01:14:17,171
Since Kyuhyun is really good at math…

1849
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:18,805
He used to be in math competitions.

1850
01:14:19,471 --> 01:14:22,071
HOWEVER…

1851
01:14:22,638 --> 01:14:25,138
SIMILAR LOOKING HATS

1852
01:14:25,705 --> 01:14:28,571
SIMILAR LOOKING BELTS

1853
01:14:29,138 --> 01:14:31,405
SIMILAR LOOKING ACCESSORIES

1854
01:14:31,971 --> 01:14:34,505
SIMILAR LOOKING FIGURES

1855
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:37,171
SIMILAR LOOKING SCULPTURES

1856
01:14:38,038 --> 01:14:41,071
A COLLECTION OF SOUVENIRS
THAT ARE ALIKE YET SUBTLY DIFFERENT

1857
01:14:41,138 --> 01:14:43,171
AND A LITTLE LAMB LOST INSIDE

1858
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:45,405
You have 30 seconds remaining.

1859
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:47,671
No way, where are they?

1860
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:49,205
90 SECONDS PASSED BY MEANINGLESSLY

1861
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:50,871
Oh, I found one.

1862
01:14:51,471 --> 01:14:53,338
RUMMAGING THROUGH THE CLOTHING RACK

1863
01:14:54,138 --> 01:14:55,905
LEOPARD-PRINT SHIRT, $65

1864
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:58,005
The bag…

1865
01:14:58,071 --> 01:15:00,171
BROWN BAG, $199

1866
01:15:00,805 --> 01:15:02,971
CHEETAH-SHAPED KNIFE, $89

1867
01:15:03,538 --> 01:15:04,605
Where is the bracelet?

1868
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,071
ONLY THE BRACELET IS LEFT TO FIND

1869
01:15:06,805 --> 01:15:07,738
DOUBLE-CHECKS THE ITEM

1870
01:15:07,805 --> 01:15:10,138
-Is there a case?
-What?

1871
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,971
Oh, it's here. I can't believe it.

1872
01:15:12,038 --> 01:15:14,071
FOUND IT WITH 15 SECONDS TO SPARE

1873
01:15:14,638 --> 01:15:16,138
RED BRACELET, $10

1874
01:15:16,205 --> 01:15:17,371
RELYING ON MENTAL CALCULATION

1875
01:15:17,438 --> 01:15:18,438
Ten seconds remaining.

1876
01:15:19,505 --> 01:15:23,238
Four, three, two, one.

1877
01:15:23,305 --> 01:15:24,305
RETREATS

1878
01:15:24,371 --> 01:15:25,771
FAIL

1879
01:15:25,838 --> 01:15:27,205
AT RHINO'S HOUSE

1880
01:15:28,038 --> 01:15:29,638
I did it.

1881
01:15:29,705 --> 01:15:30,605
SU-GEUN PASSES

1882
01:15:30,671 --> 01:15:32,905
I can't take this anymore.

1883
01:15:32,971 --> 01:15:34,871
ENERGY DRAINED THROUGH ALL THE EYELETS

1884
01:15:36,205 --> 01:15:39,638
RHINO EUN BEGINS TO SPIN

1885
01:15:39,705 --> 01:15:40,571
Oh my.

1886
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,238
Isn't that a Pumbaa?

1887
01:15:44,305 --> 01:15:46,538
YOUNGER IDIOT ON THE FLOOR

1888
01:15:46,605 --> 01:15:47,571
OLDER IDIOT GOES HIS WAY

1889
01:15:47,638 --> 01:15:49,871
That shoe drove me crazy.

1890
01:15:49,938 --> 01:15:51,071
LOST FOR SOME REASON

1891
01:15:51,138 --> 01:15:52,905
"I'm the king…" Mission…

1892
01:15:52,971 --> 01:15:56,071
"I'm the king of the jungle. Roar."

1893
01:15:56,605 --> 01:15:58,138
"I'm the king…" Mission…

1894
01:15:58,205 --> 01:16:00,105
ROARING AT MIKE FOR NO REASON

1895
01:16:00,171 --> 01:16:01,305
I'm sorry.

1896
01:16:01,371 --> 01:16:03,038
This is insane.

1897
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:06,805
Why are they acting
like they're part of the mission?

1898
01:16:06,871 --> 01:16:08,238
"I'm the king…"

1899
01:16:09,005 --> 01:16:12,471
"I'm the king of the jungle. Roar."

1900
01:16:12,538 --> 01:16:13,871
I'M SORRY…

1901
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:16,371
Ten seconds remaining.

1902
01:16:17,438 --> 01:16:18,871
Oh, it's him.

1903
01:16:18,938 --> 01:16:20,338
SU-GEUN FINALLY JOINS

1904
01:16:20,405 --> 01:16:23,005
"I'm the king of the jungle. Roar."

1905
01:16:23,071 --> 01:16:25,705
I've checked everywhere.
Why couldn't I think of this place?

1906
01:16:25,771 --> 01:16:27,038
The items you need to find are…

1907
01:16:27,105 --> 01:16:29,938
-We can't use our phone, right?
-Of course not, are you kidding?

1908
01:16:30,005 --> 01:16:30,871
AWKWARD

1909
01:16:30,938 --> 01:16:32,538
SU-GEUN'S COMBO

1910
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:34,538

3. WILDLIFE GUIDEBOOK

1913
01:16:38,538 --> 01:16:40,438
4. ELEPHANT SCULPTURE

1914
01:16:44,405 --> 01:16:45,805
Ready, set, go.

1915
01:16:45,871 --> 01:16:47,038
STARTS THE SEARCH

1916
01:16:47,105 --> 01:16:49,805
How can I do this in two minutes?
Oh, it's here.

1917
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,838
You're clever, Kyuhyun.

1918
01:16:51,905 --> 01:16:53,205
JI-WON, KYUHYUN

1919
01:16:53,271 --> 01:16:54,205
1 MINUTE'S UP

1920
01:16:54,271 --> 01:16:55,771
HEADS STRAIGHT TO GIVE HIS ANSWER

1921
01:16:55,838 --> 01:16:56,671
Is the time up?

1922
01:16:56,738 --> 01:16:59,205
-Did you perhaps finish the calculations?
-Of course.

1923
01:16:59,271 --> 01:17:00,538
What's your answer?

1924
01:17:00,605 --> 01:17:03,405
-It's 363 dollars.
-I can't find the hat.

1925
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:05,271
-You said…
-It's 363 dollars.

1926
01:17:06,971 --> 01:17:08,038
Correct.

1927
01:17:08,105 --> 01:17:09,605
KYUHYUN PASSES

1928
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:10,938
I'll wait for you, Su-geun.

1929
01:17:11,005 --> 01:17:13,105
KYUHYUN STAYS IN 1ST PLACE

1930
01:17:14,605 --> 01:17:17,571
Should I take it easy?
I don't think he'll make it.

1931
01:17:18,338 --> 01:17:21,371
Oh, I can't see. I should've worn glasses.

1932
01:17:21,438 --> 01:17:22,971
KYUHYUN WAS RIGHT ON POINT

1933
01:17:24,305 --> 01:17:27,271
Is this it? I don't think it is.
Is the color different?

1934
01:17:27,338 --> 01:17:28,505
THIS IS THE ONE

1935
01:17:28,571 --> 01:17:30,005
BROWN HAT, $65

1936
01:17:30,671 --> 01:17:31,938
Oh, I found it.

1937
01:17:32,938 --> 01:17:34,438
MAASAI PLATE, $9

1938
01:17:34,505 --> 01:17:36,038
FOUND THE GUIDEBOOK AS WELL

1939
01:17:36,105 --> 01:17:38,571
WILDLIFE GUIDEBOOK, $65

1940
01:17:38,638 --> 01:17:40,271
BROWN HAT, GUIDEBOOK, MAASAI PLATE

1941
01:17:40,338 --> 01:17:42,538
ONLY THE ELEPHANT SCULPTURE IS LEFT

1942
01:17:43,105 --> 01:17:44,338
Come on.

1943
01:17:44,405 --> 01:17:45,771
THE ELEPHANT IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN

1944
01:17:45,838 --> 01:17:49,205
But the elephant is big.
This is driving me crazy.

1945
01:17:50,405 --> 01:17:52,405
Oh, it's here.

1946
01:17:52,471 --> 01:17:54,105
FINALLY FOUND THE ELEPHANT SCULPTURE

1947
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,205
I think this is the one.

1948
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:57,171
Or is this the one?

1949
01:17:59,005 --> 01:18:01,038
10 OTHER SCULPTURES IN DIFFERENT SIZES

1950
01:18:01,638 --> 01:18:03,005
Seems like the prices vary.

1951
01:18:04,171 --> 01:18:06,338
SU-GEUN PICKS THE 15-DOLLAR SCULPTURE

1952
01:18:06,405 --> 01:18:07,605
What's the answer?

1953
01:18:08,405 --> 01:18:09,705
Is it 185 dollars?

1954
01:18:10,405 --> 01:18:12,205
-Do you mean to say 185 dollars?
-Yes.

1955
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,471
-Wrong!
-How did I end up with that number?

1956
01:18:14,538 --> 01:18:15,671
CAN'T GET HIS ADDITION RIGHT

1957
01:18:15,738 --> 01:18:17,338
Wait, so it's not 185 dollars?

1958
01:18:17,405 --> 01:18:18,571
MUST WAIT FOR 1 MINUTE

1959
01:18:18,638 --> 01:18:19,838
I forgot the original price.

1960
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:23,205
-Did Ji-won go home?
-His task is really difficult.

1961
01:18:23,705 --> 01:18:25,338
AT RHINO'S HOUSE

1962
01:18:25,405 --> 01:18:27,671
JI-WON FINALLY FOUND THE SHOES

1963
01:18:28,505 --> 01:18:30,171
Gosh, I want to give up.

1964
01:18:31,205 --> 01:18:32,205
Seriously.

1965
01:18:32,271 --> 01:18:33,605
SUCH A LONG DAY FOR JI-WON

1966
01:18:34,505 --> 01:18:37,771
Which kind of idiot brings
these shoes to Kenya, huh?

1967
01:18:38,471 --> 01:18:40,571
Has he lost his mind?

1968
01:18:40,638 --> 01:18:42,005
UNTYING THE SHOELACES IN ANGER

1969
01:18:42,071 --> 01:18:47,205
I bet he's the type of person who has
to wake up at 4 a.m. to get ready on time.

1970
01:18:48,538 --> 01:18:50,505
SHOVING HIS FEET IN
WITHOUT UNTYING THE LACES

1971
01:18:53,705 --> 01:18:55,671
RAMPAGE

1972
01:18:55,738 --> 01:18:57,971
SAVE ME

1973
01:18:58,838 --> 01:19:00,571
Are you sure these are men's shoes?

1974
01:19:00,638 --> 01:19:01,671
AFTER MUCH HARD WORK

1975
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:04,671
-I did it.
-You passed.

1976
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:06,305
SIGHS

1977
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:07,471
I'm so exhausted.

1978
01:19:09,805 --> 01:19:11,571
A LITTLE LATER

1979
01:19:12,105 --> 01:19:13,438
I failed due to my poor memory.

1980
01:19:13,505 --> 01:19:14,838
ENTERS WITH A DETERMINED LOOK

1981
01:19:14,905 --> 01:19:17,438
You've arrived.
You look very exhausted.

1982
01:19:17,505 --> 01:19:20,205
"I didn't realize
that I was actually Pumbaa."

1983
01:19:20,805 --> 01:19:21,638
That won't work.

1984
01:19:22,338 --> 01:19:24,071
It's about time I won.

1985
01:19:24,138 --> 01:19:26,038
KYUHYUN HEADS TO THE LAST ANIMAL HOUSE

1986
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:27,705
RECEPTION
LOUNGE

1987
01:19:27,771 --> 01:19:28,938
CODE: DON'T BE A HIPPO-CRITE

1988
01:19:29,005 --> 01:19:32,171
WHICH CHALLENGE AWAITS THE IDIOTS?

1989
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:38,205
What's the code?

1990
01:19:39,271 --> 01:19:40,771
"Don't be a hippo-crite."

1991
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:43,905
-The game is "Water-drinking Hippo."
-"Water-drinking Hippo?"

1992
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:47,705
You'll work with the giraffe brothers here
to solve a problem together.

1993
01:19:47,771 --> 01:19:50,905
THE GIRAFFE BROTHERS ARE BACK

1994
01:19:50,971 --> 01:19:52,538
FIFTH CHECKPOINT
HIPPO'S HOUSE

1995
01:19:52,605 --> 01:19:54,671
THE WATER-DRINKING HIPPO GAME

1996
01:19:54,738 --> 01:19:57,371
BALANCE A WATER-FILLED BASIN
WITH THE GIRAFFES

1997
01:19:57,438 --> 01:20:01,005
EACH HAS TO TAKE TURNS
IN TAKING OFF THEIR SOCKS

1998
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:04,071
THEN PUT THEM BACK ON TO SUCCEED

1999
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:07,205
IF THE WATER SPILLS, HE FAILS

2000
01:20:07,905 --> 01:20:09,038
How do we do this?

2001
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,305
Here comes the water basin.

2002
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:12,605
Oh my goodness.

2003
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:14,671
Hold on.

2004
01:20:16,971 --> 01:20:18,038
POSITIONING THE BASIN

2005
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,505
Who wants to go first?

2006
01:20:20,805 --> 01:20:22,305
Should I go first? Can you handle it?

2007
01:20:22,371 --> 01:20:23,205
KYUHYUN GOES FIRST

2008
01:20:23,271 --> 01:20:24,471
Okay.

2009
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:26,671
CAREFULLY LIFTS HIS LEFT FOOT

2010
01:20:27,938 --> 01:20:29,471
NERVOUS

2011
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:30,971
HE SUCCESSFULLY TAKES ONE OFF

2012
01:20:31,038 --> 01:20:32,671
NOW HE MUST REMOVE THE RIGHT SOCK

2013
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:33,905
Oh my gosh.

2014
01:20:33,971 --> 01:20:35,405
THE WATER IS TILTING TO ONE SIDE

2015
01:20:35,471 --> 01:20:36,438
Hold on.

2016
01:20:37,038 --> 01:20:37,971
We can do this.

2017
01:20:42,805 --> 01:20:44,171
KYUHYUN FINISHES HIS TURN

2018
01:20:44,805 --> 01:20:46,338
Who wants to go next?

2019
01:20:46,405 --> 01:20:47,238
-I'll do it.
-Sure.

2020
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:48,505
THE BIGGER GIRAFFE GOES NEXT

2021
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:50,871
STRIPS

2022
01:20:50,938 --> 01:20:52,005
Hold on.

2023
01:20:53,171 --> 01:20:54,371
Are you done already?

2024
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:56,238
HOWEVER

2025
01:20:56,305 --> 01:20:57,971
SLOWLY LOSING STRENGTH IN THEIR LEGS

2026
01:20:59,538 --> 01:21:00,571
DRIPS

2027
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:03,538
I'm on my right foot.

2028
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:05,538
I think we need to pull this up.

2029
01:21:06,805 --> 01:21:08,438
SPILLS

2030
01:21:09,971 --> 01:21:11,305
LOSING WATER LITTLE BY LITTLE

2031
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:14,271
My gosh, pull it up from that side.

2032
01:21:14,338 --> 01:21:15,505
Wait a minute.

2033
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:17,938
Can we adjust our positions?
Try holding it up.

2034
01:21:18,005 --> 01:21:19,138
My feet are stiff.

2035
01:21:19,205 --> 01:21:21,405
-Come back.
-It's like his feet are gone.

2036
01:21:21,471 --> 01:21:24,471
WHILE KYUHYUN IS LEADING
THE GIRAFFE BROTHERS

2037
01:21:24,538 --> 01:21:25,971
AT LION'S HOUSE

2038
01:21:26,038 --> 01:21:28,038
You'll be playing "Roar, Buy a Souvenir."

2039
01:21:28,105 --> 01:21:30,738
Find the following items.

2040
01:21:31,438 --> 01:21:32,771
JI-WON'S PACKAGE

2041
01:21:32,838 --> 01:21:34,738
1. TRIVET

2042
01:21:34,805 --> 01:21:36,705
2. BOTTLE OPENER

2043
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:38,638
3. NECKLACE

2044
01:21:38,705 --> 01:21:40,605
4. STUFFED ELEPHANT

2045
01:21:45,105 --> 01:21:46,138
Your time starts now.

2046
01:21:46,205 --> 01:21:47,105
STARTS HIS SEARCH

2047
01:21:47,171 --> 01:21:49,571
My extra minute is over.

2048
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:51,038
Come in and continue playing.

2049
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:54,305
RUNS TO CHECK THE ELEPHANT

2050
01:21:54,371 --> 01:21:56,771
PICKS THE ELEPHANT WITH CAUTION

2051
01:21:57,671 --> 01:22:00,605
SU-GEUN PICKS
THE 11-DOLAR ELEPHANT THIS TIME

2052
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,971
-Here.
-Great choice.

2053
01:22:03,505 --> 01:22:05,671
The math works out the same as earlier.

2054
01:22:06,438 --> 01:22:07,671
It's 150 dollars.

2055
01:22:08,305 --> 01:22:09,871
-That's different from before.
-Yes.

2056
01:22:09,938 --> 01:22:11,371
-Is your answer 150 dollars?
-Yes.

2057
01:22:11,438 --> 01:22:15,005
-Correct!
-Thank you!

2058
01:22:15,071 --> 01:22:18,171
I guess I miscalculated earlier.

2059
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:20,671
My answer is 150 dollars.

2060
01:22:21,171 --> 01:22:24,238
Wrong, you have different items.
Go back and do the math.

2061
01:22:24,305 --> 01:22:27,005
-Oh, we have different items?
-That's right.

2062
01:22:27,071 --> 01:22:28,371
I knew it.

2063
01:22:28,938 --> 01:22:30,438
MEANWHILE, SU-GEUN RECEIVES HIS CLUE

2064
01:22:30,505 --> 01:22:31,438
This is too far.

2065
01:22:32,105 --> 01:22:33,905
I feel like number eight is my room.

2066
01:22:34,405 --> 01:22:35,538
HEADING TO HIS ROOM

2067
01:22:35,605 --> 01:22:36,538
Let's go.

2068
01:22:37,405 --> 01:22:40,005
CURRENT RANKING:
1ST KYUHYUN, 2ND SU-GEUN, 3RD JI-WON

2069
01:22:41,471 --> 01:22:43,038
Hold on. That's 40-something.

2070
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:46,105
This is 38, and that's 4 dollars,
so that would be 42 dollars.

2071
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:48,871
I think this is the one.

2072
01:22:48,938 --> 01:22:50,938
STUFFED ELEPHANT, $40

2073
01:22:51,671 --> 01:22:52,571
This is it.

2074
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:53,938
TRIVET, $21

2075
01:22:54,005 --> 01:22:55,305
You have 30 seconds left.

2076
01:22:55,938 --> 01:22:58,605
JI-WON FOUND ALL HIS ITEMS
WITH 30 SECONDS REMAINING

2077
01:22:58,671 --> 01:22:59,638
JI-WON'S EXPECTED ANSWER

2078
01:22:59,705 --> 01:23:01,271
-I have an answer.
-Go ahead.

2079
01:23:01,338 --> 01:23:03,105
-It's 103 dollars.
-Correct.

2080
01:23:03,805 --> 01:23:05,871
-All right.
-That was quick.

2081
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:07,905
This is your next destination.

2082
01:23:07,971 --> 01:23:09,671
-"Don't be a hippo…"
-Run, Ji-won!

2083
01:23:09,738 --> 01:23:11,605
Number eight?

2084
01:23:12,171 --> 01:23:13,538
JI-WON STARTS RACING

2085
01:23:13,605 --> 01:23:16,705
Number eight
is somewhere near Su-geun's room.

2086
01:23:16,771 --> 01:23:18,438
WILL HE CATCH UP?

2087
01:23:18,505 --> 01:23:19,405
All right.

2088
01:23:19,471 --> 01:23:20,371
AT HIPPO'S HOUSE

2089
01:23:20,438 --> 01:23:21,571
Start with your right foot.

2090
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:25,171
IT'S DOWN TO KYUHYUN AND THE BIG GIRAFFE
WHO NEED TO WEAR IT BACK

2091
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:27,071
STRUGGLING

2092
01:23:27,638 --> 01:23:29,738
THE MISSION SEEMS
A BIT CHALLENGING FOR HIM

2093
01:23:29,805 --> 01:23:31,405
Wait a second.

2094
01:23:31,471 --> 01:23:32,438
Hold on.

2095
01:23:32,505 --> 01:23:34,138
Don't rush it. Let's slow down.

2096
01:23:34,205 --> 01:23:35,038
Take your time.

2097
01:23:35,538 --> 01:23:37,105
SUPER CHARISMATIC

2098
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:38,471
Okay, go.

2099
01:23:38,971 --> 01:23:40,671
FOLLOWING THE LEADER'S WORDS

2100
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:42,305
We're almost there.

2101
01:23:42,938 --> 01:23:45,138
KYUHYUN IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT

2102
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:47,438
TREMBLING

2103
01:23:49,671 --> 01:23:52,771
We can do it. We're almost there.
I just have one foot left.

2104
01:23:52,838 --> 01:23:55,505
Just hang in there.
Can you do that for me?

2105
01:23:57,571 --> 01:23:58,471
Okay!

2106
01:23:58,538 --> 01:23:59,871
HE WEARS IT SWIFTLY

2107
01:23:59,938 --> 01:24:00,905
-Pass!
-We did it!

2108
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:02,571
KYUHYUN PASSES

2109
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:04,771
Thank you. Great job, guys.

2110
01:24:05,738 --> 01:24:07,271
SORE ALL OVER

2111
01:24:07,338 --> 01:24:10,371
-Let's do a celebration.
-Which one?

2112
01:24:10,438 --> 01:24:12,305
ALLIANCE FORGED THROUGH A WATER BASIN

2113
01:24:15,838 --> 01:24:17,971
KYUHYUN OVERCAME ALL FIVE CHALLENGES

2114
01:24:18,038 --> 01:24:20,071
-Next.
-This is your last hint.

2115
01:24:20,705 --> 01:24:22,871
THE LAST STOP TO FIND
THE GLISTENING-EYED GIRAFFE

2116
01:24:24,538 --> 01:24:26,938
AN UNKNOWN, MYSTERIOUS WORD

2117
01:24:27,005 --> 01:24:28,205
What's a kuogolea?

2118
01:24:28,805 --> 01:24:30,405
Am I supposed to find this on my own?

2119
01:24:32,438 --> 01:24:36,105
WHAT DOES KUOGOLEA MEAN?

2120
01:24:38,205 --> 01:24:40,138
WHILE KYUHYUN IS FIGURING OUT
THE MYSTERIOUS WORD

2121
01:24:41,005 --> 01:24:42,705
"Don't be a hippo-crite."

2122
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:45,438
SU-GEUN ARRIVES JUST IN TIME

2123
01:24:45,505 --> 01:24:46,771
This is impossible, Su-geun.

2124
01:24:46,838 --> 01:24:47,705
LYING OUT OF HABIT

2125
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:49,071
I don't care.

2126
01:24:49,138 --> 01:24:50,838
-The game is "Water-drinking Hippo."
-Okay.

2127
01:24:50,905 --> 01:24:54,971
This is a game you have to solve
with the giraffe brothers here.

2128
01:24:55,538 --> 01:24:58,238
THEY GO TO THEIR POSITIONS LIKE A ROUTINE

2129
01:24:58,305 --> 01:25:00,405
I've got good control over my feet.

2130
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:02,071
Let's do it. I'm good at this.

2131
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:03,105
STARTS OUT CONFIDENTLY

2132
01:25:03,171 --> 01:25:05,471
I wore my socks too tightly.

2133
01:25:05,538 --> 01:25:07,005
HERE COMES THE WATER BASIN

2134
01:25:07,071 --> 01:25:08,238
That much water?

2135
01:25:09,038 --> 01:25:10,005
Darn it.

2136
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:11,838
-It's really hard.
-Are you ready?

2137
01:25:11,905 --> 01:25:13,271
Maintain your balance.

2138
01:25:13,338 --> 01:25:15,005
FUN BECAUSE IT'S NOT HIS BUSINESS ANYMORE

2139
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:17,438
How do I take these off?

2140
01:25:18,171 --> 01:25:19,838
-With your hands.
-I can use my hands?

2141
01:25:19,905 --> 01:25:21,371
TAKES BOTH FEET OFF THE BASIN

2142
01:25:21,438 --> 01:25:24,005
You have to keep one foot attached.

2143
01:25:24,071 --> 01:25:25,505
EXHAUSTED

2144
01:25:26,171 --> 01:25:27,705
I need to leave now.

2145
01:25:27,771 --> 01:25:29,671
KYUHYUN LEAVES IN A HURRY

2146
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:30,638
Hold on.

2147
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:34,771
Go ahead. Let your foot go.

2148
01:25:35,438 --> 01:25:37,138
Why would you take your feet off?

2149
01:25:37,205 --> 01:25:38,871
NOT IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS
DUE TO EXHAUSTION

2150
01:25:38,938 --> 01:25:40,505
I think he's doing this on purpose.

2151
01:25:41,305 --> 01:25:43,738
No, put your left foot attached.

2152
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,305
Did Kyuhyun make it?

2153
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:47,871
He cleared this and left?

2154
01:25:49,238 --> 01:25:51,405
Wait, Kyuhyun actually cleared this?

2155
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:54,071
The giraffes must be too tired to do it.

2156
01:25:54,138 --> 01:25:57,371
I bet they're exhausted
after doing it for three minutes with me.

2157
01:25:58,538 --> 01:26:01,205
"Kuogolea."

2158
01:26:01,271 --> 01:26:02,138
DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE

2159
01:26:02,205 --> 01:26:03,171
What is kuogolea?

2160
01:26:04,305 --> 01:26:05,405
Is it 9552?

2161
01:26:06,438 --> 01:26:08,538
-That was impressive, wasn't it?
-Sure.

2162
01:26:09,405 --> 01:26:10,571
But where is it?

2163
01:26:11,138 --> 01:26:15,038
I'm sure we'll end up
back to where we started, right?

2164
01:26:15,105 --> 01:26:16,238
FOLLOWING HIS GUT FEELING

2165
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:19,705
BACK TO THE LOUNGE WHERE THEY STARTED

2166
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:22,271
THEY'RE NOW TRYING TO PUT THEM BACK ON

2167
01:26:23,838 --> 01:26:25,605
A UNIQUE TACTIC OF STRUGGLING ALONE

2168
01:26:25,671 --> 01:26:27,338
This is too exhausting for me.

2169
01:26:28,338 --> 01:26:29,971
GIRAFFES ARE DONE WITH THEIR SOCKS

2170
01:26:30,038 --> 01:26:33,038
Hold the basin steadily.
I did a good job, didn't I?

2171
01:26:34,205 --> 01:26:36,371
ONLY SU-GEUN'S SOCKS ARE REMAINING

2172
01:26:36,938 --> 01:26:40,738
I'm almost done. This isn't impossible.

2173
01:26:41,305 --> 01:26:42,971
-Look.
-Pass.

2174
01:26:46,005 --> 01:26:47,905
THEIR LEGS GIVE OUT THE MOMENT THEY FINISH

2175
01:26:48,705 --> 01:26:51,038
CLATTER

2176
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:52,505
-Oh my goodness.
-I'm so sorry.

2177
01:26:52,571 --> 01:26:55,238
-You're such a piece of trash.
-So sorry.

2178
01:26:55,305 --> 01:26:56,638
I didn't mean it.

2179
01:26:57,771 --> 01:26:58,938
SU-GEUN GETS HIS LAST CLUE

2180
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:00,105
What's this?

2181
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:01,571
What could this mean?

2182
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:04,305
-Help me out, Ji-won.
-What?

2183
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:07,138
-If you clear this round for me--
-Forget it, I'm leaving.

2184
01:27:07,205 --> 01:27:09,038
REJECTS THE DEAL WITHOUT MERCY

2185
01:27:09,605 --> 01:27:11,505
KYUHYUN IS BACK AT THE STARTING POINT

2186
01:27:12,371 --> 01:27:14,438
Look, it's Super Junior.

2187
01:27:15,038 --> 01:27:16,238
Kuogolea!

2188
01:27:16,305 --> 01:27:18,538
-Aren't you a member of Super Junior?
-I am.

2189
01:27:18,605 --> 01:27:19,838
Kuogolea!

2190
01:27:19,905 --> 01:27:20,938
What's that?

2191
01:27:21,538 --> 01:27:23,305
I GUESS THIS ISN'T THE SPOT

2192
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,105
What's kuogolea, then?

2193
01:27:26,305 --> 01:27:28,805
Kuogolee. Kugolia?

2194
01:27:28,871 --> 01:27:29,871
What is this?

2195
01:27:29,938 --> 01:27:31,305
SU-GEUN HAS NO CLUE EITHER

2196
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:33,071
Should I translate this to Korean?

2197
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:37,205
I think kuogolea means something
in the local language.

2198
01:27:38,305 --> 01:27:39,238
Excuse me.

2199
01:27:39,938 --> 01:27:42,271
ASKING THE STAFF FOR HELP

2200
01:27:42,838 --> 01:27:44,705
Here, kuogolea.

2201
01:27:49,771 --> 01:27:52,138
No way. I have to go to the swimming pool.

2202
01:27:52,205 --> 01:27:54,005
WE ASKED A LOCAL
TO READ THE MYSTERIOUS WORD

2203
01:27:54,071 --> 01:27:55,138
LUCY
61 YEARS IN KENYA

2204
01:27:55,205 --> 01:27:59,938
Kuogolea, the Swahili word for swimming.

2205
01:28:00,005 --> 01:28:01,438
WHICH MEANS

2206
01:28:01,505 --> 01:28:03,771
A BEAUTIFUL POOL
OVERLOOKING THE SAFARI

2207
01:28:04,338 --> 01:28:07,071
A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE MIDST OF IT

2208
01:28:07,638 --> 01:28:09,471
FLOATING ALL ALONE

2209
01:28:09,538 --> 01:28:13,071
IS THE GLISTENING-EYED GIRAFFE

2210
01:28:13,138 --> 01:28:14,805
HOWEVER

2211
01:28:16,138 --> 01:28:17,471
FLOATING

2212
01:28:19,938 --> 01:28:20,805
Kuogolea?

2213
01:28:20,871 --> 01:28:22,805
THE CURRENT FIRST PLACE HAS NO CLUE

2214
01:28:22,871 --> 01:28:24,338
Kuogolea!

2215
01:28:24,405 --> 01:28:25,938
YELLING KUOGOLEA ENDLESSLY

2216
01:28:26,005 --> 01:28:27,071
What does it mean?

2217
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:29,505
Kuogolea!

2218
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:30,871
RIGHT UNDER KYUHYUN'S NOSE

2219
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:32,071
What is it?

2220
01:28:32,138 --> 01:28:33,071
Kuogolea?

2221
01:28:33,138 --> 01:28:34,205
PLEASE SAVE ME

2222
01:28:34,271 --> 01:28:36,938
THE GLISTENING-EYED GIRAFFE
IS GETTING ALL BLOATED

2223
01:28:38,138 --> 01:28:40,205
WHILE THE GIRAFFE IS ASKING FOR HELP

2224
01:28:41,338 --> 01:28:43,271
HE TAKES A QUICK TURN TOWARD THE GIRAFFE

2225
01:28:45,471 --> 01:28:46,705
DISCOVERS THE GIRAFFE

2226
01:28:47,838 --> 01:28:49,105
That's the one, right?

2227
01:28:49,705 --> 01:28:51,271
We're here to look for the giraffe.

2228
01:28:51,338 --> 01:28:53,571
GETTING READY TO GO UNDERWATER

2229
01:28:53,638 --> 01:28:55,171
RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT

2230
01:28:55,238 --> 01:28:57,405
I think I'll go to the swimming pool.

2231
01:28:58,505 --> 01:28:59,405
I've got a feeling.

2232
01:28:59,471 --> 01:29:01,038
SU-GEUN ARRIVES AT THE POOL AS WELL

2233
01:29:01,105 --> 01:29:02,138
I'll go straight ahead.

2234
01:29:02,205 --> 01:29:03,171
SU-GEUN

2235
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:06,005
WHO WILL GET THE GIRAFFE IN THE END?

2236
01:29:06,571 --> 01:29:07,671
My gosh!

2237
01:29:07,738 --> 01:29:10,271
TAKING ONE STEP CLOSER
TO THE GIRAFFE WITH A CRY

2238
01:29:11,405 --> 01:29:13,771
IT'S TOO DEEP FOR KYUHYUN
TO GRAB THE GIRAFFE

2239
01:29:14,338 --> 01:29:16,438
SU-GEUN IS RIGHT BEHIND HIM

2240
01:29:17,071 --> 01:29:18,071
What are you doing?

2241
01:29:19,071 --> 01:29:20,038
What are you doing?

2242
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:25,005
I GOT IT!

2243
01:29:25,705 --> 01:29:28,471
THE GLISTENING-EYED GIRAFFE
HAS COME OUT TO THE WORLD

2244
01:29:29,038 --> 01:29:31,138
SU-GEUN MISSED IT BY A HAIR

2245
01:29:32,005 --> 01:29:33,705
Kuogolea!

2246
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:35,338
KYUHYUN IS THE FINAL WINNER

2247
01:29:35,838 --> 01:29:37,271
The race has ended.

2248
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:38,238
What a bummer.

2249
01:29:38,305 --> 01:29:39,305
KYUHYUN WINS THE DIAMOND

2250
01:29:41,171 --> 01:29:42,138
EXCLAIMS

2251
01:29:44,071 --> 01:29:47,071
I don't think we ever asked you
to make that pose.

2252
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:49,171
DOING A DANCE OF JOY

2253
01:29:49,238 --> 01:29:50,605
You're a full-on entertainer now.

2254
01:29:50,671 --> 01:29:53,405
The funny thing is that Ji-won
is still doing his game.

2255
01:29:54,371 --> 01:29:56,971
AT HIPPO'S HOUSE

2256
01:29:58,071 --> 01:29:59,005
EXCLAIMS

2257
01:29:59,071 --> 01:30:00,005
GASPS

2258
01:30:00,071 --> 01:30:01,405
SPILLS

2259
01:30:01,471 --> 01:30:02,805
You did that on purpose.

2260
01:30:02,871 --> 01:30:04,105
WRONGFULLY ACCUSED

2261
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:07,005
I felt how you were exerting
too much force!

2262
01:30:11,905 --> 01:30:15,305
If I'm going to lose anyway,
I'd rather be eliminated now.

2263
01:30:15,371 --> 01:30:17,071
GLOOMY AT THE THOUGHT
OF DOING MANUAL LABOR

2264
01:30:17,138 --> 01:30:19,705
Is this even necessary?

2265
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:22,405
Wouldn't it be better to surrender now?
What do you think?

2266
01:30:24,305 --> 01:30:25,905
The race has ended.

2267
01:30:25,971 --> 01:30:26,938
It's over?

2268
01:30:27,671 --> 01:30:31,271
Why did we do this?
You should've eliminated me sooner.

2269
01:30:32,438 --> 01:30:33,705
I got wet for nothing.

2270
01:30:34,571 --> 01:30:37,305
BUT IT WAS FUN, WASN'T IT?

2271
01:30:37,371 --> 01:30:39,105
GATHER AT THE POOL

2272
01:30:39,171 --> 01:30:41,105
-We need to give Kyuhyun his prize.
-Right.

2273
01:30:41,171 --> 01:30:43,538
Here's the prize we promised.

2274
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:47,471
This is a real diamond. Congratulations.

2275
01:30:47,538 --> 01:30:48,771
-Oh my gosh.
-Congrats.

2276
01:30:49,338 --> 01:30:52,138
0.5-CARAT NATURAL DIAMOND

2277
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:54,838
This is amazing.
I'll keep this as a family heirloom.

2278
01:30:54,905 --> 01:30:57,338
-Congratulations on your win, Kyuhyun.
-Thank you.

2279
01:30:57,405 --> 01:31:02,238
You won because you kissed
the glistening-eyed giraffe.

2280
01:31:02,305 --> 01:31:04,571
You randomly added the word "kissed."

2281
01:31:04,638 --> 01:31:06,905
SUDDENLY FEELING UNEASY

2282
01:31:06,971 --> 01:31:11,571
We'll be kissing
a different kind of giraffe tomorrow.

2283
01:31:11,638 --> 01:31:13,271
-Are we really kissing them?
-Yes.

2284
01:31:13,338 --> 01:31:16,205
-Let me show you a photo.
-Did you take it yourself?

2285
01:31:16,271 --> 01:31:18,638
-This is what you'll do.
-What is going on?

2286
01:31:19,805 --> 01:31:22,038
THE GIRAFFE IS BOLDER THAN WE THOUGHT

2287
01:31:22,105 --> 01:31:23,905
It's practically eating his face up.

2288
01:31:24,605 --> 01:31:26,105
This is unexpected.

2289
01:31:27,305 --> 01:31:30,771
I'd still do it
if this were the only way to kiss one.

2290
01:31:31,405 --> 01:31:33,638
Do we wait for the kiss?

2291
01:31:33,705 --> 01:31:36,438
-We'll stay still with your eyes closed.
-We just have to stay still.

2292
01:31:36,505 --> 01:31:38,171
THEIR LAST DAY ENDS WITH EXCITEMENT

2293
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:40,571
THE NEXT DAY

2294
01:31:40,638 --> 01:31:43,671
HE PUTS ON LIP BALM
AS HE GETS OUT OF THE CAR

2295
01:31:43,738 --> 01:31:47,205
We're about to meet them at last.

2296
01:31:47,705 --> 01:31:51,238
We're finally achieving our purpose
on our last day.

2297
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:52,471
It's about time.

2298
01:31:52,538 --> 01:31:53,671
Let me remind you.

2299
01:31:53,738 --> 01:31:57,938
The giraffes here
work double shifts at the giraffe hotel.

2300
01:31:58,605 --> 01:32:00,505
They work at the hotel as well.

2301
01:32:00,571 --> 01:32:02,638
-We could've met them there, then.
-That's right.

2302
01:32:05,138 --> 01:32:07,305
THEIR LAST STOP

2303
01:32:08,038 --> 01:32:10,871
THE GIRAFFES HAVE MOVED
FROM THE GIRAFFE HOTEL

2304
01:32:11,905 --> 01:32:14,938
WHICH WAS THE IDIOTS' ORIGINAL DESTINATION

2305
01:32:15,605 --> 01:32:18,771
WHERE THEY PROTECT

2306
01:32:18,838 --> 01:32:22,871
AND CARE FOR THE ENDANGERED
ROTHSCHILD'S GIRAFFES

2307
01:32:23,438 --> 01:32:26,605
THE SITE OFFERS GIRAFFE-FEEDING ACTIVITIES

2308
01:32:29,605 --> 01:32:31,905
AND VARIOUS OTHER EXPERIENCES
WITH THE GIRAFFES

2309
01:32:33,605 --> 01:32:37,871
COME AND HAVE FUN WITH THE GIRAFFES

2310
01:32:37,938 --> 01:32:40,771
-Is that real? Wait, it's real.
-It is.

2311
01:32:40,838 --> 01:32:42,705
-Really?
-I thought it was a statue.

2312
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:44,571
WELCOMING THE GUESTS FROM THE ENTRANCE

2313
01:32:44,638 --> 01:32:46,371
-It looks like a statue.
-It's pretty.

2314
01:32:46,438 --> 01:32:48,638
-It's pretty!
-Oh, it's right in front of us.

2315
01:32:48,705 --> 01:32:49,771
We need to get closer.

2316
01:32:51,771 --> 01:32:53,938
Look at its baby. It's adorable.

2317
01:32:55,371 --> 01:32:56,738
THIS ONE IS ONLY 15 DAYS OLD

2318
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:58,938
How could such an animal exist on Earth?

2319
01:32:59,005 --> 01:33:01,271
It's coming after us
because it knows we have food.

2320
01:33:01,338 --> 01:33:02,605
BABY GIRAFFE WITHOUT HORNS

2321
01:33:02,671 --> 01:33:05,138
Don't those giraffes look a bit older?

2322
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:07,638
NEWBORN GIRAFFES ARE RELEASED
AFTER SOME TIME IN THE SHELTER

2323
01:33:11,105 --> 01:33:14,338
KELLY, 24-YEAR-OLD FEMALE
TALL AND A LITTLE VICIOUS

2324
01:33:14,405 --> 01:33:16,871
AN INTIMATE MOMENT
WITH THE IDIOTS COMING SOON

2325
01:33:16,938 --> 01:33:19,105
AN ELDERLY GIRAFFE
WHO HAS WEATHERED TURMOILS

2326
01:33:19,171 --> 01:33:21,038
-She's a bit old.
-That's very old.

2327
01:33:21,105 --> 01:33:23,538
TIME FOR THEIR PENALTY

2328
01:33:23,605 --> 01:33:25,971
-Kelly is all set for everything.
-With Kelly.

2329
01:33:26,538 --> 01:33:27,371
Su-geun?

2330
01:33:27,438 --> 01:33:29,371
COME ON NOW

2331
01:33:29,438 --> 01:33:31,471
-Are you ready?
-I'll go first.

2332
01:33:31,538 --> 01:33:33,138
There's no way Ji-won will go first.

2333
01:33:33,205 --> 01:33:36,438
-How should I do it?
-I don't think it'll come near.

2334
01:33:36,505 --> 01:33:37,471
Put the treat here?

2335
01:33:37,538 --> 01:33:38,471
NERVOUS WITH EXCITEMENT

2336
01:33:38,538 --> 01:33:40,605
-Do I place it here?
-Move slowly.

2337
01:33:41,105 --> 01:33:42,205
Kelly.

2338
01:33:43,205 --> 01:33:44,605
CHOKING UP

2339
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,338
-What does it feel like?
-How was it?

2340
01:33:53,438 --> 01:33:56,505
It was okay, but her tongue is so coarse.

2341
01:33:56,571 --> 01:33:57,938
That's what they evolved into.

2342
01:33:58,005 --> 01:34:00,705
-Because of acacia trees.
-Oh, right. They eat acacia trees.

2343
01:34:00,771 --> 01:34:03,738
-It felt very coarse.
-Try it one more time.

2344
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:06,571
KELLY NEEDS TO MOISTURIZE HER LIPS

2345
01:34:09,771 --> 01:34:11,738
Ji-won is a scaredy-cat.

2346
01:34:12,938 --> 01:34:14,071
He looks worried.

2347
01:34:14,138 --> 01:34:15,671
JI-WON FEELS SMALL IN FRONT OF KELLY

2348
01:34:22,505 --> 01:34:26,605
EYES SHUT

2349
01:34:26,671 --> 01:34:28,538
Gosh.

2350
01:34:28,605 --> 01:34:30,105
LEAVES WITH A SHARP YELL

2351
01:34:30,171 --> 01:34:32,638
-You should've stayed longer.
-I did.

2352
01:34:32,705 --> 01:34:35,005
-I'll try longer. Hi, Kelly.
-Hey, Su-geun.

2353
01:34:35,071 --> 01:34:37,338
LICKING

2354
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:38,838
That was impressive.

2355
01:34:38,905 --> 01:34:41,271
THE BEST LOVE STORY EVER

2356
01:34:42,071 --> 01:34:45,271
THE AFTERMATH OF THEIR LOVE

2357
01:34:46,138 --> 01:34:47,338
I did great, didn't I?

2358
01:34:48,638 --> 01:34:49,905
Kyuhyun wants to give it a try.

2359
01:34:49,971 --> 01:34:51,571
-Go ahead.
-This is your only chance.

2360
01:34:51,638 --> 01:34:54,871
-I feel like she doesn't like me.
-No, she likes you.

2361
01:34:54,938 --> 01:34:57,671
Give her one as a sample first
and move slowly.

2362
01:34:57,738 --> 01:35:00,471
-Hi, Kelly.
-Kelly.

2363
01:35:01,138 --> 01:35:04,105
CAREFULLY APPROACHING HER

2364
01:35:05,238 --> 01:35:08,005
Why are you trembling?

2365
01:35:14,638 --> 01:35:15,671
-Not too bad, right?
-Yes.

2366
01:35:15,738 --> 01:35:16,905
-It was okay.
-Not too bad.

2367
01:35:16,971 --> 01:35:20,405
-We didn't get saliva all over our faces.
-No, she didn't.

2368
01:35:20,471 --> 01:35:22,671
Thank you, Kelly,
for taking the video with us.

2369
01:35:22,738 --> 01:35:24,305
They're unbelievably beautiful.

2370
01:35:24,371 --> 01:35:26,338
THANKING HER
FOR THE ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE

2371
01:35:26,405 --> 01:35:28,971
-She's got beautiful eyes.
-Look, her eyes are adorable.

2372
01:35:29,038 --> 01:35:30,071
I loved it.

2373
01:35:30,138 --> 01:35:30,971
HAVE A SAFE TRIP

2374
01:35:31,038 --> 01:35:34,005
TAKING PHOTOS AFTER THE KISS

2375
01:35:34,071 --> 01:35:35,238
EDDY
A GENTLE 8-YEAR-OLD MALE

2376
01:35:35,305 --> 01:35:36,305
No way.

2377
01:35:37,138 --> 01:35:38,571
-He's insanely tall.
-Eddy.

2378
01:35:40,638 --> 01:35:41,871
You should smile.

2379
01:35:41,938 --> 01:35:43,438
TENSED UP

2380
01:35:44,005 --> 01:35:44,905
CHUCKLES

2381
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:45,805
Eddy.

2382
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:47,405
Oh, he almost ate my hand.

2383
01:35:47,471 --> 01:35:49,371
GIGGLES

2384
01:35:50,605 --> 01:35:53,271
THREE DIFFERENT PHASES

2385
01:35:53,338 --> 01:35:55,505
-Should I try it?
-Go ahead, I'll take your photo.

2386
01:35:56,071 --> 01:35:58,038
THE YOUNGEST IDIOT GOES FOR IT

2387
01:36:00,138 --> 01:36:01,038
Did you feel it?

2388
01:36:01,105 --> 01:36:02,005
GASPS

2389
01:36:02,071 --> 01:36:03,171
Take a look at this.

2390
01:36:03,238 --> 01:36:04,405
CHUCKLES

2391
01:36:04,971 --> 01:36:07,705
-That makes him look like a horse.
-It looks like a horse.

2392
01:36:07,771 --> 01:36:09,605
This is fun.

2393
01:36:09,671 --> 01:36:12,138
EDDY STILL FEELS QUITE DISTANT

2394
01:36:12,705 --> 01:36:14,205
I kissed a giraffe.

2395
01:36:15,838 --> 01:36:17,371
Four of us here did it.

2396
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,038
AGREEING SHEEPISHLY

2397
01:36:19,105 --> 01:36:22,738
-Hey, there's more over there.
-There are ten of them in total.

2398
01:36:23,771 --> 01:36:24,871
SIGHS

2399
01:36:24,938 --> 01:36:29,405
I've got no regrets
now that I've seen all kinds of animals.

2400
01:36:29,471 --> 01:36:31,171
Humans are weak.

2401
01:36:31,238 --> 01:36:33,805
GETTING SENTIMENTAL
TOWARD THE END OF THEIR TRIP

2402
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:35,738
Let's try laughing. Three, two, one.

2403
01:36:37,171 --> 01:36:40,838
MEMORIES WITH OLD FRIENDS
IN A FARAWAY LAND

2404
01:36:40,905 --> 01:36:41,971
Are you done yet?

2405
01:36:43,405 --> 01:36:44,438
We're done!

2406
01:36:44,505 --> 01:36:45,771
-Thank you.
-Good job, guys.

2407
01:36:45,838 --> 01:36:47,205
THE END FOR REAL!

2408
01:37:51,738 --> 01:37:53,738
