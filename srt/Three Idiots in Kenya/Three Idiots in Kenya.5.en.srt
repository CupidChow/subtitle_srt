1
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:12,838
THREE IDIOTS IN KENYA

2
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:16,571
A FAMILIAR LAYOUT

3
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:20,471
IT'S MORE THAN CLEAR
THAT A DUMPSTER FIRE IS IN ORDER

4
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:22,838
SECOND-ELDEST IDIOT ARRIVES FIRST

5
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:24,205
Come in.

6
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,905
-You want us to hide them.
-How did you end up as number one?

7
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:30,205
WHAT IS IN STORE FOR HIM TURNS OUT TO BE…

8
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:32,405
First off, this game is
the Golden Coffee Bean Mafia.

9
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:33,305
Come again?

10
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:36,571
GOLDEN COFFEE BEAN MAFIA

11
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:39,838
5 GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS
THAT LOOK JUST LIKE KENYA AA COFFEE BEANS

12
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,771
A FIGHT BETWEEN THE PROTECTOR
AND THE PURSUERS

13
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:46,871
There are two Citizens and one Mafia.

14
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:48,371
If you're the Mafia,

15
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:50,971
you must protect
the golden beans for 100 minutes

16
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:53,538
and deliver them to the Mafia King.

17
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:56,271
The Mafia doesn't keep them on him?

18
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:57,871
No, we've already…

19
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:00,338
-You hid them?
-We've hidden them in the lodge.

20
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,238
-In the lodge?
-Yes.

21
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:05,305
It includes the tent and the front yard.

22
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:08,438
THE GAME WILL LAST FOR 100 MINUTES

23
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:10,638
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE AROUND THE LODGE AREA

24
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:13,171
5 GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

25
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:15,838
THE MAFIA MUST PROTECT THEM
WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT

26
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:18,271
WHILE THE CITIZENS TRY TO STEAL THEM

27
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,905
HE HESITANTLY CHOOSES ONE

28
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:24,905
Oh, crap.

29
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:26,305
Show us what you got.

30
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:29,905
CONGRATS

31
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,838
MAFIA, BUT A WANNABE CITIZEN

32
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:35,005
Since you picked the Mafia card,
I'll share the secret rule with you.

33
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:38,338
-The game lasts 100 minutes, right?
-Yes.

34
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:39,805
Every 20 minutes,

35
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:41,738
-you'll be given a mission.
-Okay.

36
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:46,238
If you succeed,
the Citizens won't get a hint.

37
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:49,205
What do you think will happen if you fail?

38
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:51,771
-They'll obtain a hint instead.
-That's right.

39
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:54,405
IF THE MAFIA FAILS IN A MISSION
ASSIGNED EVERY 20 MINUTES

40
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:57,738
THE CITIZENS WILL GET A HINT
ON THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS' LOCATION

41
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:02,271
Please note that you'll have to bring
the gold beans inside its case.

42
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:05,738
HE MUST BRING THEM PLACED IN A RING BOX

43
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:06,805
SIGHS

44
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:10,038
-I understood.
-Good luck.

45
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:11,405
A SIGH FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART

46
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:16,271
-I could pretend to be a Citizen, right?
-Yes, of course.

47
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:17,305
Just like plain Mafia Game.

48
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,938
-Tell the next person to come in.
-All right.

49
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,771
I'm not good at this.

50
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:24,838
PREDESTINED TWO CITIZENS

51
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:26,738
I've never won in this type of game.

52
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:28,905
But in here,

53
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:31,871
we won't have any luck
if they hide objects outside.

54
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:33,471
Outside should be off-limits.

55
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:35,738
Suppose they put it in a hippo's mouth.

56
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:38,705
He's back.
Let's give him a pat-down first.

57
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:40,805
Let's start with that.

58
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:43,371
That's not necessary.

59
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:44,371
HUNTING FOR WHATEVER HE'S HIDING

60
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:46,838
-Come on.
-What do you mean?

61
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:49,605
-Just come here.
-Yes, let's kick things off.

62
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,771
-I don't get what you mean.
-I mean an inspection.

63
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,838
A WARM SEARCH… NO, GREETING

64
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:58,938
-If you play it like this, we're done for.
-It's necessary.

65
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:00,171
THE STRONG PREYING ON THE WEAK

66
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:01,271
There's a line to keep.

67
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:03,305
OVERPOWERED

68
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,205
Frisk him.

69
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:08,538
I don't have anything.
We're not playing that kind of game.

70
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:12,705
DESPITE HIS MENACING ROLE,
HE'S EASILY RESTRAINED BY THE CITIZENS

71
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:14,605
All right, fine.

72
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:17,238
-I'll go next.
-Let's talk after you return.

73
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:19,838
You must find and claim
the gold beans first

74
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,138
and bring them to the Mafia King to win.

75
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:25,271
-And who's the Mafia King?
-As for the Mafia King, we'll--

76
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,038
-It's me.
-Oh, really?

77
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:29,038
We meant to tell you later, but…

78
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:31,871
-You branched out to that world too?
-Yes, it's me.

79
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,338
Draw a card to decide your role.

80
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:37,138
Whenever I play a game like this,
I always get the Citizen.

81
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:42,005
See? I've never played a leading role
in a game like this.

82
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:46,171
The Mafia will have the most fun
since he'd know where the beans are.

83
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:49,005
He'd have a good time
while the Citizens know jack squat.

84
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:52,338
NOT HAVING FUN

85
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:59,405
ONLY THE MAFIA IS TOLD
WHERE THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS ARE

86
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,605
PICTURE NO. 1

87
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:04,338
DETAILED PICTURE NO. 2

88
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:07,038
EUN JI-WON: WHERE IS THAT?

89
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:09,771
THIS GUY DOESN'T KNOW JACK SQUAT EITHER

90
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:11,305
Where is this spot?

91
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,171
Where is this?

92
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:18,138
WE'LL SHOW YOU WHERE THAT IS

93
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:20,771
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
AT THIS BASIN IN THE BATHROOM

94
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,705
YOU'LL FIND A RING BOX
WITH THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

95
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:28,171
AS JI-WON FACES TROUBLE FROM THE START,
A KIND, DETAILED INSTRUCTION FOLLOWS

96
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:31,338
IN THE MEANTIME,
CITIZEN CHO IS INFORMED AS WELL

97
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,005
-Please draw a card first.
-Okay.

98
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:39,105
-That means you'll be a Citizen.
-Okay, I've always wanted to be a Citizen.

99
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,938
Keep in mind that the gold beans

100
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:43,838
are awarded to the person
who brings them to the Mafia King.

101
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:46,205
-He's the winner, right?
-Exactly.

102
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:48,438
-The other citizen will be my competition.
-Right.

103
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,438
Since random searches
won't get you so far,

104
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:53,005
-we'll present you with hints.
-Okay.

105
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:56,638
But we can't reach you on KakaoTalk,
so we'll text you instead.

106
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:57,971
They don't come through that well.

107
00:04:58,505 --> 00:04:59,371
HIS GAME PHONE HAS BAD SERVICE

108
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:01,438
-Well, that's our--
-Can't you slip me notes?

109
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:04,638
You can slip one into my palm
as you pass me by.

110
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,371
-Just like how we did in the morning?
-Yes.

111
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:12,938
Anyhow, you're going to be giving me hints
during the 100 minutes?

112
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:15,271
You don't know the circumstances
where hints can be given,

113
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,005
so you'll have to be aware--

114
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:21,438
Oh, does that mean
that we may have to meet

115
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:25,405
the necessary and sufficient condition
to receive our hints?

116
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:26,571
PRODUCTION CREW STARTLED

117
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:29,838
-We can't share that just now.
-Why not? Isn't that fair enough?

118
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:33,905
-You're on the right path.
-Oh, all right.

119
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:35,605
ENDING WITH A SHARP FINAL QUESTION

120
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,738
-Okay, see you in 100 minutes.
-Sounds good.

121
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:41,205
ROLE SELECTION COMPLETE

122
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:45,705
MAFIA EUN VS CITIZENS

123
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,271
THE MAFIA IS STILL STRUGGLING

124
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:49,905
ZOOMING IN AND OUT

125
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:51,871
Where the heck is this?

126
00:05:51,938 --> 00:05:52,771
IT'S STILL A MYSTERY

127
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:55,705
UNLIKE THE CLUELESS YOUNGER MEMBER

128
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,838
THE ELDEST'S INSTINCT
TAKES HIM TO THE BATHROOM

129
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,938
I bet he's the Mafia.

130
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:08,705
Do you know why Ji-won is vegging out?
It's because he knows where they are.

131
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:11,205
He doesn't have to look for them.

132
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,005
STILL HAS NO CLUE

133
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,738
I can read their actions.

134
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:21,738
They were in shows like The Genius.

135
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,105
What was that?

136
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:28,271
A FART WITH THE MAGICAL POWER
TO LOCATE THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

137
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:33,405
-Jeez, what the heck?
-What's wrong?

138
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,738
Jeez, what the heck?

139
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:36,371
RETREATING QUICKLY

140
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,405
SKEDADDLING AT THE AGE OF FIFTY

141
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:40,805
What's wrong?

142
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:43,105
I thought I ran into a ghost.

143
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:45,805
Tell me if I got it wrong.
Was that a person?

144
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,371
What exactly did you see?

145
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:52,405
I don't get spooked so easily,
but that was just…

146
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:56,105
AN IMAGINARY GHOST
HAS KEYED UP HIS WHINING

147
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:57,671
-It was there.
-Is it Kyuhyun?

148
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:03,038
No, I was observing things over here
when a figure appeared.

149
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:04,871
I was startled out of my wits.

150
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:07,305
NOT A GHOST BUT A STAFF MEMBER

151
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:09,905
THE YOUNGEST CITIZEN ARRIVES
WHILE THE COWARDS ARE SHUDDERING

152
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:12,571
GAME BEGINS

153
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:13,771
-Su-geun.
-Yes?

154
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,238
-He's the Mafia.
-I thought so too.

155
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:17,905
THE PRIME SUSPECT FROM THE GET-GO

156
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,205
I realized from his movements.

157
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:22,638
I started searching the moment I got here.

158
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:25,305
-But he didn't flinch.
-Weren't you searching over there?

159
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,671
-Yes.
-From the back, right?

160
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,638
Look at him.

161
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:28,605
FALTERING

162
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:30,371
How could you accuse me right off the bat?

163
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:33,071
I'm certain it's you.
The Citizens can always stand tall.

164
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:37,271
-That's a bold statement.
-Are you suggesting I can't?

165
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:40,405
Su-geun did his search
before coming back in.

166
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:41,671
-I did.
-Who do you mean?

167
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:45,071
Ji-won was on his bed after returning.
He has to be the Mafia.

168
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:47,538
-A Citizen would be looking for the prize.
-You bet.

169
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:50,005
-No, I was trying to identify the Mafia.
-You're the Mafia.

170
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:54,138
He's good at acting.
I know you were on game shows like this.

171
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:57,238
SITTING STILL
WHEN HE WAS LEFT WITH SU-GEUN

172
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,638
OR WHEN HE WAS LEFT WITH KYUHYUN

173
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:04,205
-The gold beans must be tiny.
-No, we won't be able to see them.

174
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:05,505
That would be the point.

175
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:08,238
The staff members
came to the lodge a couple of times.

176
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:11,638
-In that case, they set up the lights…
-Hold on.

177
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:13,638
We can retrace their steps.

178
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:15,738
HERE'S A PERSON WHO CAN'T FIGURE OUT
EVEN WHEN GIVEN THE ANSWER

179
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:17,338
That should tell us the location.

180
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:19,305
-Stay right here.
-Why?

181
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:22,071
Don't try anything funny.

182
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:24,538
-Stay put if you're not the Mafia.
-I doubt it's you.

183
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,005
-I'm certain he's the fishy one.
-Just a second.

184
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:31,071
WHILE BEFUDDLED JI-WON
RAMBLES OUT HIS WEAK EXCUSES

185
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:32,171
Just a second.

186
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:37,638
Could it be?

187
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:39,371
I bet it's for something else.

188
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:41,005
You can't have found them already.

189
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:42,771
SIZING IT UP WITH A SIDEWAY GLANCE

190
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,105
THEN, PASSING BY NONCHALANTLY

191
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,605
Isn't it strange how it just hung there?

192
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,938
You're misdirecting us again.

193
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:52,938
ENTERING THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEAN ZONE
AFTER A HALFHEARTED COMMENT

194
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:58,005
All we have to do
is complete missions to earn hints.

195
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,338
HE MANAGED TO RAISE THE HURDLE
DESPITE THE VISUAL AID

196
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,438
Where are they?

197
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,538
They couldn't have made it so easy.

198
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,905
-They might have put…
-A clue?

199
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,405
Something else, yes.

200
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:11,638
ACTUALLY…

201
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:14,771
WHEN THE IDIOTS ARRIVED IN THE SAFARI

202
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:19,738
THE SACHET WAS ALREADY THERE

203
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:22,171
I wonder what the nutty smell is.

204
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:24,505
I can smell it whenever I get here.

205
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:26,538
THE AROMATIC SACHET DID ITS DUTY

206
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,138
I smell coconut.

207
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:31,871
BY COINCIDENCE,
THE BAG IS FILLED WITH COFFEE BEANS

208
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,471
-It has coffee beans inside.
-As a bait?

209
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:36,805
These can't be the real thing.
They wouldn't have made it so easy.

210
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:38,505
Their scent is exquisite, though.

211
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:40,805
There could be one in there.

212
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,605
MAFIA SLIPS IN AND JOINS THEM

213
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:45,371
-In that short amount of time,
-So there are coffee beans in there.

214
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:48,505
Ji-won must've snuck in
and hidden one over there.

215
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,838
You're unbelievable.

216
00:09:51,705 --> 00:09:53,005
I'm waiting for the mission.

217
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:54,671
Just think.

218
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,538
Where did the staff members visit?

219
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:59,505
They were all over the place.

220
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:02,038
HE'S BLATANTLY ASKING FOR HELP

221
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:03,705
Could they have hidden them
in our suitcases?

222
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:04,671
Wait, Su-geun.

223
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,205
Ji-won could've moved them
from the initial location.

224
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:10,271
No way.

225
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:13,505
-Can't he move them?
-I would've caught it

226
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,938
if he had tried anything
while you were away.

227
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:19,905
-They would give us hints.
-Yes, we have to collect them first.

228
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:23,405
That's exactly what I pointed out
in the first place, Su-geun.

229
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:26,638
But the Mafia knows where they are.

230
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:27,905
HE DOESN'T KNOW

231
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:29,738
-The Mafia--
-But we don't.

232
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,038
-That's why--
-The Citizens don't.

233
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:33,505
That's why I wanted the hints
and observed his actions…

234
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:37,871
I mean, his reactions.
Didn't I tell you from the beginning?

235
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,838
I'm not suspecting either of you.

236
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:45,205
I'm just going to do
what I can to catch someone acting out.

237
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:48,571
At the end of the day,
even a Citizen has to claim the beans

238
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:50,271
-to be declared the winner.
-Right.

239
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:52,038
What's our prize, by the way?

240
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:53,771
The beans are worth two million won.

241
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:56,505
-The beans are worth two million.
-That's what I said.

242
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:58,938
-So those are made of gold.
-They'd have to be.

243
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,205
Gold price is off the charts.

244
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,705
-Could we accept them?
-She said the beans were made of gold.

245
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:05,971
Kyuhyun lost his phone, so…

246
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:08,505
If you're frank with us,
I won't try to hold you back.

247
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:11,305
-What do you mean?
-Let's say we have five minutes left.

248
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,805
No one would win

249
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:15,505
if you kept us here until time ran out
regardless of our roles.

250
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:17,138
STARTLED

251
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:20,671
Su-geun, that'd be a low blow.

252
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:23,838
-Did you hear him call it a low blow?
-It is what it is.

253
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:27,505
-We have to get him no matter what.
-Hey, the Mafia would want to stay here.

254
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:29,738
He'd want that to guard the beans.

255
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:32,571
If anyone tries to keep us here,
he's the suspicious one.

256
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,905
RULE COMPREHENSION ISSUES
ONE CITIZEN SIDES WITH THE MAFIA

257
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:37,138
MAKING THE OTHER CITIZEN FRUSTRATED

258
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:40,138
THE REAL MAFIA IS THROWN OFF
BY THIS DEVELOPMENT

259
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:41,771
Does the Mafia have to deliver the beans?

260
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:43,938
ALL PLAYERS MUST DELIVER
THE BEANS TO THE MAFIA KING

261
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,271
They're confusing me.

262
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,771
-Are they just lousy actors?
-You heard the Mafia's instruction?

263
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:49,138
Man, this is so confusing.

264
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:50,805
-Su-geun.
-Yes?

265
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:52,805
Did she tell you the Mafia's goal?

266
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:55,738
I'm sure she told you too.
You just didn't ask for clarification.

267
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:56,705
Did she tell you, Ji-won?

268
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:02,305
-About how the Mafia has to collect them?
-To pass them to the Mafia King.

269
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,705
I only heard about the Citizens.

270
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:06,038
A SLOPPY PRETENSE

271
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:10,738
I feel at ease
because their acting is so obvious.

272
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:12,538
How is it going?

273
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:14,671
CITIZEN LEE'S DEDUCTION LOG

274
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:16,371
One thing I'm certain of

275
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:19,338
is the look Ji-won has on his face
when he's lying.

276
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,171
We've been friends for long.
I can tell he's lying his ass off.

277
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:28,838
He's lying on the bed
to ease his body and soul.

278
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,238
I know him too well.

279
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:32,905
DEALING WITH STRESS AS THE MAFIA

280
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:36,305
He'd say, "Why won't you believe me?"
with his eyes wide open.

281
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:37,971
EXHIBIT A

282
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:39,305
EXHIBIT B

283
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:42,238
I was almost set
on picking Ji-won as the Mafia…

284
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:43,438
Is he the Mafia?

285
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:45,038
There's about a 70% chance.

286
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:46,305
A 70% CHANCE OF A STRESSED MAFIA

287
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:50,871
If someone blocks the doors
to keep us inside with five minutes left,

288
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,638
none of us would win
as no one would get to the Mafia King.

289
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:57,138
When I pointed that out,
Kyuhyun bristled all of a sudden.

290
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:58,638
BRISTLING

291
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:00,871
AND ANOTHER OUTBURST

292
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:03,271
I couldn't get why he'd lose his cool.

293
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:05,671
-A Citizen wouldn't, you see.
-You're right.

294
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:09,538
A 30% CHANCE OF AN OVERREACTING MAFIA

295
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,571
That got me puzzled.

296
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:15,671
THE 30%-CHANCE MAFIA
APPROACHES THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEAN ZONE

297
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,271
A SEARCH GUIDED BY HIS INSTINCT

298
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:26,371
HE'S GOTTEN PRETTY CLOSE
TO THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

299
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:30,505
WHAT A SHAME

300
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:42,171
QUITE DEFT FINGERS
BEFITTING THE 30%-CHANCE MAFIA

301
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,705
BUT AS FOR THIS SACHET…

302
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:48,438
AFTER SEEING KYUHYUN FALL FOR ONE

303
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:51,971
THE REAL MAFIA TOOK
AN AIR FRESHENER IN THE BATHROOM

304
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:53,971
CHECKED WHAT OTHERS WERE DOING

305
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:56,671
AND HID IT AGAIN

306
00:13:56,738 --> 00:14:00,838
HE FAILED TO FIND THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS
AND ONLY SET UP A TRAP FOR OTHERS

307
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:04,571
THIS BAG IS ALSO FILLED
WITH NUTTY COFFEE BEANS

308
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:07,038
AROMATIC

309
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:13,605
POCKETS THE SACHET
AFTER CHECKING IT IN SECRET UNDER THE LAMP

310
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:16,238
A MOMENT LATER…

311
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:19,071
THE STRESSED MAFIA RUSHES IN

312
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:26,138
NOTICES JI-WON'S SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR

313
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,605
CONFIRMS THAT THE SACHET IS MISSING

314
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:35,538
Hey, I… Get it over here.

315
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:37,805
You took it, right?

316
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,271
-It's Ji-won for sure.
-I identified the Mafia, Su-geun.

317
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,705
-Hey, where is it?
-Su-geun.

318
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:45,405
-I went to the bathroom just a moment ago.
-Yes?

319
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:49,538
-Give it back. Where is it, idiot?
-Look what he's doing.

320
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:51,038
-What's up?
-What do you mean?

321
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,605
Where is the bag of coffee beans?

322
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,971
-Where was it?
-It was right here.

323
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,905
-Another one was behind the basin.
-Where, exactly?

324
00:14:56,971 --> 00:15:00,371
-There was one behind the basin?
-There was one clearly behind it.

325
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:02,905
-You two knew about this?
-How did you know?

326
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:04,005
I saw one here.

327
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,171
-Why didn't you tell us, then?
-It's gone.

328
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,471
-Why didn't you tell us?
-What's going on between you two?

329
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:10,671
-Give it back.
-I don't have it. Answer my question.

330
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:13,438
One of you must be a Citizen.
Confide in me too.

331
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:16,005
THIS GOOD CITIZEN IS LEFT OUT
AND NOT EVEN SUSPECTED

332
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:18,071
-Why did you take it?
-Why didn't you tell us?

333
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:19,805
Why did you take it and keep it a secret?

334
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:23,805
-I finally got it.
-You get it, right?

335
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,505
-You're the Mafia.
-Exactly.

336
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,971
But he found the gold beans
to keep them for himself.

337
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:29,571
This Citizen hid them.

338
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,738
I can't believe you two.

339
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,871
We're both Citizens. You get that, right?

340
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:38,571
KYUHYUN'S SCHEME IS BUSTED

341
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,405
-Let's say I took them.
-That little…

342
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:43,371
-He's the Mafia 100%.
-Why didn't he tell us, then?

343
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,705
THE ONLY GOOD SOUL IS BEING TROLLED

344
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:49,305
He knows about the bag of beans
because he's the Mafia.

345
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:52,271
It's certain that Ji-won is the Mafia.

346
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:55,005
-I'm sure it was right here.
-So someone found them.

347
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:59,171
-One of you has already found them.
-You caught my drift, right?

348
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:02,038
Ji-won found it first, but left it here.

349
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:03,205
He stole them.

350
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:06,138
Ji-won left the sachet where it was.

351
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,871
Kyuhyun then found it and hid it.

352
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:15,071
You're even worse than the Mafia.

353
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:18,205
-You fooled a fellow Citizen.
-Wait, Su-geun.

354
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:19,805
We need to identify the Mafia.

355
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:21,971
-When did you have the time to--
-You remember how he went in

356
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:23,338
-as we were talking?
-Sure.

357
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:27,105
Oh, man. Spoken like a true Mafia.
You're really something.

358
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:29,071
STRIDING UP

359
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,671
They couldn't have made it so easy.

360
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:32,305
I don't have it, Ji-won.

361
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:36,438
THE CITIZEN IS INDIFFERENT
TO THE PERFORMANCE

362
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:39,371
-It's strange you went outside.
-But I didn't.

363
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:41,371
SQUABBLING

364
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:43,605
-What are you doing?
-Wait, Ji-won.

365
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,805
It's suspicious that you left the lodge.

366
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,138
THE BICKERING SUSPECTS
LEAVE THE CRIME SCENE

367
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:51,005
WHILE THE OLD DETECTIVE OBSERVES THEM

368
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:53,238
Darn it. They beat me to it.

369
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,571
Help me find them, then.

370
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:57,705
DETECTIVE LEE ON PURSUIT

371
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:00,605
I've reached my conclusion.

372
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,671
Su-geun.

373
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:04,205
As the representative of the Citizens,

374
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:07,771
I'll explain what happened
to the lost Golden Coffee Beans.

375
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:09,905
CITIZEN LEE'S DEDUCTION LOG 2

376
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:11,705
THE CASE RECREATED

377
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:13,571
Ji-won is the Mafia.

378
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,971
He let his guard down
and left the sachet unattended

379
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:17,705
to avoid our suspicion.

380
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,838
But Kyuhyun, a Citizen, found it.

381
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,238
He should've come to me,
his fellow Citizen,

382
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,338
to inform me of it
and discuss our next step,

383
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:27,205
but he hid it somewhere
so he could hog the prize.

384
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:28,905
PRETTY SPOT ON

385
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,438
That's why Ji-won, the Mafia,
is stressed out.

386
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,705
As a fellow Citizen…

387
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:36,271
IT HAS BEEN 20 MINUTES
SINCE THE GAME BEGAN

388
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:37,471
-Because…
-Su-geun.

389
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:43,038
A CLEAR CHIME FROM HIS NEW DEVICE

390
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,405
MAKES THE SACHET THIEF CHECK HIS PHONE

391
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:47,305
PRODUCTION CREW

392
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:50,705
AS THE MAFIA COMPLETED HIS MISSION,
YOU WON'T RECEIVE A HINT

393
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,771
Su-geun.

394
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:56,405
"As the Mafia completed his mission,
you won't receive a hint…"

395
00:17:57,605 --> 00:18:00,471
-What? I didn't get any texts.
-I didn't get anything either.

396
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,705
TERRIFYINGLY CALM MAFIA EUN

397
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:04,005
How did the Mafia manage it?

398
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:05,138
15 MINUTES AGO

399
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:10,571
WHILE THE CITIZENS WERE ABSORBED
IN THEIR ARGUMENT

400
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:14,205
MAFIA EUN RECEIVED A TEXT

401
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:16,638
This is…

402
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:18,538
THIS IS YOUR FIRST MISSION
TURN THE MAIN LAMP ON AND OFF 3 TIMES

403
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:22,105
HE HAD NO ONE UNDERFOOT

404
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,438
CORRECT SWITCH IDENTIFIED

405
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:34,005
Maybe they use this to call the hippos.

406
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,171
What's that noise?

407
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:37,838
Maybe they use this to call the hippos.

408
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:44,371
INDECIPHERABLE BUT CAPTIVATING CHANT

409
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:48,938
IN THE BACKGROUND,
THE LIGHTS IN THE TENT FLICKERED

410
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,505
Which one is the main lamp?

411
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:51,405
BOLDLY START MISSION

412
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:55,305
This one. The main lamp is right here.

413
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:59,438
Don't I have a point, Ji-won?
I don't get why that got Kyuhyun on edge.

414
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,638
THE CITIZEN ARRIVED A BIT LATE

415
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:04,505
-That's my point exactly.
-Of course, I'd be annoyed.

416
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:06,971
THE MAFIA LEFT THE SCENE
AFTER THE PERFECT MISSION

417
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:09,438
MISSION COMPLETE

418
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:12,805
WHILE THE CITIZENS ARE CONFUSED

419
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:15,171
THE MAFIA RECEIVES A TEXT

420
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,171
THIS IS YOUR SECOND MISSION
HUG THEM FROM THE BACK

421
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:19,971
Did they send it to just you?

422
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,571
THEY'LL WANT TO CHECK MY INBOX,
SO SEND ME THE SAME TEXT

423
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,405
HE MAY MAKE A TYPO,
BUT HE HAS A THOROUGH PLAN

424
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:26,871
SECURED AN ALIBI

425
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:28,438
Hey, I got a text.

426
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:29,971
What text?

427
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:30,871
BEGINS HIS ACTING

428
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:37,138
"As the Mafia completed his mission,
you won't receive a hint."

429
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:39,205
What about the second hint?

430
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:41,871
-Do we get nothing?
-The Mafia succeeded?

431
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:45,838
How did he… What did he do?

432
00:19:45,905 --> 00:19:47,138
Kyuhyun must be the Mafia.

433
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:48,305
When he stepped outside,

434
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:50,805
-he must've done something.
-Do you now regret hounding me?

435
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:53,605
THE GREEDY CITIZEN IS PUT IN A TOUGH SPOT

436
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,938
How did the Mafia succeed?
I thought he had to deliver them.

437
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,938
-Give it up now.
-I'm not joking.

438
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,071
-Your acting sucks.
-That must not be the mission.

439
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:02,871
It's so crappy that it reeks.

440
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:05,871
You and your crappy acting.

441
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,505
BODY ODOR ALLEGATIONS

442
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,271
Hey, don't block the tent!

443
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:10,938
How did the Mafia succeed?

444
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:12,938
THE CITIZENS ARE CLUELESS

445
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:16,171
WHILE THE MAFIA STARTS GEARING UP

446
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:18,438
-Okay, I get it.
-We must stick together.

447
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:20,271
Kyuhyun can't act at all.

448
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,605
AFTER HOLDING SU-GEUN'S SHOULDERS TIGHTLY

449
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:24,738
JI-WON MOVES TOWARD HIS NEXT TARGET

450
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:25,705
Bring it here.

451
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,971
THE FRAMED CITIZEN APPROACHES HIM,
NOT REALIZING HIS PLOT

452
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:32,671
How did you do it? Spill now, Mafia.

453
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:34,638
SLITHERING HIS ARMS
AROUND KYUHYUN'S SHOULDERS

454
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:35,838
Come on now.

455
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:38,605
AND JUST LIKE THAT,
THE CITIZENS ARE ROBBED BLIND

456
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,805
CLEARS HIS MISSION IN JUST 2 MINUTES

457
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:44,471
-I'm losing my mind here.
-My fellow Citizen,

458
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:47,138
-I don't follow at all.
-I think there are more bags.

459
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:49,571
-Let's find them.
-Let's do that.

460
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:53,405
-I doubt there are multiple gold beans.
-The Mafia completed his mission, right?

461
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:55,805
What could he have done?

462
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:02,238
-That came out of nowhere.
-Whoever the Mafia is…

463
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:05,171
Why change the subject?
We should find the beans first.

464
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:08,605
EVADING THE QUESTION
WITH AN AWKWARD DISPLAY OF LEADERSHIP

465
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:10,538
Remember, I brought up the beans first.

466
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:14,538
This game has a flaw.

467
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:18,171
It prevents the Citizens
from forming a united front.

468
00:21:18,238 --> 00:21:21,005
Due to the design of the game,

469
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:25,471
the Citizens end up
giving in to materialism.

470
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,371
Tempted by the thought
of hogging the prize,

471
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:31,438
good Citizens end up becoming a Mafia.

472
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:32,571
That's how this is.

473
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:35,138
This game turns everyone into a villain.

474
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:39,738
I can say so because we have two Citizens
who can't work together.

475
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:42,205
Maybe they're outside.

476
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:43,338
VILLAIN HIMSELF

477
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:46,771
SEARCHING THE FELLOW CITIZEN'S BELONGINGS

478
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,938
STEALS KYUHYUN'S FAVORITE SACHET

479
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:54,205
CAUGHT RED-HANDED

480
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,105
Darn it.

481
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:59,238
-You're a Citizen, right? I bet you are.
-I am.

482
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:01,905
That's a bait though.

483
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:07,238
-Why did you hide it then?
-Just because Ji-won acted all shady.

484
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:08,538
The real things aren't there.

485
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:12,971
Come on.
Would I be here if I weren't a Citizen?

486
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:15,371
-But you didn't tell me.
-Hear me out.

487
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:18,705
THE PREVIOUS EVENTS
LEFT A BAD TASTE IN SU-GEUN'S MOUTH

488
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,571
Ji-won went straight to the bathroom.

489
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:24,271
FIXATED ON BEAN EXAMINATION
REGARDLESS OF KYUHYUN'S INPUT

490
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:28,138
A TEXT ALERT BREAKS THE SILENCE

491
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,038
Hold on, Su-geun.

492
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:36,971
AS THE MAFIA COMPLETED HIS SECOND MISSION,
YOU WON'T RECEIVE A HINT

493
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:38,371
NEWS OF THE SECOND MISSION

494
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:40,671
Oh, Ji-won!

495
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:42,771
-What's up?
-I found the bag Kyuhyun was hiding.

496
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:45,638
What was that?

497
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:47,271
MR. GREED TURNS TO THE MAFIA,
AND NOT THE GOOD CITIZEN

498
00:22:47,338 --> 00:22:49,605
-I hid the coffee beans that I found.
-Okay.

499
00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:52,738
-Did Su-geun find them?
-Yes, and the moment he did,

500
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:57,805
I got a text telling me there'd be no hint
as the Mafia cleared his mission.

501
00:22:57,871 --> 00:22:59,605
SHARING INTEL ON THE MAFIA
WITH THE REAL MAFIA

502
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:03,138
TWO EVIL IDIOTS OBSERVING THE KIND CITIZEN

503
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:05,471
-I think he's the Mafia.
-He cleared the mission?

504
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:07,505
That text came
the moment he seized my stuff.

505
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,371
BUT THEN…

506
00:23:11,438 --> 00:23:14,405
Did you see me find the coffee beans
Kyuhyun kept hidden?

507
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,771
I found them in his suitcase,
but they were plain beans.

508
00:23:17,338 --> 00:23:18,705
-Plain beans?
-He still hid them.

509
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:21,271
-Are you sure?
-Yes, you bet I am.

510
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:23,271
Ji-won rushed in immediately
after I found it.

511
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:25,405
INADVERTENTLY CORNERED
BECAUSE OF THE INNOCENT CITIZENS

512
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,905
Darn it, I feel so lost.

513
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:31,671
He's acting all wishy-washy.
It's not like his usual self.

514
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:34,638
-I'm surprisingly naive.
-This is really odd.

515
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:39,271
The internet service is awful here.

516
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:41,305
I CAN'T FIND THEM
WHERE ARE THEY?

517
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:43,671
FAILED TO SEND SOS MESSAGES

518
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:45,171
What are you doing?

519
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:48,838
-Are you playing a game?
-No, KakaoTalk.

520
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,705
In this situation?

521
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,071
Kyuhyun is the Mafia for sure.

522
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:54,638
HE NEEDS TO TEXT
SINCE HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW THE LOCATION

523
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:58,771
THIS IS YOUR THIRD MISSION
PREPARE RAMYEON AND FINISH IT ALONE

524
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,305
A MISSION TEXT COMES THROUGH
WHILE HIS TEXT WON'T SEND

525
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:05,271
WHEN A STAFF MEMBER CAME
TO LET THEM KNOW OF THE EVENING'S SCHEDULE

526
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:08,605
SHE BROUGHT THE RAMYEON SET
SU-GEUN WON IN THE DRAWING CONTEST

527
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:12,971
PIE IN THE SKY

528
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:17,438
Hey, why would you bother with the sachet?
You're the one who hid it.

529
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:18,805
Everyone, sit down.

530
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,405
-Fine.
-Don't go anywhere.

531
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:22,671
Stay in one place
until the next mission alert comes.

532
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:25,805
If we get another mission success text,
Kyuhyun is the Mafia.

533
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:27,905
Because he's the only one
who has snuck outside.

534
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:29,138
Let's see.

535
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:31,505
GAUGING THE MOOD

536
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,971
-Hey, that's for the ramyeon.
-Oh, I see.

537
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:38,371
Let's have some ramyeon.

538
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:40,471
I'll teach the remaining Citizen a lesson.

539
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:42,305
-Let's make ramyeon.
-We can't do that now.

540
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:44,638
-We'll do that after the game.
-The Citizens are…

541
00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:48,705
THE CITIZENS ARE TOO BUSY
HULLING INSULTS TO CARE ABOUT RAMYEON

542
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:50,838
I'll give you the rundown again.

543
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:52,238
You're the Mafia, Ji-won.

544
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:55,338
Kyuhyun's a Citizen
who's worse than the Mafia.

545
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:56,738
That's it.

546
00:24:56,805 --> 00:25:00,305
That's how I see things,
so you two can fight to the death.

547
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:03,071
-Why are you taking a pass?
-Because I'm clueless.

548
00:25:03,138 --> 00:25:04,771
-I've got nothing.
-Why are you a Citizen?

549
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,938
-Because I am one.
-We've had no hints.

550
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,971
-I found the sachet in your things.
-Why did you come out looking like this?

551
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:12,171
To hog the prize, I bet.

552
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,271
-But the real ones weren't there.
-That makes you evil too.

553
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:16,371
-What nonsense is this?
-You're evil too.

554
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:17,871
You're a trashy Citizen.

555
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,538
Take your beans, idiot.

556
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,505
INCENSED SU-GEUN
THROWS THE SACHET OF BEANS

557
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:22,671
What a load of bull!

558
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:26,171
Show me the gold beans
and prove your logic.

559
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:30,138
You're even worse than the Mafia.
A piece of trash citizen.

560
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:31,871
You're the Mafia, but a dumb one.

561
00:25:31,938 --> 00:25:33,871
-What did I do?
-You…

562
00:25:33,938 --> 00:25:35,105
You're a sweet kid.

563
00:25:35,171 --> 00:25:37,171
Cut your ties with the Mafia
and turn over a new leaf.

564
00:25:37,238 --> 00:25:40,638
-Make an honest living.
-I only thought they were gold beans!

565
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,905
-I was certain those were gold ones.
-I'll give you my summary again.

566
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:48,138
-You're the Mafia, but a stupid one.
-Why am I the Mafia?

567
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:50,771
-Remember that pig-like character?
-Who do you mean?

568
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:52,638
Tumbo or Tembo… Anyhow, you're like him.

569
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:55,005
-Did you mean Pumbaa?
-Yes, Pumbaa.

570
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,805
This is so much fun,
even if it's just us three.

571
00:25:57,871 --> 00:25:59,605
In this tiny village…

572
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,771
THERE IS NO TEAM SPIRIT
IN THIS THREE-PERSON VILLAGE

573
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:04,171
THE ESSENCE OF GREED
SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR

574
00:26:04,238 --> 00:26:07,505
At the very least,
two Citizens should be on the same side.

575
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:10,938
Su-geun, I'll be the bad guy.
You can work with your fellow Citizen.

576
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,038
-With who?
-With the Citizen.

577
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:14,205
THE PUMBAA… NO, MAFIA
VOLUNTEERS TO BE THE TRASH

578
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:17,238
A LEGIT TRASHY CITIZEN
COLLECTS AIR FRESHENER JUST IN CASE

579
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:19,638
Kyuhyun, you said
you didn't open the sachet.

580
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:21,338
-But you told me there was no gold.
-I did.

581
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:24,405
I did to get it back
because I honestly am a trashy Citizen.

582
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:27,038
He just admitted
to being a trashy Citizen.

583
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:30,538
I so wish you'd give up
your life as the Mafia.

584
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:33,271
-Return to the village and find a job.
-Okay.

585
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:34,938
THE WHOLE VILLAGE DISSUADES JI-WON
FROM LIVING THE MAFIA LIFE

586
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:38,071
Things are bleak
because of a dumb Citizen like you.

587
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,971
-No, I'm doing great between you two.
-Unbelievable.

588
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:44,671
THE MISSION TIME ENDS
BEFORE JI-WON EVEN BOILS THE WATER

589
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,105
Hey, I got a text.

590
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,771
A TEXT ARRIVES

591
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:50,105
-Even if I wanted to--
-Hey, look!

592
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:52,705
The Mafia failed to carry out his mission.

593
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:54,238
They're somewhere near Su-geun.

594
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:56,338
I knew it. He's the Mafia again for sure.

595
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:58,471
AS THE MAFIA FAILED IN HIS MISSION,
YOU WILL BE GIVEN A HINT

596
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:01,305
GOLDEN COFFEE BEAN'S CURRENT LOCATION:
NEAR SU-GEUN, IN A RING BOX

597
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,205
Would they have used my name
if I were the Mafia?

598
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,205
THE PACK OF HYENAS
SURROUNDS THE GOOD CIVILIAN

599
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:08,205
COINCIDENTALLY, WAY BEHIND SU-GEUN'S BACK

600
00:27:08,938 --> 00:27:11,905
AND IN THE BATHROOM
ARE WHERE THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS ARE

601
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:13,405
-What did the text say?
-If so,

602
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,271
the hint would never say
they were near me.

603
00:27:15,338 --> 00:27:16,505
STEALTHILY CHECKING THE MISSION

604
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:18,305
What does that even mean?

605
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,405
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH MISSION

606
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:21,371
You're all idiots.

607
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:23,471
SHOW THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS TO THE CAMERA

608
00:27:23,538 --> 00:27:25,605
Still, things are getting heated.

609
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:29,438
As it turns out,
you little punks haven't located the gold.

610
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:32,471
I still have my shot.

611
00:27:32,538 --> 00:27:34,705
-You little punks.
-What do you mean?

612
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:39,438
CONSIDERING THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION
OF THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEAN'S CASE

613
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:42,505
THEY'LL FIND IT IN NO TIME

614
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:43,838
Somewhere near Su-geun…

615
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:47,238
STARTS WANDERING AROUND IN THE BATHROOM

616
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:50,971
IT'S JUST AN ARM'S REACH AWAY

617
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:56,071
FINALLY LOCATED THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

618
00:27:56,138 --> 00:27:59,905
Ji-won, get over here already.

619
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,071
Ji-won.

620
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,171
STARTLED

621
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:03,438
Get over here already.

622
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:05,438
They might be here.

623
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:08,205
If they are near me,
they must be inside the suitcases.

624
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:17,671
JI-WON'S GOLDEN-COFFEE-BEAN AROMA
HAS ATTRACTED THE YOUNGER CITIZEN

625
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,138
Can you turn on the light here?

626
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:22,438
A SUDDEN GLOW-UP ATTEMPT
IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT

627
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:26,771
THE EVIL CITIZEN KEEPS A CLOSE WATCH

628
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,871
THE SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR
TRIGGERS A BODY SEARCH

629
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:32,505
Did my eyes play a trick on me?

630
00:28:32,571 --> 00:28:33,605
I saw you carrying something.

631
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,071
-It was this.
-Was that it?

632
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,905
STUDIO FIX LONGWEAR CUSHION FROM M.A.C

633
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:40,871
DODGED A BULLET WITH A WEIRD COVER STORY

634
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:42,838
He's putting on makeup at this hour?

635
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:46,538
-How strange, right?
-What's up with him?

636
00:28:47,138 --> 00:28:51,338
THE NERVOUS MAFIA BIDES HIS TIME

637
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:56,105
NOTICEABLY TIRED
DESPITE THE NEWLY APPLIED MAKEUP

638
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:58,138
Did you finish going through my stuff?

639
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:03,605
Why are you asking me that?

640
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:04,771
You were going through before.

641
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:07,805
OBTAINED THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

642
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:12,671
WALKS PAST THE CITIZENS
PREOCCUPIED WITH THE SEARCH

643
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:16,871
CHECKS THE CAMERA'S POSITION

644
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:21,305
THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

645
00:29:27,005 --> 00:29:30,205
COMPLETES HIS MISSION
WHILE PRETENDING TO STRETCH HIMSELF

646
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,738
FOURTH MISSION COMPLETE

647
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,438
The Mafia must've moved them.

648
00:29:35,438 --> 00:29:37,538
MEANWHILE, THE CITIZENS
ARE STILL SEARCHING

649
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:38,671
Where's Su-geun?

650
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,471
-In the bathroom.
-He's not.

651
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:46,471
-What on earth? I just saw him.
-I'm not lying.

652
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:48,471
Oh, for Christ's sake!

653
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:52,405
HAPPY

654
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:56,238
ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK

655
00:29:56,305 --> 00:29:57,238
Team Citizen.

656
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:58,971
That was us working together.

657
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:01,805
-My heart is racing.
-What did you think was inside?

658
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:02,805
What?

659
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:06,005
THEY HIT 68-MINUTE MARK
WITH THE SURPRISE ATTACK

660
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,105
STRAINED MOVEMENTS

661
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:13,371
THE SCARED MAFIA

662
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,605
AND THE GOOD CITIZEN TURNED EVIL

663
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:18,971
-Stay still.
-What do you mean?

664
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:21,138
What do you want?

665
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:23,705
LOWERED VOICES
TO KEEP KYUHYUN FROM NOTICING

666
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:26,071
-What's this?
-What do you mean?

667
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:27,905
What are these?

668
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:30,105
A GLANCE

669
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:32,471
TAKES AWAY

670
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:33,971
What's with you, you idiot?

671
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:37,771
We'll split the earnings.

672
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:40,205
CHORTLING

673
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:45,771
HE CAN'T HOLD BACK THE LAUGHTER
AT SU-GEUN'S STRAIGHTFORWARD OFFER

674
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:47,438
-Did you find them?
-Find what?

675
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:48,471
-Did you?
-No.

676
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:50,671
-You must've found them.
-I said no.

677
00:30:50,738 --> 00:30:52,371
Oh, my goodness.

678
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:55,271
Mad respects, Su-geun.

679
00:30:55,838 --> 00:30:57,905
CHECKS THE GOODS RIGHT AWAY

680
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,438
Where did you keep them?

681
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,005
THE ACCOMPLICE CITIZEN RETURNS QUIETLY

682
00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:04,738
See? I told you he was the Mafia for sure.

683
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:05,971
He snuck them away.

684
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:08,038
Snuck what away?

685
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:10,338
THE RING BOX IS EMPTY

686
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:15,205
JUST 1 MINUTE AGO,
AFTER BEING SHOWN TO THE CAMERA

687
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:21,005
THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS
ONLY LEFT THE RING BOX BEHIND

688
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:24,438
I found this in his pocket, okay?

689
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:26,105
-It was in his pocket?
-I took it out.

690
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:27,871
That's why we laughed.

691
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:29,305
Oh, was the box empty?

692
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:32,538
I know it was childish, but I took it.

693
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:35,638
I think they'll give us another hint
at 11:20 p.m. Let's wait it out.

694
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:39,938
This is my first time seeing the ring box.

695
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:42,371
SO HE STEALS IT

696
00:31:42,438 --> 00:31:45,105
Don't try to bullshit us.
Then why did you pocket it?

697
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:49,005
-I got you now.
-I'm not going out… Look, it's him.

698
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:53,438
POINTING A FINGER AT EACH OTHER
AND RATTING EACH OTHER TO THE MAFIA

699
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:56,171
-Take it out. Put it back right there.
-I'm staying put.

700
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:59,438
-If you're not leaving, put it back.
-I said I won't.

701
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:01,105
-Why won't you do it?
-I don't want to.

702
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:02,371
-You little…
-See this?

703
00:32:02,438 --> 00:32:04,738
A BLOODY BATTLE BETWEEN THE CITIZENS
AND THE HELPLESS MAFIA

704
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:06,738
-Whoever has the prize,
-He's the Mafia.

705
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:12,038
you can forget about winning
because you riled me up.

706
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:14,071
-You're all not leaving.
-I can say the same.

707
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:15,638
-Not ever.
-No one can.

708
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:17,705
-Stay put, you idiots.
-Okay.

709
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:23,138
If you had forgiven me, I would have said,

710
00:32:23,205 --> 00:32:25,171
"Fine, you take them."

711
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:28,838
We'll see how it goes
in just a few minutes, you damn bastards.

712
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:33,738
THE OLDEST IDIOT BLOCKS THE DOOR

713
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:36,738
THE YOUNGEST IDIOT STOLE THE RING BOX

714
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:40,305
THE MAFIA GOT CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE

715
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:42,971
ONLY 20 MINUTES REMAINING

716
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,638
COULD THEY GET THE PRIZE BACK?

717
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:48,538
No one's leaving. It's almost over.

718
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:51,538
-You're a Citizen, right?
-I told you over and over I'm a Citizen!

719
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,538
-Then, I'm really disappointed in you.
-Why?

720
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:57,271
You're acting so weird right now.

721
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:58,471
There's our text.

722
00:32:58,538 --> 00:33:01,005
AS THE MAFIA COMPLETED HIS MISSION,
YOU WON'T RECEIVE A HINT

723
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:03,438
UNSURPRISINGLY,
IT'S A MISSION SUCCESS NOTICE

724
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:06,438
At any rate, no one's leaving.
We're agreed on that part.

725
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:07,871
You can only leave over my dead body.

726
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,671
Rip up the tent if you must.
I hope this ends soon.

727
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:13,405
You knew I was a fellow Citizen.

728
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:15,671
Then you could've persuaded me
at the very least.

729
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:18,305
-That's mine.
-I know. I'm just cold.

730
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,371
Good job, then.

731
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:22,505
-Are you getting ready to go out?
-Yes.

732
00:33:22,571 --> 00:33:24,538
WEARING SU-GEUN'S JACKET FOR SOME REASON

733
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:28,038
What kind of mission did he pull off
that we didn't get our hint?

734
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:30,271
FOR YOUR INFORMATION

735
00:33:30,338 --> 00:33:32,305
TURNING THE LIGHTS OFF, HUGGING,
SHOWING THE BEANS TO THE CAMERA…

736
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:35,138
THIS IS YOUR LAST MISSION
DISGUISE IN ANOTHER MEMBER'S CLOTHES

737
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:36,805
IF YOU FAIL, THE DEAL IS OFF

738
00:33:36,871 --> 00:33:38,905
A WARNING ABOUT FAILURE

739
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:40,838
HE'S DOING GREAT

740
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:43,105
We only have 15 minutes left,
and I'm not letting you out.

741
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:45,905
I'm sorry,
but you'll have to convince me first.

742
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:48,471
I'll make way, then.

743
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:52,038
Can you lend me a pair of sweatpants?

744
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:54,638
-What for?
-I'm just cold.

745
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:58,238
My green… I mean, my black pants
have collected so much dirt.

746
00:33:58,805 --> 00:33:59,771
WHILE PUMBAA-FIA WAVERS

747
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,571
Why are you wearing them, Kyuhyun?

748
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:04,271
Why are you both adding layers
all of a sudden?

749
00:34:04,338 --> 00:34:07,138
-Why is he putting pants on?
-You're both acting off.

750
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:08,405
-Just--
-What are you doing?

751
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:11,205
Why did you put on an extra pair of pants
out of the blue?

752
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:13,905
I didn't want the person
with the special item to take my stuff

753
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:14,938
by force.

754
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:16,038
TOOK ON THE MISSION FOR THE RING BOX

755
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:19,038
I bet we'll get one last text.

756
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:22,038
In that case, the sudden weird behavior…

757
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:23,805
Can I borrow your sweatpants, Su-geun?

758
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,138
Change into… Hey, there we have it.

759
00:34:27,204 --> 00:34:28,971
-Wearing clothes?
-Wearing clothes…

760
00:34:29,038 --> 00:34:31,471
If they tell us
that the Mafia completed his mission,

761
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:33,838
we can confirm Ji-won is the Mafia.

762
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,838
-You're a Citizen--
-What about him?

763
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:37,105
Why would he wear pants
on top of his original pair?

764
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:39,371
-To protect the ring box.
-So, in here…

765
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:42,105
I need a thick pair of sweatpants.

766
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:44,938
DESPITE FINDING JI-WON SUSPICIOUS,
THE NAIVE OLDEST GIVES HIM CLOTHES

767
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:47,338
Su-geun, this is obviously
the Mafia's mission.

768
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:50,238
Come on. I don't have anything.
I'm being honest.

769
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:53,405
-Why would you change, then?
-I'm just getting into my pajamas.

770
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:55,738
What's going on?
Why are you going in there?

771
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:58,038
-You want me to get changed here?
-There's a camera inside.

772
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,638
HE'S SUDDENLY VALUING PRIVACY

773
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:01,438
When did we ever care about that?

774
00:35:02,638 --> 00:35:05,405
What do you mean?
Have you ever changed in front of us?

775
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,071
I do that all the time.

776
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,571
-Just your underwear?
-Yes.

777
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:11,638
-You did? Why did I never catch that?
-I've always done that.

778
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:14,705
Hey, I had a massage session
just in my underpants, you punk.

779
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:16,938
POST-CONFUCIANISM CLOTHING ETIQUETTE

780
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,771
What kind of show is this?

781
00:35:19,605 --> 00:35:22,105
-Why nag about me changing?
-We're a family.

782
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:24,771
Are we sure there is no window back there?

783
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:26,838
JUMPS TO HIS FEET TO MONITOR JI-WON

784
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:27,738
I have to guard the door.

785
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:29,538
BURSTS IN

786
00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:33,005
What are you doing?

787
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:35,738
I can't carry out the mission.
The time's up already.

788
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:36,938
-You got that right.
-Then why…

789
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:39,338
-So spill. You're the Mafia, right?
-I'm not.

790
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:41,371
-You have the gold beans.
-No, I don't!

791
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,005
-I'm sorry--
-I don't!

792
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:44,971
I even got changed. I don't have them.

793
00:35:45,038 --> 00:35:48,671
Then why are we getting texts
about the Mafia clearing his missions?

794
00:35:48,738 --> 00:35:49,771
If the Mafia succeeded,

795
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:52,605
that means that this idiot
is still carrying out his mission.

796
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:55,305
That's getting to me, okay?

797
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:58,738
Convert to the good guys
after one last Mafia act. I'll make way.

798
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:00,171
You're driving me insane.

799
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:01,771
I was only getting ready to… Why did…

800
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:03,538
Listen, Ji-won. This is the first time

801
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:07,205
you wearing my clothes
after decades of our friendship.

802
00:36:07,271 --> 00:36:10,838
Let's say getting changed was the mission.
Where does that leave him?

803
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:13,038
-I only followed you.
-Look, Ji-won.

804
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:16,771
-You got changed too.
-Ji-won, you did an amazing job.

805
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:18,138
Go collect your gold.

806
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:22,405
-You're unbelievable.
-We caught you, but I'm satisfied.

807
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,605
We'll get a new mission success text soon.

808
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:27,205
GAME ENDS

809
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:31,238
IT'S GOTTEN LATE,
BUT ONE TENT IS BRIGHTLY LIT

810
00:36:31,805 --> 00:36:35,338
MAKING A GRANDIOSE PREPARATION
TO APPRAISE THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

811
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:37,605
Who's the Mafia? You can come clean now.

812
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:39,438
-It's over.
-I have no idea.

813
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:42,971
It's pointless.
No one can crack the final stage anyway.

814
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:44,038
That's not the point.

815
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:45,838
I still suspect you.

816
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:47,005
Hey, it's over.

817
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,971
PRODUCTION CREW

818
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:53,405
FINALLY, THE MAFIA KING
MAKES CONTACT FOR THE HANDOFF

819
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:56,138
-I'm sure Ji-won has them.
-Come with me, Mafia.

820
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:57,738
Where are we going?

821
00:36:57,805 --> 00:37:00,771
Did you hear the Mafia answer?

822
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:02,738
-Where to?
-Let's finish it off.

823
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:04,371
Let's go finish it off. Where are they?

824
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:07,705
Get out of your bed, Ji-won.
Talk it out with Kyuhyun.

825
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:09,805
JUMPS TO HIS FEET

826
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,371
How am I supposed to get past a guard?

827
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,938
-You…
-Out of my way.

828
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:15,471
A DOWNRIGHT BRAWL

829
00:37:15,538 --> 00:37:18,705
I can't finish anything off by myself.

830
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:21,971
-We managed to hold you off, then.
-Yes, the Citizens triumphed.

831
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:23,138
Let's all go together.

832
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:24,338
We'll go together.

833
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:25,471
THE TRIO DEPARTS IN HARMONY

834
00:37:25,538 --> 00:37:27,005
The Citizens held him back well.

835
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:29,071
DESTINATION REACHED

836
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:30,571
I can't believe this.

837
00:37:30,638 --> 00:37:32,805
-I'm really upset.
-It was so frustrating.

838
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:35,438
-You knew it'd end like this, right?
-I'm disappointed in you two.

839
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:38,038
-All right.
-Tell us where it went wrong.

840
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:41,405
Mafia, please step up and take a seat.

841
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,071
-Sit, Ji-won.
-Go on.

842
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:45,505
-You take a seat.
-That's enough.

843
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:47,205
Will you keep on acting even now?

844
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:52,471
-I knew the moment I saw you.
-Me too, but…

845
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:55,438
THE MAFIA MAKES CONTACT
WITH THE MAFIA KING

846
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:58,805
-I'll check a few details.
-Like what?

847
00:37:58,871 --> 00:38:02,271
-Whose jacket are you wearing?
-Su-geun's.

848
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:03,405
Pass.

849
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:06,338
-Whose pants are you wearing?
-Su-geun's.

850
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:07,238
Pass.

851
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:10,338
You carried out your mission successfully.

852
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:14,771
Finally, please show me
the Golden Coffee Beans.

853
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,838
-I should return to get them.
-I helped you out, remember?

854
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,271
PULLS OUT

855
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:25,971
You kept them in a matchbox?

856
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,471
-Good idea.
-There are a number of them.

857
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:28,705
You're right.

858
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:30,571
HOW DID MAFIA EUN CARRY THEM HERE?

859
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:34,005
WHEN HE FIRST FOUND
THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

860
00:38:34,071 --> 00:38:37,705
HE KEPT THEM IN HIS RIGHT POCKET

861
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:43,305
BUT AFTER THIS PERFORMANCE

862
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:47,371
HE TOOK SOMETHING OUT FROM HIS LEFT POCKET

863
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:49,371
WHICH WAS A MATCHBOX KEPT IN THE LODGE

864
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:53,905
HE PUT THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS
IN THE MATCHBOX INTO HIS LEFT POCKET

865
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:59,371
ONLY THE EMPTY RING BOX WAS
IN THE RIGHT POCKET SU-GEUN EXAMINED

866
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:02,805
GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS INSPECTED

867
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:05,505
-These are the real deal.
-Of course.

868
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:09,171
Last but not least,
please present the case.

869
00:39:09,238 --> 00:39:10,071
A DEEP BREATH

870
00:39:10,138 --> 00:39:12,338
I'm afraid things got complicated.

871
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:13,871
-Hold on.
-Okay.

872
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:16,505
I designated this as the new case.

873
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:18,605
-You made this the new case?
-Yes.

874
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:21,005
-But the ring box--
-It got damaged.

875
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,105
It got damaged?

876
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:24,371
It was corrupted
by the hands of an evil man.

877
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:27,605
-The box carrying the sacred beans
-What is he talking about?

878
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:30,538
was tainted by evil forces.

879
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:32,938
MR. EVIL HANDS CALLED OUT

880
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:35,238
In that case… Give me that for a minute.

881
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:36,505
I won't try anything.

882
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:38,838
Can you guess what my mission was?

883
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:43,338
We clearly instructed you to bring
the Golden Coffee Beans in the ring box.

884
00:39:43,405 --> 00:39:45,905
Since you only brought the beans,
you failed.

885
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:47,338
FAILURE
CAUSE: BOX CONTAMINATION?

886
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:48,438
It's so rough.

887
00:39:49,438 --> 00:39:51,005
If it had been easy,
I would've met your terms

888
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:53,105
instead of putting them in this matchbox!

889
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,538
A LATE ANGRY OUTBURST

890
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:57,971
Wasn't I super sharp?
A similar game show may try to recruit me.

891
00:39:58,038 --> 00:39:58,938
I nailed everything.

892
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:01,171
-I got stuck in the middle--
-You had doubts too.

893
00:40:01,238 --> 00:40:03,771
-Don't ever play the game like that.
-Why?

894
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:06,071
Right at my face,
you said, "You're the Mafia."

895
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:07,805
-Did I get you good?
-As if!

896
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:11,738
-Just don't play any game like that.
-Whenever you lie,

897
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:13,738
you smile before finishing your sentence.

898
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:16,238
If I say anything, you get all round-eyed.

899
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:18,638
-He's such an annoying player.
-As for Kyuhyun,

900
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:21,471
he is the Citizen
who never considers cooperation.

901
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:24,238
He's good at such games,
so he thinks he can win.

902
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:27,705
Here's what I think.
Though Ji-won didn't have the ring box,

903
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:31,638
he still brought me
all five Golden Coffee Beans.

904
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:33,805
The rule prevents me
from giving him all five,

905
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:36,405
but since he has kept them safe

906
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,905
-for almost two hours…
-I did.

907
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:40,138
Let me hear your input.

908
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:42,438
-What do you think, Su-geun?
-But because…

909
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:43,671
I think he deserves three.

910
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:45,171
-Three?
-Really?

911
00:40:45,238 --> 00:40:48,071
-And you, Su-geun?
-The number doesn't matter,

912
00:40:48,138 --> 00:40:50,171
but I think he earned one Bean.

913
00:40:50,738 --> 00:40:52,638
I doubt the viewers
would approve of overcompensation.

914
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:54,338
Technically, he failed.

915
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:55,871
COMPROMISE REACHED?

916
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:58,671
I think we can spare you three.
We'll use the rest in another game.

917
00:40:58,738 --> 00:41:01,338
-Ji-won did great tonight.
-Thank you.

918
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:04,771
Honestly, it was a rough night
because the missions were so difficult.

919
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:06,071
They are solid gold.

920
00:41:06,138 --> 00:41:09,471
It was rough for me too. We all suffered.

921
00:41:09,538 --> 00:41:10,805
Thank you.

922
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:14,705
I suggest we keep each as a token.

923
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,605
-But they cost a fortune.
-Really?

924
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:17,705
They're solid gold.

925
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:22,571
I get that, but I still want us
to have one Kenyan coffee bean

926
00:41:22,638 --> 00:41:24,705
-as a memento.
-Is it shaped like a real coffee bean?

927
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:26,838
-Yes.
-My gosh. I can't thank you enough.

928
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:29,271
We can keep one each.

929
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:32,438
It'd be hilarious if we took one each

930
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:34,438
only to find them stolen tomorrow morning.

931
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:36,938
THOUGH THEY HAVE CONCERNS
ONE OF THEM MIGHT STEAL ALL

932
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:39,338
THE IDIOTS DECIDE TO SHARE
EVEN THE TINY COFFEE BEANS

933
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:43,838
WRAPPING UP THEIR FIRST NIGHT
IN THE SAFARI ON A HIGH NOTE

934
00:41:44,905 --> 00:41:47,971
AFTER THE FIASCO OF LAST NIGHT

935
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:51,938
THE SUN HAS RISEN

936
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:55,305
-You have a safari outfit.
-No, I don't have long pants.

937
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:56,438
Me neither.

938
00:41:57,005 --> 00:42:00,338
WHY ARE THE IDIOTS SHOWING
MORE CONCERN FOR APPROPRIATE ATTIRE?

939
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:02,638
FIRST ITEM ON THEIR ITINERARY

940
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:07,138
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE SAFARI TOUR

941
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:12,771
GAME DRIVE

942
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:15,471
AN ACTIVITY IN A WILDLIFE RESERVE
LIKE MAASAI MARA

943
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:18,171
WHERE TOURISTS CAN OBSERVE
VARIOUS ANIMALS IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT

944
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:21,238
ACCOMPANIED BY A PROFESSIONAL RANGER

945
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,171
IF YOU SPOT WILDLIFE FROM AFAR

946
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:29,538
THE VEHICLE WILL TAKE YOU CLOSE
TO OBSERVE THE CREATURES

947
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:32,571
-You're right.
-My gosh.

948
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:35,405
IT USUALLY TAKES PLACE
IN THE MORNING OR THE AFTERNOON

949
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:38,271
AS MOST ANIMALS ARE ACTIVE THEN

950
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:40,971
A THRILLING NIGHT TOUR IS ALSO AVAILABLE

951
00:42:41,538 --> 00:42:43,938
AS WELL AS AN ENJOYABLE BUSH LUNCH
SURROUNDED BY NATURE

952
00:42:44,505 --> 00:42:47,938
THE GAME DRIVE ALLOWS YOU
TO SEE ANIMALS UP CLOSE

953
00:42:48,738 --> 00:42:52,505
THE IDIOTS ARE ON THEIR WAY
TO ENJOY THE SAFARI

954
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:55,405
LET'S HURRY!

955
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:59,271
THE HUNGRY OLDER IDIOTS
HAVE THEIR BREAKFAST

956
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:03,538
WHILE THE YOUNGEST, AN IDOL,
CHOOSES TO SPEND THE TIME FOR A GLOW-UP

957
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:05,938
He's late again.

958
00:43:06,005 --> 00:43:07,071
-Who?
-Kyuhyun.

959
00:43:07,138 --> 00:43:08,838
YOUNGEST IDIOT IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND

960
00:43:08,905 --> 00:43:11,371
What's Kyuhyun's problem?

961
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:12,471
His thick skin.

962
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:14,838
-He's shameless.
-Is that right?

963
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:16,005
You bet.

964
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:19,205
-Hey, he's coming.
-I wonder what he'll say.

965
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:21,238
-Look how shameless he is.
-Shameless Cho.

966
00:43:21,305 --> 00:43:23,371
Ji-won, I wondered
why you weren't returning

967
00:43:23,438 --> 00:43:25,405
-See?
-I can bet everything on this.

968
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:29,005
-That's a perfect example.
-I'll swear on all I own.

969
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:31,105
We agreed to meet here at 9 a.m.

970
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:32,738
When did we do that?

971
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:35,005
You said so yourself.
"We're leaving at 9, right?"

972
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,071
Well, sure. But I kept waiting for you.

973
00:43:37,138 --> 00:43:39,338
I thought you'd return to the lodge
to get ready.

974
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:40,671
A SUDDEN HEADACHE

975
00:43:40,738 --> 00:43:42,138
I swear on all my fortune.

976
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,071
Aren't you Mr. Shameless Cho?

977
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:45,371
I apologize.

978
00:43:45,438 --> 00:43:48,571
-A quick admission of guilt.
-I do, but it's upsetting.

979
00:43:48,638 --> 00:43:50,571
I thought the crew
would return after breakfast…

980
00:43:50,638 --> 00:43:53,805
There was a time when I believed you.

981
00:43:56,338 --> 00:43:58,338
You're a trashy Citizen.

982
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:00,438
LAST NIGHT'S GRUDGE REMAINS

983
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:01,805
I have it all on camera.

984
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:03,871
You can see me go,
"Where are Su-geun and Ji-won?"

985
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:05,705
Why aren't they coming?

986
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,471
VIDEO EVIDENCE SUBMITTED

987
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:11,138
We're so lucky to have brought
an outfit suited for the safari tour.

988
00:44:11,205 --> 00:44:13,638
I'm actually touched
to see you in matching outfits.

989
00:44:13,705 --> 00:44:16,205
-Yung-suk bought this for me.
-Sure, but still.

990
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:17,438
WEARING THE "GIFT" FROM THE AIRPORT

991
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:21,838
At any rate,
today is the highlight of this trip.

992
00:44:21,905 --> 00:44:24,538
-This is what we came here for.
-We came here for this tour.

993
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:27,371
-This is why we came so far.
-My heart is fluttering.

994
00:44:27,438 --> 00:44:29,071
The elephants on our first day
dumbfounded me.

995
00:44:29,138 --> 00:44:30,105
Yes, I remember.

996
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:31,138
THEIR AWE LINGERS FROM YESTERDAY

997
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:33,405
How long does our tour last, ma'am?

998
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:36,138
We'll spend about two hours on the safari.

999
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:39,371
-It's a measly two-hour trip?
-You can extend it.

1000
00:44:39,438 --> 00:44:42,071
2 HOURS IS NOT ENOUGH
FOR THIS ANIMAL LOVER

1001
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,471
We have to see lions and leopards.

1002
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:47,305
We're finally here.

1003
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:48,905
WITH HOPES OF COMPLETING THE BIG 5 LOG

1004
00:44:49,538 --> 00:44:51,405
We're back on the grasslands.

1005
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:54,171
-Just like a scene from The Lion King.
-The weather is lovely.

1006
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:57,171
-It's an insanely fine day.
-How amazing.

1007
00:44:57,738 --> 00:45:00,971
UNDER THE PERFECTLY CLEAR SKY

1008
00:45:01,538 --> 00:45:04,771
THE IDIOTS' SAFARI JEEP
SPEEDS ACROSS THE GRASSLANDS

1009
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:08,205
Isn't that the bird from The Lion King?

1010
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:10,305
-It's a heron.
-Is it?

1011
00:45:10,371 --> 00:45:12,138
HERON
A WADING BIRD WITH LONG NECK AND LEGS

1012
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:13,438
It's a heron.

1013
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:16,005
Farewell, Heron

1014
00:45:16,071 --> 00:45:18,471
-It's not moving.
-It looks different from the Korean ones.

1015
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:19,605
FIRST ANIMAL OF THE DAY, HERON

1016
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:22,405
-I see ostriches.
-Where?

1017
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:23,771
You're right. They're ostriches.

1018
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:25,471
HAVE THEY RUN INTO OSTRICHES NEXT?

1019
00:45:25,538 --> 00:45:29,371
Those birds are grey crowned-cranes.

1020
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:30,538
GREY CROWNED-CRANE
BIRD OF THE CRANE FAMILY

1021
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:33,905
The plumes on top of their heads
almost look like a crown.

1022
00:45:34,871 --> 00:45:35,705
Can you see them?

1023
00:45:35,771 --> 00:45:37,838
Yes, the yellow chicken head…

1024
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:39,405
-I mean, the comb.
-Right, they were named

1025
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:42,605
gray crown cranes
thanks to the crown-like plumes.

1026
00:45:43,371 --> 00:45:46,705
The yellow feathers are
on the top of their heads like a comb.

1027
00:45:47,271 --> 00:45:49,305
BEHIND THE GRAY CROWN CRANES

1028
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,671
Hey, it's an elephant herd.

1029
00:45:50,738 --> 00:45:52,138
AN ELEPHANT HERD?

1030
00:45:52,205 --> 00:45:54,505
We saw elephants
really up close yesterday.

1031
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,071
Unless I see a huge one, I won't feel…

1032
00:45:57,138 --> 00:45:59,471
Damn, that one's gigantic.

1033
00:45:59,538 --> 00:46:01,905
-Right in the middle.
-My gosh, it's so huge.

1034
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:04,471
I guess we're going over to them.

1035
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:08,105
-There are so many of them.
-There are more up there.

1036
00:46:08,171 --> 00:46:09,605
We have a proper herd.

1037
00:46:09,671 --> 00:46:12,938
-Wait, are those all elephants?
-Yes.

1038
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:15,805
Look, that elephant is huge.

1039
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:19,271
Ji-won, they're all huge.

1040
00:46:19,338 --> 00:46:22,371
-There's something else among them.
-Like what?

1041
00:46:22,438 --> 00:46:24,271
-I think that's a calf.
-It is.

1042
00:46:25,305 --> 00:46:27,438
There are calves here.
Is this an elephant kindergarten?

1043
00:46:27,505 --> 00:46:29,805
Look at those baby ones.
They are so adorable!

1044
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,171
Maybe it is a kindergarten.

1045
00:46:31,238 --> 00:46:34,338
That elephant calf is so cute.

1046
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:39,838
ELEPHANTS IN ALL SIZES

1047
00:46:40,571 --> 00:46:43,505
-My gosh, little baby elephants.
-They're all with calves.

1048
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:45,738
They don't even have their tusks yet.

1049
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:48,771
TUSKLESS

1050
00:46:49,471 --> 00:46:53,805
FROM DEPENDABLE ADULT ELEPHANTS
TO INQUISITIVE ELEPHANT CALVES

1051
00:46:54,371 --> 00:46:57,705
THE ELEPHANT FAMILY TRAVELS AS A HERD

1052
00:46:57,771 --> 00:47:00,471
They must've gathered like it's a holiday.

1053
00:47:00,538 --> 00:47:03,138
The smallest one over there
must be about four months old.

1054
00:47:03,205 --> 00:47:04,571
-My gosh.
-That one.

1055
00:47:04,638 --> 00:47:07,838
-It's paler than others.
-I think that indicates its age.

1056
00:47:07,905 --> 00:47:10,271
They're so cute and small.

1057
00:47:10,338 --> 00:47:11,871
That one is indeed tiny.

1058
00:47:11,938 --> 00:47:14,605
It will be bigger than you think
when you're up close to it.

1059
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:17,071
-It's pretty much like fire gazing.
-Yes.

1060
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:18,838
We're out here doing elephant gazing.

1061
00:47:18,905 --> 00:47:21,338
-I can stare at them all day.
-Elephant gazing is a good one.

1062
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:23,305
TIME SEEMS TO HAVE STOPPED
BEFORE THE MAJESTIC NATURE

1063
00:47:23,871 --> 00:47:25,138
My gosh.

1064
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,771
I'd be content just staring at them.

1065
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:38,571
THE WILD ANIMALS' MOVEMENTS
ARE ALMOST ENTRANCING

1066
00:47:39,638 --> 00:47:41,638
-The dad has come nearer.
-Dad?

1067
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:43,505
It's just a few steps away.

1068
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:47,538
Hey, it's turning away.

1069
00:47:47,605 --> 00:47:51,571
THE ELEPHANT IS UNBELIEVABLY CLOSE BY

1070
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:55,538
This is the herd with so many calves.

1071
00:47:55,605 --> 00:47:57,705
I've never seen a tiny elephant like that.

1072
00:47:57,771 --> 00:47:58,838
It's so cute.

1073
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:05,338
AN ELEPHANT CALF,
A NEW SIGHT FOR THE IDIOTS

1074
00:48:07,138 --> 00:48:11,705
ALL CREATURES LEAD THEIR OWN LIVES
IN THE BOSOM OF NATURE

1075
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:19,771
It's on its back, acting all cute.

1076
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:21,638
A giant one is lying down.

1077
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:24,705
This is the experience of a lifetime.

1078
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,971
-We won't ever see such a sight again.
-For sure.

1079
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:30,005
Watch the teenage elephants playing games.

1080
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:32,138
-With their trunks.
-Where?

1081
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:34,971
TEENAGE ELEPHANTS HAVING FUN

1082
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,605
A TIP ON ELEPHANTS:
ELEPHANTS INTERTWINE THEIR TRUNKS

1083
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:39,771
TO SHOW AFFECTION
AND STRENGTHEN THEIR BOND

1084
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:42,638
Hey, look at that one doing push-ups.

1085
00:48:43,205 --> 00:48:45,671
THIS ENERGETIC ELEPHANT
IS TRYING TO BUILD MUSCLE

1086
00:48:45,738 --> 00:48:48,205
Even the white flowers
on the grass look lovely.

1087
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:51,938
The elephants don't eat them, do they?

1088
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:54,771
The locals call them
"tissue paper flower."

1089
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:55,771
"Tissue paper"?

1090
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:58,505
Elephants leave their feces
all over the place, right?

1091
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:02,838
The idea behind the nickname is
that they'll wipe themselves with those.

1092
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:06,571
They say elephants are
the farmers of the savanna.

1093
00:49:06,638 --> 00:49:09,405
They can eat up to 300 kg of plants.

1094
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:12,238
When they defecate all over the savanna,
they're dispersing seeds,

1095
00:49:12,305 --> 00:49:14,405
-which then become trees.
-They fertilize the land.

1096
00:49:14,471 --> 00:49:15,605
They're like farmers.

1097
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:19,338
Let's move, then.
The youngsters there are having fun.

1098
00:49:19,405 --> 00:49:20,505
We had our fill.

1099
00:49:20,571 --> 00:49:21,705
GOODBYE, EVERYONE

1100
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:24,471
AFTER THE ENJOYABLE ELEPHANT GAZING

1101
00:49:25,871 --> 00:49:28,538
Doesn't it mean something
when birds are circling overhead?

1102
00:49:28,605 --> 00:49:30,371
-Where?
-Ji-won told us about eagles.

1103
00:49:30,438 --> 00:49:33,171
-Carcasses must be nearby.
-Those are vultures.

1104
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:36,338
In Korean, various species
of birds of prey are called eagles.

1105
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:38,838
But vultures and eagles
are different species.

1106
00:49:38,905 --> 00:49:40,471
Aren't they falcons?

1107
00:49:40,538 --> 00:49:43,971
FALCON, EAGLE, VULTURE

1108
00:49:44,038 --> 00:49:47,038
THESE ARE ALL BIRDS OF PREY

1109
00:49:47,105 --> 00:49:51,938
Vultures feed on carcasses
left by other predators

1110
00:49:52,005 --> 00:49:54,438
while eagles hunt their own prey.

1111
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:56,238
FALCONS AND EAGLES PREY ON LIVE ANIMALS

1112
00:49:56,305 --> 00:49:57,738
Since vultures are around,

1113
00:49:57,805 --> 00:49:59,438
-dead game must be nearby.
-Those are vultures.

1114
00:49:59,505 --> 00:50:02,571
Judging by their number,
lions must've left their prey.

1115
00:50:02,638 --> 00:50:04,205
I bet there's something there.

1116
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:07,305
Let's go and find out what they're eating.

1117
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,005
Hold on tight. We're going to hit puddles.

1118
00:50:10,071 --> 00:50:11,205
-All right.
-Okay.

1119
00:50:11,271 --> 00:50:13,671
-Could we get across this?
-You bet it could.

1120
00:50:14,238 --> 00:50:15,871
THE SAFARI JEEP ROLLS INTO THE PUDDLE

1121
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:17,371
Put your hands inside. The water…

1122
00:50:17,438 --> 00:50:19,138
SPLASHING

1123
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:21,571
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

1124
00:50:21,638 --> 00:50:24,705
We should make it look like
we're going through rough terrain.

1125
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:27,071
SU-GEUN'S OLD-SCHOOL COMEDY HACKS

1126
00:50:27,138 --> 00:50:28,871
Stop it, Su-geun. Don't make a noise.

1127
00:50:28,938 --> 00:50:31,438
-But nothing's nearby.
-Lions will come find you.

1128
00:50:31,505 --> 00:50:34,305
AS MUCH AS HE WANTS TO SEE LIONS,
HE'S AFRAID OF THEM

1129
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:37,238
I see a pack of animals ahead of us.
Are those impalas?

1130
00:50:37,305 --> 00:50:39,771
-There's a pack.
-They must be young ones.

1131
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:41,371
Those are gazelles.

1132
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,471
-Gazelles?
-You can see them in animated films.

1133
00:50:44,538 --> 00:50:45,738
GAZELLE
A TYPICAL AFRICAN HERBIVORE

1134
00:50:45,805 --> 00:50:47,438
They jump all over the place.

1135
00:50:47,505 --> 00:50:50,805
-Lions often prey on gazelles.
-That's true.

1136
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:52,405
-Thanks for being there.
-How cute.

1137
00:50:52,471 --> 00:50:55,105
-They look so pretty.
-Look how beautiful they are.

1138
00:50:55,171 --> 00:50:57,805
-The gazelles are adorable.
-Why are they so cute?

1139
00:50:57,871 --> 00:50:59,871
Hi, guys. Jamba.

1140
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:01,805
Jango mambo.

1141
00:51:01,871 --> 00:51:03,471
IT'S "JAMBO"

1142
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:08,838
-They must feel afraid every day.
-I know, it must be so scary for them.

1143
00:51:08,905 --> 00:51:09,871
GAZELLES RUN AWAY

1144
00:51:09,938 --> 00:51:12,505
Their fur is in a lovely shade of brown.

1145
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:15,771
-Are those guys gazelles again?
-Topi?

1146
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:18,605
-They're impalas.
-Impalas.

1147
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:22,271
IMPALA
NIMBLE HERBIVORES IN THE AFRICAN SAVANNA

1148
00:51:22,338 --> 00:51:26,271
THEY LIVE IN A HERD, AND MALE IMPALAS
HAVE CURVED HORNS SHAPED LIKE A BOW

1149
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:29,738
With a herd around,
there could be a lion close by.

1150
00:51:30,805 --> 00:51:33,971
-There is a lion.
-A lion?

1151
00:51:34,038 --> 00:51:35,405
-Where?
-Where is it?

1152
00:51:35,471 --> 00:51:36,538
They spotted a lion?

1153
00:51:37,238 --> 00:51:39,005
-Oh, my god.
-Where is it?

1154
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:40,038
A SAFARI JEEP AT A STOP

1155
00:51:40,105 --> 00:51:41,305
Something is moving ahead.

1156
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:44,705
-This is insane. It's over there.
-Where is it?

1157
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:47,471
-Oh, it's a cheetah.
-It's showing its belly.

1158
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:49,938
You're right. My gosh.

1159
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:52,605
A GOLDEN FIGURE UP AHEAD

1160
00:51:54,871 --> 00:51:57,071
-It's lying down.
-Stay very still.

1161
00:51:57,138 --> 00:51:58,971
It's lying down.

1162
00:51:59,038 --> 00:52:01,505
THE IDIOTS' SAFARI JEEP
APPROACHES IT CAUTIOUSLY

1163
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:06,905
FINALLY FOUND A CHEETAH, A PREDATOR BUDDY

1164
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:08,771
Damn, we finally met a cheetah.

1165
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:10,771
-It caught a gazelle.
-There is one.

1166
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:13,038
WITH ITS DEAD PREY NEARBY

1167
00:52:15,205 --> 00:52:19,305
THE CHEETAH RESTS HIDDEN IN THE GRASS

1168
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:23,605
He caught the gazelle,
so he had a successful hunt.

1169
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:26,238
He was on the hunt.

1170
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:30,071
The cheetah caught a gazelle.

1171
00:52:30,638 --> 00:52:33,571
THEIR VOICES ARE AUTOMATICALLY LOWERED
BEFORE THE MAJESTIC CHEETAH

1172
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:35,705
This is an incredibly rare sight.

1173
00:52:36,271 --> 00:52:37,771
Look at its eyes.

1174
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:38,905
Use these, Kyuhyun.

1175
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:41,371
THE FIRST PREDATOR OF THE DAY
HAS AN IMPOSING AURA

1176
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:45,471
Director Nah, take a look
through the binoculars.

1177
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:48,138
CHEETAH
THE FASTEST LAND ANIMAL

1178
00:52:48,705 --> 00:52:50,305
This is my first time seeing a cheetah.

1179
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:55,271
-Is it one of the Big Five?
-Isn't that a leopard?

1180
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,871
-Are cheetahs among the Big Five?
-No?

1181
00:52:58,938 --> 00:53:00,171
Shall we get moving, then?

1182
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:05,138
-It's not among the Big Five.
-Like that matters.

1183
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:07,371
We rarely see cheetahs here.

1184
00:53:07,438 --> 00:53:09,671
Really? Let's stay a bit longer.

1185
00:53:09,738 --> 00:53:11,938
-They're rarer than lions.
-Just five more minutes.

1186
00:53:12,005 --> 00:53:14,505
Let's add them
and make the list the "Big Six."

1187
00:53:16,805 --> 00:53:22,605
If you ask me,
it's worn out after catching one gazelle.

1188
00:53:23,171 --> 00:53:26,771
CHEETAHS TAKE A REST AFTER SPRINTING
AT 100KM/H TO HUNT ITS PREY

1189
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:28,871
We're truly out in the wild.

1190
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:30,871
Hey, it's looking at us.

1191
00:53:30,938 --> 00:53:33,105
A CLOSEUP
ON THE FIERCE BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL

1192
00:53:33,671 --> 00:53:36,505
-But why won't it feed?
-Maybe it's full?

1193
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:39,771
What if some other animal takes it?
Why is it leaving it there?

1194
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,171
Because it's no fun.
You need a good pre-meal game.

1195
00:53:43,238 --> 00:53:45,671
-It needs the animal quiz.
-Yes, the animal quiz.

1196
00:53:46,671 --> 00:53:48,771
"The guys that took my leftovers."

1197
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:50,771
"Oh, I know. Vultures."

1198
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:51,938
"No, not those guys."

1199
00:53:52,471 --> 00:53:53,571
"It's a three-syllable word."

1200
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:55,138
"Hy… What was it again?"

1201
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:57,205
"Hey, y'all?"

1202
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:59,771
CHEETAH, INCORRECT!

1203
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:01,938
-Oh, my.
-It got up.

1204
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,538
It's checking the perimeter.

1205
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:06,905
THE CHEETAH IS FINALLY ON THE MOVE

1206
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:11,405
It's had its fill.
Look at its belly sticking out.

1207
00:54:11,938 --> 00:54:13,105
BULGING

1208
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:15,071
-It must've had its fill.
-It's full.

1209
00:54:15,138 --> 00:54:16,138
TURNS OUT IT HAS EATEN ALREADY

1210
00:54:16,205 --> 00:54:18,638
It's just lovely and cute.

1211
00:54:18,705 --> 00:54:20,871
I'd love to stroke its head.

1212
00:54:22,738 --> 00:54:24,405
Anyone can say that at a safe distance.

1213
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:25,705
I know that, but…

1214
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:27,905
What are those? Why are they so big?

1215
00:54:27,971 --> 00:54:29,571
They are vultures.

1216
00:54:29,638 --> 00:54:31,271
They're waiting for the cheetah to leave.

1217
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:32,305
Hey.

1218
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:34,738
They'll come swooping down for the meat
once it leaves.

1219
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:36,571
So they're waiting?

1220
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:38,771
1ST GROUP ON THE WAITING LIST

1221
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:39,905
There's another one.

1222
00:54:39,971 --> 00:54:43,705
-It swoops down like a kite, Woo-jung.
-That's amazing.

1223
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:48,571
It's so funny how they're all waiting.
There's another one. They keep coming.

1224
00:54:48,638 --> 00:54:51,705
That looks like a goose, not a vulture.

1225
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:54,038
It's all alone, away from the flock.

1226
00:54:54,105 --> 00:54:55,138
That's right.

1227
00:54:55,205 --> 00:54:58,005
-That is a marabou stork.
-Marabou stork?

1228
00:54:58,071 --> 00:54:59,638
Will it join the vultures?

1229
00:54:59,705 --> 00:55:01,838
You've already seen them in Nairobi.

1230
00:55:01,905 --> 00:55:04,338
They were on the trees back in Nairobi.

1231
00:55:04,405 --> 00:55:06,405
Marabou storks do look rather creepy.

1232
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:10,271
REMEMBER THE BIRDS
YOU WERE SO EXCITED TO SEE IN NAIROBI?

1233
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:13,105
ITS NAME IS AFRICAN BOLD STORK IN KOREAN

1234
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:16,271
IT IS CALLED MARABOU STORK IN ENGLISH

1235
00:55:17,038 --> 00:55:20,571
Marabou storks have the nickname,
"the garbage collectors."

1236
00:55:20,638 --> 00:55:22,605
How come?

1237
00:55:22,671 --> 00:55:25,938
In Nairobi, they go through the trash.
Out here, they finish carcasses.

1238
00:55:26,805 --> 00:55:29,771
Here it comes. It looks like a guy
walking with his hands behind his back.

1239
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:32,138
THE MARABOU STORK APPROACHES THE VULTURES

1240
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:35,938
It looks like it's saying,
"Hey, guys. Let's enjoy a meal together."

1241
00:55:36,005 --> 00:55:39,038
"Hey, scoot over."

1242
00:55:39,105 --> 00:55:41,305
"Hey, out of my way."

1243
00:55:43,005 --> 00:55:44,805
"What's the matter?"

1244
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:45,805
"Hey."

1245
00:55:46,505 --> 00:55:47,571
REALISTIC DEPICTION OF THE SAVANNA

1246
00:55:47,638 --> 00:55:51,471
"There are just too many of you.
I can't share with such a big group.

1247
00:55:51,538 --> 00:55:52,905
Some of you should leave."

1248
00:55:54,371 --> 00:56:00,671
"With such a big group,
we'd only get a bite each.

1249
00:56:00,738 --> 00:56:01,671
Some of you leave."

1250
00:56:01,738 --> 00:56:05,171
I don't think they're going to feed soon.
Why don't we get going?

1251
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,071
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1252
00:56:07,138 --> 00:56:08,371
ON TO FINDING ANOTHER ANIMAL

1253
00:56:08,438 --> 00:56:09,805
Goodbye, cheetah.

1254
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:13,805
Could we load that carcass in our jeep?

1255
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,871
-Well…
-Won't they all follow us?

1256
00:56:15,938 --> 00:56:19,671
Look how short the grasses are.
I doubt lions are here.

1257
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:23,238
FOLLOWING JI-WON'S ADVICE

1258
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:27,671
THEY HEAD TO THE AREA WITH TALL GRASS

1259
00:56:27,738 --> 00:56:31,705
Since the grasses are tall,
lions may be nearby.

1260
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:34,538
-Is that so, Dr. Eun?
-It's pretty likely.

1261
00:56:34,605 --> 00:56:41,238
-"Dr. Eun"?
-We're here in Kenya with Dr. Eun Ji-won.

1262
00:56:41,305 --> 00:56:43,605
He participated in the scripts
of wildlife documentaries.

1263
00:56:43,671 --> 00:56:45,105
That's true.

1264
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:47,871
This area is likely to have
a lion pride close by.

1265
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:51,771
We're following Dr. Eun's guidance
to find lions in their natural habitat.

1266
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:54,171
-Look very closely.
-We have zebras ahead.

1267
00:56:54,238 --> 00:56:55,771
-Zebras?
-What?

1268
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:58,671
ZEBRAS INSTEAD OF LIONS

1269
00:56:59,238 --> 00:57:00,905
OVERWHELMED

1270
00:57:01,438 --> 00:57:03,771
JI-WON, LOOK OVER THERE

1271
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,638
There are so many of them.

1272
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:07,338
-What on earth?
-All kinds of species are there.

1273
00:57:07,405 --> 00:57:08,438
HERBIVORES INCLUDING ZEBRAS

1274
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:09,438
We've got zebras.

1275
00:57:09,505 --> 00:57:11,371
HERBIVORES WITH BLACK-AND-WHITE STRIPES

1276
00:57:11,438 --> 00:57:13,138
ZEBRAS LIVE IN A HERD
OUT ON AFRICAN GRASSLANDS

1277
00:57:13,205 --> 00:57:14,438
There are about 100 of them.

1278
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:16,105
They have surprisingly short legs.

1279
00:57:16,638 --> 00:57:18,905
Their legs are disproportionately short.

1280
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:20,671
I guess they are courting.

1281
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:23,171
Guys, their heads are aligned
with each other's.

1282
00:57:23,238 --> 00:57:25,805
-Are they in the mating season?
-There's romance in the air.

1283
00:57:25,871 --> 00:57:28,538
-Do you know why they're doing that?
-No.

1284
00:57:28,605 --> 00:57:31,238
-To appear bigger than they actually are.
-Dr. Eun.

1285
00:57:31,305 --> 00:57:34,571
Thanks to their striped pattern,
they can confuse other animals.

1286
00:57:35,238 --> 00:57:37,171
-Isn't that right?
-You really are knowledgeable.

1287
00:57:37,238 --> 00:57:38,971
See? I told you I'm a wiz at this.

1288
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,371
-Good for you.
-You really know a lot.

1289
00:57:40,438 --> 00:57:43,771
Each zebra's striped pattern
is like a person's thumbprint.

1290
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:45,671
No two zebras have the same pattern.

1291
00:57:46,238 --> 00:57:48,871
Facing the opposite direction
allows them to scratch each other

1292
00:57:48,938 --> 00:57:53,838
and detect approaching predators quickly.

1293
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:57,438
They do have startlingly stumpy legs.

1294
00:57:57,505 --> 00:58:00,138
Is this because we're used
to seeing them gallop?

1295
00:58:00,205 --> 00:58:01,538
They look like donkeys.

1296
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:03,071
STUMPY

1297
00:58:03,138 --> 00:58:04,738
In comparison, the cheetah was beautiful.

1298
00:58:04,805 --> 00:58:05,771
SAD

1299
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:09,738
Are those buildings over there
the Maasai tribe's houses?

1300
00:58:09,805 --> 00:58:13,338
-I think that's a farm.
-While the area is a national park,

1301
00:58:13,405 --> 00:58:15,705
the Maasai tribe has a community here.

1302
00:58:15,771 --> 00:58:17,805
You can see them
tending to their cattle here.

1303
00:58:17,871 --> 00:58:20,238
Cattle ranching has been
their traditional livelihood.

1304
00:58:20,305 --> 00:58:23,705
I see a herd of cows.
A few hundred of them.

1305
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:26,671
OTHER THAN HUNDREDS OF COWS

1306
00:58:26,738 --> 00:58:28,871
What's that? Hey, it's wagging its tail.

1307
00:58:29,438 --> 00:58:31,238
TOPI

1308
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:33,338
-There's a fox.
-It's a jackal.

1309
00:58:33,405 --> 00:58:34,771
JACKAL

1310
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:36,538
-Where?
-Right there.

1311
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:37,905
What's that up ahead?

1312
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:39,205
HYENA

1313
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:40,871
-I thought it looked different.
-It's a hyena.

1314
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:43,005
That rock looks like an animal.

1315
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,405
I know. I almost thought
something was crouching down.

1316
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:48,138
-I thought it was an elephant.
-An elephant rock.

1317
00:58:48,205 --> 00:58:51,671
Hey, punk. Stop wagging your tail
and return to your group.

1318
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:54,805
AND A LONER GAZELLE

1319
00:58:54,871 --> 00:58:56,405
-How cute.
-Bye-bye.

1320
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:57,838
IDIOTS MET VARIOUS ANIMALS

1321
00:58:57,905 --> 00:59:00,771
You can't get bored on this tour.

1322
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:03,205
-You never know what you may see.
-I could do this all day.

1323
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:05,238
We might as well spend the whole day here.

1324
00:59:05,305 --> 00:59:07,805
Are those critters up ahead
ostriches or hyenas?

1325
00:59:07,871 --> 00:59:08,905
I mean the trio right there.

1326
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:11,571
OSTRICH
THE BIGGEST BIRD SPECIES IN THE WORLD

1327
00:59:11,638 --> 00:59:13,238
THEY CAN'T FLY,
BUT THEY'RE THE FASTEST BIRD ON LAND

1328
00:59:13,305 --> 00:59:15,138
Doesn't it look like
it's walking backward?

1329
00:59:15,205 --> 00:59:17,238
-It looks like they're moonwalking.
-It really does.

1330
00:59:17,305 --> 00:59:19,638
Doesn't it look like
a person in a bird suit, Kyuhyun?

1331
00:59:19,705 --> 00:59:21,938
The person in it is walking backward.
Look at the black part.

1332
00:59:22,005 --> 00:59:24,338
THE IDIOTS HAVE INCREDIBLE IMAGINATIONS

1333
00:59:24,905 --> 00:59:28,205
CRACKING UP

1334
00:59:28,271 --> 00:59:29,605
Can you play clip in reverse?

1335
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:32,005
-Show us the footage in reverse.
-Like it's walking forward.

1336
00:59:32,071 --> 00:59:33,138
If we could only add a face…

1337
00:59:33,205 --> 00:59:35,438
THIS OSTRICH WAS JUST WALKING AWAY

1338
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:38,838
-It's something we'd do for games.
-How hilarious.

1339
00:59:38,905 --> 00:59:40,138
It's so funny.

1340
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:41,371
VIDEO REVERSED

1341
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:44,505
It's walking with the head down.
It must be looking for something.

1342
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:45,971
I bet it's Kyuhyun's phone.

1343
00:59:46,038 --> 00:59:47,471
To find his phone…

1344
00:59:47,538 --> 00:59:49,371
THAT WORD KEEPS CROPPING UP

1345
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:54,538
I'M LOOKING FOR A Z FOLD

1346
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:55,938
BEING RIDICULED FOR 5 EPISODES

1347
00:59:56,005 --> 00:59:56,871
Ostrich Cho.

1348
00:59:56,938 --> 00:59:59,605
I can't believe it walks that way.
How funny is that?

1349
00:59:59,671 --> 01:00:03,638
-Do giraffes live entirely elsewhere?
-I have a hunch we'll see them tomorrow.

1350
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:04,938
GIRAFFES ARE NOWHERE IN SIGHT

1351
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:06,871
Why don't I take this short break

1352
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:11,038
to tell you the history of giraffes
and acacia trees' co-evolution?

1353
01:00:11,105 --> 01:00:15,671
Giraffes' height gives them access
to leaves high up on tall trees.

1354
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:17,605
So, they fed on acacia trees.

1355
01:00:17,671 --> 01:00:23,105
Then, the acacia trees developed thorns,
which are extremely sharp.

1356
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:26,238
Then, giraffes evolved to add
a protective layer to their tongues,

1357
01:00:26,305 --> 01:00:28,438
making them leathery.

1358
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:31,671
You will notice it when we see
the giraffe's tongue later…

1359
01:00:31,738 --> 01:00:36,271
-Do we get to see their tongues?
-Yes, when we see giraffes.

1360
01:00:36,338 --> 01:00:38,071
We're driving toward the forest.

1361
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:39,305
IT'S TIME FOR LUNCH!

1362
01:00:39,371 --> 01:00:42,305
This tour includes having a meal

1363
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:46,538
right in the middle of the safari,
so we're on our way for that.

1364
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:47,638
-Okay.
-Sounds great.

1365
01:00:47,705 --> 01:00:49,738
What? Right in the middle of the safari?

1366
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:51,905
UNBELIEVABLE

1367
01:00:51,971 --> 01:00:54,138
I hope we'll see lions there.

1368
01:00:55,105 --> 01:00:56,305
Hope our smell attracts them.

1369
01:00:56,371 --> 01:00:59,238
Are we having a meal,
or are we their meal package?

1370
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:01,905
-Is it our meal?
-Are you saying we're the lunch?

1371
01:01:02,538 --> 01:01:03,571
-Tell me.
-The Big Five--

1372
01:01:03,638 --> 01:01:05,238
Are you filming us getting eaten?

1373
01:01:05,305 --> 01:01:06,571
IS THIS A HYPER-REALISTIC VARIETY SHOW?

1374
01:01:06,638 --> 01:01:09,105
Are you setting up a meal
for the animals or what?

1375
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:12,871
-I just don't follow.
-Humans or animals, it doesn't matter.

1376
01:01:12,938 --> 01:01:14,271
What are you saying?

1377
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,771
THE LUNCH SITE REACHED OVER THE LIGHT CHAT

1378
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:19,105
JAMBO

1379
01:01:19,871 --> 01:01:23,471
LUSCIOUS GREENERY

1380
01:01:24,038 --> 01:01:26,738
CLEAR SKY

1381
01:01:27,605 --> 01:01:30,105
SOUNDS OF GENTLE BREEZE

1382
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:33,705
SCENT OF FRESH PLANTS

1383
01:01:34,271 --> 01:01:37,938
RIGHT IN THE CENTER

1384
01:01:38,005 --> 01:01:40,505
STANDS THE WHITE TABLE
WAITING FOR THE THREE IDIOTS

1385
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,638
So we're getting a buffet?

1386
01:01:42,705 --> 01:01:44,438
-I see.
-Sounds great.

1387
01:01:44,505 --> 01:01:48,771
COUNTLESS DISHES ARE ON OFFER

1388
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,271
The chefs grill chicken and beef for you.

1389
01:01:52,605 --> 01:01:56,005
IT'S TIME TO RELAX
AND ENJOY THE GENEROUS BUSH LUNCH!

1390
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:58,538
This guided tour is just incredible.

1391
01:01:58,605 --> 01:02:01,071
AN AWE-INSPIRING BUFFET
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SAFARI

1392
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:03,005
Dear viewers,

1393
01:02:03,071 --> 01:02:05,105
please consider this
as your honeymoon destination.

1394
01:02:05,171 --> 01:02:06,438
It's a worthy choice.

1395
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:08,971
-Visit Kenya for your honeymoon.
-Older couples especially may enjoy it.

1396
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:12,871
I think it would've been fine
to have skipped breakfast.

1397
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:16,171
AFTER COLLECTING A HEALTHY AMOUNT
OF HIS FAVORITES ON THE PLATE

1398
01:02:16,805 --> 01:02:18,571
What did you order, Ji-won?

1399
01:02:18,638 --> 01:02:20,138
One chicken and one beef.

1400
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,371
Asante sana.

1401
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:27,138
RETURNING TO THE TABLE
WITH THE WARM STEAKS

1402
01:02:28,138 --> 01:02:29,271
AMAZED

1403
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:31,571
LET'S TUCK IN

1404
01:02:32,405 --> 01:02:34,571
The steaks are cooked just right.

1405
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:39,038
Gosh, the meat is just so…

1406
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:40,871
It's so nice to have them directly.

1407
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:43,605
I feel like I'm way too lucky.

1408
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:46,405
-What's that?
-What?

1409
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,305
-Oh, it's been fried.
-I'm making a taco.

1410
01:02:48,371 --> 01:02:50,205
ON TOP OF THE CHAPATI

1411
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:51,838
ADDS BEEF STEAK

1412
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:52,838
Just like that…

1413
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:55,638
ADDS KACHUMBARI

1414
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,071
I love that the local fruits
aren't too sweet.

1415
01:02:58,138 --> 01:02:59,238
WRAPS UP THE INGREDIENTS

1416
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:01,371
DELICIOUS

1417
01:03:01,438 --> 01:03:03,405
TAKES A BITE OF THE TACO

1418
01:03:03,471 --> 01:03:04,838
Is this how you eat it?

1419
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:07,638
Tanya used chapati
for all her dishes, remember?

1420
01:03:07,705 --> 01:03:08,705
REFERRING TO SMOCHA

1421
01:03:08,771 --> 01:03:10,571
MUNCHING

1422
01:03:10,638 --> 01:03:11,838
This tastes the best.

1423
01:03:11,905 --> 01:03:13,705
-Make a wrap like Tanya did.
-Really?

1424
01:03:13,771 --> 01:03:14,805
Just like that.

1425
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:15,771
FOLLOWING SUIT

1426
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:18,571
Take a bite… There we go.

1427
01:03:18,638 --> 01:03:20,771
-That's the best.
-Right.

1428
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,538
It's the endgame.

1429
01:03:22,605 --> 01:03:24,371
This reminds me of Tanya.

1430
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:28,005
-How long do we get to stay here?
-Why do you ask?

1431
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:29,371
This is perfect for some chat.

1432
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,371
-That's a good idea.
-Do you have a story to tell?

1433
01:03:31,438 --> 01:03:33,438
Don't you want to hear his stories?

1434
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:35,438
TWO DAYS AGO…

1435
01:03:35,505 --> 01:03:39,271
This story deserves some respect.
We need to concentrate.

1436
01:03:39,338 --> 01:03:42,938
-He's exaggerating again.
-We need a solemn setting. It's hilarious.

1437
01:03:43,005 --> 01:03:45,571
It's the tale of his old managers.

1438
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:49,405
-There were about 70 of them.
-I think it's closer to 50, Ji-won.

1439
01:03:49,971 --> 01:03:51,671
Shall we start with a small fry?

1440
01:03:51,738 --> 01:03:53,138
AN OMINOUS OPENING COMMENT

1441
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:54,705
-You're not balking.
-It's because

1442
01:03:54,771 --> 01:03:57,738
he's had a whopping 50 managers.

1443
01:03:57,805 --> 01:03:59,571
THUS BEGAN…

1444
01:03:59,638 --> 01:04:01,605
50 MANAGERS OF KYU-REY

1445
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,505
Shall we start
with the tale of the tollgate manager?

1446
01:04:04,571 --> 01:04:06,471
CHAPTER 1
TOLLGATE MANAGER

1447
01:04:06,538 --> 01:04:09,271
When you pass through Namsan Tunnel,

1448
01:04:09,338 --> 01:04:14,171
you have to pay a fee at the tollgate
if you have fewer than three passengers.

1449
01:04:14,238 --> 01:04:15,971
Otherwise, they let you go.

1450
01:04:16,038 --> 01:04:18,971
My old manager meant to drive away,
but we got held back.

1451
01:04:19,038 --> 01:04:21,305
THERE'S A MANDATORY INSPECTION

1452
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:23,071
My manager was driving,

1453
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:25,505
and a Super Junior member was
in the passenger seat.

1454
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:26,705
There were just the two of them.

1455
01:04:26,771 --> 01:04:28,038
2 PASSENGERS MEANT PAYING THE FEE

1456
01:04:28,105 --> 01:04:31,671
-Just the two of them.
-But your manager meant to slip away.

1457
01:04:31,738 --> 01:04:36,271
But the tollgate keeper asked them
to lower the window.

1458
01:04:37,138 --> 01:04:39,738
They went, "Inspection, please."

1459
01:04:39,805 --> 01:04:41,071
The manager said, "Sure."

1460
01:04:41,638 --> 01:04:43,738
Rolled down the window slightly

1461
01:04:43,805 --> 01:04:45,971
and rolled it up as if to say,
"We're good, right?"

1462
01:04:46,038 --> 01:04:47,905
There was a teddy bear in the back seat.

1463
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:50,905
-The manager was hoping that it could--
-Pass as a person?

1464
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,638
Yes, they thought its silhouette
should convince them.

1465
01:04:53,705 --> 01:04:55,205
So, they only rolled it down a bit,

1466
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:57,371
rolled it up, and went,
"We're good, okay?"

1467
01:04:57,438 --> 01:05:00,771
But the tollgate keeper went,
"Do you think this is a joke?"

1468
01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:02,205
It turned into a huge deal.

1469
01:05:02,271 --> 01:05:03,971
All over the teddy bear.

1470
01:05:04,038 --> 01:05:05,938
They would catch it. They are veterans.

1471
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:07,571
They would've seen that trick
countless times.

1472
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:10,438
-Other than that, we had a kleptomaniac.
-A kleptomania?

1473
01:05:10,505 --> 01:05:12,471
As for the kleptomaniac manager…

1474
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:15,605
I didn't catch him red-handed.
One of the members did.

1475
01:05:15,671 --> 01:05:18,505
-Did he catch him in the act?
-Yes, he did.

1476
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:21,238
When you open the door to the shoe closet,

1477
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:23,838
you could find a small cupboard
in our old dorm.

1478
01:05:23,905 --> 01:05:28,571
One day, Yesung returned to our dorm,
and that freaked our then manager.

1479
01:05:29,438 --> 01:05:32,238
He said, "Yesung, you're here."

1480
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:34,038
-That's fishy, right?
-Of course.

1481
01:05:34,105 --> 01:05:36,038
It was a random place to be in,
and he was so shaken.

1482
01:05:37,171 --> 01:05:38,871
So, Yesung went,
"Where were you doing there?"

1483
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:40,938
He's good at reading people, you see.

1484
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:43,971
Our manager shouted, "It's not like that!"

1485
01:05:44,038 --> 01:05:46,471
-As if.
-As if, right?

1486
01:05:47,238 --> 01:05:48,205
It definitely stinks.

1487
01:05:48,271 --> 01:05:50,338
So, he pushed them aside,
and they were like, "No, Yesung!"

1488
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:52,271
AFTER THE SCUFFLE,
YESUNG OPENED THE SHOE CLOSET

1489
01:05:52,338 --> 01:05:58,005
Yesung found a box
with all the items we had lost.

1490
01:05:58,938 --> 01:06:00,905
-He kept everything there?
-Yes, he did.

1491
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:04,471
After that, another scuffle ensued.

1492
01:06:04,538 --> 01:06:06,705
Yesung then called Leeteuk.

1493
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:08,938
Why did he call him?

1494
01:06:09,005 --> 01:06:10,771
-Because he's our leader.
-I see.

1495
01:06:10,838 --> 01:06:12,305
He was living on another floor.

1496
01:06:12,371 --> 01:06:14,305
Anyhow, that manager…

1497
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:15,838
-I suppose he begged.
-Right.

1498
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,205
He went,
"Please, Yesung. Don't tell anyone."

1499
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:19,138
He got on his knees.

1500
01:06:19,205 --> 01:06:21,605
He tried to pose
like a picture of obedience…

1501
01:06:22,538 --> 01:06:23,905
I'll show you how.

1502
01:06:23,971 --> 01:06:26,571
He would've been
on his knees like this, right?

1503
01:06:27,138 --> 01:06:29,871
"Just this once…
Please let it go, Yung-suk."

1504
01:06:29,938 --> 01:06:31,871
Leeteuk would've come to see, right?

1505
01:06:32,438 --> 01:06:35,771
When he came in,
the manager was leaning to the side,

1506
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:37,771
making it unclear
if he was kneeling or not.

1507
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:40,638
He was eventually fired.

1508
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:45,605
But the scary thing is,
I found him working for another singer.

1509
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:47,738
They always manage to get a new job.

1510
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,005
That sent chills down my spine.

1511
01:06:50,071 --> 01:06:52,805
I'll now move on to the meaty part.

1512
01:06:52,871 --> 01:06:56,071
I still remember where it happened.
It was at Konkuk University intersection.

1513
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:59,205
My manager made a U-turn
though it was forbidden in that area.

1514
01:06:59,805 --> 01:07:02,671
That brought out
an unmarked police car on a stakeout.

1515
01:07:02,738 --> 01:07:06,638
-The police?
-They followed us with the siren blaring.

1516
01:07:06,705 --> 01:07:07,871
WHEN THE POLICE GAVE PURSUIT

1517
01:07:07,938 --> 01:07:08,771
This guy…

1518
01:07:10,738 --> 01:07:12,038
hit the gas like crazy.

1519
01:07:12,105 --> 01:07:14,071
THE MANAGER CHOSE TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT

1520
01:07:14,138 --> 01:07:15,905
-With you in tow?
-Yes, exactly.

1521
01:07:15,971 --> 01:07:17,005
He was going faster.

1522
01:07:17,805 --> 01:07:19,471
So, I went, "Hey, what are you doing?"

1523
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:22,171
"What is all this?"

1524
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:23,805
FLABBERGASTED

1525
01:07:24,438 --> 01:07:26,405
I then noticed
that his eyes had gone wild.

1526
01:07:26,471 --> 01:07:27,371
Oh, I see.

1527
01:07:27,438 --> 01:07:29,705
"Kyuhyun, my driver's license
has been suspended."

1528
01:07:29,771 --> 01:07:30,771
That's insane!

1529
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:33,071
"Kyuhyun, my license
has already been suspended.

1530
01:07:33,138 --> 01:07:35,238
I can't let the police take me!"

1531
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:37,571
I went, "I get it, but even so--"
He only said, "No."

1532
01:07:37,638 --> 01:07:40,305
I was so scared
that I didn't dare to try to talk to him.

1533
01:07:40,371 --> 01:07:43,505
I held on to the grab handle.
But the thing was

1534
01:07:43,571 --> 01:07:45,538
-we had traffic ahead of us.
-It was over.

1535
01:07:45,605 --> 01:07:47,405
He started driving the wrong way.

1536
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:49,438
"Come on. I get you're desperate,
but this is out of line."

1537
01:07:49,505 --> 01:07:50,538
He still said, "No."

1538
01:07:50,605 --> 01:07:54,538
He wouldn't even look at me.
He just kept on driving.

1539
01:07:54,605 --> 01:07:56,838
I was like, "What am I supposed to do?"

1540
01:07:56,905 --> 01:07:59,371
But I couldn't talk to him
because he didn't look sane at the moment.

1541
01:07:59,438 --> 01:08:03,271
There was a motorcycle in front of us,
and the rider was driving slowly.

1542
01:08:03,338 --> 01:08:06,838
He started honking the horn
and yelling, "Get out of my way!"

1543
01:08:06,905 --> 01:08:09,371
"Get out of my freaking way!"
He swore, too.

1544
01:08:09,438 --> 01:08:11,405
But the rider noticed.

1545
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:16,471
Because of the blaring siren,
they knew my manager was trying to run.

1546
01:08:16,538 --> 01:08:18,871
-So, they went slowly on purpose.
-To block the way?

1547
01:08:18,938 --> 01:08:23,005
They'd cut in whenever my manager tried
to drive the wrong way and held him back.

1548
01:08:23,071 --> 01:08:26,871
In the end, he pulled over.
We had nowhere else to run.

1549
01:08:26,938 --> 01:08:28,938
My manager was like, "Hold on, Kyuhyun.

1550
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:33,305
My… My license
has been suspended, Kyuhyun.

1551
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:35,171
Can't you take the driver's seat?"

1552
01:08:36,005 --> 01:08:38,538
-He asked me that.
-But you're a celebrity.

1553
01:08:38,605 --> 01:08:40,371
He asked me to take the fall.

1554
01:08:41,138 --> 01:08:44,371
I went, "Come on, dude. You want me
to take the fall for wrong-way driving?

1555
01:08:45,005 --> 01:08:46,705
I can't do that."

1556
01:08:47,404 --> 01:08:49,938
Outside the car,
the officers were banging on our window.

1557
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:52,138
They yelled, "Get out now!"

1558
01:08:52,205 --> 01:08:56,071
The windows were heavily tinted,
so they couldn't see us.

1559
01:08:56,138 --> 01:08:58,105
When I said I wouldn't help him,

1560
01:08:58,171 --> 01:09:03,105
he was like, "Then tell me this, Kyuhyun.
Who'll take care of you when I'm gone?"

1561
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:06,904
I went, "What are you even saying?
I'll take care of that."

1562
01:09:06,971 --> 01:09:08,638
"Just open the door."

1563
01:09:08,705 --> 01:09:11,371
My manager still went,
"But I need to take care of you."

1564
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,971
The officers kept barking orders,
so he got out of the car.

1565
01:09:14,038 --> 01:09:16,205
The officers were fuming,
and they arrested him.

1566
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:19,305
He was like,
"Kyuhyun, what would happen to you now?

1567
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:21,171
Who's to take care of you?

1568
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:22,805
Kyuhyun!"

1569
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:26,105
It sounds like an exaggeration, right?
But I didn't spice things up at all.

1570
01:09:26,171 --> 01:09:28,438
He did call my name
as the officers took him away.

1571
01:09:28,505 --> 01:09:33,138
"Can't you take the driver's seat,
Kyuhyun?" This line is hilarious.

1572
01:09:33,205 --> 01:09:34,404
"Please?"

1573
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:36,605
I just can't even… This story makes me…

1574
01:09:36,671 --> 01:09:38,771
-That was spectacular, really.
-It's incredible.

1575
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:41,005
I can't believe he got the job
with a suspended license.

1576
01:09:41,071 --> 01:09:42,105
He had no working license.

1577
01:09:42,171 --> 01:09:44,938
How did he bear the suspense?

1578
01:09:45,005 --> 01:09:48,238
THE STORY TIME ENDS WITH THE EPIC TALE
OF THE WRONG-WAY DRIVING MANAGER

1579
01:09:49,105 --> 01:09:50,138
Shall we get going?

1580
01:09:50,205 --> 01:09:51,471
LUNCH HOUR IS OVER

1581
01:09:51,538 --> 01:09:54,138
Do you think they built this
so we could go down and watch?

1582
01:09:54,205 --> 01:09:56,238
GOING DOWN THE TERRACE

1583
01:09:56,305 --> 01:09:57,538
Hey, there's a hippo.

1584
01:09:58,538 --> 01:10:00,471
-My gosh.
-Isn't that a rock?

1585
01:10:00,538 --> 01:10:01,705
SUNBATHING HIPPOS

1586
01:10:01,771 --> 01:10:04,138
Man, they're huge.

1587
01:10:04,205 --> 01:10:06,338
JI-WON WALKS UP CLOSER TO THE HIPPOS

1588
01:10:06,405 --> 01:10:08,405
DR. EUN'S STUDY ON HIPPOS
LESSON 1

1589
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:10,038
-Dr. Eun.
-Yes?

1590
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:12,405
Why do hippos sleep so much?

1591
01:10:13,538 --> 01:10:15,505
They have nothing better to do.

1592
01:10:15,571 --> 01:10:17,738
-Really?
-It's not like they have natural enemies.

1593
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:20,171
They can't swim.

1594
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:21,571
-But that one's floating.
-What?

1595
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:23,205
Its head is above the surface.

1596
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:25,971
Their back just sits low, that's all.

1597
01:10:26,038 --> 01:10:27,371
They can't swim.

1598
01:10:27,438 --> 01:10:29,705
So, they stay away from deep waters.

1599
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:32,471
Because they can't swim,

1600
01:10:32,538 --> 01:10:36,138
they have to go underwater
and walk on land to move.

1601
01:10:36,205 --> 01:10:37,571
They're going in.

1602
01:10:37,638 --> 01:10:39,405
The sunlight is too strong for them.

1603
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:42,605
WADDLING INTO THE WATER
JUST AS DR. EUN SAID

1604
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,638
Look, one went underwater.

1605
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:48,738
-Shouldn't that count as swimming?
-No.

1606
01:10:49,271 --> 01:10:53,005
They only move by walking on the ground.

1607
01:10:53,071 --> 01:10:54,805
I find that hard to believe.

1608
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:57,005
You're impossible.

1609
01:10:57,071 --> 01:10:58,171
Look it up.

1610
01:10:58,938 --> 01:11:01,105
SEARCHING ON THE WEB DUE TO MISTRUST

1611
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:02,905
-It says they can't swim.
-See?

1612
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:03,838
Really?

1613
01:11:03,905 --> 01:11:05,705
HONOR RESTORED

1614
01:11:06,271 --> 01:11:10,471
Why didn't you believe me?
I have never once lied in my life.

1615
01:11:10,538 --> 01:11:13,638
I might have made assertions
based on wrong knowledge

1616
01:11:13,705 --> 01:11:17,438
or from what I knew to be common sense,
but I have never lied in my life.

1617
01:11:17,505 --> 01:11:19,971
BECAUSE OF THEIR HEAVY BUILD
AND SHORT LEGS

1618
01:11:20,038 --> 01:11:22,705
HIPPOS WALK UNDERWATER INSTEAD OF SWIMMING

1619
01:11:23,338 --> 01:11:26,105
DR. EUN IS BACK AT THE LODGE

1620
01:11:26,671 --> 01:11:28,238
I'm concerned about the hippos.

1621
01:11:29,205 --> 01:11:31,238
They could come up here.

1622
01:11:31,305 --> 01:11:34,171
-What's to stop them?
-We're in the remotest corner.

1623
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:35,305
But they walk past here.

1624
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,538
-I guess they may come here by mistake.
-Exactly.

1625
01:11:38,305 --> 01:11:40,705
Ji-won, I'll be right here with you.

1626
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:42,205
-Don't worry.
-All right.

1627
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:46,671
But you can never beat a hippo.

1628
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:49,371
I can't, but I can die with you.

1629
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:50,305
HIS STRENGTH IS LOYALTY

1630
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:52,005
No, don't. Save yourself.

1631
01:11:54,438 --> 01:11:58,405
I APPLAUD YOUR BRAVERY

1632
01:11:59,005 --> 01:12:01,605
Aren't we supposed to gather
at the lounge at 5 p.m.?

1633
01:12:01,671 --> 01:12:03,438
Right, they told us to come then.

1634
01:12:03,505 --> 01:12:05,705
THE IDIOTS AT THE LOUNGE

1635
01:12:05,771 --> 01:12:07,471
Pumbaas are so cute.

1636
01:12:07,538 --> 01:12:08,738
STUDYING PUMBAA

1637
01:12:09,438 --> 01:12:11,971
PUMBAA OF LEISURE

1638
01:12:12,638 --> 01:12:16,205
SLEEPY PUMBAA

1639
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:20,938
FOODIE PUMBAA

1640
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:24,038
-I wonder what it's eating.
-Most likely ants.

1641
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,205
Whenever I see them,
they're stuffing their faces.

1642
01:12:26,271 --> 01:12:30,538
They don't seem to damage the lawn
like the hogs in Korea do.

1643
01:12:30,605 --> 01:12:32,738
That's why they're left alone.

1644
01:12:32,805 --> 01:12:35,805
If they were a threat to the lawn,
the staff would've driven them away.

1645
01:12:36,438 --> 01:12:38,771
With these guys around,
they won't need a lawnmower.

1646
01:12:38,838 --> 01:12:42,271
They seem to eat all the ants too, right?

1647
01:12:43,071 --> 01:12:45,205
AS THEY ONLY GRAZE ON THE TOP OF THE GRASS

1648
01:12:45,271 --> 01:12:48,938
THEY ACTUALLY HELP MAINTAIN
THE LAWN AND ITS VEGETATION DIVERSITY

1649
01:12:49,005 --> 01:12:52,471
LET ME BE YOUR HONORARY LAWNMOWER

1650
01:12:52,538 --> 01:12:55,038
Even after 30 minutes,
I still enjoy watching them.

1651
01:12:56,871 --> 01:13:00,805
Maybe Africa is all about Pumbaas.
We should add them to the Big Five.

1652
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:01,971
IDIOTS GROWING ON THEM

1653
01:13:02,038 --> 01:13:04,471
HEADING TO THE DINNER SITE

1654
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:07,271
We have a great view
over the hippo bank today.

1655
01:13:08,305 --> 01:13:10,738
This is just…

1656
01:13:10,805 --> 01:13:12,305
Wait, I should go this way.

1657
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:13,205
I'm craving…

1658
01:13:13,271 --> 01:13:15,038
-Hey, we've got soju!
-What?

1659
01:13:15,705 --> 01:13:16,538
What's this?

1660
01:13:16,605 --> 01:13:18,871
Are we doing the dear old Soju Quiz?

1661
01:13:18,938 --> 01:13:21,538
-What's this?
-It's time for dinner.

1662
01:13:22,305 --> 01:13:23,405
What else can it be? It's soju.

1663
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:25,171
-What is this?
-Soju, obviously.

1664
01:13:26,571 --> 01:13:28,571
-What's this?
-It's soju.

1665
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:31,505
You think I don't know that?

1666
01:13:31,571 --> 01:13:33,771
-Sure, I thought so.
-It looked that way to me.

1667
01:13:33,838 --> 01:13:35,538
SO FRIENDLY FROM THE GET-GO

1668
01:13:35,605 --> 01:13:37,671
-Are we holding a rite?
-No.

1669
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:40,838
-Today…
-An ancestral rite?

1670
01:13:40,905 --> 01:13:44,338
We're four days into the shoot,
so it's time to consolidate.

1671
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:46,838
The dinner's theme is a team dinner.

1672
01:13:46,905 --> 01:13:49,305
-I'd love that.
-That's how it will be.

1673
01:13:49,371 --> 01:13:51,105
The rule of the game is simple.

1674
01:13:51,171 --> 01:13:54,171
Pour as much soju as you want
into your glass.

1675
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:58,271
If you win a game,
we'll give you one delicious Korean dish.

1676
01:13:59,405 --> 01:14:01,405
KOREAN FOOD TEAM DINNER

1677
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:03,471
OUT IN THE SAFARI

1678
01:14:03,538 --> 01:14:06,071
INTRODUCING THE DISHES TO GO WITH SOJU

1679
01:14:06,638 --> 01:14:08,938
THE BASICS
INCLUDING INSTANT RICE AND CANNED TUNA

1680
01:14:09,505 --> 01:14:11,105
JJAJANG RAMYEON

1681
01:14:11,671 --> 01:14:13,038
COLD NOODLES

1682
01:14:13,605 --> 01:14:15,138
KIMCHI STEW

1683
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:17,138
STIR-FRIED SQUID

1684
01:14:17,705 --> 01:14:19,305
BULGOGI

1685
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:23,338
GENEROUS PORTION OF PORK BELLY

1686
01:14:23,405 --> 01:14:25,438
-There's a chance you may lose, right?
-Yes.

1687
01:14:25,505 --> 01:14:27,338
IF THEY LOSE

1688
01:14:27,405 --> 01:14:31,038
THEY MUST DRINK ONLY SOJU

1689
01:14:31,105 --> 01:14:35,438
-We'll get heartburn.
-We may end up babbling gibberish.

1690
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:39,305
-We may end up eating grass over there.
-We should join Pumbaa.

1691
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:41,338
-Just like this.
-We may collapse,

1692
01:14:41,405 --> 01:14:44,605
get on our knees, and start grazing grass.

1693
01:14:44,671 --> 01:14:48,105
Our best-case scenario is having
hammered Su-geun swim next to hippos.

1694
01:14:48,171 --> 01:14:49,205
That's for sure.

1695
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:51,238
I can picture him on a hippo's back.

1696
01:14:51,305 --> 01:14:57,638
I can almost see shirtless Su-geun
on a hippo's back going wild like this.

1697
01:14:57,705 --> 01:14:59,438
-That'd be incredible.
-I'd love to see that.

1698
01:14:59,505 --> 01:15:02,038
-Just amazing.
-I think you can pull it off.

1699
01:15:02,105 --> 01:15:03,138
WE'LL LET YOU ON OUR BACKS

1700
01:15:03,205 --> 01:15:06,638
Let's kick it off with something light.
Bring in the first dish.

1701
01:15:07,538 --> 01:15:10,005
-Surely, we'd get some side dishes.
-Why the plain rice?

1702
01:15:10,071 --> 01:15:11,805
We got instant rice for starters.

1703
01:15:11,871 --> 01:15:15,671
But isn't rice underwhelming
as the first drinking snack?

1704
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:19,271
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE PLAIN RICE TO YOU?

1705
01:15:20,005 --> 01:15:22,871
IT'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTFULLY CHEWY
HIGH-END INSTANT RICE

1706
01:15:22,938 --> 01:15:25,371
We can win the rice first
and continue to secure more food?

1707
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,005
They must bring in more dishes.

1708
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:28,505
THEY CAN KEEP IT AND ENJOY IT LATER

1709
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:31,571
We're going to do
a little bit of everything.

1710
01:15:31,638 --> 01:15:34,805
Looking back,
you played Continue the Phrase,

1711
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:38,505
Name It, Charades, and others.

1712
01:15:38,571 --> 01:15:39,805
Your first game is…

1713
01:15:40,805 --> 01:15:43,805
We haven't played this in a while.
It's Continue the Idiom.

1714
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:44,705
Idioms?

1715
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:48,005
CONTINUE THE IDIOM

1716
01:15:48,071 --> 01:15:49,771
For example, three-day?

1717
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:50,705
-Hump.
-Hump.

1718
01:15:50,771 --> 01:15:51,938
Exactly. That's how it's done.

1719
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,405
Is it a round trip?

1720
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:56,638
Yes, Su-geun will have to go there
after he gives his answer.

1721
01:15:56,705 --> 01:15:59,438
-If he answers correctly--
-Let's go. We can relax with this game.

1722
01:16:00,438 --> 01:16:02,071
-What was it again?
-Took… a punch?

1723
01:16:02,138 --> 01:16:03,405
-Took a punch.
-Three, two, one.

1724
01:16:03,471 --> 01:16:04,838
-Took a punch.
-Took a punch, damn it.

1725
01:16:04,905 --> 01:16:07,038
Why did you add "damn it" at the end?

1726
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:08,805
I localized it.

1727
01:16:08,871 --> 01:16:09,871
Let's begin.

1728
01:16:09,938 --> 01:16:11,071
INSTANT RICE ROUND

1729
01:16:12,305 --> 01:16:13,271
A blessing?

1730
01:16:13,338 --> 01:16:14,771
-In disguise.
-Correct.

1731
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:15,738
A self-sacrifice?

1732
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:17,205
-For the righteous cause.
-Correct.

1733
01:16:17,271 --> 01:16:18,305
-Blow hot?
-And cold.

1734
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:19,738
Correct. The cream?

1735
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:21,238
-Of the crop!
-Correct.

1736
01:16:21,838 --> 01:16:23,371
THEY'VE HIT THE HALFWAY POINT
ON THEIR FIRST ROUND!

1737
01:16:23,438 --> 01:16:24,605
-Killing two birds?
-With one stone.

1738
01:16:24,671 --> 01:16:26,038
Correct. Penny-wise?

1739
01:16:26,105 --> 01:16:27,805
-And pound-foolish.
-Correct.

1740
01:16:27,871 --> 01:16:29,571
-Go the?
-Extra mile?

1741
01:16:29,638 --> 01:16:31,138
Hold on. "Go the"?

1742
01:16:31,205 --> 01:16:32,771
-Hey, you got it.
-I did, right?

1743
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,438
-I got so startled!
-"Go the extra mile!"

1744
01:16:34,505 --> 01:16:35,871
-I thought I got it wrong!
-Correct!

1745
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:38,905
Gosh.

1746
01:16:39,571 --> 01:16:40,438
Gosh.

1747
01:16:40,505 --> 01:16:41,538
You guys killed it.

1748
01:16:41,605 --> 01:16:43,138
-We now know our idioms.
-Did you think

1749
01:16:43,205 --> 01:16:45,105
we'd still be "bricks short of a load?"

1750
01:16:45,171 --> 01:16:46,471
-We're not messing around.
-Exactly.

1751
01:16:46,538 --> 01:16:48,671
"BRICKS SHORT OF A LOAD"
IS A FIT EXPRESSION

1752
01:16:48,738 --> 01:16:51,038
-I was so startled.
-Hey, what comes after "a self-sacrifice"?

1753
01:16:51,105 --> 01:16:53,605
"For a righteous cause," of course.
Why wouldn't I know that?

1754
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:55,971
That idiom was one of the easiest.

1755
01:16:56,638 --> 01:16:59,871
-So, did we win the rice?
-Yes, have a shot to celebrate.

1756
01:16:59,938 --> 01:17:01,871
-What?
-Drink to celebrate.

1757
01:17:01,938 --> 01:17:04,071
-With just rice?
-With just rice?

1758
01:17:04,638 --> 01:17:06,071
THEY'RE NOT KEEN ON THE IDEA

1759
01:17:06,138 --> 01:17:07,205
You can have rice with it.

1760
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:09,971
-Let's just take a sip.
-But you have to down the first glass.

1761
01:17:10,038 --> 01:17:12,438
-We can refill our glass?
-We can adjust the amount. Let's drink.

1762
01:17:12,505 --> 01:17:13,705
-All right.
-Bottoms up.

1763
01:17:13,771 --> 01:17:15,738
-Let's celebrate!
-I love you, Kenya.

1764
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,171
Man, you can just tell
it was kept at room temperature.

1765
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:29,405
-Room temperature?
-It could've gotten rather hot.

1766
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,538
The alcohol is quite strong.

1767
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:32,605
SO HOT

1768
01:17:32,671 --> 01:17:34,471
I love the smell of the rice.
It's been so long.

1769
01:17:34,538 --> 01:17:36,205
Take one spoonful each.

1770
01:17:36,838 --> 01:17:39,605
I started to miss Korean rice
after all the Kenyan rice.

1771
01:17:39,671 --> 01:17:41,505
They're so different.

1772
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:43,905
My gosh.

1773
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:47,638
JI-WON TAKES A SPOONFUL TOO

1774
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:49,338
It's been so long since I had white rice.

1775
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:52,638
I know. This chewy texture…

1776
01:17:52,705 --> 01:17:54,705
Close your eyes and savor the taste.

1777
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:56,405
Rice is savory in itself.

1778
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:58,905
Have you carried uncooked rice around
in your pocket as a snack?

1779
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:01,638
We used to do that
and snack on it back in the day.

1780
01:18:01,705 --> 01:18:02,905
-Uncooked rice?
-Sure.

1781
01:18:02,971 --> 01:18:03,805
You snacked on it?

1782
01:18:03,871 --> 01:18:05,605
-Don't lie, Su-geun.
-Right in my pocket and…

1783
01:18:05,671 --> 01:18:07,071
Why would you put it there?

1784
01:18:07,138 --> 01:18:08,605
Why the shade about uncooked rice?

1785
01:18:08,671 --> 01:18:10,505
Don't act like
you were born with a silver spoon.

1786
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,705
"PLAYING DUMB" SPIEL BUSTED

1787
01:18:15,271 --> 01:18:16,371
HERE COMES THE NEXT DISH

1788
01:18:16,438 --> 01:18:18,005
-Thank you.
-Bring in the next dish.

1789
01:18:18,071 --> 01:18:19,605
What are those? Glasses of ice?

1790
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:21,405
SOME ICE TO COOL DOWN SOJU
AND THE NEXT SNACK

1791
01:18:21,471 --> 01:18:23,938
-It's a light… Thank you.
-Canned tuna.

1792
01:18:24,005 --> 01:18:25,171
-May I…
-Just one, please.

1793
01:18:26,005 --> 01:18:27,171
So, you enjoy soju that way?

1794
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:28,338
I'll pour mine here.

1795
01:18:28,405 --> 01:18:29,471
That's not right.

1796
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,338
-But why?
-Come on, it will get watered down.

1797
01:18:32,405 --> 01:18:34,471
For goodness' sake.

1798
01:18:36,005 --> 01:18:37,138
What on earth, Su-geun?

1799
01:18:37,205 --> 01:18:39,838
-What was that for?
-I'm drinking the same amount of soju.

1800
01:18:39,905 --> 01:18:42,071
-The ice will melt and dilute it.
-He's right.

1801
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:43,471
-This won't do.
-Some drink this way.

1802
01:18:43,538 --> 01:18:44,771
You should savor its unique flavor.

1803
01:18:44,838 --> 01:18:46,038
THE YOUNGER ONES ARE WORKED UP
FOR SOME REASON

1804
01:18:46,105 --> 01:18:47,905
-Don't…
-That'll get watered down.

1805
01:18:47,971 --> 01:18:49,171
POURS RUTHLESSLY

1806
01:18:49,838 --> 01:18:51,205
THE OLDEST IDIOT HAS NO CHOICE

1807
01:18:51,271 --> 01:18:52,638
You did the same.

1808
01:18:52,705 --> 01:18:54,038
-What?
-You did the same thing.

1809
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:56,005
-Enjoy the original flavor.
-There. Satisfied?

1810
01:18:56,605 --> 01:18:57,905
GIGGLES

1811
01:18:57,971 --> 01:19:00,905
At this rate,
we'll get drunk by the halfway point.

1812
01:19:00,971 --> 01:19:05,105
PREVIEW

1813
01:19:05,171 --> 01:19:07,405
It's not like I committed a capital crime.

1814
01:19:07,471 --> 01:19:08,938
-These days--
-That's against the rules!

1815
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:12,271
These days,
many people drink soju this way.

1816
01:19:12,338 --> 01:19:14,905
-What? I want to use my small glass.
-Let's use the same glass.

1817
01:19:14,971 --> 01:19:16,538
Otherwise, it gets confusing.

1818
01:19:16,605 --> 01:19:19,771
-What's this?
-Shot glasses can look inappropriate.

1819
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:21,638
It's a fine way to promote our culture.

1820
01:19:21,705 --> 01:19:23,871
-Let's keep it uniform.
-Like that could promote our culture.

1821
01:19:23,938 --> 01:19:25,238
THAT'S ENOUGH

1822
01:19:25,305 --> 01:19:28,338
-My gosh. Is this…
-The second dish is canned tuna.

1823
01:19:28,405 --> 01:19:30,038
It's a low-calorie snack.

1824
01:19:30,105 --> 01:19:32,405
CANNED TUNA ROUND

1825
01:19:32,471 --> 01:19:34,405
Since you're so good at it,

1826
01:19:34,471 --> 01:19:38,338
why don't we have another round
of Continue the Idioms?

1827
01:19:38,405 --> 01:19:40,671
-The idioms?
-Again?

1828
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:43,071
Here we go with Continue the Idiom.

1829
01:19:43,138 --> 01:19:44,471
The prize is canned tuna.

1830
01:19:46,938 --> 01:19:48,805
-All sizzle?
-And no steak.

1831
01:19:48,871 --> 01:19:49,971
Owe someone?

1832
01:19:50,538 --> 01:19:51,871
-A meal?
-A debt of gratitude.

1833
01:19:51,938 --> 01:19:53,005
Gratitude? Damn it.

1834
01:19:53,071 --> 01:19:54,305
-A meal?
-A debt of gratitude.

1835
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:55,671
Gratitude? Damn it.

1836
01:19:55,738 --> 01:19:58,471
ONLY THE YOUNGEST IDIOT DIDN'T KNOW

1837
01:19:58,538 --> 01:20:01,571
That's more like it.
You can only make it this far.

1838
01:20:01,638 --> 01:20:04,138
I never expected Kyuhyun
to give a wrong answer.

1839
01:20:04,205 --> 01:20:07,805
Take responsibility and down a shot.
This has nothing to do with us.

1840
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:09,838
It's a penalty drink.

1841
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:12,805
-Drink up
-Drink up

1842
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:15,405
-Don't keep me doing the shimmy
-Don't keep me doing the shimmy

1843
01:20:15,471 --> 01:20:21,205
Look at that Pumbaa
It's feeding

1844
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:23,271
DEEPLY MOVED

1845
01:20:23,338 --> 01:20:25,438
Go on. Down the shot, punk.

1846
01:20:25,505 --> 01:20:26,871
Look at that Pumbaa.

1847
01:20:26,938 --> 01:20:29,038
-It's feeding.
-It's feeding.

1848
01:20:29,105 --> 01:20:32,071
WHAT A RELIABLE PAIR OF IDIOTS
WITH AN AVERAGE AGE OF 48.5

1849
01:20:32,138 --> 01:20:33,638
I'll drink half a glass.

1850
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:35,038
-Half a glass?
-This is too much.

1851
01:20:35,105 --> 01:20:38,205
-Just finish it.
-We'll allow half a glass.

1852
01:20:38,771 --> 01:20:41,905
GLUG, GLUG

1853
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:44,171
He drank more than I expected.

1854
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:45,171
All that alcohol.

1855
01:20:46,438 --> 01:20:47,771
-It's not bad, right?
-Why is it sweet?

1856
01:20:47,838 --> 01:20:49,005
Soju's sweet.

1857
01:20:49,071 --> 01:20:51,538
CANNED TUNA, OUT

1858
01:20:51,605 --> 01:20:53,405
Here's your next dish.

1859
01:20:53,471 --> 01:20:54,738
What is it? Tteok-galbi?

1860
01:20:54,805 --> 01:20:57,038
-No, that's stir-fried squid.
-It's squid.

1861
01:20:57,105 --> 01:20:58,938
-It's squid.
-We should win that.

1862
01:20:59,005 --> 01:21:01,105
GLAD TO SEE SOME SPICY RED SEASONING

1863
01:21:01,771 --> 01:21:05,071
SPICY TASTE OF KOREAN CUISINE

1864
01:21:06,438 --> 01:21:09,138
STIR-FRIED SQUID

1865
01:21:09,705 --> 01:21:11,305
This is it. It's the endgame.

1866
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:12,471
I really want that.

1867
01:21:12,538 --> 01:21:14,938
-A true drinking snack.
-It looks rather spicy.

1868
01:21:15,005 --> 01:21:16,671
We can finish two bottles with that alone.

1869
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:18,305
For sure, why stop at two?

1870
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:21,471
Do you know the special talent
of folks from the countryside?

1871
01:21:21,538 --> 01:21:23,438
They only order one snack
and leave it untouched.

1872
01:21:24,905 --> 01:21:25,971
-I don't get it.
-Don't you know?

1873
01:21:26,038 --> 01:21:28,271
The country folks…
Let me borrow your chopsticks.

1874
01:21:28,338 --> 01:21:30,038
Let's say there's a small pub.

1875
01:21:30,105 --> 01:21:32,338
Folks would gather and order tofu-kimchi.

1876
01:21:32,405 --> 01:21:34,938
That's the only dish they order.

1877
01:21:35,005 --> 01:21:38,805
They'd pour a glass and down it.
Then, they'll pick up the snack.

1878
01:21:38,871 --> 01:21:44,105
After picking a piece up,
"Didn't I tell you just two days ago?

1879
01:21:44,171 --> 01:21:47,571
If you want to irrigate your paddy,
do it bright and early, punk.

1880
01:21:47,638 --> 01:21:49,971
If you have excuses, let's hear them.

1881
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:54,238
You little prick.
Do you know how long I've lived this way?"

1882
01:21:54,305 --> 01:21:55,638
The dish would remain as it was.

1883
01:21:55,705 --> 01:21:58,371
It'd be untouched
even after they finished drinking.

1884
01:21:58,438 --> 01:22:00,871
I guess that explains
how they're all on the thin side.

1885
01:22:00,938 --> 01:22:03,271
-They have so much to talk about.
-They sure do.

1886
01:22:03,338 --> 01:22:05,438
We can finish 20 bottles with this.

1887
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:06,538
I enjoyed that.

1888
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:09,705
So, the next game is…

1889
01:22:10,505 --> 01:22:11,805
Name It.

1890
01:22:12,571 --> 01:22:15,005
For instance,
dishes served in Chinese places?

1891
01:22:15,071 --> 01:22:15,938
Jjajangmyeon.

1892
01:22:16,005 --> 01:22:18,038
Three, two, one. Jjamppong.
You know the drill.

1893
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:20,938
-So, the keyword is animal.
-What's the theme?

1894
01:22:21,005 --> 01:22:23,405
-I love animals.
-You know a lot, right?

1895
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:26,371
-You're our zoologist for the day.
-Right.

1896
01:22:26,438 --> 01:22:28,638
-You even led our tour.
-I'll swap seats with you.

1897
01:22:28,705 --> 01:22:30,071
We're going to play Name It.

1898
01:22:30,138 --> 01:22:33,505
Ji-won, you have to go to the fourth spot
after your initial answer.

1899
01:22:33,571 --> 01:22:34,705
This won't be easy.

1900
01:22:34,771 --> 01:22:36,971
Shall we, then? Our theme is animals.

1901
01:22:39,438 --> 01:22:41,038
Name animals
with a three-syllable Korean name.

1902
01:22:41,105 --> 01:22:42,205
-Three, two, one.
-Komodo dragon.

1903
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:43,305
-Three, two, one.
-Leopard cat.

1904
01:22:43,371 --> 01:22:44,438
-Three, two, one.
-Tiger.

1905
01:22:44,505 --> 01:22:46,271
-Three, two, one.
-Tiger.

1906
01:22:46,338 --> 01:22:47,938
-Three, two, one.
-Red squirrel.

1907
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,805
-Three, two, one.
-Cobra.

1908
01:22:49,871 --> 01:22:51,305
-Three, two, one.
-Lion.

1909
01:22:52,438 --> 01:22:53,571
AN AWKWARD TENSION

1910
01:22:53,638 --> 01:22:55,571
-"Tiger" and "lion" work, right?
-Of course.

1911
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:56,971
A LOADED GLANCE

1912
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:58,371
-What's the issue?
-Success!

1913
01:22:58,438 --> 01:23:00,505
-What did you say?
-What?

1914
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:01,938
Will they accept tiger
in Korean and English?

1915
01:23:02,005 --> 01:23:03,171
Did we use tiger twice?

1916
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:06,038
Oh, I did think something sounded off.

1917
01:23:06,105 --> 01:23:07,071
-Three, two, one.
-Tiger.

1918
01:23:07,138 --> 01:23:08,205
Three, two, one

1919
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:09,105
A REAL-TIME INTERPRETER

1920
01:23:09,171 --> 01:23:10,571
-Three, two, one.
-Red squirrel.

1921
01:23:10,638 --> 01:23:12,471
STARTLED TIGER

1922
01:23:12,538 --> 01:23:15,005
-Didn't you say "lion"?
-I gave that answer too.

1923
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:17,905
You can't use tiger twice,
once in Korean and once in English.

1924
01:23:17,971 --> 01:23:19,738
WE'LL TRY AGAIN

1925
01:23:19,805 --> 01:23:22,905
-Finding three-syllable names is rough.
-That's the easiest.

1926
01:23:22,971 --> 01:23:24,371
-Komodo dragon.
-Most do. Squirrel…

1927
01:23:24,438 --> 01:23:25,738
-Cobra…
-I said it.

1928
01:23:25,805 --> 01:23:27,171
-When?
-Komodo dragon was my answer.

1929
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:28,571
I kicked us off with it.

1930
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:31,905
You guys named all the animals
I had in mind.

1931
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:34,238
THE ZOOLOGIST HAD HIS REASONS

1932
01:23:34,305 --> 01:23:37,205
That's why you said "tiger" in English
after I said it in Korean.

1933
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:38,771
I can't say.

1934
01:23:38,838 --> 01:23:40,338
I tried to use the difficult ones.

1935
01:23:40,405 --> 01:23:42,938
-Let's try again.
-I thought I was being witty.

1936
01:23:43,005 --> 01:23:46,671
This time, you'll name animals
in the category of two.

1937
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:49,738
-Two? So two-syllable names?
-Two syllables?

1938
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:54,238
Name two-legged animals.

1939
01:23:54,305 --> 01:23:55,771
-Three, two, one.
-Sparrow.

1940
01:23:55,838 --> 01:23:57,005
-Three, two, one.
-Duck.

1941
01:23:57,071 --> 01:23:58,105
-Three, two, one.
-Crane.

1942
01:23:58,171 --> 01:23:59,071
-Three, two, one.
-Pigeon.

1943
01:23:59,138 --> 01:24:00,138
-Three, two, one.
-Peacock.

1944
01:24:00,205 --> 01:24:01,771
-Three, two, one.
-Scallop.

1945
01:24:01,838 --> 01:24:03,705
-Three… Incorrect!
-Scallop?

1946
01:24:03,771 --> 01:24:04,638
-Three, two, one.
-Pigeon.

1947
01:24:04,705 --> 01:24:05,671
-Three, two, one.
-Peacock.

1948
01:24:05,738 --> 01:24:07,005
-Three, two, one.
-Scallop.

1949
01:24:07,071 --> 01:24:07,905
Three… Incorrect!

1950
01:24:07,971 --> 01:24:09,305
-Scallop?
-Scallop?

1951
01:24:09,371 --> 01:24:10,571
That's shellfish.

1952
01:24:10,638 --> 01:24:12,038
Scallop?

1953
01:24:12,105 --> 01:24:13,438
It is shellfish, isn't it?

1954
01:24:13,505 --> 01:24:15,338
-Isn't there a bird with that name?
-Does it have legs?

1955
01:24:15,405 --> 01:24:17,005
There's this one with a similar name.

1956
01:24:17,071 --> 01:24:20,305
Wait, I meant to name scoter.

1957
01:24:20,371 --> 01:24:22,571
Of all the bird names to choose from,
you wanted scoter?

1958
01:24:22,638 --> 01:24:24,038
-It's not the easiest.
-Exactly.

1959
01:24:24,105 --> 01:24:26,805
-I wanted to leave easier options for you.
-I could've named any other bird.

1960
01:24:26,871 --> 01:24:28,271
I truly apologize for this.

1961
01:24:28,338 --> 01:24:29,771
-Didn't we--
-Why not say pigeon?

1962
01:24:29,838 --> 01:24:31,405
Didn't we have scallops yesterday?

1963
01:24:33,071 --> 01:24:33,905
All right.

1964
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:35,038
EXCHANGING A LOOK

1965
01:24:35,838 --> 01:24:38,405
A PENALTY DRINK IN A DISHEVELED STATE

1966
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:41,338
STIR-FRIED SQUID, OUT

1967
01:24:41,405 --> 01:24:43,905
Since Su-geun has had his drink,
we'll show you the next dish.

1968
01:24:43,971 --> 01:24:45,138
-What a shame.
-I already drank it.

1969
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:46,838
-We almost had it.
-What's this?

1970
01:24:46,905 --> 01:24:48,238
Jjajang ramyeon with fried egg.

1971
01:24:48,305 --> 01:24:49,505
Jjagye.

1972
01:24:50,205 --> 01:24:53,805
I'M THE CHEF TODAY

1973
01:24:54,771 --> 01:24:57,905
JJAJANG RAMYEON

1974
01:24:57,971 --> 01:25:00,705
Here we have jjajang ramyeon.

1975
01:25:00,771 --> 01:25:04,805
We'll be trying a special version
of Continue the Phrase.

1976
01:25:04,871 --> 01:25:06,271
Is it a new one?

1977
01:25:06,338 --> 01:25:09,205
You'll complete the names
of historical figures.

1978
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:10,438
That's too difficult.

1979
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,905
-Ji-won, can you handle it there?
-It doesn't matter.

1980
01:25:12,971 --> 01:25:15,238
-Do you want my seat?
-You two carry the load.

1981
01:25:15,305 --> 01:25:16,805
-You can come here, then.
-Yeah, go there.

1982
01:25:16,871 --> 01:25:18,271
Okay, I'll try it.

1983
01:25:18,338 --> 01:25:20,371
It's not like I'm confident.
Why am I swapping seats?

1984
01:25:21,405 --> 01:25:22,571
Because you're arrogant.

1985
01:25:24,405 --> 01:25:25,638
NEEDS TO PROVE HIMSELF

1986
01:25:25,705 --> 01:25:26,805
-All right.
-This is…

1987
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:28,105
-Continue the Phrase.
-Let's get that.

1988
01:25:28,171 --> 01:25:32,538
The theme is famous historical figures.

1989
01:25:32,605 --> 01:25:34,471
It's easy. Here we go.

1990
01:25:34,538 --> 01:25:35,571
JJAJANG RAMYEON ROUND

1991
01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:39,205
-Leonardo?
-DiCaprio.

1992
01:25:40,338 --> 01:25:41,271
Isn't it DaVichi?

1993
01:25:41,338 --> 01:25:42,971
That's so tricky to call…

1994
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:44,171
Incorrect!

1995
01:25:44,805 --> 01:25:47,471
-He's not a historical figure.
-But he is writing history.

1996
01:25:47,538 --> 01:25:48,905
He's still alive!

1997
01:25:48,971 --> 01:25:50,271
-They wanted da Vinci, right?
-Sure.

1998
01:25:50,338 --> 01:25:51,705
The answer is da Vinci, right?

1999
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:53,805
-Yes, how could you go for DiCaprio?
-DiCaprio?

2000
01:25:53,871 --> 01:25:55,271
The painter of the Last Supper.

2001
01:25:55,338 --> 01:25:57,805
-Isn't DiCaprio a historical figure?
-No.

2002
01:25:57,871 --> 01:26:00,371
He's actively working as an actor.

2003
01:26:00,438 --> 01:26:02,671
Are you a historical figure, Kyuhyun?

2004
01:26:02,738 --> 01:26:03,805
That doesn't sound so bad.

2005
01:26:04,471 --> 01:26:06,005
I LOVE MYSELF

2006
01:26:06,071 --> 01:26:08,038
Still, Leonardo DiCaprio was hilarious.

2007
01:26:08,105 --> 01:26:10,271
Can't we try again?
We only heard one question anyway.

2008
01:26:11,105 --> 01:26:13,738
Have a penalty drink first.
I'll leave the amount to your discretion.

2009
01:26:13,805 --> 01:26:15,938
LET'S TRY AGAIN

2010
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:20,105
Okay, this is Continue the Phrase
on historical figures.

2011
01:26:20,171 --> 01:26:21,638
Kyuhyun will kick us off.

2012
01:26:21,705 --> 01:26:23,938
Way to make yourself look dumb on a show.

2013
01:26:25,205 --> 01:26:26,771
-Michel?
-Angelo.

2014
01:26:26,838 --> 01:26:27,805
Correct.

2015
01:26:28,438 --> 01:26:30,138
-Galileo?
-Galilei.

2016
01:26:30,205 --> 01:26:31,205
Correct.

2017
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:34,338
-Vincent van?
-Obama.

2018
01:26:34,405 --> 01:26:36,205
-Incorrect!
-You punk… Excuse me.

2019
01:26:36,271 --> 01:26:37,505
You punk… Excuse me.

2020
01:26:38,805 --> 01:26:40,238
Vincent Obama?

2021
01:26:40,871 --> 01:26:43,105
-Ji-won!
-What's Vincent's last name?

2022
01:26:43,171 --> 01:26:44,638
Van Gogh, of course.

2023
01:26:44,705 --> 01:26:45,838
Change your answer.

2024
01:26:45,905 --> 01:26:47,538
How about Vincent Consent?

2025
01:26:48,205 --> 01:26:50,671
Can we go again?
Let's go with Vincent Consent.

2026
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:53,005
-Vincent…
-Consent. Go on, say it.

2027
01:26:53,071 --> 01:26:55,105
But that would make me look really dumb.

2028
01:26:55,171 --> 01:26:58,505
-I don't feel comfortable with that.
-What about Vincent Obama?

2029
01:26:59,905 --> 01:27:01,405
Obama is a person, at least.

2030
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:02,538
But consent…

2031
01:27:02,605 --> 01:27:04,871
Anyone would see that it's a random noun.

2032
01:27:04,938 --> 01:27:08,071
-How could you suggest that?
-Our other show covered van Gogh.

2033
01:27:08,138 --> 01:27:09,671
-They learned about him.
-On the history show.

2034
01:27:09,738 --> 01:27:12,805
I got van Gogh,
but I couldn't recall his first name.

2035
01:27:12,871 --> 01:27:14,805
Why did you whisper
Obama in my ear anyway?

2036
01:27:14,871 --> 01:27:15,971
Who do you mean?

2037
01:27:16,038 --> 01:27:17,238
-You did.
-He told you that?

2038
01:27:17,305 --> 01:27:19,071
-What did I even say?
-You whispered Obama.

2039
01:27:19,138 --> 01:27:21,171
I only did it because you seemed clueless.

2040
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:22,338
Vincent?

2041
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:25,171
INPUT: OBAMA
OUTPUT: OBAMA

2042
01:27:25,238 --> 01:27:26,205
Why did you say it?

2043
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:28,505
His name just came to me at that moment.

2044
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:33,171
-Vincent Consent.
-I might call Vincent Consent from now on.

2045
01:27:33,838 --> 01:27:35,538
It's all because of you!

2046
01:27:36,205 --> 01:27:38,305
-Vincent?
-Consent.

2047
01:27:38,371 --> 01:27:39,471
RHYME TIME

2048
01:27:39,538 --> 01:27:40,838
It's neat.

2049
01:27:40,905 --> 01:27:43,738
It sounds like he's the guy
who invented the concept of consent.

2050
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:46,971
We don't really know historical figures
by their full name.

2051
01:27:47,038 --> 01:27:51,871
-We should just consider giving this up.
-It was funny, though.

2052
01:27:51,938 --> 01:27:55,371
Here's my suggestion.
One of you can play for the team.

2053
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:57,305
If he gets three answers in a row,
you get a bite each.

2054
01:27:57,371 --> 01:27:58,538
He can do it.

2055
01:27:58,605 --> 01:28:00,705
-No, I can't.
-You've got this.

2056
01:28:00,771 --> 01:28:03,438
-I have faith in you.
-Try it.

2057
01:28:03,505 --> 01:28:05,638
CHALLENGER CHOCAPRIO

2058
01:28:05,705 --> 01:28:07,538
If Kyuhyun gets three in a row,

2059
01:28:07,605 --> 01:28:09,871
-you can each have a mouthful.
-I don't think I can.

2060
01:28:09,938 --> 01:28:13,471
-Choose figures that everybody knows.
-Sure, this couldn't be easier.

2061
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,605
They should be so easy
that everyone here can answer on reflex.

2062
01:28:15,671 --> 01:28:17,138
We've got you covered.

2063
01:28:17,205 --> 01:28:18,671
Try to relax.

2064
01:28:18,738 --> 01:28:21,605
The whole world is watching, Kyuhyun.

2065
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:23,871
-I'm going to wind down.
-Full names are difficult.

2066
01:28:24,505 --> 01:28:25,538
Here we go.

2067
01:28:25,605 --> 01:28:27,871
CHOCAPRIO'S SOLO ATTEMPT
JJAJANG RAMYEON ROUND

2068
01:28:27,938 --> 01:28:29,405
I'll give you three in a row.

2069
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,471
-Aris?
-Totle.

2070
01:28:32,538 --> 01:28:33,538
Correct.

2071
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:35,071
-Nighting?
-Ale.

2072
01:28:35,138 --> 01:28:37,805
-Correct. Abraham?
-Cadabra.

2073
01:28:37,871 --> 01:28:39,138
Lincoln, damn it.

2074
01:28:39,205 --> 01:28:41,171
Gosh, I should've answered.

2075
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:42,538
-Cadabra.
-Lincoln.

2076
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:45,171
THE SOPHISTICATED ANSWER MAKES YOU HUMBLE

2077
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:48,305
ABRAHAM LINCOLN

2078
01:28:48,371 --> 01:28:50,871
But Abraham Lincoln is just so…

2079
01:28:50,938 --> 01:28:52,938
-What did he say again?
-Cadabra.

2080
01:28:53,005 --> 01:28:54,405
Who's that?

2081
01:28:54,471 --> 01:28:56,305
It's a song by Brown Eyed Girls.

2082
01:28:56,371 --> 01:28:58,605
-"Abraham Catabra."
-Damn it.

2083
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:00,938
Has he lost his mind or what?

2084
01:29:01,005 --> 01:29:02,571
I'm not trying to run you down.

2085
01:29:02,638 --> 01:29:04,438
But the history show's crew
would be disappointed.

2086
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,205
Abraham Lincoln is just too…

2087
01:29:07,138 --> 01:29:08,105
This is just…

2088
01:29:08,171 --> 01:29:10,105
We're not having it, okay?

2089
01:29:11,338 --> 01:29:12,338
Honestly…

2090
01:29:12,405 --> 01:29:14,738
JJAJANG RAMYEON, OUT

2091
01:29:14,805 --> 01:29:17,538
-The squid earlier--
-What's that?

2092
01:29:18,105 --> 01:29:19,238
What is that?

2093
01:29:19,305 --> 01:29:24,138
BONUS CLIP

2094
01:29:24,205 --> 01:29:27,505
-Is that a bird figure on your head?
-Yes.

2095
01:29:28,371 --> 01:29:31,938
This is a must to avoid being attacked
by animals while eating out here.

2096
01:29:33,771 --> 01:29:35,771
I'm going to try this Kenyan watermelon.

2097
01:29:44,638 --> 01:29:45,738
It tastes like radish.

2098
01:29:45,805 --> 01:29:48,371
