00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:12,838
THREE IDIOTS IN KENYA

2
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,771
PREVIOUS EPISODE

3
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:20,871
AFTER MANY HARDSHIPS,
THEY'VE ARRIVED AT MAASAI MARA

4
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,705
-Fantastic!
-So nice.

5
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,538
NOT LONG AFTER ADMIRING THE SCENERY

6
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:27,305
Just looking at it is therapeutic.

7
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:32,138
WHAT AWAITED THEM WAS

8
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:35,405
A SWIFT RIVER

9
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,705
AND A TINY BOAT

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,271
Today's surprise mission.

11
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:41,638
It's the Logic Game.

12
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:42,971
-What?
-Logic Game.

13
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:44,438
-Logic?
-Yes.

14
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:46,205
You will get ten minutes.

15
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:50,605
Let's say the boat can only carry
two entities at a time.

16
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:52,071
-Two entities?
-Yes.

17
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:55,671
The ones crossing are
a lion, a giraffe, and an acacia tree.

18
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:57,571
LOGIC GAME

19
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,005
A LION, A GIRAFFE, AND AN ACACIA TREE

20
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,538
WANT TO CROSS THE RIVER
ON A TWO-SEATER RAFT

21
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:03,271
IF THE GIRAFFE IS LEFT ALONE WITH THE LION
THE GIRAFFE GETS EATEN

22
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:06,005
IF THE GIRAFFE IS LEFT ALONE
WITH THE ACACIA, THE ACACIA GETS EATEN

23
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:08,738
GET EVERYONE ACROSS
WITHOUT ANYONE BEING EATEN

24
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:10,471
YOU CAN'T MOVE AN EMPTY BOAT
OR EAT ONE WHILE PASSING ANOTHER

25
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,005
HOW WILL YOU GET EVERYONE ACROSS?

26
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,071
I didn't understand one bit.

27
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:18,338
-So, do we play each of them?
-Do we ride the boat?

28
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:20,805
-We're the lion, the giraffe…
-Yes, a lion, a giraffe…

29
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:25,105
Back there,
do you see the lion and the acacia tree?

30
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:27,505
The acacia's the best one.

31
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,305
There's no good or bad in this.

32
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,705
-Work together.
-It's a team mission.

33
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:32,238
-The acacia tree--
-What's the prize?

34
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:36,205
If you cross the river
and get to the lodge in ten minutes,

35
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:38,071
you'll have a gourmet feast.

36
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,638
If you fail,

37
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:42,671
-something else awaits.
-What's that noise?

38
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:44,038
I think I hear a hippo.

39
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,438
-There's a hippo.
-There it is.

40
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:47,805
This is home to hippos.

41
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:49,071
Home to hippos?

42
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:52,171
HI, THREE IDIOTS

43
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,105
THIS PLACE IS ACTUALLY CALLED

44
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:00,238
THE HIPPO BANK,
MEANING A RIVERBANK OF HIPPOS

45
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:04,171
IT'S HOME TO MANY HIPPOS,
WHICH JI-WON IS AFRAID OF

46
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:06,838
CROSS THIS RIVER WITHIN 10 MINUTES

47
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:09,971
AND THEY GET A VIEW OF THE VAST SAFARI

48
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,671
WHILE EATING A GOURMET FEAST

49
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:17,471
IF THEY FAIL, THEY GET UGALI

50
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,505
-No, the giraffe and…
-Get ready. You have ten minutes.

51
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:22,505
-Get set. Go.
-Giraffe can eat this.

52
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:26,471
EUN-CACIA, SHORTY GIRAFFE, LION CHO

53
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:27,805
I don't think it fits.

54
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,705
CURRENT TIME: 11:26 A.M.

55
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,771
So, the lion and this tree can go.

56
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:34,471
-The lion and the tree go.
-And then?

57
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:36,171
They get off.

58
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:37,805
-The tree--
-Who gets off?

59
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:38,971
The lion or the tree.

60
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:40,438
One gets off, the other comes back…

61
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:41,938
-What is he?
-The lion.

62
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:44,105
Then, the tree can bring the lion over.

63
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:45,571
EUN-CACIA'S PLAN

64
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:48,071
1) THE LION AND THE TREE CROSS THE RIVER

65
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:50,005
2) THE TREE RETURNS

66
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,738
3) THE LION GETS ON THE BOAT?

67
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,538
THERE ARE TWO LION CHOS?

68
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:56,438
When you come back,
you and I have to get on the boat.

69
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:57,538
We have to go together.

70
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:58,438
-Right.
-Are you staying?

71
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:00,005
-No, we're going together.
-But I eat you.

72
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,005
EUN-CACIA'S SECOND PLAN

73
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:03,071
1) THE LION AND THE TREE CROSS THE RIVER

74
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:04,838
2) THE TREE RETURNS

75
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:06,905
3) THE GIRAFFE GETS ON THE BOAT?

76
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,305
HE'S GETTING HIMSELF EATEN

77
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:12,338
-We can't because I eat you.
-Then, what do they mean

78
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:13,771
that it's okay to pass by?

79
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:16,171
You're allowed to pass by
each other to switch.

80
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,205
-He's completely clueless.
-Oh, the switch.

81
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,071
There's no way they made it that easy.

82
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:21,671
-Hang on.
-It's been one minute.

83
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:25,271
Why is he making a fuss,
acting like he's so clever?

84
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,605
-He doesn't want a distraction.
-Right.

85
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,005
-And we all have to cross the river?
-Of course.

86
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:32,205
We can all get on the boat, Su-geun.

87
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,871
-It's a two-seater boat.
-Only two can get on.

88
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:35,838
EUN-CACIA'S THIRD PLAN

89
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:37,738
ALL THREE OF THEM GET ON THE BOAT

90
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:39,138
BUT THE BOAT CAN ONLY CARRY TWO

91
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:42,305
WHILE THE OLDER ONES ARE BICKERING

92
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:45,138
I thought of one,
but I forgot as I listened to these guys.

93
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,105
-I had solved it.
-Yeah, right.

94
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,438
CALM DOWN

95
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:52,638
-Come here, guys. I'm the tree.
-What am I?

96
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:55,338
-The lion can go with the tree.
-You're the lion.

97
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,405
You're the giraffe, right?

98
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:58,505
-You and I should go.
-Let's go and think on the way.

99
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,338
SHORTY GIRAFFE TEMPORARILY ABANDONED

100
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:04,905
-Am I the lion?
-You're the lion. I'm the tree, right?

101
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:06,838
But I can't go with either of you.

102
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,105
Then, how--

103
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,338
-Just go and come back.
-Let's go.

104
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:11,305
Go and come back?

105
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:13,538
-Yes, come back.
-Come on, Ji-won. Let's just go.

106
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:15,838
LION CHO AND EUN-CACIA CROSS

107
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:18,105
They come back, leave the lion here…

108
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:19,505
Okay, I got it.

109
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,838
Return, leave the lion here,
and I will be able to go.

110
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:23,238
No, then you'll be--

111
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,605
-Or you can get off.
-Su-geun, you come back

112
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:29,138
and switch with the tree.

113
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:31,138
Wait there, Su-geun.

114
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,938
Then, you'll end up eating me.

115
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,338
-I can't switch with the tree.
-No.

116
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:35,538
You're talking nonsense.

117
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:36,738
SHORTY GIRAFFE IS SULKY

118
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:39,871
-Is that your solution?
-Just stay put.

119
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:41,838
WHAT SHORTY GIRAFFE UNDERSTOOD

120
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:44,105
1) THE LION AND THE TREE CROSS THE RIVER

121
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:46,938
2) THE TREE RETURNS

122
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:49,505
3) THE GIRAFFE CROSSES THE RIVER

123
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:51,905
4) AND GETS EATEN?

124
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:54,238
-Listen, Ji-won. You're the tree, right?
-Yes.

125
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:57,638
When we get there, go back alone.

126
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:59,038
Then, the giraffe will eat me.

127
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:01,938
-No, it's okay to switch on land.
-Okay.

128
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:05,405
So, you go back,
and the giraffe comes to me.

129
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,438
-You can't get on the boat alone.
-Yes, we can.

130
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:09,838
ABANDONED SHORTY GIRAFFE

131
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:13,438
When they go, he'll eat the giraffe.
The tree can't share the boat with me.

132
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:14,638
Oh, I got it!

133
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:15,638
Hey, Acacia!

134
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:17,305
-It's up to two entities.
-Acacia!

135
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:18,538
Oh, I see.

136
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:20,971
You need to come back. No, I mean…

137
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:22,571
-But you can eat me!
-No.

138
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:24,238
It's all right to switch.

139
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:26,538
We're allowed to switch.
You should go back.

140
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:27,671
-Me?
-Yes, go back.

141
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:28,571
A BOLT FROM THE BLUE

142
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,805
Are you coming back to pick me up?

143
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,771
LION CHO AND SHORTY GIRAFFE'S PLAN

144
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,871
1) THE LION AND THE TREE CROSS THE RIVER

145
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:37,071
2) THE TREE RETURNS

146
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,938
3) THE GIRAFFE CROSSES THE RIVER

147
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,505
4) THE LION GOES BACK
AND PICKS THE TREE UP

148
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:44,605
SUCCESS

149
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:47,738
-You'll go back and switch with him.
-Hurry back!

150
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,238
You get off, I cross,
and the lion can come back to pick you up!

151
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:53,438
-I'm going back alone, okay.
-Okay?

152
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,338
You two can get off.

153
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,638
AMID THE SHOUTING,
THE TREE FLOATS DOWN WITH HIS BACKPACK

154
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,571
-Ji-won!
-Yes?

155
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:00,371
Never mind.

156
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:01,338
LAUGHS

157
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:03,605
-I'm the tree.
-Yes, you're the tree.

158
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:04,638
So, I just stay here.

159
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,805
-No, you stay here.
-You're getting off, Ji-won.

160
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:07,871
NAGGING FROM BOTH SIDES

161
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:10,471
And the lion will come back for you.
Do you get it?

162
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,005
Then, you two come back.
We have ten minutes.

163
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,838
If you can go by yourself, why can't I?

164
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:16,671
You're alone on the boat right now.

165
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:20,005
-Why bother coming for me?
-All you need to do is switch with him.

166
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:21,971
-The lion needs to pick you up!
-Why?

167
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,705
-We can't share the boat, stupid!
-Then, how are you going by yourself?

168
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,605
Just switch with him!

169
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:29,771
What are you saying?
You're alone on the boat.

170
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:32,071
That means I can go back alone
after you leave!

171
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:34,905
But we all need to cross! Just get off!

172
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:36,871
STUBBORN EUN-CACIA'S PLAN

173
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,671
1) THE GIRAFFE CROSSES THE RIVER

174
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:41,371
2) THE EMPTY BOAT RETURNS FOR THE TREE

175
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:43,805
3) THE TREE CROSSES
WHILE THE GIRAFFE GETS EATEN

176
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:46,171
We only need to switch.
The lion will come back for you.

177
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,071
Why does he need to come back?
I can go alone.

178
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:49,571
Just get off, damn it!

179
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:50,671
Just hurry up!

180
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:53,605
Someone needs to be on the boat.
We can't move an empty boat.

181
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:55,171
Oh, we can't move an empty boat?

182
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:57,471
AN ANGRY GIRAFFE BOARDS THE BOAT

183
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:59,138
-Go.
-You should have told me.

184
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:01,371
But we listened to the rules together.

185
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:04,571
Do you get it now?
You can go back for him now.

186
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:06,071
Yes, I'll go and pick him up.

187
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:08,638
This was too easy, then.

188
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,205
It's way too easy.

189
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:12,071
-But you couldn't solve it.
-But you failed.

190
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:14,105
If I had known
we could go back and forth multiple times,

191
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,305
I would have solved it.

192
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:17,905
SHORTY GIRAFFE CROSSED THE RIVER

193
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,138
Go and pick him up.
Sit up front to speed up the boat.

194
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:22,705
How long do we have left?

195
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:24,438
You have five minutes.

196
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:27,005
That's more than enough.

197
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,671
The crew didn't think we'd solve it.
You must have thought we were imbeciles.

198
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:31,838
BRIGHT

199
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:34,671
But Ji-won still doesn't get it.

200
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,905
He said, "I can go by myself,"
on an empty boat.

201
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:39,371
When we told him
that we couldn't move an empty boat.

202
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:43,338
THE JOYFUL, DUMB TREE JOINS THEM,
ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

203
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:44,638
All right.

204
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,505
You succeeded in six minutes!

205
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:49,571
THEY ONLY TOOK 6 MINUTES

206
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:50,571
Congratulations.

207
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:54,638
Hey!

208
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:55,905
You must swim here.

209
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:58,605
THEY GET A LUXURIOUS LUNCHEON

210
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:02,805
But how should I put it?

211
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:06,971
Since the weather is so nice,
I like everything, not just the jungle.

212
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,438
I see an open view ahead.

213
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:11,305
It's the grasslands.

214
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:14,705
Would you like
some survival tips in Africa?

215
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:15,871
-Yes.
-Yes.

216
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:19,405
When you run into a hippo on the road,
which way should you run?

217
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:21,371
-Which way should we run?
-Yes.

218
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:22,471
Where the hippos aren't.

219
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:25,938
You must always run in a zigzag.

220
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,071
Hippos have bad eyesight,
but they have a good sense of smell,

221
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:30,938
and they can run at 40 km per hour.

222
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:35,905
So, you must run in a zigzag line
to prevent the hippo from attacking you.

223
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,271
THEY SAY RUNNING IN A ZIGZAG HELPS

224
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:39,505
We can be funny when we run in a zigzag.

225
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:40,905
I'll get caught on the first turn.

226
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:42,471
"In a zig…"

227
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:45,371
We shouldn't be in such a situation
in the first place.

228
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,238
-Anxiety is back.
-Yes.

229
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:48,605
JUST THE THOUGHT IS TERRIFYING

230
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:51,038
I don't really want to test that theory.

231
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,205
Of course, I'll do it,

232
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,738
but it shouldn't happen
in the first place.

233
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,738
I'll be running in a straight line
while thinking I'm running in a zigzag.

234
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:58,971
It's more likely to be a curve.

235
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:00,938
Woo-jung, there's an elephant.

236
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:02,938
Under that tree.

237
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:06,271
-That's an elephant under the tree.
-Yes, it's far away.

238
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,405
That's an elephant, right?

239
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:10,305
-Is that a tusk?
-Isn't it?

240
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:12,671
There it is. I see it clearly.

241
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:13,971
A SILHOUETTE FROM AFAR

242
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,705
-We saw it.
-Yes, I saw the tusk.

243
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:18,071
We saw one of the Big Five.
There's an elephant.

244
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:19,538
Can we go near it?

245
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:22,538
-Let's check it out.
-I can zoom in with my Galaxy phone.

246
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,971
-I can't believe we're seeing it.
-Zoom in.

247
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:28,605
We get to go near it when we see one?

248
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:31,005
CAREFULLY APPROACHING THE ELEPHANT

249
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,271
That's enormous.

250
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:37,271
We're going straight toward it.

251
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:39,305
Are we even allowed to?

252
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:41,505
AMAZED

253
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:43,438
EXCLAIMS

254
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:46,205
-Wait, what is that?
-This is awesome.

255
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:47,705
This is unbelievable.

256
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:49,571
This is insane.

257
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:52,005
-Be quiet, guys.
-Quiet.

258
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:58,805
A WILD ELEPHANT IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM

259
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:17,471
A SURREAL VIEW BEFORE THEIR EYES

260
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:20,105
AFRICAN SAVANNA ELEPHANTS
THE LARGEST LIVING LAND ANIMALS

261
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:22,771
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT,
INHABITING OPEN GRASSLANDS

262
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:25,338
AND CAPABLE OF LONG-DISTANCE COMMUNICATION
USING LOW-FREQUENCY INFRASOUND

263
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,738
EXCLAIMING

264
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:31,871
It's gigantic.
Check out the bird on its back.

265
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,005
It's playing with the bird.

266
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:35,771
This is incredible.

267
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:39,838
It's like a scene from an animated film.

268
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,371
Those white birds are called egrets.

269
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:46,171
When an elephant walks,
the frogs jump here and there.

270
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:47,671
Then, they feed on those frogs.

271
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:51,005
-Oh, they're there for frogs?
-Yes, they feed on them.

272
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:53,138
-So, elephants are their best friends.
-Totally.

273
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:55,271
This is fantastic.

274
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,705
-Is the elephant eating grass?
-It's eating grass.

275
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:59,205
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THEY'VE EVER SEEN

276
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:00,738
What are those birds doing?

277
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:02,405
They're so…

278
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:03,705
They look so peaceful.

279
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:04,638
I thought it was a rock.

280
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,671
THE THREE IDIOTS CAN'T STOP ADMIRING

281
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,971
I need to capture this with my eyes.

282
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:11,838
Wow, look at its tusks.

283
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,205
OVERWHELMED BY THE FIGURE

284
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:15,471
It's enjoying it.

285
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:22,571
THE ELEPHANT BUDDY
IS GRADUALLY GETTING CLOSER

286
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:28,205
-I think it's coming here.
-It's coming for us.

287
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,405
The elephant is coming to us.

288
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,538
THEY TENSE UP AS THE LARGE BUDDY NEARS

289
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:31,905
Su-geun, put your arms back in.

290
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,671
It's coming toward us.

291
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:37,338
Do you see those muscles?

292
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,205
ENJOYING NATURE'S FEAST

293
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:42,671
This is terrifying.

294
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,938
Please don't provoke it.

295
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:49,905
It's eating grass.

296
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:51,305
THE AWE AND FEAR YOU FEEL
IN THE PRESENCE OF NATURE

297
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:52,705
It's gigantic.

298
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:55,271
But you know what? It eats all day long.

299
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:58,871
-It's like I'm watching a documentary.
-Yes, this is so beautiful.

300
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:02,671
-I'm so scared.
-It actually moves my heart.

301
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,805
THE ELEPHANT COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT THE THREE IDIOTS

302
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,938
What if it charges at us?

303
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:10,905
No, we're bigger than that elephant.

304
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,805
FORTUNATELY, THE JEEP IS
AS BIG AS THE ELEPHANT

305
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:18,171
It must think we're a rock.

306
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:23,271
It usually takes 30 to 40 years
for their genetic knowledge

307
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:25,438
to be imprinted and passed down.

308
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:29,105
Since this national park was established
over 70 years ago,

309
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:33,338
they have learned
that humans don't attack them.

310
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:34,871
A lot probably went wrong at first.

311
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:38,838
So, we're nothing more than an entity

312
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,505
-in this park.
-That's right.

313
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:43,838
They just think, "Oh, look, they're back."

314
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:52,038
NATURE HAS DECIDED
TO GIVE A PART OF ITSELF

315
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,071
"I see them every day,
but they don't attack us."

316
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:56,105
-The word got around.
-Yes.

317
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:58,271
"I took a bite, and it was hard."

318
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:01,171
-"I bit the hood once, and it was tough."
-No.

319
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,771
I'm sure we taste just as good.

320
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,638
No, it must have chewed the steel.

321
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:06,105
Not the humans.

322
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:07,605
The trust has been built over 70 years.

323
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:10,738
Will this show be a huge success?
We got so lucky.

324
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,871
There's fun in finding them.

325
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:14,871
THEY SAY BYE TO THEIR FIRST ANIMAL BUDDY

326
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:16,971
Is this why Christopher Columbus
kept going around?

327
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:20,905
BIG 5 LOG
ELEPHANT SIGHTING SUCCESSFUL

328
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:24,438
It's easy to sight an elephant
in the grasslands.

329
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:26,705
-These are all food for them.
-Exactly.

330
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:29,205
AN ENTIRE LAND OF FOOD FOR ELEPHANTS

331
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:32,505
Do you see the herd
of animals at 11 o'clock?

332
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:34,305
-I think they're buffalo.
-Are they?

333
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,538
-Yes, the ones I saw last time.
-It's a whole herd.

334
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:38,971
-Ji-won saw it on the plane.
-Yes, buffalo.

335
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:42,371
-There are dozens of them.
-Yes, they travel in herds.

336
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:44,705
They move in herds out in the open.

337
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,338
I really enjoy things like this.

338
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:51,338
Look, is that an elephant or a buffalo?

339
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:52,605
That's a buffalo.

340
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:54,971
-Right? We spotted one.
-It's a buffalo.

341
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:57,338
-We saw another one.
-It's huge.

342
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:59,271
-It certainly is big.
-A buffalo.

343
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,671
SPOTTED A BUFFALO
SEPARATED AWAY FROM THE HERD

344
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,805
-Don't provoke it.
-Don't provoke it.

345
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:05,871
-That thing charges at us.
-It's looking at us.

346
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:07,571
It looks like it's ready to charge.

347
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,871
BUFFALO
A LARGE-BODIED MEMBER OF THE BOVINE FAMILY

348
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:11,805
It's different from an elephant.

349
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:14,071
Buffaloes are usually short-tempered.

350
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:16,471
There's a saying in Africa.

351
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:21,838
"An elephant never forgets,
and a buffalo never forgives."

352
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:25,205
When elephants remember where water is,

353
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:27,605
it can find its way back,
even after decades.

354
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:30,671
And buffaloes are known
to seek revenge once they're wronged.

355
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:36,338
We already saw two of the Big Five.

356
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:39,771
BIG 5 LOG
BUFFALO SIGHTING SUCCESSFUL

357
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,371
-Don't they travel in herds, Ji-won?
-They do.

358
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:44,305
Why is this one here by itself?

359
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:48,338
Buffalo also retire from the herd.

360
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:49,905
Do they receive their pension?

361
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:51,105
A LEISURELY RETIREMENT IN THE SAFARI

362
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:53,905
As they grow old, male buffalo

363
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:57,071
leave the group
and live on their own like that one.

364
00:14:57,138 --> 00:15:00,738
THEY RETIRE FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF PROTECTING THE HERD

365
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:03,071
So, he has to survive on his own.

366
00:15:03,138 --> 00:15:05,271
It's like, "You can go, old man."

367
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,338
Judging from the color of its hair,

368
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:10,538
-it seems pretty old.
-Right? That makes it even sadder.

369
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:14,905
Animals and humans
both get lonelier as they grow old.

370
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:17,438
But there's a herd right over there.

371
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:21,438
He can't even join them.

372
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,971
It's such a sad reality.

373
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:26,205
I feel bad for him. I feel like crying.

374
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,271
It's staying close to the road.

375
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:30,538
I think we're almost there.

376
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:32,605
There were so many fun stories
on our way here.

377
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:35,338
I learned a lot from the buffalo's story.

378
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:37,638
We're almost at the lodge.

379
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,405
Since you crossed the river
in six minutes,

380
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:42,405
there will be a feast prepared for you.

381
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,971
You may enjoy a meal
while admiring the safari plains.

382
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:50,371
THEY JUMP OFF WITH EXCITEMENT

383
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:52,838
We're finally here.

384
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:53,771
-Jambo.
-Jambo.

385
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:55,438
-Jambo.
-Welcome. Karibu.

386
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,271
THE THREE IDIOTS' SECOND LODGE

387
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:01,271
A HISTORIC TENTED LODGE
THAT HAS BEEN IN OPERATION SINCE 1972

388
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:03,338
This kind of place
makes me feel so pleasant.

389
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,938
GOVERNORS' CAMP

390
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:06,871
What is this place?

391
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:08,138
Isn't that the river we crossed?

392
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:09,371
JI-WON EXCLAIMS

393
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:12,038
This is incredible.

394
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,071
LOCATED ALONG THE MARA RIVER

395
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:19,205
IT BOASTS AN OPEN PANORAMIC VIEW

396
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:24,038
WHERE WILDLIFE ROAMS FREELY
IN HARMONY WITH NATURE

397
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:27,438
AN ECO-FRIENDLY LODGE

398
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:30,005
Is this a well?
I think there's a fire pot.

399
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:32,138
It must be a barbecue place.

400
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:35,571
THERE IS A BARBECUE AREA

401
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,071
THE RESTAURANT
THAT OVERLOOKS THE VAST SAFARI

402
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:43,905
FULL OF THERAPEUTIC ELEMENTS

403
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:45,705
Look at that table.

404
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,738
This is unbelievable.

405
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:50,105
Look at the restaurant
over there, Kyuhyun.

406
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:53,805
THE FEAST WITH A SAFARI VIEW
AS PROMISED

407
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:55,071
It's amazing.

408
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:57,505
SPOILED WITH A SCENIC VIEW

409
00:16:57,938 --> 00:16:58,771
AND GOURMET FOOD ON THE TABLE

410
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,438
This is such a luxury.

411
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:03,338
ENJOY YOUR FOOD

412
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:04,571
Can we eat?

413
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:06,205
Yes, it's your prize.

414
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:07,638
You can enjoy the food now.

415
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:09,471
What kind of steak is this?

416
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:12,038
It's a grilled beef steak.

417
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,571
And this soup?

418
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,871
It's papaya soup. Chilled papaya soup.

419
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:18,071
This is called a mezze platter.

420
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,571
There's meat and…
You all know what this is, right?

421
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:23,571
-Their staple food.
-Yes, it's ugali.

422
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:27,838
There's also salad and curry.
The one next to the curry is a lamb stew.

423
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,338
Enjoy your lunch.

424
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:31,471
Do you want to try this?

425
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,038
-What is it?
-A skewer.

426
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:36,471
A BITE OF THE SKEWER FROM JI-WON

427
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:38,905
-Guys.
-Yes?

428
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:40,905
It's absolutely delicious.

429
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:42,805
-What's this?
-It's so tender.

430
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,571
It's a beef skewer.

431
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:45,971
-Is this mbuzi?
-No, it's beef.

432
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:47,805
-It's not goat meat.
-It's beef.

433
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:49,638
AMAZED

434
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:50,538
Su-geun.

435
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,405
SU-GEUN ALSO TAKES A BITE

436
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,338
This is so…

437
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:57,705
I couldn't thank you enough, guys.

438
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,438
-Have you tried it? It's good, right?
-Yes.

439
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:01,471
IT EVEN SATISFIES PICKY JI-WON'S PALATE

440
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,538
I wonder what this is.

441
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,638
It looks like curry to me.

442
00:18:05,938 --> 00:18:07,538
YOU EAT RICE OR CHAPATI

443
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:09,871
WITH A BOWL OF LAMB STEW

444
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:13,638
KYUHYUN TRIES THE LAMB STEW

445
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:15,438
DELICIOUS

446
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:19,071
This lamb meat is so tender.
They serve amazing food.

447
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:20,471
This one is scrumptious.

448
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:22,805
I think you'll like this too.

449
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:25,238
EXCLAIMING

450
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,838
This is just unrealistic to me.

451
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:30,305
This entire situation is…

452
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:34,538
It feels like
I'm at an open set for a short time.

453
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:38,105
You need to take a bite,
take a look at the view, and repeat.

454
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:42,071
A BREATHTAKING SAFARI VIEW
THAT FEELS UNREAL

455
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:45,405
I think we made
the right choice coming here.

456
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:48,005
Except for the part where I lost my phone,
everything's perfect.

457
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,305
BECOMING SOLEMN FOR SOME REASON

458
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:53,871
-What?
-What's that?

459
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:56,171
-That was a hippo, wasn't it?
-Yes, where is it?

460
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:57,371
THE YOUNGEST JUMPS UP

461
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:00,405
BUT THE OLDER ONES STAY SEATED

462
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:01,605
KYUHYUN LOOKS FOR THE HIPPO

463
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:04,405
-Is it there?
-Yes, Kyuhyun.

464
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,305
KYUHYUN EXCLAIMING

465
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:09,038
THEY SPOTTED HIPPOS!

466
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:11,138
How many are there? Three?

467
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:13,605
-Do they come on land?
-They do.

468
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,971
HE MUST UNDERSTAND KOREAN

469
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,105
I hope it comes up.

470
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:22,471
This morning, one of them came up here.

471
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:24,171
HE UNDERSTOOD AND ANSWERED

472
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:26,571
-All the way here?
-Yes, this morning.

473
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:27,738
Today?

474
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:28,871
It's coming up.

475
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:33,171
-Are those all hippos?
-They are.

476
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,838
HIPPOS HIDING ALL OVER THE RIVER

477
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:37,038
This is sublime.

478
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:40,005
I badly want some kimchi, though.

479
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:43,905
Don't you think
you'll crave any Korean food today?

480
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:45,938
Can you keep eating like this?

481
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:48,771
One Korean meal in between sounds good.

482
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:50,871
I also want some ramyeon.

483
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:52,138
For a slice of kimchi,

484
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:54,738
I'd risk putting my hand
in a lion's mouth and taking it out.

485
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:58,305
HENCE, WE'VE PREPARED
A COMFORTING EVENT FOR THEM

486
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:03,471
What? What do they have on their heads?

487
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:06,338
Aren't they our shadows?

488
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,271
You're overworking the staff members.

489
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:10,271
-What's going on?
-It brings back old memories.

490
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,938
TWO, NO, THREE GIRAFFES WALK UP
FROM THE RIVERSIDE

491
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:16,071
We have invited some giraffes.

492
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:18,971
We asked the resort staff
for some giraffes.

493
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,338
-It's a beautiful giraffe family.
-It's like a comedy skit.

494
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:23,971
NOTE: THESE ARE THE STAFF
WHO PLAYED THE SHADOWS

495
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:26,038
OH, MY LOVE, MY SHADOW

496
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:28,771
We're going to hold
a small drawing contest.

497
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,238
-I'm terrible at drawing.
-A contest?

498
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:31,138
Yes, a drawing contest.

499
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:32,038
The name is

500
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,571
-My Drawing of a Giraffe I Drew.
-That's nice.

501
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:38,238
It's the era of AI, isn't it?

502
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:42,771
We're going to ask ChatGPT to be the judge
and present the winner with an award.

503
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:45,371
-I'll be the loser.
-Draw a family of giraffes, or draw them?

504
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:46,405
Them, of course.

505
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:48,438
But how will it know they're giraffes?

506
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:51,038
We'll take a photo of them
and show it to ChatGPT.

507
00:20:51,771 --> 00:20:53,771
WE'LL TAKE A PHOTO
OF THE FAMILY OF GIRAFFES

508
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:56,805
WE'RE HAVING A CONTEST OF DRAWING GIRAFFES

509
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:58,838
WE'LL COMPARE THREE DRAWINGS TO THIS PHOTO

510
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:01,471
AND THE AI PROGRAM WILL RANK THEM

511
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:02,905
But you're great at drawing.

512
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:05,471
No, Ji-won is.

513
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:07,038
-I'm good.
-Was that you?

514
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:10,771
So, we have three prizes.

515
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:12,705
There is such variety.

516
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,138
We've prepared three essentials for you.

517
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:17,838
-A massage voucher.
-Oh, I love massages.

518
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:19,505
And how happy will you be

519
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,805
to have ramyeon, kimchi,
and a glass of soju later today?

520
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:24,571
I need that.

521
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:26,871
-I'm going to win that.
-You can use it whenever you want.

522
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:28,238
-Whenever?
-The third prize.

523
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,105
A bottle of wine of your choice.

524
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:31,371
EXCLAIMS

525
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:32,938
These aren't ranked prizes.

526
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:35,938
-The winner gets them all?
-The winner takes everything.

527
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:38,105
CONTEST PRIZES

528
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,605
3 RECOVERY ITEMS

529
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,071
MASSAGE

530
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:42,471
RAMYEON AND KIMCHI

531
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:45,471
WINE

532
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:49,405
THE CONTEST STARTS

533
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:52,071
Man, this won't be easy.

534
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:54,738
THE SUBJECT OF THIS NOT-SO-EASY CONTEST

535
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:58,138
A FAMILY OF GIRAFFES

536
00:21:58,471 --> 00:22:00,138
THE NUMBER OF GIRAFFES

537
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:02,005
1 GIRAFFE

538
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,105
2 GIRAFFES

539
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:06,271
3 GIRAFFES

540
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,271
PLUS SOCKS

541
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:13,705
A FAMILY OF GIRAFFES ALIVE WITH DETAIL

542
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:14,971
GOOD LUCK

543
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,505
This won't be easy.

544
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,938
EVERYONE STARTS DRAWING IN THEIR OWN WAY

545
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,838
GLARING

546
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:23,738
This is making me feel competitive.

547
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:25,405
HIS EYES TURN SHARP WITHOUT NOTICING

548
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,271
The prizes are too good.

549
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:31,938
WITH PRIZES THAT ARE JUST WHAT THEY NEED

550
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:37,038
THE THREE IDIOTS CONCENTRATE
WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD

551
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,205
Gosh, Ji-won is finished.

552
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:42,205
How does he draw so well?

553
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:46,838
-Because I've been to a lot of academies.
-Oh, really?

554
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:48,305
THE EFFECT OF EARLY EDUCATION

555
00:22:48,871 --> 00:22:51,671
This isn't even considered good.

556
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,038
END OF MY DRAWING OF A GIRAFFE I DREW

557
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:57,871
Who wants to show their drawing first?

558
00:22:57,938 --> 00:22:59,705
I'll go first since mine is the worst.

559
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,571
-Kyuhyun will go first.
-Yes.

560
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:08,171
I actually focused on the giraffes,

561
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:11,338
the theme of this drawing contest.

562
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:14,805
-I didn't pay any attention
-Yes.

563
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:20,038
to the surrounding scenery,
objects, or chairs.

564
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:24,305
My mind was solely on the giraffes
as I drew this.

565
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:25,538
Take a look.

566
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,971
I thought…

567
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:27,871
TA-DA

568
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:33,605
…about how little kids would draw them.

569
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:35,005
And it hasn't been that long

570
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:36,738
-since ChatGPT came out, right?
-Yes.

571
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:38,605
It's pretty young.

572
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:42,205
So, I drew them from the perspective
of ChatGPT, a little child.

573
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:45,405
-What's that?
-I mimicked the drawing style

574
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,771
that little kids would love.

575
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:51,538
I'm sorry, but the giraffes are
missing their bodies and limbs.

576
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:52,505
That's it.

577
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:54,571
Because I solely focused on the giraffes.

578
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:56,805
-Don't giraffes have legs?
-They look like humans

579
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:58,805
who were eaten by giraffes.

580
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,671
The human head is in the giraffe's belly.

581
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:03,405
-It's digesting a human?
-Yes, it's digesting the human.

582
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:06,805
-It's scary in a way.
-It is. It's very violent.

583
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:07,838
CRITICS ALL OVER

584
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,671
Giraffes may rule the world in the future.

585
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:13,505
I also had that conspiracy theory in mind
when I drew this abstract picture.

586
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:15,071
All right, next.

587
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:16,138
ARTIST EUN'S EXPLANATION

588
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:21,005
I just brought back
my childlike innocence.

589
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:25,405
I thought of the old times
when I was in the school's drawing contest

590
00:24:25,471 --> 00:24:26,938
and drew them exactly.

591
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:29,305
That's how they look in nature, isn't it?

592
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:31,005
It's the exact sketch of nature.

593
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:34,138
I portrayed the exact image
that I saw with my eyes.

594
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,405
AMAZED

595
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:38,971
THE CROWD IS STIRRED UP

596
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,105
-That's almost a portrait.
-They look like aliens.

597
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:42,438
A WORK THAT EXPRESSES THINGS AS THEY ARE

598
00:24:43,005 --> 00:24:45,171
FROM THE STUFFED GIRAFFE

599
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:48,238
TO THE FINGERTIPS OF THE GIRAFFE BROTHERS

600
00:24:49,105 --> 00:24:52,338
A DETAILED DEPICTION
WORTHY OF AN ART ACADEMY STUDENT

601
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:55,405
I like it,
but there's no distinct feature.

602
00:24:56,605 --> 00:25:00,105
-Were we supposed to be creative with it?
-Isn't this more unique?

603
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:04,371
-I think AI may give that a higher score.
-Right?

604
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:05,338
This is too--

605
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:06,971
-I don't see any giraffes.
-Exactly.

606
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,338
But it's them.

607
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:10,205
It's up to the AI program to judge,

608
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:12,138
-we'll only give compliments.
-I don't trust it.

609
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:14,771
But it's a contest,
so you don't have to trust it.

610
00:25:14,838 --> 00:25:16,505
-Fine.
-Just from this image,

611
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:18,971
it looks like humans are ruling
over the giraffes.

612
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:20,805
The humans are too big in proportion.

613
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,638
In Kenya, especially in the savanna,

614
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:27,338
animals come first,
so giraffes come first.

615
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:29,338
So, I emphasized the giraffe.

616
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,138
PRIORITIZING ANIMALS OVER PEOPLE

617
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:38,038
THE GIRAFFES WERE FINALLY GIVEN
BODIES AND LEGS

618
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:42,238
SU-GEUN ALSO DEPICTED THE SAFARI
IN THE BACKGROUND

619
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:44,571
And humans coexist within them.

620
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:47,971
-But, it looks similar to Kyuhyun's.
-That's how I drew them.

621
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:49,371
-My drawing is better.
-How dare you?

622
00:25:49,438 --> 00:25:51,471
-These two are pretty similar.
-How so?

623
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:54,971
-No, I put one human at the bottom.
-These two.

624
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:56,738
It's the exact copy of this one.

625
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,438
No, I was trying to say
that humans and giraffes coexisted.

626
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:03,238
-Personally, the other parts stand out.
-Sure.

627
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:06,871
-Oh, we're giving compliments.
-As I said, the AI will judge them.

628
00:26:06,938 --> 00:26:08,238
-That's true.
-We don't have to--

629
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:10,305
LET'S ASK AI TO KEEP IT PEACEFUL

630
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:12,405
WE'RE HAVING A CONTEST

631
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,538
THE FAMILY PHOTO IS UPLOADED

632
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,571
Here's what it's saying.

633
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:17,971
"Yes, Your Highness."

634
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,305
SUDDENLY GIVES US AN HONORIFIC TITLE

635
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,905
-Is that how you trained it?
-Yes, I did.

636
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:27,938
-You made it call you "Your Highness"?
-Yes.

637
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:31,138
"Upload the three drawings,
and I'll take a look and rank them."

638
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:32,871
-I uploaded your drawings.
-Okay.

639
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:34,471
EVALUATION COMPLETE

640
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:36,705
AI is so overwhelming.

641
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:37,771
-I'll read them.
-Why?

642
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:39,038
-We have the evaluations.
-Okay.

643
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:40,271
Why is it overwhelming?

644
00:26:41,538 --> 00:26:43,005
THE THREE IDIOTS' DRAWINGS
WERE UPLOADED ON CHATGPT

645
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:45,005
-"All right, Your Highness."
-"Your Highness."

646
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:45,905
AS POLITE AS IT CAN BE

647
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,438
"The three finalist works
of the drawing contest

648
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:51,071
were judged and ranked
based on the following criteria.

649
00:26:51,138 --> 00:26:57,205
The criteria were 'fun, creativity,
expressiveness, and giraffe-ness.'"

650
00:26:57,338 --> 00:26:58,338
EXCLAIMING

651
00:26:58,405 --> 00:26:59,738
THE ONE WHO EMPHASIZED GIRAFFE-NESS

652
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:01,571
Why evaluate creativity all of a sudden?

653
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:04,005
-That's its opinion.
-That's what art is about.

654
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,105
Kyuhyun.

655
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:07,038
CONTESTANT NUMBER 1
ARTIST CHO

656
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:07,971
"Fun.

657
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:09,938
The simplified idea
of making the giraffe head

658
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,405
look like an egg ghost
really cracks you up."

659
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:14,205
-He thought it was fun.
-"Creativity.

660
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:17,738
Extremely cartoonish giraffe
with separated props feels fresh.

661
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,105
Drawing the socks separately is
a cute point."

662
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,538
That's what AI said?

663
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:25,138
-It understood what I intended.
-That's incredible.

664
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:26,038
"Expressiveness.

665
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:28,238
Using the fewest lines,
it conveys the maximum information.

666
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:30,038
Restraint and minimalism stand out."

667
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:31,171
How did it know?

668
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:32,238
"Giraffe-ness.

669
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:35,705
It strips everything down to the essence.
It's minimalist giraffe art."

670
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:36,805
DEEPLY MOVED

671
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:38,505
-It even called it "art."
-It knows.

672
00:27:38,571 --> 00:27:40,471
"Overall, it's a meme-like piece

673
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:42,138
that makes you laugh
the moment you see it.

674
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:46,038
-I rate it 4 out of 5 stars."
-He might win.

675
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:48,605
-Kyuhyun wins.
-It understood precisely what I intended.

676
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:51,271
-But you never said anything like that.
-Well, no…

677
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,138
ChatGPT broke it down for me.

678
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,938
-It's smart.
-Next, Ji-won's piece.

679
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:57,271
-Here's the evaluation.
-I'm not expecting anything.

680
00:27:57,338 --> 00:27:58,971
-Come on.
-I don't think I'll win.

681
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:01,538
-It's not even fun.
-No, it's very fun.

682
00:28:01,605 --> 00:28:03,171
-What's so funny about this?
-It is funny.

683
00:28:03,238 --> 00:28:05,338
But I didn't mean it to be funny.

684
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:06,705
Fine.

685
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:11,271
Here's AI's evaluation of Ji-won's piece.

686
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:12,471
"Fun.

687
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:16,538
It takes the path of realism,
faithfully reproducing the original photo.

688
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:17,971
Creativity.

689
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:21,638
It stays true to the original photo,
but lacks variation or reinterpretation."

690
00:28:22,238 --> 00:28:24,271
I wasn't trying to be creative.

691
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:25,705
"Expressiveness.

692
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,438
The sketchy style captures
the person delicately.

693
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:30,738
The details in the hands and chair
are especially good.

694
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:32,905
Giraffe-ness.

695
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:35,838
It pays attention to detail
with the mask, socks, and plushie,

696
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:37,705
but overall, it is a bit plain.

697
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:41,771
It's a piece faithful to the basics
and textbook-like.

698
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:45,505
I rate it 3 out of 5 stars."

699
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,071
-He got the wrong education.
-Exactly.

700
00:28:48,138 --> 00:28:49,705
He only focused on textbooks.

701
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,305
-I mean, you're supposed to be creative.
-Right.

702
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:54,905
-That's what AI thinks.
-Anyone can copy it exactly.

703
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:56,371
AI also requires humans to be creative.

704
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:58,671
-Anyone can copy it exactly?
-Anyone can.

705
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,238
You'll be condemned for saying that.

706
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,971
Copying exactly is the hardest.

707
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:04,638
PLEASE STOP

708
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:07,571
-Watching them fight brings me joy.
-Make sure to keep that part in.

709
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:09,705
Finally, Su-geun's piece.

710
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:13,438
STANDS UP IN ANTICIPATION

711
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:14,571
"Fun.

712
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:17,271
It naturally blends a human face
into the giraffe's body,

713
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,871
which was witty.

714
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:20,705
Creativity.

715
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:24,805
It actively interprets the real scenery
and the giraffe family's posture.

716
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:28,605
Placing the face between the legs is
a unique composition.

717
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:30,171
Expressiveness.

718
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:32,271
Even with blunt colored pencils,

719
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:35,371
it brings out the giraffe patterns
and the facial expressions.

720
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:37,271
Giraffe-ness.

721
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:40,638
It cares about the trees,
the sky, and a sense of scale.

722
00:29:40,705 --> 00:29:44,838
-It gets extra points for background."
-He's the winner.

723
00:29:44,905 --> 00:29:48,838
"Overall, it has great detail and harmony.
It's a true masterpiece.

724
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:54,205
-I rate it 5 out of 5 stars."
-You startled me.

725
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:57,538
SU-GEUN GETS THE PERFECT SCORE

726
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:58,805
GIGGLING

727
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:01,471
CONGRATULATIONS, SU-GEUN

728
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:03,771
-Su-geun wins!
-I win!

729
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:06,305
HE REDEEMS HIMSELF
AFTER THE FASHION SHOW LOSS

730
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:10,171
Since this is going on Netflix,
can I sell it at an international auction?

731
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:12,471
CONTACT US IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

732
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:14,338
I'm satisfied with second place.

733
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,671
Damn, I'm last.

734
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:19,605
AN ART STUDENT QUIETLY WIPING AWAY TEARS

735
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,905
-A massage voucher for one person…
-Yes.

736
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:24,038
…a ramyeon and kimchi set,

737
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:29,171
and this resort's premium wine.

738
00:30:29,238 --> 00:30:31,971
-These three prizes go to Su-geun!
-Thank you.

739
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,571
I admit it.

740
00:30:33,638 --> 00:30:36,705
I dedicate all this glory
to the giraffe family.

741
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,571
Let's take a picture
with the giraffe family.

742
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:40,105
Three, two, one.

743
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,705
TAKING A CELEBRATORY PHOTO

744
00:30:42,738 --> 00:30:44,671
MY DRAWING OF THE SHADOW GIRAFFES

745
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:46,905
It's the very last room.

746
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:50,071
Let's bring the bags. This is nice.

747
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:51,571
This is like glamping.

748
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:52,571
How do you open it?

749
00:30:52,638 --> 00:30:54,305
-Down there.
-There's the zipper.

750
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,138
HE'S A GENTLEMAN
WHENEVER HE'S UNSURE OF SOMETHING

751
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,671
I hope bugs don't get inside.

752
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:00,638
AMAZED

753
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:03,205
THIS AWE-INSPIRING SPOT IS

754
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:07,438
THE THREE IDIOTS'
PRIVATE TENT IN THE FOREST

755
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:10,905
WHEN YOU STEP INTO THE TENT
AWAY FROM THE SUN

756
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,338
This is awesome, isn't it?

757
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:16,038
THERE'S A CLEAN AND COZY LIVING SPACE

758
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:19,138
A BED BATHED IN WARM SUNLIGHT

759
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:23,271
A SOFA UNDER THE COOL BREEZE
FOR SHARING TALKS

760
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:26,105
EVEN A MODERN SHOWER

761
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:28,705
This place is lovely.

762
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:32,038
I wish we had
a glamping site like this in Korea.

763
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:34,271
The natural vibes are insane.

764
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:35,671
We could stay here all day.

765
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:39,605
KYUHYUN STEPS OUTSIDE FOR FRESH AIR

766
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,771
Imagine having ramyeon
and a shot of soju here.

767
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:48,505
A VIEW THAT INSPIRES POETIC MOOD

768
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:51,871
You know,
it won't be the same once the sun sets.

769
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:53,971
-It'll feel different.
-Yes, you need alcohol.

770
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,438
That's the power of day drinking.

771
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:58,005
WHILE KYUHYUN IS DISCUSSING
THE NEED FOR A DRINK

772
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:02,038
SIGHS

773
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:08,705
JI-WON SINKS INTO THE BED,
WORN OUT FROM LIGHT AIRCRAFT RIDE

774
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:12,238
IT FEELS SO NICE

775
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,505
My hair is a mess.

776
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:16,171
MEANWHILE, SU-GEUN MAKES A CALL

777
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:17,405
Honey!

778
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:20,738
We've arrived at the savanna.

779
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:21,705
THE OLDEST IDIOT SHARING THE GOOD

780
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:22,805
-The savanna.
-The savanna.

781
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:25,538
Did you see the elephant photo
I sent you earlier?

782
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:27,171
We're eating right now.

783
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,538
Oh, enjoy your meal.

784
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:32,405
-Okay.
-Okay.

785
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:34,271
It's fascinating
that we have service here.

786
00:32:34,338 --> 00:32:35,205
Wait, she hung up--

787
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:38,105
LET'S LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF NATURE
INSTEAD OF A PHONE CALL

788
00:32:38,838 --> 00:32:42,671
THE SOUND OF INSECTS

789
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:47,305
THE SOUND OF BIRDS

790
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:51,571
THE SOUND OF WATER

791
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:54,938
THE SOUND OF THE WIND

792
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:57,571
AND

793
00:32:57,638 --> 00:32:58,471
EUN JI-WON

794
00:32:58,538 --> 00:33:00,038
LISTEN CLOSELY

795
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,471
SNORING

796
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:06,005
SNORING

797
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:10,538
THE MYSTERIOUS CRIES
OF AN UNKNOWN SAFARI ANIMAL

798
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:13,538
REPORTED BY HIM

799
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:17,205
CAREFULLY CAPTURING THE FACE
OF THE MYSTERIOUS ANIMAL, LEST IT WAKE

800
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:18,538
JUST LIKE
"LISTEN TO MY HEARTBEAT"

801
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,605
VIVID REALISM

802
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:21,605
NAH YUNG-SUK
IT'S LIKE A YOUTH FILM

803
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:23,805
A RATHER SUBJECTIVE REVIEW

804
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:26,138
AND WITH THAT

805
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:28,005
IT'S TIME TO GET UP!

806
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:31,171
Is this massage out in the open?

807
00:33:31,238 --> 00:33:32,538
They normally keep the doors open.

808
00:33:32,605 --> 00:33:33,838
-Do I start undressing here?
-What?

809
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:34,971
PRIZE 1
ECO-FRIENDLY OPEN-AIR SPA

810
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:36,838
-Jambo.
-Jambo.

811
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:46,471
-Wait--
-What do I do?

812
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:47,471
-Is it good?
-Yes.

813
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:49,605
-They say it's how it's done.
-Pardon?

814
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,771
-This is how it's done.
-Is it?

815
00:33:51,838 --> 00:33:54,071
You'll be getting plenty of phytoncides.

816
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,005
THE SPA BEGINS IN EARNEST

817
00:33:57,571 --> 00:34:00,071
Oh, there's a camera under it.

818
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,871
Oh, there's a camera under it.

819
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:04,105
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

820
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:05,505
LAUGHS

821
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:07,905
Hi, you scared me.

822
00:34:08,305 --> 00:34:09,405
Try to relax.

823
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:11,038
GRUNTS

824
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:13,038
If you need more pressure…

825
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:14,571
STRUGGLING

826
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:16,805
Push a bit more,
and my face might pop out.

827
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:18,005
PRODUCTION CREW AMUSED

828
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:19,038
One strong push.

829
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:20,438
SURPRISINGLY STRONG PRESSURE

830
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:25,005
They seem to really emphasize scrubs here.

831
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:28,438
IN A FULLY OPEN MASSAGE SHOP

832
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:32,038
-I hear birds. This feels unreal.
-Right?

833
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:33,871
Why does Su-geun always end up like this?

834
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,538
He was the one, even yesterday.

835
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:38,238
They scrubbed my whole body with salt.

836
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:39,805
As if they were making kimchi.

837
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:41,738
I've been marinated.

838
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:43,805
So, this is the prep work
for a lion's meal.

839
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:45,505
-Exactly.
-You're being marinated.

840
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:49,438
At first, tourists don't realize that.
They think it's part of the tour.

841
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,805
I heard most of them never returned home.

842
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:56,538
-Is he being made into jerky?
-I think Ji-won already figured it out.

843
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:57,838
I offered, and he refused.

844
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,038
TROUBLED THOUGHTS

845
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:04,005
THE LION'S MEAL PREP COURSE CONTINUES

846
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:07,205
Is she spraying soy sauce on me?

847
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,571
BEING SEASONED WITH AROMA

848
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:12,671
Man, even frogs would be shocked.

849
00:35:13,171 --> 00:35:14,171
Don't pass gas.

850
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,205
She's going to be so shocked.

851
00:35:16,638 --> 00:35:19,671
MARINADE

852
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:22,671
AS THE COURSE NEARS ITS END

853
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:26,838
All done, right?

854
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:27,771
One moment.

855
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,538
-She got wrapping paper.
-It looks like she's wrapping you up.

856
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:34,505
It must be for delivery.

857
00:35:34,571 --> 00:35:37,505
-Delivery?
-Was it a delivery order?

858
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:39,571
STATUS CHECK

859
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,238
HESITANT

860
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:45,505
You're not naked under there, right?

861
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:46,605
I am.

862
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:49,905
HE'S BEEN CAREFULLY DOUBLE-WRAPPED

863
00:35:52,438 --> 00:35:54,305
-Does it feel hot?
-It's like my mom's arms.

864
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:57,171
LIKE A MOTHER'S EMBRACE,
THE PACKAGING FEELS COZY

865
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,705
What does that mean?

866
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:03,138
AS WE EAT WITH OUR EYES FIRST

867
00:36:07,438 --> 00:36:10,471
HE USED ONE OF HIS PRIZES

868
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:14,805
SURPRISED

869
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:17,471
-What is that?
-I filmed it.

870
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:18,671
THE THREE IDIOTS ARE HYPED UP

871
00:36:18,738 --> 00:36:20,805
What's happening? It startled me.

872
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:23,705
-No filming.
-I got it.

873
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:26,371
-Zoom in.
-We already filmed it.

874
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:29,805
-It opened its mouth.
-What are you talking about?

875
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:32,538
I got a full five-minute clip
from the water to the land.

876
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:34,605
-Even the mouth-opening part.
-You filmed it all?

877
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:36,371
Show him the original video first.

878
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:38,071
We need to cut a deal.

879
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:40,805
Is this my solo program?

880
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:42,705
-Aren't we in it together?
-No, we're negotiating.

881
00:36:42,771 --> 00:36:46,205
When you try to take away our thing,
we're going to strike a deal.

882
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:49,171
-You can't film that.
-No, this is just…

883
00:36:49,238 --> 00:36:51,305
THE VIDEO WE OBTAINED
AMID THEIR BOSSY POWER TRIPS

884
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:54,971
Isn't that too big?

885
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,138
1. ENORMOUS HIPPO

886
00:36:57,205 --> 00:36:58,938
-It's underwater.
-It's pooping.

887
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:00,038
2. POOPING HIPPO

888
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:01,438
It's wagging its tail while pooping.

889
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:04,171
Open it.

890
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:09,505
3. YAWNING HIPPO

891
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:11,538
All right. Look over here, Ji-won.

892
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,971
4. JUST A COMMEMORATIVE SHOT

893
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:17,771
Nice, you came out well.

894
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:19,338
THEY SPENT A WHOLE HOUR LIKE THIS

895
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:21,271
TIME TO EAT!

896
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:22,405
What's this?

897
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:24,705
WHAT AWAITED THE STARVING IDIOTS WAS

898
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:27,371
-Jambo. Is it a buffet?
-Barbecue.

899
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:29,838
A SUPER SPECIAL MEAL
PREPARED FOR THE THREE IDIOTS

900
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:32,805
A FULL-ON BARBECUE SPREAD

901
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:34,638
FROM APPETIZERS TO WHET THE APPETITE

902
00:37:34,705 --> 00:37:36,438
FRESH SEAFOOD

903
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,438
AND THEIR FAVORITE, FRIED RICE

904
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:40,371
BUT THE HIGHLIGHT, ABOVE ALL

905
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:42,105
WHOLE HOG ROAST

906
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:46,105
CRISPY OUTSIDE, JUICY INSIDE,
WITH A SWEET AND SAVORY GLAZE

907
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:47,871
AMAZED

908
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:49,938
-I suddenly feel hungry.
-Look at the cuttlefish.

909
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:50,871
Is it seafood?

910
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,471
-It's seafood this time.
-There's seafood too.

911
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:55,938
-Lobsters and prawns.
-There are lobsters and meat.

912
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:59,071
A MASSIVE, MOUTHWATERING BARBECUE FEAST

913
00:37:59,638 --> 00:38:02,005
-Doesn't it look good?
-Are you kidding?

914
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:02,971
IN LOVE WITH THE BARBECUE

915
00:38:03,038 --> 00:38:05,505
It's been grilling
for two hours over charcoal.

916
00:38:05,571 --> 00:38:07,905
-Is this pork?
-Yes.

917
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:09,371
-A mini-pig.
-Isn't this Pumbaa?

918
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:11,538
Why would they roast Pumbaa?

919
00:38:16,438 --> 00:38:18,671
SEE YOU SOON

920
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,405
All right. Tonight's dinner is

921
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:23,071
-Barbecue.
-a barbecue party hosted by the resort.

922
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:26,471
-To eat, we need plates.
-And cutlery.

923
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,638
So, we'll play one of the things
we have many times before.

924
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:31,271
-It's a group mission.
-Okay.

925
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:33,071
Depending on your score…

926
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:36,605
-Is it a jump rope?
-…your plate size will change.

927
00:38:38,438 --> 00:38:41,238
-I'll reveal the game.
-I'd better switch to battle mode.

928
00:38:41,305 --> 00:38:43,238
I even put on my glasses to see better.

929
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:45,438
We've done this a lot before.

930
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:47,705
We've played Continue the Phrase
and Name It so far.

931
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:49,805
Now, the last of the Big Three series.

932
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:52,205
We will be playing charades.

933
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:53,205
Charades?

934
00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:56,505
-Nobody beats Su-geun in this.
-That's true.

935
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:57,638
He has to be the one to act.

936
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:59,005
SU-GEUN, THE GOAT IN CHARADES

937
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:00,771
Let's keep listening and see how it goes.

938
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,971
It's a team game.

939
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:04,571
All three of you must attempt it
at least once.

940
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:06,938
For example, if Su-geun acts,
the other two must guess.

941
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:09,338
Each person gives ten questions.

942
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:11,505
If you get them all right,
that will be 30 points.

943
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:13,838
-But you might slip once or twice.
-Yes.

944
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:20,071
From 25 to 30 points,
you earn the biggest buffet plate.

945
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:22,305
-That's nice.
-That's not bad.

946
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:23,571
We can pile up on it.

947
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:24,938
BUFFET PLATE

948
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:27,038
30 CM WIDE
DEEP AND THE BIGGEST OF ALL

949
00:39:27,105 --> 00:39:29,405
-You can stack it up this high.
-Definitely.

950
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:31,105
-We can put all that food.
-We can.

951
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:33,105
We could even put the two chefs on it.

952
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:37,038
US TOO?

953
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:39,071
We put those two chefs on it
and make them cook,

954
00:39:39,138 --> 00:39:41,038
-so we can keep eating.
-Exactly.

955
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:42,638
-That's true.
-Let's put the grill on it.

956
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:44,838
That's a huge benefit.

957
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:47,305
We're practically giving
you the restaurant.

958
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:50,671
But just in case
you're not in top condition today,

959
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:53,038
so you land in the 20 to 25 points range.

960
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:54,205
-That can happen.
-Right.

961
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:55,805
You know, just in case.

962
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:56,905
From 20 to 25 points…

963
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:57,805
You should go last.

964
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:59,338
-You get the second-largest plate.
-That?

965
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:01,138
-That's a huge downgrade.
-That's too small.

966
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:02,171
It's the second largest?

967
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:04,005
-That's a huge downgrade.
-That's too small.

968
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:05,905
THIS BIG BUFFET PLATE IS

969
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,905
REPLACED WITH A TINY SIDE DISH PLATE!

970
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:14,538
-Didn't you grab the wrong one?
-Look, you can put a large one here

971
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:17,071
-and stack…
-I said, you picked up the wrong one.

972
00:40:17,138 --> 00:40:19,271
-No, this is the right one.
-That's the one?

973
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:20,605
Again, just in case…

974
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:23,838
-There's a smaller one?
-…you get from 15 to 20 points…

975
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:24,838
A sauce dish?

976
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:27,705
-Correct.
-That sounds great.

977
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:29,671
I can put a piece of sweet potato in it.

978
00:40:29,738 --> 00:40:30,905
Correct.

979
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:33,538
FROM PLATE-LIKE

980
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:37,638
TO DOWNRIGHT PETTY

981
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:38,805
That's not even called eating.

982
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,238
Honestly, I don't even want to show you
the last one,

983
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,371
but it won't come to that.

984
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:45,438
-If you score under 15, can you guess?
-Is that a spoon?

985
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:46,671
It is a spoon.

986
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:48,838
UNDER 15 POINTS, A SPOON

987
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,771
-Su-geun will save us.
-We should at least try.

988
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:52,905
-We'll give it our all.
-You bet.

989
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:55,838
-Let's aim for 25 points or higher.
-Of course, as long as you do that.

990
00:40:55,905 --> 00:40:57,205
Is there a time limit?

991
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:58,738
Yes, three minutes.

992
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:01,738
The full score is ten,
but in case you skip the question,

993
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:04,805
we added three bonus words.

994
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:06,271
That makes 13 in total.

995
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,471
So, you can pass about three times.

996
00:41:08,538 --> 00:41:10,471
We basically gave you everything.

997
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:12,238
It means we have to get
at least eight right

998
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:13,271
-Let's try.
-in three minutes.

999
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,705
I'll go first.

1000
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:17,305
JI-WON'S ROUND

1001
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:19,705
WHAT'S JI-WON'S CATEGORY?

1002
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,505
-What is this?
-Let's see.

1003
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:22,771
-What does it say?
-Why?

1004
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:24,305
What even is this?

1005
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:25,971
-What is it?
-He doesn't know much about it.

1006
00:41:26,038 --> 00:41:27,405
Domestic and global companies.

1007
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:29,805
-What? I don't know any.
-Just keep it simple.

1008
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:32,171
Hey, act out the logo.

1009
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:35,938
Keep it simple.

1010
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:36,905
-T.
-This is Tesla.

1011
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:37,905
We could do that.

1012
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:40,638
You go like this, and it's Hyundai Motors.

1013
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,438
-For Kia and things.
-Use the alphabet.

1014
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:44,505
-Here we go. Get ready.
-Let's cheer up.

1015
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:45,605
"Took a punch at you"

1016
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,238
Say, "Took a punch at you, idiots."

1017
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,405
You idiots. In three, two, one.

1018
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:50,938
-Took a punch!
-Took a punch at you, idiots.

1019
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:51,905
LAUGHING

1020
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:53,738
What kind of chant is this?

1021
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:55,805
-What was it? "Tukopa"?
-Tuko pamoja.

1022
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:57,205
-Yes, took a punch.
-Are you ready?

1023
00:41:57,271 --> 00:41:58,105
Just a second.

1024
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:00,105
You can't make any sounds, Ji-won.

1025
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:01,105
Ready.

1026
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:03,471
Set, go.

1027
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:05,838
Set, go.

1028
00:42:05,905 --> 00:42:08,338
TESLA

1029
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:09,705
SURPRISED

1030
00:42:09,771 --> 00:42:10,705
NAILED THE PREDICTION

1031
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:12,271
-Tesla!
-Correct.

1032
00:42:12,338 --> 00:42:13,838
I told you. Don't make any sound.

1033

1282
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:35,171
It has to be an easy category.

1283
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:39,971

Let me speak this time.

1292
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:58,671
I don't know any books.

1293
00:49:58,738 --> 00:50:00,905

00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:02,671

00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:14,538
I'll start chewing on grass, then.

1301
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:17,238
Once I eat the grass, you must answer.

1302
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,538
We can do this. Let's go.

1303

1436
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:06,471
-What was it?

00:54:09,438 --> 00:54:10,905
What was I supposed to do?

1439
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:12,405
BUT THE PERFORMANCE WAS FLAWLESS

1440
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:17,105
You guys mentioned
me, mine, and everything else,

1441
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,871
but "my" was not mentioned.

1442
00:54:18,938 --> 00:54:20,405
How did you get "my"
when I slapped the belly?

1443
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:22,571
My belly.

1444
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:23,505
AN UNINTENDED COMMUNICATION

1445
00:54:23,571 --> 00:54:24,938
We thought you were saying, "My belly."

1446
00:54:25,438 --> 00:54:27,171
How many did we get?
It feels like quite a few.

1447
00:54:27,238 --> 00:54:28,071
-It was tough.
-Congrats.

1448
00:54:28,138 --> 00:54:29,705
Only Su-geun could have gotten this many.

1449
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:31,171
You got six.

1450
00:54:31,238 --> 00:54:34,205
-Hold on.
-In total, you got 18 points.

1451

-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:43,038
-Among the remaining plates,
-Yes.

1456
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:45,805
…if Su-geun puts the sauce dish
on the line…

1457
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:47,638
-With this on the line?
-I'm asking, just in case.

1458
00:54:47,705 --> 00:54:49,705
-Let's risk skipping this meal.
-Su-geun, Come here.

1459
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:51,671
-If you're interested…
-Let's hear him out.

1460
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:55,671
-If you get ten right--
-We can't. That's a perfect score.

1461
00:54:55,738 --> 00:54:58,105
-Let us miss one. So, nine.
-Nine sounds good.

1462
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:00,605
And we return this dish if we fail?

1463
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:02,938
-If so, you can go back to the lodge.
-We'll have to starve.

1464
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:05,871
-Yes, since that's the risk we're taking…
-He's right.

1465
00:55:05,938 --> 00:55:07,005
…let's make it nine.

1466
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:10,005

1467
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:11,138
Two, three.

1468
00:55:11,205 --> 00:55:12,038
WHAT'S THE FINAL CATEGORY?

1469
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:13,138
What is it?

1470
00:55:13,205 --> 00:55:14,671
-Brands?
-Snacks and ice cream.

1471
00:55:14,738 --> 00:55:15,838
That's not so bad.

1472
00:55:15,905 --> 00:55:17,705
-It might actually work.
-Yes.

1473
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:19,205
This means ice cream,

1474
00:55:19,271 --> 00:55:22,338
-and this means snacks.
-The tongue means ice cream.

1475
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:24,371

-Took a punch.
-They never get it right.

-What?
-Worm.

1570
00:57:49,738 --> 00:57:51,738
Kumturi!

1571
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:53,505
-Wang Kumturi!
-Correct!

1572
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:55,505
EXHILARATED

1573
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:56,405
JJANGGU

1574
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:57,338
IT'S A CHARACTER THIS TIME

1575
00:57:59,238 --> 00:58:00,471
BULGING OUT

1576
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:03,005
OOLA-OOLA

1577
00:58:03,071 --> 00:58:05,571
-What's that? Jjanggu!
-Correct!

1578
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:07,738
HONEY TWIST SNACK

1579
00:58:08,305 --> 00:58:09,405
CATEGORY: SNACK

1580
00:58:09,471 --> 00:58:11,338
-Snack and it's twisted.
-Twist Snack!

1581
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,071
-Honey Twist Snack.
-Honey Twist Snack.

1582
00:58:13,138 --> 00:58:14,105
That's time!

1583
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:15,138
We got a lot, though.

1584
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:16,371
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SCORE

1585
00:58:16,438 --> 00:58:20,071
If you got nine or more,
you'd be upgraded to a side plate.

1586
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:21,371
Su-geun's score is…

1587
00:58:21,438 --> 00:58:22,305
WHAT WILL IT BE?

1588
00:58:22,871 --> 00:58:24,571
…eleven points!

1589
00:58:24,638 --> 00:58:26,138
-Success!
-Great.

1590
00:58:26,205 --> 00:58:29,338
JOYFULLY DANCING OOLA-OOLA

1591
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:32,138
SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED TO A SIDE PLATE

1592
00:58:32,205 --> 00:58:34,038
Congratulations.

1593
00:58:34,105 --> 00:58:36,505
-You guys did great.
-Su-geun is amazing, indeed.

1594
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:38,538
You guys answered it well.
Let's get the food.

1595
00:58:38,605 --> 00:58:40,005
Enjoy your food.

1596
00:58:40,071 --> 00:58:41,371
-Thank you.
-It's hot.

1597
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,771
Hold on.

1598
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:46,405
We could have ringed scallops around it
and used it like a plate,

1599
00:58:46,938 --> 00:58:47,771
but there's no need now.

1600
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:50,771
You know, we can ring cuttlefish around it

1601
00:58:50,838 --> 00:58:52,571
-and stack in the middle.
-We can pile them up.

1602
00:58:53,138 --> 00:58:55,371
Or we can wrap pineapple slices
around the edge.

1603
00:58:55,438 --> 00:58:57,871
But pineapples are too flabby.

1604
00:58:57,938 --> 00:58:59,505
-Scallops sound better.
-Or sausages.

1605
00:58:59,571 --> 00:59:00,438
THROWING RANDOM IDEAS

1606
00:59:00,505 --> 00:59:01,805
We could put them like this.

1607
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:05,605
We could spread scallops around it
to make a wider plate, Su-geun.

1608
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:07,171
-That works too.
-It gets wider.

1609
00:59:07,738 --> 00:59:09,505
They're making a bigger plate.

1610
00:59:09,571 --> 00:59:11,638
Now, we have a bigger plate.

1611
00:59:11,705 --> 00:59:13,338
-Lobsters.
-I think ribs could work.

1612
00:59:13,405 --> 00:59:16,538
-Let's stack the ribs.
-Don't let them topple.

1613
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:19,705
We need four. No, at least three,
so we can eat one each.

1614
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:21,171
This might actually work.

1615
00:59:21,971 --> 00:59:23,771
-There, I got it.
-That's just bones.

1616
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:25,271
-It's the bone.
-It's fine.

1617
00:59:25,338 --> 00:59:27,605
-It's the bone.
-I won't eat much.

1618
00:59:27,671 --> 00:59:28,671
It's meat.

1619
00:59:28,738 --> 00:59:29,638
-No, it's not.
-No.

1620
00:59:29,705 --> 00:59:32,105
-The one you grabbed.
-This one.

1621
00:59:32,171 --> 00:59:33,571
-It's this one.
-Okay.

1622
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:34,738
THEY RAISED THEIR VOICES BUT ARE HAPPY

1623
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:38,071
SWAP COMPLETED FOR A MEATY PIECE

1624
00:59:38,138 --> 00:59:42,105
And what about the cuttlefish?

1625
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:43,338
Yes, the cuttlefish.

1626
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:45,205
TIME TO STACK THE CUTTLEFISH

1627
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:47,938
EXCLAIMING

1628
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:50,471
-It's hefty.
-It's seriously good.

1629
00:59:51,971 --> 00:59:53,271
This looks insanely good.

1630
00:59:53,338 --> 00:59:56,838
-Just one cuttlefish each?
-And what about the meat?

1631
00:59:56,905 --> 00:59:58,538
-Don't we need this?
-The skin is good.

1632
00:59:58,605 --> 01:00:01,471
-You can try it.
-Guys, a hippo came up.

1633
01:00:01,538 --> 01:00:04,038
-What? This can't be.
-A hippo came up?

1634
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:06,371
It shouldn't come here.

1635
01:00:07,305 --> 01:00:09,205
BEHIND THE SCARED IDIOTS

1636
01:00:11,171 --> 01:00:13,005
NOISE COMING FROM NEARBY

1637
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,438
Where is it coming from?

1638
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:15,905
They're all running away.

1639
01:00:15,971 --> 01:00:16,938
Look over there.

1640
01:00:17,471 --> 01:00:18,438
MOVING

1641
01:00:19,538 --> 01:00:21,338
But it charges at you.

1642
01:00:21,405 --> 01:00:23,371
THE YOUNGEST IDIOT
FEARLESSLY GOES OUT TO GREET

1643
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:25,905
How is this happening all of a sudden?

1644
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:27,238
Where did it climb up from?

1645
01:00:27,305 --> 01:00:28,971
IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING

1646
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:30,771
SO WE ENABLED NIGHT MODE
FOR BETTER VISIBILITY

1647
01:00:33,038 --> 01:00:34,471
-Where?
-There.

1648
01:00:35,138 --> 01:00:37,771
-I'm seeing two.
-Two hippos?

1649
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:40,471
TWO HIPPOS TAKING A MOONLIT WALK

1650
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:44,005
-Do you want to go near it?
-No, why is there a road?

1651
01:00:47,505 --> 01:00:50,471
ANNOYED

1652
01:00:51,871 --> 01:00:53,838
HIPPO TRIVIA
HIPPOS' SKIN IS WEAK TO UV RAYS

1653
01:00:53,905 --> 01:00:55,705
SO THEY STAY IN THE WATER DURING THE DAY
AND COME ASHORE AT NIGHT

1654
01:00:55,771 --> 01:00:58,905
-Apparently, they go on walks.
-Oh, they normally do.

1655
01:00:58,971 --> 01:01:01,071
-We've seen enough hippos.
-They usually take walks.

1656
01:01:01,138 --> 01:01:02,938
Tell us when it gets to where we are.

1657
01:01:03,571 --> 01:01:05,938
WILL DO

1658
01:01:06,005 --> 01:01:07,605
DEBATING WHAT TO PILE ON NEXT

1659
01:01:07,671 --> 01:01:08,738
What's that?

1660
01:01:08,805 --> 01:01:10,871
The one above. Yes, that one.

1661
01:01:10,938 --> 01:01:12,838
We can cut it with a knife.

1662
01:01:13,405 --> 01:01:14,438
Good.

1663
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:15,371
PICKING IT UP

1664
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:16,871
-Maybe just one.
-A sausage will roll off.

1665
01:01:16,938 --> 01:01:19,171
-Isn't it more stable now?
-No more.

1666
01:01:19,238 --> 01:01:21,005
-Fill in the gaps.
-This one tastes good.

1667
01:01:21,071 --> 01:01:22,071
LASTLY, SOME DIETARY FIBER

1668
01:01:22,138 --> 01:01:24,105
There's a little corner spot here.

1669
01:01:25,138 --> 01:01:27,138
Eat plenty of avocado, Kyuhyun.

1670
01:01:27,205 --> 01:01:29,905
This is good enough. Let's go.

1671
01:01:29,971 --> 01:01:31,338
A FULL PLATE OF ENOUGH FOOD

1672
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,705
Okay.

1673
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:34,671
SAFELY REACHED THE TABLE

1674
01:01:34,738 --> 01:01:36,871
Okay, it's all good.

1675
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:40,071
-That's a lot of food.
-I told you so.

1676
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,305
Thank you for the food.

1677
01:01:42,371 --> 01:01:43,938
I could use my hands.

1678
01:01:44,005 --> 01:01:46,171
CHOMP

1679
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:48,871
CHEWING

1680
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,038
Try the barbecue skin.

1681
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:51,505
It's insane.

1682
01:01:51,571 --> 01:01:54,738
KYUHYUN TASTES A BITE OF CUTTLEFISH

1683
01:01:55,005 --> 01:01:55,905
IMPRESSED

1684
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:58,771
Seriously. Barbecue is always…

1685
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:01,271
IT'S ALWAYS DELICIOUS WITHOUT FAIL

1686
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:03,205
Kenya has everything.

1687
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:04,671
Literally everything.

1688
01:02:04,738 --> 01:02:08,171
This is my first time
trying lobster in Kenya.

1689
01:02:08,238 --> 01:02:12,105
GETTING A TASTE OF THE INDIAN OCEAN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SAFARI

1690
01:02:12,171 --> 01:02:15,905
-I'm super allergic to lobster.
-Why are you eating it?

1691
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:18,105
If I don't eat it here, when will I?

1692
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:20,038
I'll eat it,
even if it means sneezing 100 times.

1693
01:02:20,105 --> 01:02:22,838
THREE THINGS YOU CAN'T RESIST
LOVE, SNEEZING, AND LOBSTER

1694
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:25,605
AND SO THEY FINISH A LIFE-RISKING DINNER

1695
01:02:25,671 --> 01:02:26,671
That was a good meal.

1696
01:02:28,205 --> 01:02:30,405
How are you so good at charades, Su-geun?

1697
01:02:30,905 --> 01:02:32,605
No, you guys guessed well.

1698
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:37,638
No, the way you acted them out
was fun but also spot-on.

1699
01:02:37,705 --> 01:02:38,871
So witty.

1700
01:02:38,938 --> 01:02:40,305
FRIENDLY CONVERSATION WITH FULL STOMACHS

1701
01:02:40,371 --> 01:02:41,405
I could never do it.

1702
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:43,838
BARKS

1703
01:02:45,905 --> 01:02:47,405
What is that noise?

1704
01:02:47,705 --> 01:02:49,438
ANXIOUS

1705
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:50,505
What do you mean?

1706
01:02:51,305 --> 01:02:54,471
It's coming from behind us.

1707
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:56,971
CALMS DOWN FOR NOW

1708
01:02:57,038 --> 01:02:58,805
WEIRD NOISES

1709
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:02,305
HE JUST CAN'T RELAX

1710
01:03:03,005 --> 01:03:06,138
What was that? Something's back there.

1711
01:03:06,205 --> 01:03:07,305
THE STRANGE SOUNDS CONTINUE

1712
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:08,405
What?

1713
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:10,671
Something's coming near us.

1714
01:03:10,738 --> 01:03:13,705
CLATTERING

1715
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:17,505
IT WAS THE CREW MOVING THE EQUIPMENT

1716
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:21,271
Did they say we had one more thing left?

1717
01:03:21,938 --> 01:03:23,071
I'm sleepy.

1718
01:03:23,905 --> 01:03:26,171
WHILE JI-WON HAS DOZED OFF

1719
01:03:26,238 --> 01:03:29,838
This is the ramyeon we promised earlier.

1720
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:30,871
Thank you.

1721
01:03:30,938 --> 01:03:34,205
-The game will start in five minutes.
-All right.

1722
01:03:34,271 --> 01:03:37,438
-Please decide on the order…
-Okay.

1723
01:03:37,505 --> 01:03:41,838
-…and come to room 8 one by one.
-Room 8?

1724
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:43,938
I guess we're hiding something again.

1725
01:03:44,005 --> 01:03:45,738
-I guess so.
-That's what it sounds like.

1726
01:03:45,805 --> 01:03:48,271
-We're hiding things.
-Decide your order among yourselves,

1727
01:03:48,338 --> 01:03:49,705
and come over.

1728
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:51,905
Ji-won, you need to get up.

1729
01:03:53,138 --> 01:03:54,638
I guess we're hiding things again.

1730
01:03:55,305 --> 01:03:57,371
We're going to be fighting each other.

1731
01:03:57,438 --> 01:03:58,771
It's about time.

1732
01:03:59,571 --> 01:04:00,971
Get up. We have to go now.

1733
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,905
-Let's go.
-What should I be doing?

1734
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:04,938
THE NIGHT DEEPENS IN THE SAFARI

1735
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:09,538
THE USUAL CAUSE OF DISCORD
AWAITS THE THREE IDIOTS

1736
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:14,071
IT'S TIME TO FIGHT

1737
01:04:14,138 --> 01:04:16,571
-We need to pick an order.
-Who wants to go first?

1738
01:04:16,638 --> 01:04:17,671
I'll go.

1739
01:04:19,671 --> 01:04:21,671
We're definitely hiding things.

1740
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,238
One hundred percent.

1741
01:04:23,305 --> 01:04:24,771
-Right?
-Go on, then.

1742
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:25,671
Okay.

1743
01:04:26,305 --> 01:04:28,271
Hurry back. Don't take too long.

1744
01:04:28,338 --> 01:04:29,438
CAUTIOUS

1745
01:04:29,505 --> 01:04:30,605
Is this it?

1746
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,338
What is it now?

1747
01:04:32,405 --> 01:04:33,838
HE REACHES THE NEXT HUT THROUGH THE DARK

1748
01:04:33,905 --> 01:04:36,238
See? I knew it was about hiding things.

1749
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,305
Come in.

1750
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:40,271
-You want us to hide them.
-How did you end up as number one?

1751
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:42,771
-What?
-How did you come to be first?

1752
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:44,105
I just said I'd go first.

1753
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,105
-You volunteered?
-Yes.

1754
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:51,571
First off, this game is
the Golden Coffee Bean Mafia.

1755
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:52,505
Come again?

1756
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:55,771
GOLDEN COFFEE BEAN MAFIA

1757
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:58,005
What's the most popular thing about Kenya?

1758
01:04:58,071 --> 01:04:59,371
-It's coffee.
-Exactly.

1759
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:02,238
So, we brought golden coffee beans.

1760
01:05:02,305 --> 01:05:03,905
They're worth two million won.

1761
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:09,205
5 GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS
THAT LOOK JUST LIKE KENYA AA COFFEE BEANS

1762
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:13,305
There are two Citizens and one Mafia.

1763
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:14,871
If you're the Mafia,

1764
01:05:14,938 --> 01:05:17,405
you must protect
the golden beans for 100 minutes

1765
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:19,971
and deliver them to the Mafia King.

1766
01:05:20,038 --> 01:05:22,738
The Mafia doesn't keep them on him?

1767
01:05:22,805 --> 01:05:24,338
No, we've already…

1768
01:05:24,405 --> 01:05:26,771
-You hid them?
-We've hidden them in the lodge.

1769
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:28,738
-In the lodge?
-Yes.

1770
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:31,671
It includes the tent and the front yard.

1771
01:05:31,738 --> 01:05:34,805
THE GAME WILL LAST FOR 100 MINUTES

1772
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:37,605
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE AROUND THE LODGE AREA

1773
01:05:37,671 --> 01:05:40,671
5 GOLDEN COFFEE BEANS

1774
01:05:40,738 --> 01:05:43,338
THE MAFIA MUST PROTECT THEM
WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT

1775
01:05:43,405 --> 01:05:45,771
WHILE THE CITIZENS TRY TO STEAL THEM

1776
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,471
First, let's draw a card
to decide your role.

1777
01:05:51,938 --> 01:05:52,771
Good.

1778
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:54,105
HE HESITANTLY CHOOSES ONE

1779
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:57,171
What's better?
I think being a Citizen is better.

1780
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,038
Oh, crap.

1781
01:06:01,105 --> 01:06:02,471
Show us what you got.

1782
01:06:03,171 --> 01:06:04,271
Damn it.

1783
01:06:04,338 --> 01:06:06,138
MAFIA

1784
01:06:06,205 --> 01:06:08,571
100 MINUTES LATER

1785
01:06:08,638 --> 01:06:11,038
If you had forgiven me, I would have said,

1786
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:12,938
"Fine, you eat it."

1787
01:06:13,438 --> 01:06:16,905
We'll see in just a few minutes,
you damn bastards.

1788
01:06:18,338 --> 01:06:20,638
THE OLDEST IDIOT BLOCKS THE DOOR

1789
01:06:20,705 --> 01:06:21,705
What do we know, though?

1790
01:06:21,771 --> 01:06:24,038
THE YOUNGEST IDIOT RAISES HIS VOICE

1791
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,571
You stay out of this.

1792
01:06:25,638 --> 01:06:26,638
You think I'm the Mafia?

1793
01:06:26,705 --> 01:06:28,271
I told you over and over, I'm a Citizen!

1794
01:06:28,338 --> 01:06:30,071
-Then, I'm really disappointed in you.
-Why?

1795
01:06:32,438 --> 01:06:36,538
THE CITIZENS ARE BICKERING FOR SOME REASON

1796
01:06:36,605 --> 01:06:38,438
-You're suspecting me?
-For real?

1797
01:06:38,505 --> 01:06:41,505
AND THE REAL MAFIA IS QUIETLY WATCHING

1798
01:06:41,571 --> 01:06:42,805
Let's just eat ramyeon and go to bed.

1799
01:06:42,871 --> 01:06:45,671
HOW WILL THE GOLDEN COFFEE BEAN BRAWL END?

1800
01:06:45,738 --> 01:06:48,071
-It's your last try.
-Relax and just choose.

1801
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:50,305
Why do you even wear a watch
that doesn't work?

1802
01:06:50,371 --> 01:06:51,271
BONUS CLIP

1803
01:06:51,338 --> 01:06:53,905
-You don't even have a phone.
-Wait, don't pick yet.

1804
01:06:53,971 --> 01:06:55,771
It's bad luck. Step away.

1805
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:58,305
Gosh, why are you messing with his mind?

1806
01:06:58,371 --> 01:06:59,905
The watch works.

1807
01:06:59,971 --> 01:07:02,338
-Why mess with him?
-It just doesn't get reception.

1808
01:07:02,405 --> 01:07:03,738
Your watch doesn't even work.

1809
01:07:03,805 --> 01:07:06,671
-It still tells the time.
-It can be used as a clock.

1810
01:07:07,171 --> 01:07:08,838
It's 3 minutes to 7.

1811
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:09,905
-Okay.
-Go.

1812
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:11,005
-Get some energy.
-Go.

1813
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:12,005
