1
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:12,838
THREE IDIOTS IN KENYA

2
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:16,671
THE CENTER OF KENYAN FASHION, WESTLANDS

3
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:19,938
A RUNWAY FOR THE THREE IDIOTS

4
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:24,171
THE JUDGES ADD TO THE TENSION

5
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:26,638
THE FASHION SHOW BEGINS

6
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:27,538
Go?

7
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:31,138
JI-WON ENTERS THE RUNWAY
AS THE FIRST CONTESTANT

8
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,471
POSES

9
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:34,105
POSES

10
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:37,338
CONFIDENTLY STARTS WALKING

11
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,371
RAIN BOOTS FOR THE RAINY SEASON IN KENYA

12
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:41,438
VIBRANT RED PUFFER JACKET

13
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:42,405
You're good.

14
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:44,771
A BANDANA MADE OUT OF A T-SHIRT
IS THE KEY POINT

15
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:47,805
THE ESSENCE OF STYLE IS UNLEASHED

16
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:48,705
He's good.

17
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:52,838
HE STRIDES ON THE RUNWAY
WITHOUT HESITATION

18
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:55,071
THE JUDGES TAKE NOTES

19
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:57,538
SHARP EYES

20
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:03,371
STRIKING A POSE WITH CONFIDENCE

21
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:05,871
FUMBLES

22
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:07,971
FIRES THE DECISIVE SHOT

23
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:11,871
BANG

24
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:16,605
NODDING

25
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:21,105
HE FLAILS OUT OF THE RUNWAY

26
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:23,838
SATISFIED FOR SOME REASON

27
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,471
AFTER FIRING THE LAST SHOT

28
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:32,371
HE LEAVES WITH NO REGRETS

29
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,805
THE SECOND CONTESTANT ENTERS

30
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,805
FINDS THE CAMERA LIKE A TRUE IDOL

31
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:43,638
HE WALKS WRAPPED IN A SHUKA

32
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,538
A GLIMPSE OF ZEBRA PRINT PANTS

33
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:51,305
AND A VIVID SHUKA AS THE FOCAL POINT

34
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:56,971
OPENS THE SHUKA

35
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:58,038
He's not so bad.

36
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:09,605
I, KYUHYUN, AM NOT PESSIMISTIC TODAY

37
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:14,105
THE JUDGES WEAR UNREADABLE FACES

38
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,005
FEELING WARM

39
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:24,938
HE STRIKES THE ENDING POSE

40
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:28,405
IDOL ATTITUDE
THAT HOLDS STRONG UNTIL THE END

41
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:32,371
ENTHUSIASTICALLY TAKING NOTES

42
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:35,771
THE FINAL CONTESTANT

43
00:02:35,838 --> 00:02:36,671
Good morning.

44
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:41,771
THIS MODEL IS ESPECIALLY WELL-MANNERED

45
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:44,505
THIS GUY DOESN'T SEEM ORDINARY

46
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:46,705
HOPS

47
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:56,605
STRIDING WITH INCOMPREHENSIBLE DANCE MOVES

48
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:03,838
DISPLAYING MOVEMENTS
LIKE INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE

49
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:06,905
LOOKS INTENTLY

50
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:14,738
IMPRESSED BY THE USE OF TERRAIN

51
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:16,005
What is he doing?

52
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:19,705
AND BY A JUMP STRATEGY
THAT MAKES UP FOR HIS LACK OF HEIGHT

53
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:24,371
TRIES AN ENDING POSE LIKE KYUHYUN

54
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:29,905
LOW MARKS FOR CAMERA SENSE

55
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:32,871
BUT FULL MARKS FOR STAYING IN CHARACTER

56
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:36,205
With the judges sitting there,
everyone else burst out laughing.

57
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,038
FOUR IDIOTS?

58
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:40,471
Oh, boy.

59
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:43,005
COMING THROUGH

60
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:46,405
AN INNOVATIVE, INTERACTIVE RUNWAY

61
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:48,838
MOVED BY HIS SOCIABILITY

62
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:51,371
Go.

63
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:54,938
WALKING TOGETHER AT JI-WON'S CUE

64
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,805
THEY TAKE THEIR FINALE SERIOUSLY

65
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:04,371
THEY LOOK A BIT COOLER IN SLOW MOTION

66
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:08,171
WE'RE BACK AGAIN

67
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:11,838
WE ARE…

68
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:16,705
Great work, everyone.

69
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:19,538
GREAT WORK, VIEWERS

70
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:21,805
That concludes the fashion show.

71
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:24,171
We're going to take some time
for honest feedback.

72
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:25,671
Okay.

73
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:28,805
Before that,
let me introduce the three judges.

74
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,038
CHRISTABEL ADHIAMBO

75
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:31,238
EVALUATION CRITERION: TPO APPROPRIATENESS

76
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,438
JOAKIM N KISAMO

77
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,638
EVALUATION CRITERION: FIT OF THE CLOTHING

78
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:34,805
LARRY NGAR OUKO

79
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:36,071
EVALUATION CRITERION: PHYSIQUE

80
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:39,971
Let's take some time
for each person to explain his concept.

81
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:42,371
For me,

82
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:46,138
I focused on bright colors in my outfit.

83
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:50,105
And I included items like this bandana
that might start a trend.

84
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:55,171
I also wanted my outfit
to suit the local weather.

85
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:57,271
It's the winter season here.

86
00:04:57,838 --> 00:04:59,771
YES, IT IS THE COLD WINTER

87
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:03,338
So I wanted to show you how stylish
you can look in a puffer jacket.

88
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:06,271
-But they're wearing short sleeves.
-They're in short sleeves.

89
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:07,605
BREEZY OUTFIT

90
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:08,605
Well…

91
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:11,671
Then, why are they selling this jacket?
Why do they even sell it?

92
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:13,371
LET'S GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER

93
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,871
Next, Kyuhyun.

94
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:19,938
I have a tendency to try to experience
the local culture when I go abroad.

95
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:23,871
I heard that the Maasai people
often wear shukas.

96
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:27,271
PLEASED INTERVIEWERS, I MEAN JUDGES

97
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,971
So you can take it off when it's hot

98
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,938
and put it on when it's cold.

99
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:35,871
It's an outfit that takes
the changing weather into account.

100
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:41,838
And this T-shirt shows respect
for the Maasai people.

101
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:45,738
Since there are safari parks,
I chose pants with a zebra pattern.

102
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,105
AND THE LAST CONTESTANT

103
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,305
I asked…

104
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,638
THEY BURST INTO LAUGHTER
FOR HOW SERIOUS THEY ARE

105
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:54,705
I asked Kenya,

106
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,371
"Kenya, what are we to each other?"

107
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,905
We are the Maasai.

108
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:02,205
MAASAI

109
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,405
Maasai!

110
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,138
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS,
BUT IT'S FUNNY

111
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:10,838
We started with a plan
to go to the giraffe hotel,

112
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,838
so I wanted to emphasize that.

113
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,705
REPRESENTING THIS TRIP'S GOAL
WITH A GIRAFFE PATTERN

114
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:18,705
May I ask the judges a few questions?

115
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:21,005
Who do you think had the best outfit?

116
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,905
But don't tell us who it is.

117
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:24,438
Is there an outfit that you like?

118
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:25,471
UNANIMOUSLY: YES!

119
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:27,105
-Oh, that's good.
-Okay.

120
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,571
Is there a worst dresser too?

121
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:31,005
DRY LAUGH

122
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,138
-She looked at me.
-Su-geun.

123
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:33,605
-No, she looked at me.
-She looked at me.

124
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:35,171
-She looked at Su-geun.
-No, it was me.

125
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:36,405
She can't say.

126
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:38,205
That means there is.

127
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:41,405
Can you explain why you dislike it
without mentioning who?

128
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,805
She just pointed at…

129
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:50,238
She can't lie.

130
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:51,938
She just can't handle it.

131
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,371
Without saying the name,
do you have a reason?

132
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:57,005
According to the occasion with us,

133
00:06:57,071 --> 00:07:00,305
the gum boots are a bit…

134
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:02,371
That may have been too specific.

135
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:04,438
-Sorry, please stop there.
-We can't tell who it is.

136
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:05,705
-Me neither.
-You can stop.

137
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:08,005
JI-WON IN BOOTS HAS MIXED FEELINGS

138
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,605
THE CHIEF JUDGE REVEALS HIS FAVORITE

139
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,905
-He looked at Ji-won.
-It's Ji-won.

140
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:18,538
-It must be Ji-won.
-It's him.

141
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,571
Oh, of course.

142
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:21,138
They have different opinions.

143
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:24,471
LARRY HAS THE CASTING VOTE

144
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:30,905
-"Color combination."
-He liked the color combination.

145
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:34,838
-And he liked the height.
-Height?

146
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:36,405
That's also factored in?

147
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,471
Oh, height.

148
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:40,238
It must be Kyuhyun.

149
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:44,838
-They all have different tastes.
-I told you so.

150
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:47,738
The chief judge
must have a bigger influence.

151
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:50,371
THE JUDGES START A DISCUSSION

152
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,271
WHO WILL BE THE FINAL PICK

153
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:01,671
BY THE KENYAN FASHION INDUSTRY?

154
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,405
RESULT ANNOUNCEMENT

155
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,871
Joakim, please push
the winner from behind.

156
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:08,338
-Only the winner.
-He's behind our side.

157
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,371
Are you ready?

158
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:13,671
Who will be the winner
of this fashion show?

159
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:15,738
Is it Ji-won?

160
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,871
His criterion was physique.

161
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:20,105
THE CHIEF JUDGE IS ON THE MOVE

162
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:24,571
THE BOSS OF KENYAN FASHION PICKS…

163
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,338
KYUHYUN WINS

164
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:30,338
But that was a bit…

165
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,471
-No way.
-It was a bit unfair.

166
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:33,671
THE OLDER IDIOTS CAN'T ACCEPT IT

167
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:36,238
MY FRIEND

168
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:37,971
Please turn around.

169
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:39,838
Ngal's criterion was height.

170
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:42,871
-You can turn around now.
-You have very good eyes.

171
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,605
-It's his height.
-Why did he win?

172
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:46,005
Can you explain why he's the winner?

173
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:47,438
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

174
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:50,605
He won because he had a good fit
and was fashionable.

175
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:52,771
It also suited the weather in Nairobi.

176
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:54,371
And he was stylish.

177
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:58,405
TOUCHED

178
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,671
Your experience is very good. Oh my gosh.

179
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:06,371
Then, we'll have
the two of you turn around again.

180
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:09,505
He'll push the loser from behind.

181
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:11,105
Can you tell him to kick the loser?

182
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:12,071
PLEASE

183
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:14,971
THE LOSER GETS A KICK IN THE BUTT

184
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:17,171
IN POSITION

185
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,671
He'll kick the loser's butt.

186
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:20,571
All right.

187
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:23,505
KICKS

188
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:27,638
SU-GEUN IS IN LAST PLACE

189
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:32,038
-I survived.
-How is this fair?

190
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:33,938
I SURVIVED

191
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,138
-Hey, how is this fair?
-I survived.

192
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:37,505
THE SURVIVORS SHARE THEIR JOY

193
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:41,271
Geez, this fashion mall will face
a huge problem in three years.

194
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:45,105
This was bound to happen.

195
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,438
Please tell him that there will be
resistance from the Maasai.

196
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:48,905
No, you dressed poorly.

197
00:09:57,071 --> 00:10:02,571
I'm sorry, but could you ask
when people usually wear this?

198
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:05,171
HE OPPOSES
AS THE WINNER'S OUTFIT IS TOO SHOWY

199
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:17,238
MY SHUKA IS THE BEST

200
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:20,671
I'm truly sorry,
but what about this idiot and his jacket?

201
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:21,605
Tell me.

202
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:22,871
I'm sorry for doing this.

203
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:23,771
I'm sorry!

204
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:24,871
CALM DOWN

205
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,438
I'll call the police on you.

206
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:31,071
Anyway, the results are in,
so please give the judges a big hand.

207
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:34,238
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

208
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:36,438
IT ENDS ON A WHOLESOME NOTE

209
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,738
MAKEOVER TIME FOR 3RD PLACE

210
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:41,405
THE THREE IDIOTS ENTER

211
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:42,438
This is…

212
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:44,671
EXCLAIMING

213
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:45,971
This is so hip.

214
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:47,705
-Are we in Seongsu-dong?
-Right?

215
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,005
It's really hip.

216
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:50,838
IT'S HIP FROM THE ENTRANCE

217
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:55,038
IT'S GOT TRENDY RESTAURANTS

218
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:58,138
AND TRENDY ITEMS

219
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:03,038
A POPULAR PLACE
WHERE YOU CAN EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING

220
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,638
This place is nice. I like the vibe here.

221
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:06,938
Are we really in Kenya?

222
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,538
-It's trendy.
-It's just like Seongsu-dong.

223
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,338
-Totally.
-This is amazing.

224
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:12,905
MOVING OUTSIDE

225
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,171
This place is…

226
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:17,438
That looks just like
what my dad's barbershop had back then.

227
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:19,905
Are you getting a haircut here?

228
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,638
The hairdresser is very stylish.

229
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:24,305
CONFIDENTLY ENTERS

230
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:26,171
You have a very good style.

231
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:29,438
SU-GEUN'S HAIR IS IN THE BARBER'S HANDS

232
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:32,605
Wait, is he chopping my head off?

233
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:34,538
No.

234
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:36,171
Is this where he's cutting?

235
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,571
TERRIFIED OF THE CUTOFF LINE

236
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:40,338
THE FASHION WINNERS, KYUHYUN AND JI-WON

237
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:41,738
I love this place, though.

238
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:43,671
ENJOYING THEIR FREE TIME

239
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:46,538
Tourists would love this area.

240
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,605
It has a different vibe
from typical Kenya.

241
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:52,438
All these different restaurants are here.

242
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,771
A RELAXING LUNCH UNDER THE SUN

243
00:11:57,338 --> 00:12:00,171
What kind of burger is it?
Show me the inside.

244
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:02,005
It's a Sicilian burger.

245
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:07,238
-There are bell peppers in the burger.
-A lot of bell peppers.

246
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:09,105
The buns alone look delicious.

247
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:11,205
A BIG BITE

248
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:13,671
Why? Do you like it?

249
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:16,205
The beef patty is insane.

250
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:19,738
FIVE STARS FOR TASTE
BURSTING WITH JUICY MEAT

251
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,971
-Next, sausages.
-It's a hot dog.

252
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:26,471
Oh, it's a chili hot dog, and it's huge.

253
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,838
Are you eating it in one bite?

254
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,471
Where should I start?
This is the sausage-filled part.

255
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:33,738
But the buns are crispy.

256
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,671
That's nice.

257
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,538
KYUHYUN EXCLAIMS

258
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:40,371
KYUHYUN LAUGHS

259
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:43,838
GOBBLING JI-WON MAKES HIM LAUGH

260
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:44,771
What do you think?

261
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:46,738
DELICIOUS

262
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:49,505
But it's not very pleasing to the eye.

263
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,238
The sausage is good.

264
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:58,171
Cheers for victory.

265
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,905
It's too short.

266
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:03,871
-What is?
-He's a sprout.

267
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:05,771
The sprout hairstyle looks great.

268
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:07,971
LEE SU-GEUN, FASHION SPROUT

269
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,205
Are you sure this is it?

270
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,471
A REASONABLE DOUBT

271
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:16,438
FORTUNATELY, THE SPROUT IS UNTIED

272
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:19,938
GETTING A HAIRCUT
TO BECOME AN HONOR FASHION STUDENT

273
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:22,738
SOME SCRATCH LINES FOR A MACHO LOOK

274
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:25,405
REMOVING FINE HAIR

275
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,638
LOOKING MUCH WILDER NOW

276
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,338
What am I getting now?

277
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:36,438
Facial care, skincare, and a shave.

278
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:38,205
You might as well give me plastic surgery.

279
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:40,438
A facelift, maybe.

280
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:45,571
THIS IS A FULL-SERVICE SESSION
THAT'S ALMOST AS GOOD AS PLASTIC SURGERY

281
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:51,271
1. SHAVING, FOR A HAIRSTYLE LIKE A BEAST
FACE LIKE A BABY

282
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:54,405
2. SCRUBBING, TO EXFOLIATE
50-YEAR-OLD DEAD SKIN CELLS

283
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:55,971
This must be the scrub.

284
00:13:56,471 --> 00:14:00,938
3. APPLYING AMPULE, NOT SLAPPING

285
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:05,838
What is that?

286
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,805
4. STEAM CARE,
FOR A RADIANT AND HYDRATED SKIN

287
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:14,105
LASTLY, A SHEET MASK
THAT TACKLES DEEP SKIN DRYNESS

288
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,071
FROM KOREA

289
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:20,771
-But Korea…
-It's an Abib Cosmetic product.

290
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:23,071
-What?
-It's a mask sheet from Korea.

291
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:27,438
-Of course, Korean cosmetics are great.
-It's a good one too.

292
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:31,438
AFTER WIPING OFF THE WATER

293
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,338
HE LOOKS NEAT

294
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:39,705
TODAY'S SKINCARE IS OVER

295
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:43,105
TIME FOR THE POSTER SHOOT
AFTER THE GLOW-UP

296
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:45,405
Okay, the shoot will begin now.

297
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:48,038
We'll look funnier on top of the van.

298
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:49,205
We can't do it.

299
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,238
I'll take the photos now.

300
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,905
Three, two.

301
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:56,171
THEY'RE ALL HONOR FASHION STUDENTS

302
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:59,671
PERFECTLY ADAPTED TO KENYA

303
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:02,571
-Where?
-Let's all get in this van.

304
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:05,138
-That's the van I meant.
-Which one?

305
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,305
I'll take a few.

306
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,538
Three, two, one.

307
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:11,805
SMILE, EVERYONE

308
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:17,138
WHO WANTS TO GO ON A TRIP TO KENYA?

309
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:21,038
It's a sea of green.

310
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:24,538
Until yesterday,
we've been enjoying the traditional ways.

311
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:25,971
Is there Italian cuisine here?

312
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:29,271
Today's meal will be modern fusion food.

313
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:30,438
That's nice.

314
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:32,938
It's a fusion restaurant

315
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:36,905
featuring diverse elements
from across Africa.

316
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:38,671
-African fusion.
-African fusion.

317
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,605
For example, they prepare testicles
like spicy sea snail salad.

318
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:43,171
NOT AT ALL

319
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:46,505
It's a place frequented by celebrities
and high-ranking officials.

320
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,171
We went to such places in Vietnam.

321
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,071
The restaurant Barack Obama visited.

322
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:53,071
Have we found two of the Big Five so far?

323
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:55,305
-Two.
-The bone soup?

324
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,005
That bone soup was…

325
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:58,638
It tasted like oxtail soup.

326
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,638
I wanted to add noodles.

327
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,338
NOODLES EDITION

328
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:03,771
STATUS OF BIG 5 LISTINGS

329
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,305
TANYA'S SMOCHA, BONE SOUP

330
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:08,871
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO FIND
A BIG 3 AT THIS RESTAURANT?

331
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:10,971
It looks luxurious.

332
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,405
Should we have dressed better?

333
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:18,338
BRIMMING WITH A STYLISH VIBE

334
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:20,271
A NAIROBI HOTSPOT

335
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:22,171
AND

336
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:26,071
A GATHERING PLACE
FOR FUSION AFRICAN CUISINE

337
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:30,005
A MODERN AFRICAN RESTAURANT, ANKOLE GRILL

338
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:31,538
It's luxurious.

339
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:34,205
-Goodness, it's so nice.
-Oh, my.

340
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:36,405
ENTERING TO EAT TRENDY FOOD

341
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:38,438
They even have expensive water.

342
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:39,838
-Is that Evian?
-Cafe?

343
00:16:40,505 --> 00:16:43,905
Wait, the setup gives me a bad feeling.

344
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:45,071
Yes, you're right.

345
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,871
He brought that pointer again.

346
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:50,205
There is a great chance
we're not eating today.

347
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:53,405
As you all heard,
this place serves great food.

348
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,771
-I can tell from the vibe.
-What do they serve?

349
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:59,071
They have meat, salads, appetizers, soup,

350
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:04,005
curry, pizza, fried rice, and everything.

351
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:06,338
-Soup and fried rice sound good.
-They have everything.

352
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:09,638
-You might get too full if you eat it all.
-Yes, that's true.

353
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:11,638
I want to give you everything,
but that'd be too much.

354
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:13,571
We have a chance to get a bite, though.

355
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:14,705
One bite?

356
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:16,505
Kyuhyun, you've gotten brazen.

357
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:19,638
-He has become angry and aggressive.
-But the viewers…

358
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,405
He never had a say,
being the youngest in Super Junior.

359
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:26,271
As he approaches 40,
he's become increasingly violent.

360
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,138
That's his true self.

361
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,505
How about a nickname?

362
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:30,738
Mobster Cho.

363
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:34,005
CHO KYUHYUN'S NEW NICKNAME OF 2025:
MOBSTER CHO

364
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:36,105
JI-WON LOVES IT

365
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:37,638
You're the Mobster now.

366
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:38,905
THE GAME BEGINS WITH THE MOBSTER

367
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:41,805
There are only three members,
so it will be another group mission.

368
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:43,671
It's Name It.

369
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:44,571
That's fine.

370
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:46,638
First, you stand in one line.

371
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:50,038
-Do we say one thing and head back?
-No, say as much as you can.

372
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:50,938
Then, we go back?

373
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,771
-If you can't think of anything else…
-Then, we go back.

374
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:56,038
Jjajangmyeon, jjamppong,
fried rice, and tangsuyuk!

375
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:57,738
-I'm done.
-Then, you go back.

376
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:59,138
-Yurinchi.
-No.

377
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:01,371
-Start over from the beginning.
-Continuing on?

378
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:02,905
Since you failed along the way.

379
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:04,471
-Seriously?
-Jjajangmyeong, jjamppong…

380
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:05,705
NAME 5 CHINESE FOODS

381
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:08,071
JJAJANGMYEON, JJAMPPONG, TANGSUYUK

382
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:09,738
REPLACE PLAYER

383
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,471
JJAJANGMYEON, JJAMPPONG, TANGSUYUK

384
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:13,238
FRIED RICE

385
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:16,305
-Is the order important?
-You must all try at least once.

386
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:17,871
You need to get to Kyuhyun, at least.

387
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:19,371
EVERYONE MUST PARTICIPATE

388
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:21,405
REPLACE PLAYER

389
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:23,238
JJAJANGMYEON, JJAMPPONG,
TANGSUYUK, FRIED RICE

390
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:24,338
ULMYEON

391
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:26,438
THEY'VE NAMED 5 FOODS

392
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,005
I'll go last
since it requires memorization.

393
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:29,938
-Okay, since you're smart.
-Yes.

394
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,671
-Then, you should go first, Ji-won.
-I can't memorize.

395
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,438
-Let's try ten.
-We'll give it a go.

396
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:37,238
-We'll have a practice round.
-Ji-won--

397
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:40,771
Name ten Chinese dishes.

398
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:42,238
Ready, go.

399
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:43,205
Jjajangmyeon.

400
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:44,338
What did he just do?

401
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:46,638
That piece of…

402
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,205
FAILED PRACTICE ROUND

403
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:51,905
So if that's the theme,
say all the noodles first.

404
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:53,938
If we switch back and forth
without a proper flow…

405
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:55,438
-It won't work.
-It won't.

406
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:58,105
It gets more confusing
if we name all the different food types.

407
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,105
I say this every time,

408
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:05,271
but it makes me laugh so hard
when we have a strategy meeting.

409
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:07,205
Let's do a cheer before we start.

410
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,271
Tuko!

411
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:09,938
-Tuko!
-Tuko pamoja?

412
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:11,171
Took a punch at you.

413
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,705
-Just shout, "Took a punch."
-Okay.

414
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:13,905
"Took a punch." Ready, go.

415
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:15,105
-Took a punch!
-Took a punch!

416
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:17,305
Should we bring in the first dish?

417
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:18,238
Are we starting?

418
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:19,238
Took a punch at you.

419
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,205
-What's that?
-Here's the first dish.

420
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:23,671
It looks delicious. What is it?

421
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:26,505
It looks similar
to what Tanya was selling.

422
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:27,505
I think it's a wrap.

423
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:29,671
It's called baba ganoush.

424
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:33,338
BABA GANOUSH

425
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:36,971
A ROASTED EGGPLANT DIP

426
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:39,438
INSPIRED BY MIDDLE EASTERN TRADITION

427
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:44,605
REINVENTED WITH AFRICAN FLAVORS

428
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:46,038
It's the first dish, after all.

429
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:49,471
How about one of you
get a taste of it to ignite your passion?

430
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,871
-But we're going to succeed.
-We'll succeed anyway.

431
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:52,971
Why is he worried?

432
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,638
-Then, you don't have to play.
-I still have to play.

433
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:59,238
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

434
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:01,038
-You can try.
-Oh, geez.

435
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:02,805
Put these on the bread.

436
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:04,271
-And give it a taste.
-Good.

437
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:06,671
-You could add more.
-Make a wrap.

438
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,171
It looks like pizza.

439
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,705
-That has to taste good.
-That's all you need.

440
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:14,105
But he's already tried it,
so he's no longer eager to win.

441
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,505
-Why is it spicy?
-It must be good.

442
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:18,438
-It's so tasty!
-I bet it is.

443
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:21,271
It's somewhere
between a taco and a quesadilla.

444
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,605
I really like it.

445
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:26,671
At least you got to try it.

446
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:27,838
Enjoy the food.

447
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:29,171
HE EXPECTS TO LOSE

448
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:30,405
Should we begin, then?

449
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:31,971
It smells delicious.

450
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:33,938
You get one minute.

451
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:36,805
You must name seven items.

452
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:37,871
-That's a lot.
-It's easy.

453
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:39,138
-Good luck.
-All right.

454
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,105
BABA GANOUSH ROUND

455
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,271
Name the sports

456
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:46,838
followed by the representative athletes
in order of--

457
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,138
-What?
-What's he saying?

458
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,205
-Hang on.
-Nonsense.

459
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:50,971
That was way too difficult. Come again?

460
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:52,171
Here's an example.

461
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:53,971
Soccer, Park Ji-sung.

462
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:55,938
Okay, we got one. Park Ji-sung.

463
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,371
Here it goes. Get ready!

464
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,038
BABA GANOUSH ROUND
7 PAIRS OF SPORTS AND THEIR ATHLETES

465
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,005
Get set. Go!

466
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:03,671
Soccer, Park Ji-sung.

467
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:05,571
Soccer, Park Ji-sung.

468
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:07,438
Baseball, Lee Dae-ho.

469
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:09,171
SOCCER: PARK JI-SUNG, BASEBALL: LEE DAE-HO

470
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:10,271
Foot volleyball, Lee Su-geun.

471
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:11,638
-That's no good, right?
-That's a no.

472
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,671
-The timer is going.
-No? Okay.

473
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:14,771
-Gosh.
-Now, change.

474
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,138

00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,005
swimming, Park Tae-hwan.

477
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:24,738
We need two more. We're almost done.

478
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:26,638
-He doesn't remember.
-I said them all.

479
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:29,105
Soccer, Park Ji-sung,
baseball, Lee Dae-ho,

480
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,871
badminton, Lee Yong-dae,

481
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:34,571
-tennis, Lee Hyung-taik.
-Yes.

482
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:35,971
Good. Hurry, we don't have time.

483
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:37,805
-Swimming, Park Tae-hwan.
-Good.

484
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:39,005
Please, two more.

485
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:41,271
-Basketball, Seo Jang-hoon.
-Hurry.

486
00:21:41,338 --> 00:21:42,971
-Just one more.
-One more. Do ssireum.

487
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,338
-Table tennis.
-Yes.

488
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,171
Who?

489
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:48,871
Are you insane?

490
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:49,771
Table tennis?

491
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,071
-What are you doing?
-What?

492
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:52,205
Nam-kyu.

493
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,005
-Five…
-Jeong Nam-kyu?

494
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:55,605
-Incorrect.
-Change!

495
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:57,105
MY NAME IS YOO NAM-KYU

496
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:59,138
-You've still got time.
-Hurry!

497
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:00,505
Come on. He's Yoo Nam-kyu.

498
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:01,605
Oh, Yoo Nam-kyu.

499
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:02,871
Soccer, Park Ji-sung.

500
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:04,738
THE KOREAN TABLE TENNIS WORLD IS IN SHOCK

501
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:07,538
-Four, three, two…
-Soccer, Park Ji-sung. What was next?

502
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:08,971
You came up with it!

503
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:10,438
-Incorrect!
-Soccer, Park Ji-sung.

504
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:12,305
-You were the one who said it.
-What was next?

505
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:15,338
You don't remember Mr. Yoo Nam-kyu
and Ms. Hyun Jung-hwa?

506
00:22:15,405 --> 00:22:19,138
I remembered his first name,
but I forgot his last name.

507
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,038
He's a gold medalist, man.
How could you not remember?

508
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:22,905
Also, why didn't you say,
"Ssireum, Kang Ho-dong"?

509
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:25,671
-I should have said more.
-How did you forget Ho-dong?

510
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:27,271
-I should have named more.
-Right.

511
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:29,738
THE BABA GANOUSH IS OUT

512
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:31,338
We have to think of new…

513
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:32,571
What's this?

514
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:34,038
-Here's a new menu.
-Is this a cold appetizer?

515
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:37,071
Kashiba mushroom black pepper chicken.

516
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:38,771
-Kashiba?
-Black pepper chicken.

517
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:43,405
SUCCULENT CHICKEN

518
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:48,005
TOPPED WITH A THICK,
PEPPER-SEASONED MUSHROOM SAUCE

519
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:52,238
KASHIBA MUSHROOM BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN

520
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:53,938
It looks scrumptious.

521
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,871
Well, I can already tell it's tasty.

522
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:58,205
Took a punch at you.

523
00:22:58,271 --> 00:22:59,438
Right at you!

524
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:00,871
-Took a punch!
-Took a punch!

525
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:02,538
I'll give you an easy one this time.

526
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:04,205
-We need to eat one, at least.
-Yes.

527
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:06,971
-It will be animals.
-Okay.

528
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:08,971
-Ji-won's good at this.
-We almost had it.

529
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:09,938
All right.

530
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,305
-Start as soon as you hear the subject.
-Animals.

531
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,671
-There are different types of dogs.
-What?

532
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:17,005
Name seven dog breeds.

533
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:18,038
Ready, go.

534
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,705
Korean Jindo, Chihuahuas…

535
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:22,705
MOVE OVER

536
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:25,471
Korean Jindo, Chihuahuas,
Pomeranians, golden retrievers.

537
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:29,805
Korean Jindo, Chihuahuas,
Pomeranians, golden retrievers,

538
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:31,738
bichon frises,

539
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:34,938
Dalmatians, and bulldogs.

540
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,005
QUICK SUCCESS

541
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,271
-Yes!
-We did it.

542
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,071
-We did it.
-How long did we take?

543
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:40,971
-Hold on, though.
-Only 19 seconds?

544
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:42,871
-What came after "Pome"?
-Pomeranians.

545
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,138
Pronounce it correctly.

546
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:47,005
Pomelion.

547
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:47,938
Incorrect!

548
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,238
That's wrong.

549
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,305
-You have 40 seconds.
-Only 40 seconds.

550
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:53,138
Korean Jindo, Pomeranians…

551
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:54,438
-What's it called?
-Pomeranians.

552
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:57,338
-And golden retrievers.
-He named a weird one.

553
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:59,238
Oh, I forgot the rest.

554
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:03,238
Chihuahua, Korean Jindo,
Pomeranians, bulldogs…

555
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:06,238
What was it? Golden retrievers.

556
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:07,271
What are the other two?

557
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:12,438
Chihuahuas, Pomeranians,
bulldogs, golden retrievers,

558
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:14,705
-bichon frises…
-Korean Jindo.

559
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:17,005
Korean Jindo and Dalmatians!

560
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:18,571
-Yes!
-You got it.

561
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:19,471
You took 52 seconds.

562
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:22,438
-They're called "Pomeranians"?
-Yes, Pomeranians.

563
00:24:22,505 --> 00:24:24,171
I had never heard of them before.

564
00:24:24,238 --> 00:24:25,971
Why did I think they were "Pomelions"?

565
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:29,738
-We got the food.
-We're all pet owners, after all.

566
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:32,505
THEY BEGIN EATING

567
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:35,905
-Gosh, Ji-won.
-It's obviously good.

568
00:24:37,438 --> 00:24:39,438
-It's insane.
-It's my favorite taste.

569
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,971
GROANING

570
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:43,138
It's made by that famous chef.

571
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:45,405
-What do they call it?
-Cream…

572
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:47,971
What's the most famous pasta
at Outback Steakhouse?

573
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:50,838
-Toowoomba.
-It tastes like Toowoomba pasta.

574
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:53,905
THE FIRST DISH SUITS
THE THREE IDIOTS' TASTES

575
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:56,705
What's this?
Dried radish greens? They're so good.

576
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:58,371
These veggies are tasty.

577
00:24:58,438 --> 00:25:00,338
It has the texture of dried radish greens.

578
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:01,738
They call it mchicha.

579
00:25:01,805 --> 00:25:03,205
-Mchicha?
-Mchicha.

580
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:05,271
It's a spinach-like vegetable

581
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,938
-commonly eaten across Africa.
-Right?

582
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,571
I knew it was a common thing.

583
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,571
EXCLAIMS

584
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:13,705
DEVOURED IN SECONDS

585
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:16,971
Let me tell you.
Kenyan cuisine is delicious.

586
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,505
I love Kenya. When you crave Korean food,
you can go and eat that bone soup.

587
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:21,838
This place is amazing.

588
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:27,305
Overall, the Kenyan nature, air,
temperature, and humidity

589
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:29,338
are perfect for filming a show.

590
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,571
Africa is growing on me.

591
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:34,405
My trust started with Kenya Airways.

592
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:37,105
-First, I'm in love with the people.
-Indeed.

593
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:42,371
-They're all so adorable and kind.
-And kind.

594
00:25:42,438 --> 00:25:44,038
They also say hi back.

595
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:46,505
Anyway, I've fallen in love with Kenya.

596
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,838
-Viewers, thank you for watching.
-Thank you.

597
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:50,738
Good work, guys.

598
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:51,671
That didn't take long.

599
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:53,105
-Are you full?
-What are we doing?

600
00:25:53,171 --> 00:25:54,038
I'll hit the slate.

601
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,171
Three, two, one.

602
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:58,105
THE GAME ISN'T OVER YET

603
00:25:58,171 --> 00:25:59,938
-We have to eat that.
-What is it?

604
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:02,438
It's soup. It must be a type of crab soup.

605
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:05,405
-Let's see what it is.
-I think it has eels.

606
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:07,771
-Why don't you have a taste?
-How?

607
00:26:07,838 --> 00:26:09,038
Let's try the soup.

608
00:26:09,105 --> 00:26:10,305
Rock-paper-scissors.

609
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:11,605
I tend to win these things.

610
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,205
-It looks like a stew to me.
-It's a stew.

611
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:15,805
-It's a beef stew.
-It is.

612
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,338
Isn't this like clam chowder?

613
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:19,871
I think it contains similar vegetables.

614
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:29,205
KNOCKED OUT

615
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:31,271
SCREAMS

616
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:32,638
What does it taste like?

617
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:36,271
-That beef just melts in your mouth.
-Yes.

618
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:37,871
It's just so delicious.

619
00:26:37,938 --> 00:26:39,105
Does it taste like goulash?

620
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:40,771
-Yes, exactly! Goulash.
-Goulash?

621
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:43,671
-I could drink it out of the bowl.
-All right.

622
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,238
-Do you want the name of the soup?
-Yes.

623
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,271
It's called African…

624
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:52,471
-It must be something peculiar.
-What's wrong?

625
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,605
THEY HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS

626
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:57,671
Western African mbuzi soup.

627
00:26:58,938 --> 00:27:01,305
Goat meat goes well with you.

628
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,505
You're…

629
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:04,238
-Goat dishes work for you.
-"Baa."

630
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:06,471
You couldn't eat them
just because of your prejudice.

631
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:08,071
ANOTHER GOAT DISH

632
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:10,005
You must have a special bond with goats!

633
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:14,038
I may not know the Kenyan word for cows,
but I know how to call a goat.

634
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:15,638
Anyway, you said it was good.

635
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:17,438
-Yes, I want some more.
-Good.

636
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:18,705
When I go back to Korea,

637
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:21,571
I'm going to ask my friends,
"Who wants to go get mbuzi?"

638
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:24,105
"Who wants black mbuzi?"
That's a black goat stew.

639
00:27:24,171 --> 00:27:25,405
AN EXOTIC BLACK GOAT STEW

640
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:28,038
Black mbuzi stew. That's right.

641
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:30,938
Why don't you start right away?

642
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:32,838
It's an easy one this time.
Please get in line.

643
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:34,205
-What is it?
-Are you in line?

644
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:35,938
-Here we go.
-What's the theme?

645
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:38,938
A lot of people order this
to eat with beer for dinner.

646
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:41,471
Name seven chicken brands.

647
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:42,405
Ready, go.

648
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:44,471
BBQ, 60 Chicken…

649
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,371
HE EXITS AFTER NAMING 2

650
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:46,438
He only named two.

651
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:50,205
BBQ, 60 Chicken, Kyochon,

652
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:51,871
-Pelicana…
-You're doing great.

653
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,305
Pelicana.

654
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,205
Keep going.

655
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:55,938
BBQ, 60 Chicken, Kyochon,

656
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:58,905

658
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:01,171
SUCCESS

659
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:02,438
…and BHC.

660
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:04,405
THEY SUCCEEDED IN 18 SECONDS

661
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:07,538
-Amazing, you guys won mbuzi!
-Yes!

662
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:08,538
"Baa."

663
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,438
I LOVE MBUZI

664
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:11,971
Mbuzi, come on!

665
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:13,938
EAT UP, "BAA"

666
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:16,171
-You eat it like this.
-I get it now.

667
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:17,671
THE MBUZI ENTHUSIAST GOES FIRST

668
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,238
-Really?
-Give it a try, Ji-won.

669
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:22,305
You and I basically have the same palate.

670
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:26,405
-This tastes more like galbitang.
-Right?

671
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,471
It actually does.

672
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:28,871
DRINKING FROM THE DISH

673
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:31,138
-You're really enjoying it.
-I told you it was good.

674
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:34,671
It warms your body.

675
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:37,305
I feel invigorated.

676
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:38,571
See?

677
00:28:38,638 --> 00:28:39,738
Kyuhyun seems to like it.

678
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:42,805
MBUZI, A DISH THAT IS
BOTH HEALTHFUL AND FLAVORFUL

679
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,238

00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:49,671

THE NEXT DISH IS SERVED

686
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:01,071
-Isn't that crab? It looks like it.
-What is that?

687
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:04,071
It's made of your favorite ingredient.

688
00:29:04,138 --> 00:29:05,771
-Chicken.
-Chicken.

689
00:29:06,305 --> 00:29:08,905
MARINATED WITH INDIAN SPICES

00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:10,171

GRILLED BONELESS TIKKA MASALA

693
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:19,505
-I see some mushrooms.
-It's like curry chicken.

694
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:21,338
INDIAN FOOD HAS BECOME
PART OF KENYAN CUISINE

695
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:24,105
-And it's boneless.
-It's boneless?

696
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:25,005
Let's do this.

697
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:26,471
GRILLED BONELESS TIKKA MASALA ROUND

698
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:28,938
It doesn't matter what brand it is.

699
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:32,005
It can be a shoe brand or a jewelry brand.

700
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,638
Name seven brands
that are five syllables or longer.

701

00:29:38,938 --> 00:29:41,071
-North Face.
-North Face.

705
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:42,738
Mercedes-Benz.

706
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:43,905
EXITS AFTER NAMING 2 DIFFICULT ONES

707
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:45,471
Get in there. What are you doing?

708
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:49,071
North Face, Merced-Benz.

709
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:49,971
What did you say?

710
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,438
Mercedays…

711
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:52,471
Gosh.

712
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:54,505
Benz.

713
00:29:54,571 --> 00:29:55,838
North Face,

714
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:57,838
Mercedes-Benz.

715
00:29:57,905 --> 00:29:58,838
That's correct.

716
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:00,471
-And…
-What did he say?

717
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:03,605
-I can't get past two.
-North Face, Mercedes-Benz,

718
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,105
-and Salvatore Ferragamo.
-Mercedez?

719
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:07,471
-Salvatore what?
-Salvatore Ferragamo.

720
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:11,005
Salvatore Ferragamo,
North Face, Mercede-Benz.

721
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:12,071
What was that?

722
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:13,838
Mercedecedez.

723
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:16,271
-Come on!
-Isn't it Mercede-Benz?

724
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:17,638
-Mercedes-Benz.
-Get out of the way.

725
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:18,805
Mercedez?

726
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:20,505
GETTING A PRIVATE GERMAN TUTOR

727
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:21,671
Ferregamo.

728
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:22,871
I'm sorry?

729
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:24,671
It's supposed to be
five syllables or longer.

730
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:26,838
Marusalamo Ferregamo?

731
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:28,238
-What was it?
-Incorrect!

732
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:30,371
-What?
-Salvatore Ferragamo,

733
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:31,971
-Mercedes-Benz…
-Yes.

734
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,205
-North Face…
-Yes.

735
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:34,138
Mercedez?

736
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:35,038
Is it Mercedez?

737
00:30:35,105 --> 00:30:36,005
Stop naming such tough ones!

738
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:37,938
-Mercedes-Benz.
-Yes.

739
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,005
HE FINALLY GOT THE FULL NAME

740
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,071
Salvageable Ferragamo?

741
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,038
-Incorrect!
-What's it called?

742
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:43,405
-What was it, Kyuhyun?
-What?

743
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:45,005
-Salvatore!
-Salvatore?

744
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:47,538
Salvatore Ferragamo,

745
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:49,905
-Mercedes-Benz,
-Yes.

746
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:52,138
-North Face.
-North Face!

747
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:53,905
-And…
-What was the other one?

748
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,705
Why did I stand here
without even thinking?

749
00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:58,938
I should have stepped forward
after coming up with one.

750
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:01,905
-Salvatore Ferragamo, Mercedes-Benz…
-I'll give you 30 more seconds.

751
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:05,605
-Salvatore Ferragamo, Mercedes-Benz…
-I'll give you 30 more seconds.

752
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:07,205
-North Face…
-Yes.

753
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:09,005
Kyuhyun is the only one doing it.

754
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:11,938
-Tommy Hilfiger!
-All right!

755
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:14,038
-Mercedes-Benz.
-Yes.

756
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:16,271
Salvatore what?

757
00:31:16,338 --> 00:31:17,771
-Is it Salvatore?
-Tommy what?

758
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:19,471
-Tommy what?
-Tommy Hilfiger.

759
00:31:19,538 --> 00:31:22,338
Tommy Hilfiger, Mercedes-Benz,

760
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:26,138
-Salvatore, Cartier.
-It's hard to find five syllables.

761
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:27,438
What was it called?

762
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:29,871
Salvatore Creatine? What did he say?

763
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:31,538
Step forward, Kyuhyun.

764
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:36,805
Tommy Hilfiger, Salvatore Ferragamo,
Mercedes-Benz, North Face…

765
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:38,105
Oh, North Face.

766
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:40,238
-I got nothing.
-He just needs one more.

767
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:41,305
You can't think of anything?

768
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,805
Corso Como!

769
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:44,505
-This is your very last chance.
-Corso Como!

770
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,605
-Corso Como.
-Corso Como, yes!

771
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:50,838
-Salvatore Ferragamo.
-Yes.

772
00:31:50,905 --> 00:31:52,438
-Mercedes-Benz.
-Yes.

773
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:55,105
-And North Face.
-Yes.

774
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:56,638
Was it Tommy Hillys?

775
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:59,105
-Tommy Hilfiger.
-Two more.

776
00:31:59,871 --> 00:32:01,205
Corso Como.

777
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:02,638
-You said that earlier.
-You said it.

778
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:03,638
Move.

779
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:05,305
Pascuccicci.

780
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:08,571
THEY LOSE GRILLED BONELESS TIKKA MASALA

781
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:10,605
You have the final dish left.

782
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:11,738
You still ate a lot today.

783
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,238
Yes, I ate so much.

784
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:15,505
What was your favorite
among the ones you've tried?

785
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:17,071
All of them.

786
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:17,971
Everything.

787
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:19,705
-What's that?
-Those are wings.

788
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,938
-They are wings.
-Wings.

789
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:25,138
CRISPY ROASTED CHICKEN WINGS

790
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:28,405
COATED WITH AN ADDICTIVE
SWAHILI-STYLE SEASONING

791
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:31,671
ANKOLE HOT WINGS

792
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:33,638
-What are those?
-White wine?

793
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:35,671
-Su-geun mentioned wine earlier.
-Seriously?

794
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:36,805
Thank you so much.

795
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,738
So we brought wine.

796
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:41,505
I was dying to drink white wine earlier.

797
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:44,305
This restaurant is called
Ankole Grill, right?

798
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:47,338
This dish is called the Ankole hot wings.

799
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:49,571
It's a signature menu item

800
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:52,671
confident enough
to bear the restaurant's name.

801
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,105
It was the scout team's favorite dish.

802
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:56,738
That's reliable information.

803
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:57,938
Wait, you…

804
00:32:58,005 --> 00:32:59,105
I just got goosebumps.

805
00:32:59,171 --> 00:33:01,471
He was talking in his sleep,

806
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:04,138
"I wish I could get
some yangnyeom chicken."

807
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:07,171
You said that in your sleep?

808
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:09,338
-Hey, but…
-No, I was awake that time.

809
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:12,938
IT WAS THIS MORNING

810
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:15,971
This is random,
but I'm craving yangnyeom chicken.

811
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:18,738
I'm not hungry, though.

812
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,471
No, just one piece.

813
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:21,371
HE TENDS TO EXAGGERATE

814
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:25,005
The last round
is for this restaurant's signature wings.

815
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:26,838
The category is

816
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,871
the number four.

817
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:30,871
-"Four"?
-Yes, the number four.

818
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:33,371
-What does that mean?
-I think it's four syllables.

819
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:35,871
-It must be four syllables.
-Four syllables?

820
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:38,605
-Maybe they want celebrity names.
-Who the heck has four syllables?

821
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:40,005
THERE IS A WHOLE LIST OF THEM

822
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:41,071
I got it.

823
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:42,471
Four-character idioms.

824
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,738
Guys, I'm sorry,
but we can all hear… Guys?

825
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:47,838
IN THEIR OWN WORLD

826
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:50,105
Cheopcheopsanjung, obiirak, jintoeyangnan…

827
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:52,438
-Do you really have to hide to say that?
-We'll start.

828
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:54,505
You must name seven of them.

829
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:59,205
Name seven four-syllable words
that don't have final consonants.

830
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,905
-Go!
-Hold on.

831
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:03,738
FAILED IN GUESSING THE CATEGORY

832
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:05,105
-Start.
-Ganadara.

833
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:06,938
Sorry? That's not a word.

834
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:07,938
THE WRONG GUESSER'S TURN

835
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,005
Mona Lisa.

836
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:11,838
-Is that a word?
-IRIVER.

837
00:34:11,905 --> 00:34:13,638
-What?
-IRIVER.

838
00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:15,138
Their business is still doing well.

839
00:34:15,204 --> 00:34:16,305
Mozart.

840
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:18,704
-I'm out.
-Well done.

841
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:22,871
Mona Lisa, IRIVER, Mozart, aspen tree.

842
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:24,171
HE'S EXPANDING TO TREES NOW

843
00:34:24,238 --> 00:34:28,038
Mona Lisa, IRIVER, Mozart, aspen tree,

844
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:29,371
spiny tree.

845
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:30,505
WAY TO KEEP IT GOING

846
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:31,471
Mozart.

847
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:33,338
THEY HAVE HALF THE TIME LIMIT

848
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,105
Spiny tree, aspen tree…

849
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:37,505
HE'S MISSING MONA LISA

850
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:39,671
-Move if you don't know.
-What was it?

851
00:34:39,738 --> 00:34:40,571
Go!

852
00:34:40,638 --> 00:34:42,338
Mona Lisa. Wait, I don't remember.

853
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:46,605
Mona Lisa, IRIVER,
spiny tree, aspen tree, Mozart.

854
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:49,171
Two more.

855
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:50,971
Princess tree.

856
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:52,671
Incorrect. That has a final consonant.

857
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:55,038
SU-GEUN GOES INSTEAD OF KYUHYUN

858
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:56,371
Mozart…

859
00:34:57,038 --> 00:34:57,971
IRIVER.

860
00:34:58,038 --> 00:35:00,538
Spiny tree, aspen tree, IRIVER.

861
00:35:01,138 --> 00:35:03,971
-What's the other one?
-Mona Lisa.

862
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:05,838
Norway.

863
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,671
-Five, four, three, two…
-You have to finish it.

864
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:12,038
-One.
-Iwa--

865
00:35:12,105 --> 00:35:13,038
I'm sorry?

866
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:14,205
I want to pee.

867
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:15,538
-Incorrect!
-Gosh.

868
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:17,538
-Too bad.
-Shoot.

869
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:19,305
SUNFLOWER, COSMOS, ETC

870
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:22,771
-There was also Nairobi.
-You know, that was hilarious.

871
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:24,438
-How about a bonus round?
-We did well.

872
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:25,338
-Yes.
-A bonus round?

873
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:27,771
BONUS ROUND FOR A PIECE

874
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:30,371
-I want that wine.
-I'll give you the keyword first.

875
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:33,105
-The keyword is five.
-Huddle up.

876
00:35:33,638 --> 00:35:34,871
BACK TO THE STRATEGY MEETING

877
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:36,571
What five-syllable words
don't have final consonants?

878
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:37,871
-There's no such thing.
-No.

879
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:39,405
I don't think that's it.

880
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,605
DISCUSSING SILENTLY SO NOBODY CAN HEAR

881
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,538
-Names of countries.
-Yes, names of countries.

882
00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:45,438
-Austria.
-Argentina.

883
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:47,138
Austria, Croatia.

884
00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:49,138
-Nigeria.
-Indonesia.

885
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:50,538
THEY ALSO HOLD A STRATEGY MEETING

886
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:51,705
-Okay.
-Let's do it.

887
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:53,571
LAUGHS

888
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:55,038
Should we begin?

889
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:56,005
POPPING THE CORK ALREADY

890
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,071
Please.

891
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:58,238
All right.

892
00:35:58,305 --> 00:35:59,538
-Five.
-Five.

893
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:03,871
Name seven words that end with O.

894
00:36:03,938 --> 00:36:06,138
-Words that end with O?
-I'll go first.

895
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,438
Words that end with O?

896
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:08,871
Radio, audio.

897
00:36:08,938 --> 00:36:09,871
Radio and audio?

898
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:11,871
Radio, audio, and Oreo.

899
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:13,771
You go ahead.

900
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,471
Radio, audio, Oreo, photo, bingo…

901
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:20,171
-No celebrity names, right?
-You can.

902
00:36:20,238 --> 00:36:21,471
Suo!

903
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:23,305
That's Suho.

904
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:24,205
Wait, I got it!

905
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:25,638
Oh Ji-o!

906
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:26,805
-It's Ji-ho!
-That's Ji-ho.

907
00:36:26,871 --> 00:36:27,838
He's Ji-ho?

908
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:30,638
Is it really "ho"? Did he change his name?

909
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:32,571
HE DID NOT

910
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:33,671
You have 20 seconds.

911
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:36,205
-I can't think of anything.
-EXO!

912
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:38,138
-That's pronounced "so."
-Is it?

913
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:39,771
It's pronounced "so" in Korean.

914
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:41,638
-You need to stop him.
-Ten seconds.

915
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:43,605
-I'm out.
-There's nothing else.

916
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:47,671
-Five, four, three, two, one.
-Try one and hand it over.

917
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:48,705
Kao!

918
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:49,671
-Incorrect!
-Why?

919
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:51,371
LET'S USE STANDARD WORDS

920
00:36:51,438 --> 00:36:52,838
Good effort, guys.

921
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,705
An individual match?

922
00:36:56,771 --> 00:36:58,171
-Individual?
-Yes, let's do that.

923
00:36:58,238 --> 00:36:59,738
Name seven of them.

924
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:00,638
INDIVIDUAL ROUND FOR WINGS

925
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:02,838
Name three-syllable snacks.

926
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:04,905
-Shout "I know" and come forward.
-Three syllables?

927
00:37:04,971 --> 00:37:07,071
You can also name ice cream brands.

928
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:08,905
-I'll go!
-Go ahead.

929
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:10,905
-Matdongsan!
-Matdongsan.

930
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:12,638
-Oreo!
-Oreo.

931
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:15,238
-Three, two, one.
-Incorrect!

932
00:37:15,305 --> 00:37:19,871
Matdongsan, Oreo,
Goraebab, Shrimp Crackers,

933
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,405
Onion Rings, Buttering.

934
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:25,771
-Three, two, one.
-No!

935
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:27,638
Damn it! I gave away the answers!

936
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:28,538
FURIOUS

937
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:31,938
Buttering, Onion Rings,
Oreo, Ah-mat-na Bar,

938
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:36,205
-BaBamBar, Sabre, and Matdongsan!
-Correct!

939
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:38,371
I forgot about ice creams.

940
00:37:38,438 --> 00:37:40,238
-Ice creams aren't fair.
-Right.

941
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:41,971
That's why it's worse to go first.

942
00:37:42,038 --> 00:37:43,905
-We were only thinking of snacks.
-Right.

943
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,771
-He's a cheater.
-Stop filming.

944
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:47,538
REFUSING TO BE FILMED

945
00:37:48,105 --> 00:37:50,405
THRILLED

946
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:52,205
I'll give it a try.

947
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,171
ENJOYS IT ALL BY HIMSELF

948
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,071
I said I was craving yangnyeom chicken.

949
00:37:55,138 --> 00:37:56,505
Try it. You won it.

950
00:37:56,571 --> 00:37:58,771
But Kyuhyun won fair and square.

951
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:00,138
-He didn't use ours.
-He didn't.

952
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:02,338
-He came up with all the answers.
-Right.

953
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,771
It smells good. Is it French?

954
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:06,405
AND WHITE WINE TO GO WITH IT

955
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:09,171
They go so well together.
It's the best pairing.

956
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:10,605
That was really fun, though.

957
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:11,905
-Good work.
-Good job.

958
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:14,271
THEY FINISH THEIR DELICIOUS DINNER

959
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:16,938
What's tomorrow?

960
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:20,205
Will there be a lot of walking?

961
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:23,638
THE THREE IDIOTS WILL BE HEADING
TO THE SAFARI TOMORROW

962
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:25,305
You might have to walk for a while.

963
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:27,705
-They have large grasslands.
-Right.

964
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:29,571
Are we playing games on grass?

965
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:31,005
THE SAME OLD ROUTINE

966
00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:33,005
There are venomous snakes.

967
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:34,938
A new type of game.

968
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:37,238
Roar, Don't Get Bitten!

969
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:40,371
CREATIVITY OF A FORMER
RECREATION INSTRUCTOR

970
00:38:40,438 --> 00:38:43,271
"Guys, try not to get bitten
for five minutes."

971
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:47,671
-And we'll be blindfolded.
-Blindfolded.

972
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:49,071
LAUGHS

973
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:51,038
The tiger and the lion
will also be blindfolded.

974
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,805
When the tiger comes near me,
I'll say, "I'm a tiger cub."

975
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:57,805
THEY MUST APPEAL TO MATERNAL INSTINCT
IN THIS NEW GAME

976
00:38:57,871 --> 00:38:59,738
-"I'm a tiger cub."
-"I'm a tiger cub."

977
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:00,905
"I'm a cheetah cub."

978
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:03,138
-A cheetah will bite you right away.
-Oh, really?

979
00:39:03,205 --> 00:39:06,238
HOWEVER, SOMETHING AS GRIM AS HIS JOKE

980
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:09,171
AWAITS THEM

981
00:39:09,238 --> 00:39:13,138
-This is our type of room.
-It's so fancy.

982
00:39:13,205 --> 00:39:14,505
-It's too fancy.
-Go on in.

983
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:17,505
-Will we be blindfolded?
-What are we doing?

984
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:20,005
What? Why did they cover it up?

985
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:22,871
-I guess someone will pop out.
-I guess so.

986
00:39:23,638 --> 00:39:24,838
GET BACK IN THERE!

987
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:26,205
Just don't show any interest.

988
00:39:26,271 --> 00:39:28,638
EUN JI-WON: FULL OF FEAR,
SUSPICION, AND ANGER

989
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:31,505
We're moving tomorrow.
I'll tell you the itinerary first.

990
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:36,138
We're heading out
to the safari tomorrow to see giraffes.

991
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:40,271
-Finally, we're going.
-So you can pack your stuff tonight.

992
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:43,005
-In the morning--
-I don't think I can pack tonight.

993
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:44,205
-Why not?
-Why?

994
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:47,971
-I have to wash up and get changed.
-Since you have to wash?

995
00:39:48,038 --> 00:39:49,771
Stop washing. It doesn't even show.

996
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:50,705
What are you washing?

997
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:52,271
-What is he washing?
-I mean…

998
00:39:52,338 --> 00:39:54,305
-Everywhere but your face?
-He focuses on his body.

999
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:57,505
What's the point of washing?
The lions will chew us up on the safari.

1000
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:03,438
At 7:30 a.m.,
you can have breakfast if you want.

1001
00:40:03,505 --> 00:40:05,805
We leave this hotel at 8:30 a.m.

1002
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:06,705
It's a must.

1003
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,371
We're taking a light aircraft
to get to the safari.

1004
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:13,105
So we need to eat breakfast
before we leave.

1005
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:15,105
But it's not so fun
to have all of you eat.

1006
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:16,838
It's a Breakfast Bet.

1007
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:18,805
BREAKFAST BET

1008
00:40:18,871 --> 00:40:21,538
The African breakfast
that the hotel provides

1009
00:40:21,605 --> 00:40:23,505
-needs to be introduced somehow.
-I'm curious.

1010
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:25,605
-Someone has to.
-African breakfast?

1011
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:26,805
That makes me curious.

1012
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:30,605
We'll play a little game,
and the winner gets the hotel breakfast.

1013
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:32,371
THE WINNER GETS THE HOTEL BREAKFAST

1014
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:35,771
The staff seem to be in good condition.
You must have enjoyed the breakfast.

1015
00:40:36,705 --> 00:40:38,738
THE THREE IDIOTS HAVE BEEN WONDERING

1016
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:43,105
WHAT THE PRODUCTION CREW LIKED SO MUCH

1017
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:47,905
A LUXURIOUS LOCAL-STYLE
HOTEL BREAKFAST BUFFET

1018
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:50,771
-And the second place?
-The second place gets Tanya's breakfast.

1019
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:52,038
-All right!
-That's nice.

1020
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:53,405
-That's not so bad.
-I like that.

1021
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:56,538
2ND PLACE, TANYA'S SMOCHA

1022
00:40:56,605 --> 00:40:59,271
ONCE YOU'VE HAD IT, YOU CAN'T STAY AWAY

1023
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:02,671
-The third place gets…
-Does third place get a scolding?

1024
00:41:02,738 --> 00:41:04,271
THE SECRET TO LONGEVITY

1025
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:05,305
That sounds tasty.

1026
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:07,971
The third place
will get the fruit bought the other day.

1027
00:41:08,038 --> 00:41:10,605
-We can't throw that away.
-We have to finish them.

1028
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:13,505
3RD PLACE, THE LEFTOVER FRUIT

1029
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,471
May I reveal the game now?

1030
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:17,938
The Zombie Game
has returned after a long time.

1031
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:20,505
That's why you covered all the corners.

1032
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:23,771
SAFETY FIRST

1033
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:25,705
To prevent us from smashing our heads.

1034
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:27,871
MOVED BY THE PRODUCTION CREW'S
CONSIDERATION

1035
00:41:28,438 --> 00:41:31,305
A SAFE GAME TO PLAY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

1036
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:33,038
ZOMBIE GAME

1037
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:35,705
THE BLINDFOLDED ZOMBIE
INFECTS HUMANS BY BITING THEM

1038
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:38,271
HUMANS LOSE IF THEY SHOUT "I SURRENDER"

1039
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:39,338
I SURRENDER!

1040
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:42,338
Do you know that I still have the scar
from the Zombie Game?

1041
00:41:42,971 --> 00:41:44,805
This tooth mark.

1042
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:47,071
-But that's…
-Director Nah.

1043
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,338
-I still have this tooth mark.
-Are you serious?

1044
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,705
Take a look, you idiot.

1045
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:53,438
-This tooth mark.
-It's still there?

1046
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:55,638
LAUGHS

1047
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:57,205
I still have that scar!

1048
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:00,838
I had already said, "I surrender,"
and he kept biting me.

1049
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:03,571
-He actually has it!
-This is a scar of glory.

1050
00:42:03,638 --> 00:42:07,438
When I went back home,
it started turning black.

1051
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:09,405
I thought I was turning into a zombie.

1052
00:42:11,171 --> 00:42:12,871
Seriously, you guys.

1053
00:42:12,938 --> 00:42:15,071
I still have this scar on me.

1054
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:18,405
I'll make sure to leave a mark
on either of them tonight.

1055
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:20,271
I'll bite it off and spit it out.

1056
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,638
You think I'll just stand there?

1057
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,438
Yes, bite me back.

1058
00:42:23,505 --> 00:42:26,005
I've got nothing to lose.
I already have children and everything.

1059
00:42:28,471 --> 00:42:30,338
RULES

1060
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:31,538
What's the given area?

1061
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:34,038
-Within these lines.
-We'll say, "I'm staff," if you get near.

1062
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:35,305
And you can't go past that couch.

1063
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:38,171
There's a new rule
in the Zombie Game this time.

1064
00:42:38,238 --> 00:42:41,405
Two zombies will go after one human.

1065
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:44,238
-But the human is at a disadvantage.
-Exactly.

1066
00:42:44,305 --> 00:42:45,871
He could never survive.

1067
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,438
That's why we've added a new rule.

1068
00:42:48,505 --> 00:42:51,705
A shadow person will assist the humans.

1069
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:53,571
ZOMBIE GAME
2 ZOMBIES AND 1 HUMAN

1070
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:56,038
BUT THE HUMAN HAS A SHADOW

1071
00:42:56,105 --> 00:42:59,738
For instance, Su-geun is a human,
and you two are zombies.

1072
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:03,105
Then, Su-geun will pick one
from the three staff members

1073
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:05,805
to play the role of his shadow.

1074
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:08,838
-And?
-Then, there will be two humans.

1075
00:43:08,905 --> 00:43:10,471
It's like the Shadow Clone Technique.

1076
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:12,105
You make the shadow get bitten instead.

1077
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:16,005
THE SHADOW WILL DISTRACT THE ZOMBIES

1078
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:20,671
THE HUMAN WHO LASTS THE LONGEST WINS

1079
00:43:20,738 --> 00:43:23,438
As a zombie, you bit someone,
and they surrendered.

1080
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:25,905
But that may not be Su-geun.

1081
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:30,471
-Then, humans--
-No, a shadow can't feel pain.

1082
00:43:30,538 --> 00:43:31,471
Sorry?

1083
00:43:31,538 --> 00:43:33,138
-That's true.
-He can't surrender.

1084
00:43:33,205 --> 00:43:34,405
Can a shadow feel pain?

1085
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:35,805
CALM DOWN

1086
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:38,771
-I forgot to tell you an important rule.
-What is it?

1087
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:39,971
Bring them in.

1088
00:43:40,038 --> 00:43:40,938
What is it?

1089
00:43:41,005 --> 00:43:42,071
JINGLING

1090
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:45,371
-Bells?
-Humans will wear bells on their ankles.

1091
00:43:45,438 --> 00:43:47,305
-That's good.
-But the zombies can't tell

1092
00:43:47,371 --> 00:43:50,071
whether those bells are
on a human or a shadow.

1093
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:52,071
They both wear bells.

1094
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:53,671
The human and the shadow? Okay.

1095
00:43:53,738 --> 00:43:55,071
THE HUMAN AND THE SHADOW WEAR BELLS

1096
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:56,505
Who are the shadow candidates?

1097
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:58,038
-Do you want to see them?
-Yes.

1098
00:43:58,105 --> 00:43:59,438
Shadows, please stand up.

1099
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:02,171
-We picked three who had similar builds.
-I knew it.

1100
00:44:02,238 --> 00:44:04,138
Three people with similar body types.

1101
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:07,805
As you know, Jung Myeong-jae
is our camera rig director.

1102
00:44:07,871 --> 00:44:09,838
He's worked with us for a very long time.

1103
00:44:09,905 --> 00:44:11,605
Yes, he has.

1104
00:44:12,105 --> 00:44:14,005
And Moon Jun-yeong here

1105
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:17,238
is a producer in charge of producing
TV dramas and variety shows

1106
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:18,838
at Egg is Coming.

1107
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:20,705
OBSERVING HIM

1108
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:24,938
And Kim Ju-han
is in charge of our finances.

1109
00:44:25,005 --> 00:44:26,838
-Budgets?
-Yes, general affairs.

1110
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:29,938
This may sound rude,
but he looks very disloyal.

1111
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:32,171
I mean…

1112
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:35,171
People who handle money tend to be cold.

1113
00:44:35,238 --> 00:44:37,838
And if he's about to get bitten,
he'll push you instead.

1114
00:44:37,905 --> 00:44:39,538
SELECT YOUR SHADOW

1115
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:41,038
Kyuhyun, you go first
since you're the youngest.

1116
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:42,438
-Me first?
-Yes.

1117
00:44:43,038 --> 00:44:45,371
I'm going to try
to approach this logically.

1118
00:44:45,438 --> 00:44:48,005
-The one in the middle.
-Producer Moon Jun-yeong.

1119
00:44:48,071 --> 00:44:49,805
First of all, he's wearing arm coolers.

1120
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:51,971
Either way, that's still wearing an item.

1121
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:53,371
-He came prepared?
-Yes.

1122
00:44:53,438 --> 00:44:57,071
In fact, from what I know,
he's the strongest among these three.

1123
00:44:57,871 --> 00:44:59,605
He's capable of throwing a zombie.

1124
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:01,371
But strength has nothing to do with it.

1125
00:45:01,438 --> 00:45:03,405
Because humans
aren't allowed to hit zombies.

1126
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:04,905
Well, they can't.

1127
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:07,738
Your teeth could snag on his vest
and get knocked out when he shakes.

1128
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:08,971
I WON'T HURT YOU

1129
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:10,071
Ji-won.

1130
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:13,305
I'll go with the person
covering our blind spots.

1131
00:45:13,371 --> 00:45:14,771
The rigging director.

1132
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:16,138
The rigging director.

1133
00:45:16,205 --> 00:45:17,838
-You're picking Myeong-jae?
-Yes.

1134
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:21,005
You see,
I said that he was the least loyal.

1135
00:45:22,238 --> 00:45:24,305
CLASSIC ORIGIN STORY OF A VILLAIN

1136
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:27,271
TEAM STATUS: TEAM SU-GEUN,
TEAM JI-WON, AND TEAM KYUHYUN

1137
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:30,071
SU-GEUN'S ROUND
ZOMBIES VS HUMAN, SHADOW

1138
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:31,505
All right.

1139
00:45:31,571 --> 00:45:34,505
It's a small arena,
so be careful not to get hurt.

1140
00:45:35,171 --> 00:45:36,505
Get ready.

1141
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:39,938
Get set. Go.

1142
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:42,138
THE ZOMBIES SPIN IN HARMONY

1143
00:45:44,138 --> 00:45:45,138
SUFFERING

1144
00:45:45,205 --> 00:45:46,038
GROANING

1145
00:45:48,405 --> 00:45:51,338
ZOMBIES AREN'T USED TO GROUP ACTIVITIES

1146
00:45:51,405 --> 00:45:53,271
Wait, time-out.

1147
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:55,971
LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY

1148
00:45:56,038 --> 00:45:58,271
DID YOU BREAK YOUR HEAD?

1149
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:01,305
You can't be funny
from the get-go, seriously.

1150
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:03,971
How did we just…

1151
00:46:04,038 --> 00:46:04,871
DIZZY

1152
00:46:04,938 --> 00:46:07,138
RESTART

1153
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:09,938
-This feels wrong.
-You'll be face down on the couch.

1154
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:12,238
You can start when I say,
"Three, two, one."

1155
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,871
THE ZOMBIES HAVE LOST ALL INTELLIGENCE
DUE TO HEAD INJURY

1156
00:46:16,705 --> 00:46:18,571
This will be over quickly, though.

1157
00:46:19,138 --> 00:46:20,738
Right? There's no way to win this.

1158
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:22,938
Oh, no.

1159
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:25,338
The bell is too loud.

1160
00:46:25,405 --> 00:46:27,705
I hope one of them bites
where the pain relief patch is.

1161
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:29,771
HIS TARGET

1162
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:31,905
I'll stick it right here when they come.

1163
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:36,905
FULLY PREPARED

1164
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:38,405
You can start.

1165
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:40,171
THE ZOMBIES ARE READY AS WELL

1166
00:46:40,738 --> 00:46:45,871
Okay. Three, two, one. Start.

1167
00:46:46,605 --> 00:46:48,005
…one. Start.

1168
00:46:49,238 --> 00:46:52,371
THE SHADOW LURES
THE ZOMBIES WITH HIS BELLS

1169
00:46:52,438 --> 00:46:53,905
-Who's that? Ji-won?
-It's me.

1170
00:46:53,971 --> 00:46:57,771
SU-GEUN HIDES BEHIND THE ZOMBIES

1171
00:46:58,905 --> 00:47:00,438
-Who's that? Ji-won?
-It's me.

1172
00:47:01,138 --> 00:47:02,038
What? He's behind me.

1173
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:04,505
HIS FOOT GOT STUCK

1174
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:06,438
This idiot is behind me.

1175
00:47:06,505 --> 00:47:09,405
HIS LANGUAGE HAS BECOME AS WILD AS HIMSELF

1176
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:11,805
-It's behind me.
-Here he is.

1177
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,705
LURES THEM

1178
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:14,605
In front of you.

1179
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,105
-That's not him.
-It's me.

1180
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:17,371
Spread out.

1181
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:18,838
He's lasting longer than I thought.

1182
00:47:18,905 --> 00:47:19,971
It's me.

1183
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:22,538
THE HUMAN GETS A BREATHER

1184
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:23,638
What's this?

1185
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:25,671
The shadow is doing better than expected.

1186
00:47:25,738 --> 00:47:26,805
What's this?

1187
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:28,605
The shadow is doing better than expected.

1188
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:30,205
ZOMBIE CHO SUDDENLY COMES AFTER HIM

1189
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:34,338
I heard you, idiot. You're dead.

1190
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:37,005
EXPLOSIVE SITUATION

1191
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:38,538
There you are!

1192
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,338
I heard you, idiot. You're dead.

1193
00:47:40,405 --> 00:47:41,705
THE SHADOW MAKES A NOBLE SACRIFICE

1194
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:42,771
-Here he is.
-You caught him?

1195
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:43,838
This is him.

1196
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:46,105
I heard you, idiot. You're dead.

1197
00:47:46,805 --> 00:47:50,171
BITE ME INSTEAD

1198
00:47:50,238 --> 00:47:51,071
You're dead.

1199
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:52,205
Here he is!

1200
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,005
-You caught him?
-This is it.

1201
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:55,671
BITES

1202
00:47:55,738 --> 00:47:57,638
SCREAMS

1203
00:47:58,238 --> 00:47:59,238
The shadow…

1204
00:47:59,305 --> 00:48:01,838
THE CRUEL PRICE OF SACRIFICE

1205
00:48:01,905 --> 00:48:03,605
OH, MY GOSH

1206
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:05,205
FLAILS

1207
00:48:05,671 --> 00:48:06,771
FLAILS

1208
00:48:07,805 --> 00:48:10,605
THE ZOMBIES DELIGHT
IN THE FRESHNESS OF LIVE PREY

1209
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:12,138
I surrender.

1210
00:48:12,205 --> 00:48:14,271
THE SHADOW IS OUT

1211
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:16,071
He held out really well, though.

1212
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:18,205
-I bit really hard.
-Seriously.

1213
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,338
That was impressive.

1214
00:48:19,405 --> 00:48:20,438
YOU'RE THE BEST

1215
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:21,971
A RELIABLE STATURE

1216
00:48:22,038 --> 00:48:23,671
-Where am I, by the way?
-Where am I?

1217
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:25,238
Have we resumed?

1218
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:28,005
-Time keeps ticking.
-Then, why don't I hear the bell?

1219
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:33,105
ZOMBIE CHO IS CERTAIN THAT HE'S HIDING

1220
00:48:33,738 --> 00:48:35,271
ISN'T HE HERE?

1221
00:48:36,505 --> 00:48:37,371
JINGLES

1222
00:48:37,438 --> 00:48:39,105
Wait, he's here.

1223
00:48:39,871 --> 00:48:41,438
Wait, he's here.

1224
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:47,805
I CAUGHT YOU NOW

1225
00:48:48,705 --> 00:48:50,771
GRINNING

1226
00:48:51,705 --> 00:48:52,971
MEALTIME FULL OF SMILES

1227
00:48:53,038 --> 00:48:54,338
Please.

1228
00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:55,538
Did you catch him?

1229
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:57,238
Did you?

1230
00:48:57,305 --> 00:48:58,271
LOOKING FOR THE FEAST

1231
00:48:58,971 --> 00:48:59,971
You got him?

1232
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:01,438
Here he is.

1233
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:02,838
Here.

1234
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:04,605
HE DESPERATELY HANGS ON

1235
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:06,238
BITES

1236
00:49:06,305 --> 00:49:07,138
BITING HARD

1237
00:49:07,205 --> 00:49:08,538
SCREAMING

1238
00:49:09,438 --> 00:49:11,871
BON APPÉTIT

1239
00:49:12,938 --> 00:49:14,238
I surrender!

1240
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:17,038
SU-GEUN IS OUT

1241
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:19,305
-Let me see. Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1242
00:49:19,371 --> 00:49:20,938
He never surrenders.

1243
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:22,871
I got bitten here and here.

1244
00:49:22,938 --> 00:49:25,038
He kept avoiding the pain relief patch.

1245
00:49:25,105 --> 00:49:26,505
ZOMBIE CHO HAS EXCELLENT HUNTING SKILLS

1246
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:27,705
He managed to avoid it.

1247
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:29,605
Why am I so out of breath?

1248
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:32,038
It feels different from last time.

1249
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:33,305
I'm so winded.

1250
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:36,105
KYUHYUN'S ROUND
ZOMBIES VS HUMAN, SHADOW

1251
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:38,971
Are you okay with biting him
when he's wearing that?

1252
00:49:39,038 --> 00:49:41,471
Just take off the watch.
We'll break a tooth.

1253
00:49:41,538 --> 00:49:44,271
FUN FACT: ZOMBIE'S TEETH
ARE WEAKER THAN A WATCH

1254
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:47,405
But he's wearing long sleeves.

1255
00:49:47,471 --> 00:49:50,705
They're also wearing long sleeves.
We should all be wearing short sleeves.

1256
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:52,005
Why did you wear short sleeves?

1257
00:49:52,071 --> 00:49:55,105
-But it's the Zombie Game.
-Well, I can roll them up.

1258
00:49:55,171 --> 00:49:56,505
No, I'll bite your legs.

1259
00:49:57,371 --> 00:50:00,071
I'm going after your toes.

1260
00:50:00,138 --> 00:50:01,838
You can live without a toe, right?

1261
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:04,905
There's clothing,
so it's pointless to bite you there.

1262
00:50:04,971 --> 00:50:05,905
I've got to bite the foot.

1263
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:07,405
But I'll surrender
as soon as I get caught.

1264
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,605
-No.
-No.

1265
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:10,138
What do you mean "no"?

1266
00:50:10,205 --> 00:50:11,305
I should get to bite.

1267
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:12,971
No, I'm surrendering immediately.

1268
00:50:13,038 --> 00:50:14,638
I DON'T KNOW WHAT "SURRENDER" MEANS

1269
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:17,805
You're a good actor.

1270
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:21,305
THE MIDDLE-AGED ZOMBIES GET READY TO GO

1271
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:22,638
GIBBERISH

1272
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:23,638
Get ready.

1273
00:50:23,705 --> 00:50:26,171
THE NEWLY TURNED ZOMBIE BRIMS WITH ENERGY

1274
00:50:26,238 --> 00:50:27,271
GROANS

1275
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:30,671
Zombies, are you ready?

1276
00:50:31,438 --> 00:50:32,405
PLANNING TO HIDE IN A CORNER

1277
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:34,005
I'll count three seconds.

1278
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:37,771
Three, two, one. Start.

1279
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:38,905
START

1280
00:50:38,971 --> 00:50:39,838
…one. Start.

1281
00:50:39,905 --> 00:50:41,471
CHAOS

1282
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,371
WADDLES

1283
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:43,671
ZOMBIE LANGUAGE

1284
00:50:43,738 --> 00:50:45,805
THE ZOMBIES HAVE DEVELOPED
THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AFTER ONE ROUND

1285
00:50:45,871 --> 00:50:47,471
Listen to the sound.

1286
00:50:47,538 --> 00:50:49,105
-Hold my hand.
-Listen.

1287
00:50:49,771 --> 00:50:51,305
-Hold my hand.
-Hold your hand?

1288
00:50:51,371 --> 00:50:52,438
Good.

1289
00:50:52,505 --> 00:50:53,805
Spread out.

1290
00:50:55,105 --> 00:50:57,571
ZOMBIES CONVERSING
IN AN ODDLY FAMILIAR LANGUAGE

1291
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:00,171
GO THIS WAY

1292
00:51:01,638 --> 00:51:03,471
GO THAT WAY

1293
00:51:03,871 --> 00:51:07,338
THE HUMAN AND THE SHADOW
CAN'T SEEM TO COMMUNICATE AT ALL

1294
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:10,305
THEY'RE SLOWLY GETTING CORNERED

1295
00:51:11,505 --> 00:51:13,805
-I'm staff.
-I bumped my heel into something.

1296
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,405
-It's me.
-My heel hurts.

1297
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:19,305
THE HUMAN WHO GAVE UP ON COMMUNICATING

1298
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,405
ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE

1299
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,305
JINGLES

1300
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,205
That way.

1301
00:51:23,771 --> 00:51:25,971
I HEARD THE BELL

1302
00:51:26,038 --> 00:51:27,571
THERE IS A HUMAN

1303
00:51:28,438 --> 00:51:29,738
FORTUNATELY, HE ESCAPES

1304
00:51:29,805 --> 00:51:31,171
I'm staff.

1305
00:51:33,305 --> 00:51:34,338
THE SHADOW TRIED TO FOLLOW

1306
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:35,771
Here he is! I caught him!

1307
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:36,705
I'm staff.

1308
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:39,205
No, you're not. You're not a staff member.

1309
00:51:39,271 --> 00:51:40,171
Wait!

1310
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:41,171
PRETENDED TO BE STAFF OUT OF FEAR

1311
00:51:41,238 --> 00:51:43,738
WELL DONE, SHADOW

1312
00:51:44,238 --> 00:51:45,771
BUT

1313
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:46,671
A QUICK TURN

1314
00:51:46,738 --> 00:51:48,371
Here! I heard him.

1315
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:50,938
Here! I heard him.

1316
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:52,771
SMALL ZOMBIE HAS SHARP INSTINCTS

1317
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:54,671
Here! I heard him.

1318
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:55,638
JINGLING

1319
00:51:55,705 --> 00:51:56,638
Where?

1320
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:57,938
THE SHADOW LURES THE ZOMBIES AWAY

1321
00:51:58,005 --> 00:51:59,005
I got him!

1322
00:51:59,071 --> 00:52:00,171
-I caught him.
-Staff--

1323
00:52:00,238 --> 00:52:01,738
-Staff, my ass.
-What?

1324
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:03,671
-Staff--
-Staff, my ass.

1325
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:05,771
This punk is lying.

1326
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:07,871
Stop.

1327
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:08,805
DISPLEASED

1328
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:09,938
What a bullshit.

1329
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,338
YOU'RE LYING

1330
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:14,105
HE'S SO DUMBFOUNDED
THAT HE BITES HIS OWN ARM

1331
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:15,238
Staff--

1332
00:52:16,205 --> 00:52:18,105
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT WITH THIS POSITION

1333
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:19,038
SCREAMS

1334
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:20,171
Why are you biting me?

1335
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:21,071
BITES

1336
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,071
I guess you can't bite him.

1337
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:24,105
But I just bit him!
He keeps saying he's staff!

1338
00:52:24,171 --> 00:52:25,605
POWER DIFFERENCE THAT TRANSCENDS SPECIES

1339
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:28,171
A human isn't supposed to bite back.

1340
00:52:28,238 --> 00:52:30,138
-Help me with him.
-Who's this?

1341
00:52:30,205 --> 00:52:31,805
FINALLY RESCUED BY HIS OWN KIND

1342
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,071
He ran away.

1343
00:52:33,138 --> 00:52:33,971
Oh, that's salty.

1344
00:52:34,638 --> 00:52:35,638
He's still in?

1345
00:52:35,705 --> 00:52:36,771
It's so salty.

1346
00:52:37,305 --> 00:52:39,071
He's so sweaty that it's salty.

1347
00:52:39,138 --> 00:52:40,671
The shadow endured the bite.

1348
00:52:41,905 --> 00:52:43,438
Now I know where he is.

1349
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:45,671
-What?
-I'm staff.

1350
00:52:45,738 --> 00:52:46,938
What a bullshit.

1351
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:48,438
DO NOT LIE

1352
00:52:48,505 --> 00:52:50,005
-I'm your shadow.
-Oh, my shadow.

1353
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:51,171
SCREAMS

1354
00:52:51,238 --> 00:52:52,571
Oh, my love.

1355
00:52:53,205 --> 00:52:54,305
"My love."

1356
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,971
THE SHADOW IS IN DANGER AGAIN

1357
00:52:59,538 --> 00:53:01,971
I'm staff.

1358
00:53:02,038 --> 00:53:03,705
There can't be a staff member here.

1359
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:05,838
Come here! Su-geun, I got him!

1360
00:53:05,905 --> 00:53:06,805
FIGHTS BACK

1361
00:53:06,871 --> 00:53:09,038
Why are you biting me? The staff bit me!

1362
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:10,338
Bite him.

1363
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:13,371
HIS ALLY APPROACHES

1364
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:14,371
You idiot, come here.

1365
00:53:14,605 --> 00:53:15,905
MEALTIME

1366
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:17,171
DOCUMENTARY: THE ZOMBIE FEAST

1367
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:18,571
HUNGRY ZOMBIES
WHO'VE SUCCEEDED IN THEIR HUNT

1368
00:53:18,638 --> 00:53:19,805
I surrender!

1369
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,771
I surrender!

1370
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:24,271
THEY DON'T EASILY LET GO OF THEIR PREY

1371
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:26,205
THE SMALLER ONE HAS FINISHED ITS MEAL

1372
00:53:26,271 --> 00:53:27,205
Stop it.

1373
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:30,171
THIS ONE'S PERSISTENT

1374
00:53:30,238 --> 00:53:32,305
THE SHADOW IS OUT

1375
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:34,338
-What's this?
-I'm a zombie.

1376
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:35,938
-I'm exhausted.
-Hold my hand.

1377
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:37,571
-Time's ticking.
-What?

1378
00:53:37,638 --> 00:53:39,405
-Time's ticking.
-I can't go on.

1379
00:53:39,471 --> 00:53:40,505
I'll find him.

1380
00:53:40,571 --> 00:53:43,338
THE SMALL ZOMBIE HUNTS ALONE IN THE END

1381
00:53:47,705 --> 00:53:51,371
WITHOUT THE SHADOW,
THE BELL SOUND GIVES HIM AWAY

1382
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:52,771
Here he is.

1383
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:55,971
THE BELL SOUND GETS
ZOMBIE EUN HUNTING AGAIN

1384
00:53:56,771 --> 00:53:59,705
HE'S NOT MUCH HELP, THOUGH

1385
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:03,871
AND THERE'S ONE THING
THE HUMAN HAS REALIZED

1386
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:06,871
THEY CAN'T CATCH HIM IF HE KEEPS RUNNING

1387
00:54:07,438 --> 00:54:08,271
STARTLED

1388
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:09,805
-Here he is.
-No, he's here.

1389
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,538
THE MIDDLE-AGED ZOMBIES CAN'T KEEP UP

1390
00:54:13,871 --> 00:54:15,538
-He's gone mad.
-He's here!

1391
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:16,605
I got you now.

1392
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:18,071
SMALL ZOMBIE ENRAGED BY HUMAN'S TAUNTING

1393
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:19,671
-He's gone mad.
-He's here!

1394
00:54:19,738 --> 00:54:21,171
I GOT YOU

1395
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:22,438
I got you, idiot.

1396
00:54:22,505 --> 00:54:24,105
CAPTURED

1397
00:54:24,171 --> 00:54:25,971
I surrender!

1398
00:54:26,038 --> 00:54:27,505
SHOUTS SURRENDER BEFORE THINGS GET UGLY

1399
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:28,771
Not so fast.

1400
00:54:29,938 --> 00:54:31,005
I surrender!

1401
00:54:33,538 --> 00:54:34,771
I surrender!

1402
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:35,738
EAT UP, ZOMBIE

1403
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:37,738
I surrender!

1404
00:54:37,805 --> 00:54:40,005
I already surrendered! Stop it!

1405
00:54:40,071 --> 00:54:41,871
SCREW THAT, IT'S TIME FOR A FOOD TOUR

1406
00:54:41,938 --> 00:54:43,805
Stop it, damn it!

1407
00:54:43,871 --> 00:54:44,971
SCREAMS

1408
00:54:46,005 --> 00:54:47,305
I surrender!

1409
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,105
KYUHYUN IS OUT

1410
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:52,071
Great work, everyone.

1411
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:55,638
But is this shadow an android?

1412
00:54:55,705 --> 00:54:59,138
Why do you keep biting
when he said he was a staff member?

1413
00:54:59,205 --> 00:55:01,705
And what's ridiculous is,
he claimed to be staff over there.

1414
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:02,838
THERE

1415
00:55:02,905 --> 00:55:04,805
He claimed to be staff,
but I kept hearing the bell.

1416
00:55:05,771 --> 00:55:08,571
-Ji-won, are you digested now?
-Can I get a sip of water?

1417
00:55:09,071 --> 00:55:11,005
His face went pale.

1418
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:13,805
JI-WON'S ROUND
ZOMBIES VS HUMAN, SHADOW

1419
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:18,071
Jung Myeong-jae will be the shadow.

1420
00:55:18,705 --> 00:55:20,705
Myeong-jae, which part of your body
is in the worst shape?

1421
00:55:22,571 --> 00:55:23,771
WHY DO YOU ASK?

1422
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:25,238
I'll cut out that part for you.

1423
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:28,838
ZOMBIE ORTHOPEDICS

1424
00:55:29,605 --> 00:55:31,038
Where are you going to be?

1425
00:55:31,105 --> 00:55:32,305
-Me?
-Let's switch, then.

1426
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:35,105
Su-geun has transformed into a zombie.

1427
00:55:36,771 --> 00:55:38,038
All right, then.

1428
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:39,171
-Let's go.
-The Zombie Game…

1429
00:55:39,238 --> 00:55:40,371
GIBBERISH

1430
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:41,571
…will start now.

1431
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,271
Stay sharp.

1432
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:45,571
ZOMBIE LANGUAGE

1433
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:47,338
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

1434
00:55:47,405 --> 00:55:48,971
LET THE GAME BEGIN

1435
00:55:49,038 --> 00:55:50,171
ZOMBIES PREPARING FOR THE HUNT

1436
00:55:50,238 --> 00:55:51,971
Put your faces against the sofa.

1437
00:55:52,038 --> 00:55:54,538
This is so well-made, though.

1438
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:55,871
What is this noise?

1439
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:57,571
-What is that sound?
-What is that?

1440
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,305
CLUNKING

1441
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:04,905
HE UNDERESTIMATED HIS OWN SIZE

1442
00:56:04,971 --> 00:56:07,638
HE THINKS WE'RE DUMB

1443
00:56:08,305 --> 00:56:09,771
We haven't begun yet.

1444
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:11,671
I BITE WHEN I HEAR A NOISE

1445
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:14,038
LAUGHS

1446
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:16,105
LOSING IT

1447
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:19,971
Hey, at least have the courtesy
not to make any noises.

1448
00:56:20,038 --> 00:56:21,538
-You're crazy.
-But--

1449
00:56:21,605 --> 00:56:24,271
You should have told Myeong-jae
to go under it.

1450
00:56:24,338 --> 00:56:27,938
I was trying to get in here,
but I don't fit at all.

1451
00:56:28,005 --> 00:56:31,738
I was trying to squeeze in here
like a turtle, but it's too small.

1452
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,138
-Why don't I fit?
-Let's start.

1453
00:56:33,205 --> 00:56:35,171
-It's too small, you stupid.
-Geez.

1454
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:36,571
WASTED ALL HIS ENERGY

1455
00:56:37,138 --> 00:56:40,338
Three, two, one. Start.

1456
00:56:40,938 --> 00:56:42,405
…one. Start.

1457
00:56:43,205 --> 00:56:44,038
GRUNTS

1458
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:48,105
THE SMALL ZOMBIE CHARGES HEADFIRST

1459
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:51,305
MOVING SIDE TO SIDE, HE CORNERS THE HUMAN

1460
00:56:54,171 --> 00:56:55,805
JI-WON IS TRAPPED

1461
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:00,638
I GOT YOU!

1462
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:03,538
THE SHADOW USES HIS BODY TO BLOCK

1463
00:57:03,605 --> 00:57:05,105
-I'm caught.
-Hey.

1464
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:06,738
Don't gang up on me.

1465
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,738
I surrender!

1466
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:14,538
JI-WON IS OUT

1467
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:17,338
The human got taken out before the shadow.

1468
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:18,871
Kyuhyun caught me.

1469
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:20,571
I told you he was good.

1470
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:21,771
NATURAL TALENT

1471
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,038
Thanks so much for your help, shadows.

1472
00:57:24,105 --> 00:57:25,271
Good work, guys.

1473
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:26,238
You're the best.

1474
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:28,771
RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT

1475
00:57:28,838 --> 00:57:31,938
As I announced earlier,
first place gets the hotel breakfast.

1476
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:34,371
-Second place gets Tanya's.
-We're getting Tanya's food, at least.

1477
00:57:34,438 --> 00:57:36,638
Eating that for three days in a row
is a bit much, though.

1478
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:39,371
I like Tanya's food, but still…

1479
00:57:40,138 --> 00:57:41,138
Oh, man.

1480
00:57:42,505 --> 00:57:44,771
HE ATE IT ON HIS FIRST DAY IN KENYA

1481
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:48,038
AND HIS SECOND DAY

1482
00:57:48,671 --> 00:57:50,705
-You should give your final remarks.
-I should.

1483
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:53,338
Second place gets her food,
so it's okay if you're not in second.

1484
00:57:53,405 --> 00:57:56,005
I'll announce the winner first.

1485
00:57:56,071 --> 00:57:57,271
The hotel breakfast.

1486
00:57:57,338 --> 00:57:58,771
-Su-geun?
-It's either you or me.

1487
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:00,938
The winner lasted 3 minutes 13 seconds.

1488
00:58:01,005 --> 00:58:02,638
-It's Su-geun.
-I think it's you.

1489
00:58:02,705 --> 00:58:04,471
-It's Kyuhyun.
-No way.

1490
00:58:04,538 --> 00:58:05,605
I got caught faster than I thought.

1491
00:58:05,671 --> 00:58:07,405
-Congratulations, Kyuhyun.
-Seriously?

1492
00:58:07,471 --> 00:58:09,038
-I told you I was caught fast.
-Me?

1493
00:58:09,105 --> 00:58:10,538
You're getting Tanya's again.

1494
00:58:10,605 --> 00:58:12,738
The second place
is getting Tanya's breakfast.

1495
00:58:13,271 --> 00:58:14,705
Three days in a row.

1496
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:17,105
I'm eating it three days in a row.

1497
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:18,571
Seriously.

1498
00:58:18,638 --> 00:58:23,005
With 1 minute 46 seconds,
Su-geun wins Tanya's breakfast!

1499
00:58:23,071 --> 00:58:25,971
FINAL RESULTS
HOTEL, TANYA, FRUIT

1500
00:58:26,038 --> 00:58:27,171
Good work, everyone.

1501
00:58:27,238 --> 00:58:29,605
THE SPIT-SPLATTERED ZOMBIE GAME IS OVER

1502
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:33,871
THE BRIGHT NAIROBI MORNING RETURNS

1503
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:36,605
Oh, it smells amazing.

1504
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:40,505
ZOMBIE CHO IS HERE TO CLAIM
HIS FIRST-PLACE PRIZE

1505
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:44,005
THIS PLACE IS PACKED WITH DELICIOUS DISHES

1506
00:58:44,405 --> 00:58:48,371
IT'S THE HOTEL BREAKFAST BUFFET
THAT EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT

1507
00:58:49,105 --> 00:58:51,738
It's been so long since I've seen
such a great breakfast spread.

1508
00:58:51,805 --> 00:58:53,138
It's so nice.

1509
00:58:53,205 --> 00:58:55,771
KYUHYUN HAPPILY STRESSES OVER WHAT TO EAT

1510
00:58:56,938 --> 00:58:58,205
Some olives and that one.

1511
00:58:58,271 --> 00:59:00,105
I eat that all the time in Korea.

1512
00:59:00,171 --> 00:59:01,571
-Really?
-Yes, olives.

1513
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:05,605
-Do I eat it with cheese?
-Yes, it's good for our age.

1514
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:07,438
PICKING UP FOOD

1515
00:59:07,505 --> 00:59:08,905
Check out those veggies.

1516
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:09,805
DIRECTOR NAH EXCLAIMS

1517
00:59:09,871 --> 00:59:11,171
-Remember that from yesterday?
-The spinach?

1518
00:59:11,238 --> 00:59:12,971
Yes, I love spinach.

1519
00:59:13,038 --> 00:59:14,271
RECOMMENDING AND SUBTLY INSISTING

1520
00:59:14,338 --> 00:59:16,838
-They've got this as well.
-Our eating styles are so similar.

1521
00:59:16,905 --> 00:59:19,705
WHAT A COINCIDENCE

1522
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:22,538
THE SPARROW SITS DOWN

1523
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:26,438
DIRECTOR NAH LEAVES HIS PLATE
AND STEPS AWAY

1524
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:29,105
You should film them inside.
They seemed really busy.

1525
00:59:29,171 --> 00:59:30,505
Something fun is happening.

1526
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:33,638
THE CAMERA WON'T MOVE
EVEN AFTER HIS PERSUASION

1527
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:37,071
CRUNCHING

1528
00:59:37,138 --> 00:59:40,305
HE BLATANTLY DECIDES TO EAT IT STRAIGHT

1529
00:59:41,905 --> 00:59:42,938
EXCLAIMS

1530
00:59:43,005 --> 00:59:44,305
It's good.

1531
00:59:45,138 --> 00:59:47,338
NOM

1532
00:59:47,405 --> 00:59:50,705
I'm only here
because Tanya's stall is closed.

1533
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:52,338
That's why I'm here.

1534
00:59:52,405 --> 00:59:53,405
TRUTH: IT WASN'T OPEN YET

1535
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,271
She's taking a day off.

1536
00:59:56,371 --> 00:59:59,371
KYUHYUN HEADS OUT,
UNAWARE OF THE SITUATION

1537
00:59:59,438 --> 01:00:00,438
It's good.

1538
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:01,871
-Su-geun.
-Yes?

1539
01:00:03,038 --> 01:00:04,538
-What are you doing?
-Try this.

1540
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:06,538
-I was only tasting it.
-What?

1541
01:00:06,605 --> 01:00:07,671
Why?

1542
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:09,238
SHAMELESS

1543
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,971
But we agreed not to…

1544
01:00:11,038 --> 01:00:14,038
Tanya's not open,
so they told me to have a little.

1545
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:16,005
-Are you sure it's closed?
-I'm telling you.

1546
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:19,205
-I would have gone to Tanya's.
-You're not the person to cheat.

1547
01:00:19,271 --> 01:00:22,438
Of course not.
I'm supposed to set an example.

1548
01:00:23,205 --> 01:00:26,338
KYUHYUN ENDS UP LEAVING

1549
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:31,738
HE MIGHT AS WELL TASTE KYUHYUN'S FOOD TOO

1550
01:00:31,805 --> 01:00:33,705
A BIG BITE

1551
01:00:33,771 --> 01:00:36,938
COVERING IT UP

1552
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:38,971
THE OWNER OF THE PLATE RETURNS

1553
01:00:39,038 --> 01:00:41,005
I even love the hotel breakfast in Kenya.

1554
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,571
-There's so much to eat.
-It suits my taste.

1555
01:00:43,638 --> 01:00:44,771
Have you had some?

1556
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:48,471
-Just the cereal?
-I have a conscience. I can't overdo it.

1557
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:50,971
Kyuhyun is sensitive about this stuff.

1558
01:00:51,038 --> 01:00:52,205
FEIGNING INNOCENCE

1559
01:00:52,905 --> 01:00:56,171
Their cheese omelet has cheese inside.

1560
01:00:56,705 --> 01:00:57,538
Inside the omelet.

1561
01:00:57,605 --> 01:00:58,438
SATISFACTORY SCORE

1562
01:00:59,138 --> 01:01:01,038
And I love these grilled tomatoes.

1563
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:03,871
They taste better when they're cooked.

1564
01:01:03,938 --> 01:01:07,505
I'm always impressed
when you memorize the food names.

1565
01:01:08,271 --> 01:01:09,371
I could never do that.

1566
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:13,305
It brought out the tomato's sweetness.

1567
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:18,238
Honestly, I often travel abroad, right?

1568
01:01:19,538 --> 01:01:21,905
-But the food quality is so high here.
-Yes.

1569
01:01:21,971 --> 01:01:24,905
I mean it. I'm not joking.

1570
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:26,405
Thank you for the food.

1571
01:01:26,471 --> 01:01:28,505
WHILE SU-GEUN AND KYUHYUN
ARE FINISHING BREAKFAST

1572
01:01:29,005 --> 01:01:32,571
JI-WON IS STILL ONE WITH HIS BED

1573
01:01:32,638 --> 01:01:36,505
Ji-won, if you're alive, have some fruit.

1574
01:01:36,571 --> 01:01:37,871
We only have a few minutes left.

1575
01:01:37,938 --> 01:01:40,405
SLUGGISH

1576
01:01:40,471 --> 01:01:42,371
I brought you coffee.

1577
01:01:42,438 --> 01:01:43,471
WAKE UP

1578
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:46,238
I'M UP

1579
01:01:46,938 --> 01:01:47,905
It's iced.

1580
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,305
Will it taste good today?

1581
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:51,371
FRESH FRUIT ROOM SERVICE

1582
01:01:52,105 --> 01:01:54,471
NOM

1583
01:01:56,738 --> 01:01:57,871
Damn it.

1584
01:01:58,438 --> 01:02:00,838
Why is it still not ripe?

1585
01:02:01,871 --> 01:02:03,138
Let's go.

1586
01:02:03,205 --> 01:02:05,338
OFF TO CATCH THE LIGHT AIRCRAFT

1587
01:02:05,405 --> 01:02:07,471
OR SO THEY THOUGHT

1588
01:02:07,538 --> 01:02:09,071
Tanya's stall is open.

1589
01:02:09,138 --> 01:02:12,438
-She just opened. She opens late.
-What are you talking about?

1590
01:02:12,505 --> 01:02:13,938
-So you didn't eat there?
-No.

1591
01:02:14,005 --> 01:02:15,171
Get something, then!

1592
01:02:15,238 --> 01:02:17,071
HE STEPS OUT DUE TO PUBLIC OUTRAGE

1593
01:02:17,138 --> 01:02:19,405
Good morning, Tanya.

1594
01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:21,805
I'm fine.

1595
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:24,971
HIS MORNING GREETING SOUNDS VERY KOREAN

1596
01:02:30,671 --> 01:02:34,338
I'm going to see a giraffe.

1597
01:02:34,405 --> 01:02:36,105
UNTRANSLATABLE

1598
01:02:36,771 --> 01:02:37,605
What's it called?

1599
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,671
Going to the Maasai world!

1600
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:41,471
We're going to Maasai today.

1601
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:47,238
STOPPING

1602
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,438
No?

1603
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:50,738
I think it's a type of lemon cake.

1604
01:02:50,805 --> 01:02:51,938
HE BUYS A LEMON CAKE INSTEAD

1605
01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:54,871
SAYING HIS FINAL GOODBYE

1606
01:03:00,105 --> 01:03:02,538
AWKWARD FAREWELL

1607
01:03:02,605 --> 01:03:04,105
I should try it.

1608
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:05,505
SU-GEUN IS BACK ON THE BUS

1609
01:03:05,571 --> 01:03:07,505
You'll need coffee, or you'll choke.

1610
01:03:07,571 --> 01:03:09,438
No, I won't.

1611
01:03:09,505 --> 01:03:11,571
I can just swallow with spit.

1612
01:03:12,771 --> 01:03:14,338
Amylase!

1613
01:03:14,405 --> 01:03:16,071
Iced amylase!

1614
01:03:17,071 --> 01:03:18,338
Just like an iced Americano.

1615
01:03:18,405 --> 01:03:20,571
If someone orders an IA,
would you gather spit?

1616
01:03:21,205 --> 01:03:23,005
This might be the fourth item
on the Big Five.

1617
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:24,671
HE HAS HIGH HOPES FOR THE LEMON CAKE

1618
01:03:24,738 --> 01:03:26,371
Do we have three items
on the list, Kyuhyun?

1619
01:03:26,438 --> 01:03:27,738
-Two restaurants.
-No, three.

1620
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:28,838
-Three.
-Three.

1621
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,538
Isn't the hotel breakfast the fourth one?

1622
01:03:31,105 --> 01:03:32,838
The hotel breakfast was amazing, indeed.

1623
01:03:32,905 --> 01:03:36,571
I'm surprised
the staff kept this a secret.

1624
01:03:36,638 --> 01:03:38,071
-Seriously?
-It was so good.

1625
01:03:38,138 --> 01:03:39,538
DIDN'T GET A GLIMPSE
OF THE HOTEL BREAKFAST

1626
01:03:39,605 --> 01:03:41,071
What did they have?

1627
01:03:41,138 --> 01:03:44,871
-Omelets with cheese inside.
-Oh, omelets.

1628
01:03:44,938 --> 01:03:46,105
That was so good.

1629
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:47,171
EXCLAIMS

1630
01:03:47,738 --> 01:03:49,638
You have to eat this with milk or coffee.

1631
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:50,671
I told you so.

1632
01:03:50,738 --> 01:03:52,571
My mouth is completely dried out.

1633
01:03:52,638 --> 01:03:55,205
HIS TRUSTED AMYLASE HAS FAILED

1634
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:57,871
Try a little bit.

1635
01:03:57,938 --> 01:03:59,105
-With this?
-Yes.

1636
01:03:59,171 --> 01:04:01,205
It's just like a sponge cake.

1637
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:04,238
-It's seriously dry.
-It's a sponge cake.

1638
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:07,438
Give Director Nah a piece.

1639
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:09,638
-I don't even have water.
-Neither do we.

1640
01:04:09,705 --> 01:04:10,705
And you think we do?

1641
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:13,005
-You're holding something.
-I'm not drinking it.

1642
01:04:13,071 --> 01:04:14,671
I want to savor this.

1643
01:04:14,738 --> 01:04:16,238
We'll eat the rest later.

1644
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:20,238
-Wait. I like it, though.
-I said it was good.

1645
01:04:20,305 --> 01:04:21,505
-Give me some.
-It's good.

1646
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:22,471
See?

1647
01:04:22,538 --> 01:04:26,305
-Ji-won never realizes he's hungry.
-The aftertaste is so savory.

1648
01:04:26,371 --> 01:04:27,471
-It's good.
-It's not bad.

1649
01:04:27,538 --> 01:04:28,571
-Right?
-Yes.

1650
01:04:28,638 --> 01:04:29,938
We're at the airport.

1651
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:33,938
Man, I'm so nervous right now.

1652
01:04:34,005 --> 01:04:35,605
-Why?
-What do I do?

1653
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:36,838
Here we go again.

1654
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:37,738
Anxiety is back.

1655
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:40,571
Hey, Anxiety.

1656
01:04:41,538 --> 01:04:44,205
I'm seeing a new side of Ji-won.

1657
01:04:45,205 --> 01:04:47,671
The weather's so nice
wherever you get off.

1658
01:04:48,238 --> 01:04:50,205
So this isn't the airport.

1659
01:04:50,271 --> 01:04:52,038
-It is.
-It's the domestic terminal.

1660
01:04:52,105 --> 01:04:53,305
The domestic terminal?

1661
01:04:53,871 --> 01:04:54,871
A PETITE AIRPORT FOR DOMESTIC FLIGHTS

1662
01:04:54,938 --> 01:04:55,871
This is nice.

1663
01:04:55,938 --> 01:04:57,205
There it is.

1664
01:04:57,271 --> 01:04:59,038
-What a cool plane.
-Yes.

1665
01:04:59,538 --> 01:05:01,105
I'm terrified.

1666
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:03,538
-AirKenya is trustworthy.
-Yes.

1667
01:05:04,738 --> 01:05:07,905
-It's pretty big for a light aircraft.
-I'm so scared.

1668
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,305
It has a propeller on the front.

1669
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:12,471
-The one with the propeller on the front.
-Oh, I see.

1670
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:14,371
A DREADFUL TINY AIRCRAFT

1671
01:05:14,438 --> 01:05:17,038
Ji-won, don't worry.
I'll be right beside you.

1672
01:05:17,671 --> 01:05:19,571
Can we buy one?

1673
01:05:20,505 --> 01:05:21,905
It's useful for the safari.

1674
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:23,171
SU-GEUN IS DISTRACTED BY THE GIFT SHOP

1675
01:05:23,238 --> 01:05:27,371
-This color suits you better.
-Why?

1676
01:05:27,438 --> 01:05:29,038
-This one's more "safari."
-It's too flat.

1677
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:30,705
-It's not as nice.
-This color is…

1678
01:05:30,771 --> 01:05:33,171
Can I buy this one?

1679
01:05:33,238 --> 01:05:35,038
-For the safari.
-Then, buy me this one.

1680
01:05:35,105 --> 01:05:36,171
Try it on.

1681
01:05:36,238 --> 01:05:38,471
You need a big one
like this to cover your entire face.

1682
01:05:38,538 --> 01:05:39,671
You look good.

1683
01:05:39,738 --> 01:05:41,138
This is too flat for you.

1684
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:43,838
-That one doesn't even block the sun.
-He's right.

1685
01:05:43,905 --> 01:05:45,905
I've got no freedom.
They keep scolding me.

1686
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:47,505
THE TPO CONTEST LOSER
GETS INTERFERED EVERY TIME

1687
01:05:47,571 --> 01:05:48,638
You need to wear this.

1688
01:05:48,705 --> 01:05:50,405
-Like this?
-Yes.

1689
01:05:50,471 --> 01:05:51,471
AT LEAST IT WILL BLOCK THE SUN

1690
01:05:51,538 --> 01:05:53,405
-That elephant one looks nice.
-This one?

1691
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:54,971
The elephant hat.

1692
01:05:56,205 --> 01:05:58,071
THE BIG 5 HAT CATCHES HIS EYES

1693
01:05:58,638 --> 01:05:59,671
-How does it look?
-Good.

1694
01:06:00,305 --> 01:06:01,971
-Do I look okay?
-Yes.

1695
01:06:02,571 --> 01:06:04,071
It looks cute on you.

1696
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:05,505
THANKFULLY, JI-WON APPROVES

1697
01:06:05,571 --> 01:06:06,805
Okay, Big Five.

1698
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:10,971
NODS

1699
01:06:11,038 --> 01:06:12,438
MEANS, "BUY IT FOR ME"

1700
01:06:12,505 --> 01:06:16,738
SAFARI PREP COMPLETE,
CHARGED TO DIRECTOR NAH'S CARD

1701
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:19,238
THEY'LL WAIT IN THE LOUNGE
UNTIL THE FLIGHT TIME

1702
01:06:19,305 --> 01:06:21,838
Are those sandwiches ours?

1703
01:06:21,905 --> 01:06:23,338
I ordered them.

1704
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,871
-These are Kenyan sandwiches.
-Kenyan sandwiches.

1705
01:06:25,938 --> 01:06:28,138
-They pressed it like a waffle.
-It has ham and…

1706
01:06:28,205 --> 01:06:29,171
It's steaming.

1707
01:06:29,238 --> 01:06:30,738
I hope there's mbuzi in it.

1708
01:06:30,805 --> 01:06:32,005
It was labeled "mbuzi meat."

1709
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,738
-It's ham.
-Mbuzi ham.

1710
01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:36,038
-It's just ham.
-It's mbuzi ham.

1711
01:06:36,105 --> 01:06:37,305
HE GIVES UP

1712
01:06:37,371 --> 01:06:39,105
A BITE OF MBUZI-FREE SANDWICH

1713
01:06:39,171 --> 01:06:40,005
This bread--

1714
01:06:40,071 --> 01:06:41,171
STRETCHES

1715
01:06:41,238 --> 01:06:43,271
-That's mbuzi cheese.
-It's obviously mbuzi juice.

1716
01:06:43,338 --> 01:06:44,405
It's pretty obvious.

1717
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:47,438
-Try one.
-I'm too full. Stop telling me to eat.

1718
01:06:47,505 --> 01:06:48,871
-You're full?
-Yes.

1719
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:49,771
What did you eat?

1720
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:51,405
You and I shared the cake earlier.

1721
01:06:51,471 --> 01:06:53,005
-What did you eat?
-The cake.

1722
01:06:53,071 --> 01:06:54,505
He was there during breakfast.

1723
01:06:54,571 --> 01:06:56,038
I sat with him at breakfast.

1724
01:06:56,105 --> 01:06:57,738
But he had crumbs on his mouth.

1725
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,071
What did you eat?

1726
01:06:59,138 --> 01:07:00,705
-I only had a piece.
-What?

1727
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:02,638
-Only the leftovers.
-You're not supposed to eat that.

1728
01:07:02,705 --> 01:07:03,938
I was allowed.

1729
01:07:04,005 --> 01:07:06,405
-How so?
-Because Tanya's stall wasn't open.

1730
01:07:06,471 --> 01:07:08,005
You should have only eaten at Tanya's.

1731
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:09,471
How could I when it was closed?

1732
01:07:09,538 --> 01:07:11,305
-Then, you're not supposed to eat this.
-Why not?

1733
01:07:11,371 --> 01:07:13,605
You placed third.
Why are you eating everything?

1734
01:07:13,671 --> 01:07:14,538
-He has a point.
-That's over.

1735
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:16,171
-That's bullshit.
-No, it isn't.

1736
01:07:16,238 --> 01:07:19,671
-No, you can't eat this.
-That's not it.

1737
01:07:19,738 --> 01:07:21,505
I'm trying to find out why he's full!

1738
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:22,771
It's not about this!

1739
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:24,838
HEADING OFF TO BOARD THE PLANE TOGETHER

1740
01:07:24,905 --> 01:07:27,638
IT'S BOARDING TIME ALREADY

1741
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:30,105
KYUHYUN LEISURELY TAKES
COMMEMORATIVE PHOTOS

1742
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,205
WHILE JI-WON IS FROZEN

1743
01:07:31,271 --> 01:07:32,971
Ji-won, I'll take your picture.

1744
01:07:33,505 --> 01:07:34,771
TRUDGING

1745
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:36,338
Smile, Ji-won.

1746
01:07:36,405 --> 01:07:38,071
NAUGHTY JI-WON

1747
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:39,771
-To the back.
-Go to the far back.

1748
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:41,505
I'm in the front. Business class.

1749
01:07:41,571 --> 01:07:42,971
FIRST TIME HEARING THIS

1750
01:07:43,038 --> 01:07:45,138
I think it'll be scarier in the back.

1751
01:07:45,738 --> 01:07:47,771
SEAT CLASS IS NOT HIS CONCERN

1752
01:07:48,438 --> 01:07:50,138
How do you feel right now, Ji-won?

1753
01:07:50,205 --> 01:07:52,371
My heart is pounding so fast.

1754
01:07:52,438 --> 01:07:53,805
I feel like losing my mind.

1755
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:56,171
My legs are shaking.

1756
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,071
Can you see?

1757
01:07:57,138 --> 01:07:58,405
You're shaking it on purpose.

1758
01:07:58,471 --> 01:08:00,938
No, it's actually shaking.
I'm genuinely nervous.

1759
01:08:01,005 --> 01:08:02,605
THE PLANE DOOR CLOSES

1760
01:08:02,671 --> 01:08:03,505
What's this?

1761
01:08:03,571 --> 01:08:04,905
-It won't close.
-What is it?

1762
01:08:04,971 --> 01:08:06,171
WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE DOOR TO TAKE OFF

1763
01:08:06,238 --> 01:08:07,771
I can't feel his pulse.

1764
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:09,671
TAKING HIS PULSE

1765
01:08:09,738 --> 01:08:11,138
It's going to be fascinating.

1766
01:08:11,205 --> 01:08:12,305
THE PLANE STARTS MOVING

1767
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:14,538
We'll look down on Kenya once we take off.

1768
01:08:14,605 --> 01:08:17,271
-It's going incredibly fast.
-Right?

1769
01:08:17,338 --> 01:08:18,371
IT FEELS FASTER AS IT'S A SMALL PLANE

1770
01:08:18,938 --> 01:08:19,938
It's so fast.

1771
01:08:20,005 --> 01:08:22,138
We're already in the air.

1772
01:08:22,205 --> 01:08:24,705
THE PLANE LIFTS OFF FROM NAIROBI

1773
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:25,971
It's seriously fast.

1774
01:08:26,605 --> 01:08:27,838
Su-geun.

1775
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,271
I see the roads and buildings
from the last couple of days.

1776
01:08:32,938 --> 01:08:35,038
That's the building we saw last time.

1777
01:08:35,105 --> 01:08:37,271
LEAVING FAMILIAR NAIROBI CITY BEHIND

1778
01:08:38,738 --> 01:08:40,038
We're flying above the clouds.

1779
01:08:40,105 --> 01:08:41,038
HEADING TO THE SAFARI

1780
01:08:41,105 --> 01:08:44,071
ONE OF THEM IS STILL FULL OF WORRY

1781
01:08:44,138 --> 01:08:45,404
It's all grassland.

1782
01:08:47,038 --> 01:08:50,005
GIVE ME THAT CAMERA

1783
01:08:52,938 --> 01:08:59,371
VAST GREEN PLAINS COME INTO VIEW

1784
01:09:00,105 --> 01:09:01,605
They're all plains.

1785
01:09:05,138 --> 01:09:06,971
Everywhere you look, it's plains.

1786
01:09:07,805 --> 01:09:09,171
All green.

1787
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:13,371
HE SEEMS MUCH MORE RELAXED NOW

1788
01:09:13,438 --> 01:09:15,238
This is beautiful.

1789
01:09:15,305 --> 01:09:18,205
UNLIKE AT THE BEGINNING,
JI-WON IS THE MOST EXCITED ONE NOW

1790
01:09:18,271 --> 01:09:21,371
Where there's water, there's a forest.

1791
01:09:21,438 --> 01:09:22,971
-There's water.
-It's a river.

1792
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:24,038
Yes, the river.

1793
01:09:24,105 --> 01:09:25,705
-That's where hippos live.
-What?

1794
01:09:25,771 --> 01:09:27,971
Hippos live in places like that.

1795
01:09:28,404 --> 01:09:31,738
THE GROUND GETS CLOSER

1796
01:09:31,805 --> 01:09:34,171
-I feel like we're almost there.
-I agree.

1797
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,038
WE'RE ALMOST HERE?

1798
01:09:37,105 --> 01:09:38,005
AMAZED

1799
01:09:38,071 --> 01:09:39,171
It's pure grassland.

1800
01:09:40,871 --> 01:09:43,071
KYUHYUN WAKES UP AND ENJOYS THE VAST VIEW

1801
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:45,005
If you look closely,
you'll see the animals.

1802
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:49,671
Oh, lots of animals over there.

1803
01:09:50,938 --> 01:09:52,271
There's mbuzi.

1804
01:09:53,438 --> 01:09:56,638
-I see a herd of buffalo.
-Where? Film it.

1805
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:00,605
THE FOCUS IS FIXED ON THE WINDOW

1806
01:10:00,671 --> 01:10:02,338
There's a whole group. I missed it.

1807
01:10:02,405 --> 01:10:03,771
I only got a little bit.

1808
01:10:04,338 --> 01:10:07,705
THE PLANE LANDS

1809
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:09,271
We're landing.

1810
01:10:10,971 --> 01:10:11,971
Look at that sand.

1811
01:10:12,705 --> 01:10:13,705
THE SAFARI RUNWAY IS MADE OF DIRT

1812
01:10:13,771 --> 01:10:15,371
The tires are holding up.

1813
01:10:15,438 --> 01:10:17,805
The tires aren't bursting

1814
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:20,471
on this sandy runway.

1815
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:22,371
We're landing.

1816
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,571
Good work, everyone.

1817
01:10:26,638 --> 01:10:28,071
ARRIVED SAFELY

1818
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:30,538
CLICKS

1819
01:10:30,605 --> 01:10:31,771
THE PLANE DOOR OPENS

1820
01:10:31,838 --> 01:10:32,738
It's nice and cool.

1821
01:10:32,805 --> 01:10:34,538
-Jambo.
-It's so nice and cool.

1822
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,371
Did he say "kkanbu"?

1823
01:10:36,438 --> 01:10:38,638
JAMBO MEANS "HELLO" IN SWAHILI

1824
01:10:38,705 --> 01:10:42,971
TOUCHING THE GROUND AGAIN AFTER 1 HOUR

1825
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:45,005
CAREFUL

1826
01:10:47,105 --> 01:10:48,038
Jambo.

1827
01:10:49,338 --> 01:10:50,571
Oh, my legs.

1828
01:10:51,105 --> 01:10:52,738
EXCITED

1829
01:10:52,805 --> 01:10:54,171
-Finally.
-It's the grasslands.

1830
01:10:55,205 --> 01:10:56,205
FRESH, OPEN AIR

1831
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:57,438
Finally.

1832
01:10:57,505 --> 01:10:59,571
This is a completely empty plain.

1833
01:10:59,638 --> 01:11:01,438
THE THREE IDIOTS HAVE ARRIVED IN…

1834
01:11:02,338 --> 01:11:05,438
MAASAI MARA

1835
01:11:09,505 --> 01:11:11,338
MAASAI MARA IS A WILDLIFE RESERVE
IN SOUTHWESTERN KENYA

1836
01:11:11,405 --> 01:11:13,538
AND A WORLD-FAMOUS TOURIST DESTINATION

1837
01:11:20,838 --> 01:11:26,371
HOME TO MILLIONS OF LIVING SPECIES

1838
01:11:26,838 --> 01:11:29,505
AND THE GUARDIANS OF THIS LAND

1839
01:11:29,971 --> 01:11:33,371
THE MAASAI PEOPLE

1840
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:37,438
RAW, UNTAMED WILDERNESS

1841
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:42,205
THE HARMONY OF NATURE

1842
01:11:42,905 --> 01:11:47,505
VISITORS COME HERE
TO EXPERIENCE THIS WONDER

1843
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:50,105
AMONG THE MOST POPULAR ATTRACTIONS

1844
01:11:53,805 --> 01:11:55,805
THE BIG 5 WERE ONCE CHOSEN BY HUNTERS

1845
01:11:55,871 --> 01:11:57,971
AS THE MOST DIFFICULT
AND DANGEROUS ANIMALS TO HUNT

1846
01:11:58,038 --> 01:12:00,105
BUT ARE NOW THE MOST SOUGHT-AFTER SIGHTS
FOR SAFARI TOURISTS

1847
01:12:00,438 --> 01:12:05,505
LION

1848
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:10,405
ELEPHANT

1849
01:12:11,071 --> 01:12:15,338
RHINOCEROS

1850
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:21,271
LEOPARD

1851
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:27,905
BUFFALO

1852
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:31,471
HIGH-DEFINITION BUFFALO HERD
FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE

1853
01:12:32,571 --> 01:12:34,238
THE LIVING, BREATHING EARTH

1854
01:12:34,305 --> 01:12:36,671
MAASAI MARA

1855
01:12:37,305 --> 01:12:40,538
LOOK FORWARD TO THE MEMORIES
THE THREE IDIOTS WILL MAKE HERE

1856
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:43,438
But just seeing this makes me feel good.

1857
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:46,171
I already saw one of the Big Five.

1858
01:12:46,838 --> 01:12:48,005
I saw a buffalo herd.

1859
01:12:48,071 --> 01:12:49,671
-Yes, you said that.
-When we were landing.

1860
01:12:50,271 --> 01:12:51,371
It's the fourth time you said it.

1861
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:54,605
But Su-geun says it doesn't count
if you saw it from the air.

1862
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:56,605
Why doesn't it count?

1863
01:12:57,171 --> 01:12:58,238
How is that seeing one of the Big Five?

1864
01:12:58,305 --> 01:12:59,705
You saw it alone.
The whole team has to see it.

1865
01:12:59,771 --> 01:13:01,338
No, I'm saying that I saw it.

1866
01:13:01,405 --> 01:13:03,105
How do we know? Do you have proof?

1867
01:13:04,305 --> 01:13:06,105
NO FIGHTING IN MAASAI MARA

1868
01:13:06,171 --> 01:13:07,238
Check out that jeep.

1869
01:13:07,305 --> 01:13:08,971
Look, Ji-won.

1870
01:13:09,038 --> 01:13:10,105
AMAZED

1871
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:11,438
-Now that's trustworthy.
-Awesome.

1872
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:15,138
THE SAFARI VEHICLE THE CREW WILL BE USING

1873
01:13:15,205 --> 01:13:17,305
This car's got… How many wheels?

1874
01:13:17,371 --> 01:13:18,271
OPEN SIDES FOR ANIMAL VIEWING

1875
01:13:18,338 --> 01:13:19,605
-Last-row seats.
-Nice ride.

1876
01:13:19,671 --> 01:13:21,005
It's a cool jeep.

1877
01:13:21,071 --> 01:13:22,238
I love this car.

1878
01:13:22,305 --> 01:13:23,171
TOTALLY SATISFIED

1879
01:13:23,238 --> 01:13:24,271
EXCLAIMS

1880
01:13:24,338 --> 01:13:27,005
We're finally here. This is incredible.

1881
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:28,571
-Fantastic!
-So nice.

1882
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:31,771
-Nice!
-It feels like we've really arrived.

1883
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:36,805
HEADED TO THE LODGE

1884
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,271
This is so breathtaking.

1885
01:13:39,338 --> 01:13:40,938
I've got to see this with my own eyes.

1886
01:13:42,271 --> 01:13:44,205
I feel like I'm truly in Africa now.

1887
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:48,538
ENDLESS SAVANNA

1888
01:13:48,605 --> 01:13:50,271
It's an off-road vehicle.

1889
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:51,938
THE SAFARI JEEP HELPS THEM
FEEL THE DIRT ROADS

1890
01:13:52,005 --> 01:13:55,071
PURE FUN

1891
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:58,405
That kind of tree
is something you see in movies.

1892
01:13:58,471 --> 01:14:00,371
Where there's one lone tree.

1893
01:14:00,438 --> 01:14:02,238
That's the savanna.

1894
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:03,371
IMAGINATION COMES TO LIFE

1895
01:14:03,438 --> 01:14:05,471
That's an acacia tree.

1896
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:07,805
-Really?
-It's the giraffes' main food.

1897
01:14:07,871 --> 01:14:09,771
ACACIA TREES ARE SCATTERED
ACROSS THE GRASSLANDS

1898
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:11,705
THEY'RE THE SYMBOL OF MAASAI MARA

1899
01:14:12,138 --> 01:14:15,538
"MARA" IN SWAHILI MEANS "SPOTTED"

1900
01:14:16,071 --> 01:14:19,538
DERIVED FROM THE ACACIA TREES
SCATTERED LIKE SPOTS ON THE PLAINS

1901
01:14:19,605 --> 01:14:21,538
Just looking at it is therapeutic.

1902
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:25,505
I think there's an animal on our left.

1903
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:26,538
Isn't that a lion?

1904
01:14:27,905 --> 01:14:28,738
A LION ALREADY?

1905
01:14:28,805 --> 01:14:30,138
-I see something.
-It's standing.

1906
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:31,038
It's a lion.

1907
01:14:31,105 --> 01:14:33,371
-Is that a hyena?
-It's skinny, though.

1908
01:14:33,905 --> 01:14:37,438
The one you see in that direction
is a topi.

1909
01:14:37,505 --> 01:14:39,105
-Topi.
-See?

1910
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:41,871
It's a type of antelope
that looks like it's wearing leggings.

1911
01:14:41,938 --> 01:14:43,871
There it is. It's a topi.

1912
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:44,905
At 11 o'clock direction.

1913
01:14:45,538 --> 01:14:47,905
-It's just zoning out.
-Yes, I see it.

1914
01:14:47,971 --> 01:14:50,805
What if it gets eaten
while standing there alone?

1915
01:14:50,871 --> 01:14:53,138
There's more over there.

1916
01:14:53,205 --> 01:14:55,338
There's a group on the left.

1917
01:14:55,405 --> 01:14:58,271
-It's a whole topi family.
-Six or seven of them.

1918
01:14:58,338 --> 01:15:00,471
Those trees look like a painting.

1919
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:02,805
EVERY PASSING SCENE IS SURREAL

1920
01:15:02,871 --> 01:15:03,971
Topi.

1921
01:15:04,371 --> 01:15:06,671
THROUGH THE ENDLESS PLAINS

1922
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:10,305
THE JEEP ENTERS A FORESTED AREA

1923
01:15:10,371 --> 01:15:11,838
We must be close.

1924
01:15:13,005 --> 01:15:17,671
-We'll get off and walk to cross a river.
-It's an adventure.

1925
01:15:17,738 --> 01:15:19,571
We're crossing the river on foot?

1926
01:15:20,105 --> 01:15:24,205
-No, to the river.
-We'll walk to the river then cross it.

1927
01:15:24,538 --> 01:15:26,238
HEADING TOWARD THE RIVER

1928
01:15:26,305 --> 01:15:27,438
-Pumbaa.
-What?

1929
01:15:27,505 --> 01:15:28,938
There's Pumbaa!

1930
01:15:29,005 --> 01:15:31,671
-They're adorable!
-Oh, my. It's so cute.

1931
01:15:31,738 --> 01:15:33,071
-Warthogs?
-From The Lion King.

1932
01:15:33,138 --> 01:15:34,471
It's Pumbaa from The Lion King.

1933
01:15:34,538 --> 01:15:36,238
-Goodness.
-Are those warthogs?

1934
01:15:36,305 --> 01:15:37,838
-Oh, my gosh.
-They're so cute.

1935
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:39,971
-They look just like it.
-Just like in the movie.

1936
01:15:40,038 --> 01:15:41,071
It's The Lion King.

1937
01:15:41,138 --> 01:15:42,938
How are they right next to us?

1938
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,738
In Swahili, "pumbaa" can mean "foolish."

1939
01:15:45,805 --> 01:15:47,471
Oh, I see.

1940
01:15:47,538 --> 01:15:48,838
They're adorable, though.

1941
01:15:48,905 --> 01:15:51,271
Look at how they bend
their front legs to eat.

1942
01:15:51,805 --> 01:15:53,771
DINING ON ITS KNEES
IS PUMBAA'S TABLE MANNERS

1943
01:15:53,838 --> 01:15:56,138
-They bend their front legs to eat.
-Yes.

1944
01:15:56,205 --> 01:16:00,138
When they move, they stick their tails up,
which act as antennae.

1945
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:01,205
Antennae?

1946
01:16:01,271 --> 01:16:02,971
That way, the whole family can follow.

1947
01:16:03,038 --> 01:16:05,971
They're the reason
we have good service here.

1948
01:16:06,038 --> 01:16:07,371
They pointed their antennae up.

1949
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,338
LET'S GET OFF

1950
01:16:09,938 --> 01:16:12,571
WALKING TOWARD THE RIVER

1951
01:16:13,471 --> 01:16:15,005
The smell hits you.

1952
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,438
They pooped a lot here.

1953
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,205
-That's elephant dung.
-Elephant dung.

1954
01:16:19,138 --> 01:16:20,938
BIG 5 DUNG WELCOMES THE THREE IDIOTS

1955
01:16:21,005 --> 01:16:21,838
Here's the river.

1956
01:16:21,905 --> 01:16:24,571
-Yes, our lodge is across this river.
-It's the river.

1957
01:16:25,171 --> 01:16:27,838
It's like rafting. Check it out.

1958
01:16:27,905 --> 01:16:29,038
That's a scary river.

1959
01:16:29,105 --> 01:16:31,105
The current seems pretty strong.

1960
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:32,538
The water's fierce.

1961
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:34,505
-Oh gosh.
-Look at that.

1962
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:36,071
THE RIVER LOOKS PRETTY DEEP

1963
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,271
AND THE CURRENT SEEMS QUITE SWIFT

1964
01:16:40,005 --> 01:16:41,671
AND…

1965
01:16:41,738 --> 01:16:42,938
We're crossing on that?

1966
01:16:43,005 --> 01:16:44,505
That's it?

1967
01:16:44,571 --> 01:16:48,471
With this current, we'd float all the way
to the Hangang River back home.

1968
01:16:48,538 --> 01:16:50,071
A SMALL RAFT IS WAITING FOR THEM

1969
01:16:50,671 --> 01:16:52,338
AND A ROPE THAT CONNECTS TO THE OTHER SIDE

1970
01:16:52,405 --> 01:16:54,138
-We're crossing on a rope.
-Wow, this is…

1971
01:16:54,205 --> 01:16:55,105
Do we put these on?

1972
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:57,805
Yes, take one life jacket each.

1973
01:16:57,871 --> 01:17:00,105
-Is everyone ready?
-Yes.

1974
01:17:00,171 --> 01:17:01,671
Today's surprise mission.

1975
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:04,305
LOGIC GAME

1976
01:17:05,071 --> 01:17:06,738
It's the Logic Game.

1977
01:17:06,805 --> 01:17:08,005
-What?
-Logic Game.

1978
01:17:08,071 --> 01:17:09,538
-Logic?
-Yes.

1979
01:17:09,605 --> 01:17:11,305
You will get ten minutes.

1980
01:17:11,371 --> 01:17:15,705
Let's say the boat can only carry
two entities at a time.

1981
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:17,171
-Two entities?
-Yes.

1982
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:20,771
The ones crossing
are a lion, a giraffe, and an acacia tree.

1983
01:17:20,838 --> 01:17:22,205
A LION, A GIRAFFE, AND AN ACACIA TREE

1984
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:23,738
WANT TO CROSS THE RIVER
ON A TWO-SEATER RAFT

1985
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:24,938
IF THE GIRAFFE IS LEFT ALONE WITH THE LION

1986
01:17:25,005 --> 01:17:26,105
THE GIRAFFE GETS EATEN

1987
01:17:26,171 --> 01:17:27,505
IF THE GIRAFFE IS LEFT ALONE
WITH THE ACACIA

1988
01:17:27,571 --> 01:17:28,771
THE ACACIA GETS EATEN

1989
01:17:28,838 --> 01:17:31,471
GET EVERYONE ACROSS
WITHOUT ANYONE BEING EATEN

1990
01:17:31,538 --> 01:17:32,671
YOU CAN'T MOVE AN EMPTY BOAT

1991
01:17:32,738 --> 01:17:34,438
AND ONE CAN'T EAT THE OTHER
WHILE PASSING BY

1992
01:17:35,438 --> 01:17:39,338
HOW WILL YOU GET EVERYONE ACROSS?

1993
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:43,638
Back there,
do you see the lion and the acacia tree?

1994
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:46,038
The acacia's the best one.

1995
01:17:46,105 --> 01:17:47,671
There's no good or bad in this.

1996
01:17:47,738 --> 01:17:49,205
-Work together.
-It's a team mission.

1997
01:17:49,271 --> 01:17:50,771
-The acacia tree--
-What's the prize?

1998
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:54,738
If you cross the river
and get to the lodge in ten minutes,

1999
01:17:54,805 --> 01:17:56,705
you'll have a gourmet feast.

2000
01:17:56,771 --> 01:17:59,105
If you fail, something else awaits.

2001
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:02,505
What's that noise? I think I hear a hippo.

2002
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:04,838
-There's a hippo.
-There it is.

2003
01:18:04,905 --> 01:18:06,271
This is home to hippos.

2004
01:18:06,338 --> 01:18:07,438
Home to hippos?

2005
01:18:07,505 --> 01:18:08,738
THEY MUST CROSS

2006
01:18:10,605 --> 01:18:13,105
THROUGH A DANGEROUS ANIMAL'S HABITAT

2007
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:15,405
Then, why don't I go alone after you?

2008
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:17,905
-That won't work!
-No, just get off for now.

2009
01:18:17,971 --> 01:18:20,705
Why is he making a fuss,
acting like he's so clever?

2010
01:18:20,771 --> 01:18:23,738
THEIR DISCORD SHINES BRIGHTEST IN CRISIS

2011
01:18:23,805 --> 01:18:26,305
-I see three of them. No, four lions.
-There's a lot.

2012
01:18:26,371 --> 01:18:27,338
Look at that.

2013
01:18:27,405 --> 01:18:29,638
The wind is blowing that way. We're lucky.

2014
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,238
The wind is blowing toward the lions.

2015
01:18:31,305 --> 01:18:33,038
Let's hurry. The lion is coming.

2016
01:18:36,738 --> 01:18:38,371
THE WONDERS OF THE WILD

2017
01:18:38,438 --> 01:18:39,438
I can't run anymore.

2018
01:18:42,105 --> 01:18:43,805
No way. This is crazy.

2019
01:18:43,871 --> 01:18:45,038
It's stifling.

2020
01:18:45,538 --> 01:18:47,738
The fishy smell is killing me.

2021
01:18:52,638 --> 01:18:54,305
I'm too old to even run now.

2022
01:18:54,371 --> 01:18:56,205
Is this the last one?

2023
01:18:56,938 --> 01:18:59,205
THE INTENSE FINALE

2024
01:19:00,571 --> 01:19:04,505
COMING SOON

2025
01:19:04,571 --> 01:19:06,538
BONUS CLIP

2026
01:19:06,605 --> 01:19:08,105
For crying out loud.

2027
01:19:08,605 --> 01:19:11,071
I was eating, Su-geun.

2028
01:19:11,138 --> 01:19:12,771
A frog showed up.

2029
01:19:12,838 --> 01:19:13,938
It was a frog…

2030
01:19:14,405 --> 01:19:15,905
Hurry up!

2031
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:17,205
You saw what?

2032
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:18,438
A frog.

2033
01:19:19,605 --> 01:19:22,038
Did you step on a frog
while you were laughing?

2034
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:23,705
Where did it go?

2035
01:19:23,771 --> 01:19:24,805
It's walking away. There it goes.

2036
01:19:24,871 --> 01:19:25,971
It's heading down that way with a camera.

2037
01:19:26,038 --> 01:19:26,971
