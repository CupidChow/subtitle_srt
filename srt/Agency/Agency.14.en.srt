will not come when the minister dies.

Father, thank you.

6
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,396
I thought I'd get married...

7
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,796
in a seedy wedding hall with no guests.

8
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,876
Your dad is still great.

9
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,196
Uncle, thank you for caring for us.

10
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,036
Dad, be nice to him.

11
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,076
This is all thanks to him.

12
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,119
Why thank colleagues of the same generation?

13
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,799
He's good enough.

14

Astaga! Ji-wu!

15
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,596
Congratulations!

16
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,156
- Happy. - You guys are here.

17
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,076
I envy. It's so beautiful here!

18
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,196
Ji-wu, we'll be waiting outside.

19
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,376
Halo.

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,636
I have to sit here.

21
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,099
All right. Look here.

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,379
One more time.

Of course.

35
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,379
Did I choose to work with you without a plan?

36
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,739
Jeong-seok.

37

Youre here.

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,996
Director Go, welcome.

39
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,376
The bride will enter.

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,619
Bride, please come in.

41
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,699
Where is the Director Go?

42
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,376
Why?

43
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,016
He has not come?

44
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,456
Not like that...

45
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,059
Over there.

46
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,900
Their expressions were completely opposite.

47
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:23,257
Good afternoon, distinguished guests who have attended...

48
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,260
to save the couple's marriage.

49
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:30,737
I want to wish the best for the future of this couple.

50
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,457
What are you doing?

51
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:33,777
What do you mean?

52
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:37,337
Why are you using Jeong-seok in our competition?

53
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:39,297
Utilize what?

54
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,617
The production team needs one more executive.

55
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,577
So, I discussed it with the Vice President...

56
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:44,777
and he agreed.

57
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,617
I offer Jeong-seok and he accepts it too.

58
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,180
Why? Is there any problem?

59
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:54,060
Look.

60
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,097
Look at Jeong-seok's expression.

61
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:02,377
When was the last time we saw him like that?

62
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:04,497
You...

63
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:07,580
what do you think?

64
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,301
What?

65
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:15,460
You say I took advantage of it?

66
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,377
How about you?

67
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:21,537
Do you think he should stay running a seedy bar?

68
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:22,617
What is this...

69
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:26,057
You want to be able to see him whenever you need to.

70
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,581
Am I wrong?

71
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,177
Of,

72
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,237
At the moment...

73
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:34,660
I took advantage of Jeong-seok.

74
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:36,980
But I...

75
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:39,701
give him...

76
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,940
thing he really wanted.

77
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,100
How about you?

78
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,740
you take advantage of it

79
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,340
but what did you do for him?

80
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,377
Still, why did you involve him?

81
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:59,497
Isn't there a limit we have to keep?

82
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,460
Law?

83
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,697
Aren't you the one who dragged Kang Han-na into our competition?

84
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,657
It's different...

85
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:09,380
You said you'd bring the storm to me.

86
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,860
When the storm comes, you'll know...

87
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,337
the difference between flowers growing in greenhouses...

88
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:18,460
and wild flowers that grow in the streets.

89
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:20,241
What?

90
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,537
Just wait.

91
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:26,700
I will shake the mentality of growing up in a greenhouse.

92
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,620
How come it's been so quiet lately?

93
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:36,380
Aren't we in the middle of a battle?

94
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:42,460
Why are you so peaceful alone?

95
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,900
You think...

96
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,100
have you won?

97
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:52,657
Now, we will start...

98
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,417
the highlight of the wedding, the newlyweds' cortege.

99
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,657
I hope you all can stand up and save them.

100
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:02,157
Please start the newlyweds' motorcade.

101
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:08,297
I guess I should...

102
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,500
apologize to you.

103
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:19,057
If I look too peaceful as if the battle is over,

104
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,637
it is impolite to the other party.

105
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:25,577
Of course.

106
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:30,740
No matter how fierce we fight, we must have good manners.

107
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,417
Correct.

108
00:08:57,441 --> 00:09:01,220
It's not over until it's really over.

109

"Battles only end for the dead."

110
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:20,900
Director Go, stay here to eat...

111
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,337
What is it?

112
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,097
Just let him go.

113
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,897
Did something happen?

114
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,559
If something happens, we'll know right away.

115
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,459
Kang Han-na, are you going to work without breakfast?

116
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,699
You haven't eaten at all since yesterday.

117
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,896
Are you drinking?

118
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,699
I was drinking yesterday.

119
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,780
Who are you?

120
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,296
I'm Director Kang Han-na's new secretary.

121
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,820
What?

122
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,676
What happened to Mr. Park?

123
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,179
My eldest grandson.

124
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,176
Yes, Grandpa.

125
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,736
Eat it.

126
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,596
You have to fight on a full stomach.

127
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,856
I also just found out this morning.

128
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,256
Did he threaten and tell her to stop?

129
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,256
No.

130
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,456
He himself resigned.

131
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,019
He refused Vice President Kang's offer.

132
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,739
What offer?

133
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,376
Is it true?

134
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,776
He rejected it?

135
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,300
Of.

136
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,576
Has his resignation been processed?

137
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,699
I don't think so.

138
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,716
- Hold on. - Okay.

139
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,596
What?

140
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,679
- Great Seniors! - Eun-jeong?

141
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,676
Thank you for coming to the wedding.

142
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,796
You're welcome.

143
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,156
But why are you here so early in the morning?

144
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,316
Which...

145
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,196
I came to work.

146
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,439
Work? What...

147
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,036
Did anyone forget to pay?

148
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,136
Do you still accept credit payments?

149
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,236
Jeong-seok.

150
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,396
Hey.

151
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,080
You reporting for work?

152
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,316
Of.

153
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,879
Has this been discussed with Director Go?

154
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,716
It's been discussed, yes.

155
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,476
Not by the director you mean,

156
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,279
but another director.

157
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,519
Very awkward couple.

158
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,396
Awkward couples breed creativity...

159
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,399
and we can't be afraid of that.

160
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,359
Haven't I taught you?

161
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,759
Let's work well together.

162
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,276
You're not disappointed when you see me often, right?

163
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,919
No...

164
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,720
"WK Fire Insurance"

165
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,759
Director Go, Jeong-seok comes to work.

166
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,316
The insurance ad received a positive reaction.

167
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,756
What about campaign extensions?

168
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,276
What really happened?

169
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,359
What else should we record?

170
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,196
You don't hear me? You're not going to work?

171
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,919
I'll arrange it and give you a report.

172
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,516
To install Pak Khan.

173
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,676
Of?

174
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,796
Director Choi takes Jeong-seok...

175
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,556
to interfere with my work within the production team.

176
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,199
Are we going to get stuck with that and waste our time?

177
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,036
No. I see what you mean.

178
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,356
Increase sales 50 percent.

179
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,556
As long as I finish it, everything will go smoothly.

180
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,916
Work with other teams...

181
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,916
to control what we do.

182
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,036
What should we set based on?

183
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,396
Speed.

184
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,236
That's our priority now.

185
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,760
Okay.

186
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,639
Director, would you like something to eat before we go?

187
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,876
Keep liking me.

188
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,196
I will also continue to like you.

189
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,196
You can lose everything if you do that.

190
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,876
Sometimes, you have to know how to give up...

191
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,639
I just need to change the world.

192
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,716
Even though you might lose everything you have now?

193
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,556
without you here,

194
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,199
I don't have anyone else in this world.

195
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,519
I'm told you love this restaurant.

196
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,359
Just walk.

197
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,719
- Besides... - Yes?

198
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,199
I don't like this place.

199
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,720
What is it?

200
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,919
Dad, stop it.

201
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,676
Stop what?

202
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,479
Stop interfering in my children's lives.

203
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,516
When have I ever interfered in your children's lives?

204
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,519
Like now...

205
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,516
Isn't it nice to be in control of my life?

206
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,396
Would you only be happy if you control...

207
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,919
live my children?

208
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,679
Looks like you're dead wrong.

209
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,996
Why are Han-su and Han-na fighting?

210
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,396
That...

211
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,156
because you made them compete.

212
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,716
Why are they competing?

213
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,596
Isn't it because they are trying to become the chairman of the VC Group?

214
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,556
Why is the problem about your children?

215
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,116
It's about the successor to the VC Group, the company I founded.

216
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,876
But he will be crushed.

217
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,996
Yong-ho.

218
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,556
Of?

219
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,796
To you too Han-su and Han-na,

220
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,559
before becoming my children and grandchildren,

221
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,960
you guys are paid servants by my company.

222
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,679
If you don't like it, drop everything and leave.

223
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,676
You have an appointment with the Chairman of the Wuwon Group.

224
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,200
Good.

225
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,536
Just do it at a board meeting.

226
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,876
Okay.

227
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,196
What about the rest?

228
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,636
I will handle it.

229
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,799
Just take care of internal affairs.

230
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,520
Enter.

231
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,379
Hey.

232
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,216
Mr. Yu, long time no see.

233
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,136
Mr Kwon, long time no see.

234
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,020
I heard you went through a lot.

235
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,736
Please help us.

236
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,856
Go Ah-in...

237
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,536
Good grief...

238
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,816
He's out of control.

239
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,019
Why is he the same as when he entered the company?

240
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,499
Correct. He has changed.

241
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,976
Changed? How could that be?

242
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,616
He had a team dinner with his team the other day.

243
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,619
That's not a problem.

244
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,459
Is it true?

245
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,537
Even so,

246
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,537
it's funny to see him having dinner with his secretary.

247
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:05,817
Secretary?

248
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:08,097
Who? You mean Mr. Park?

249
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,577
Not.

250
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,100
That girl. Ah-in's secretary.

251
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:26,340
So they did that...

252
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,097
There's one more thing...

253
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,860
what we have to discuss at today's meeting.

254
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:14,837
Is she the Chief's daughter?

255
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,060
Director Han-na, your secretary changed.

256
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,240
Of.

257
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,440
Even though you're still new.

258
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,937
You must have plenty of free time to care about this.

259
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:41,660
I told you to pay more attention to your presence.

260
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,657
Because you have nothing to do, right?

261
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:46,897
What?

262
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:48,497
What have you been doing lately?

263
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,260
Which advertisers do you have now?

264
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:57,537
Employees who don't care about their advertisers...

265
00:19:57,561 --> 00:20:00,900
usually lacking in terms of presence...

266
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,021
Don't you agree?

267
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:10,260
- Now... - You're right.

268
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:12,937
Attendance lately was chaotic.

269
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,461
Correct?

270
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:16,380
So true.

271
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:18,497
You never work...

272
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:21,337
and just go to head office every day.

273
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:23,860
How can a company run like this?

274
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,737
That's why we have a board of directors meeting today.

275
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,140
We try to make the company run well.

276
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:39,940
"Meeting Room"

277
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:44,217
We can cancel this project quickly.

278
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:47,297
Let me put it in touch with the planning office...

279
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:48,737
and solve it quickly.

280
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,897
Agreed. This one is fashion related...

281
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,177
I'll take care of it.

282
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,657
Help me make the script.

283
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:55,297
Then for this...

284
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,577
I'll take care of finances internet usage and insurance.

285
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,057
Alright, I'll finish another one.

286
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:02,377
As expected.

287
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:05,057
The cohesive creative director...

288
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:06,617
make everything run smoothly.

289
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,617
Of course.

290
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,697
If I'm on a team with people who don't understand,

291
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:13,057
I instead spent time convincing and explaining.

292
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:14,057
Correct.

293
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:17,417
We have less than a month to increase sales,

294
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:19,137
let's finish...

295
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:21,937
and another sumptuous team dinner!

296
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,461
Ayo!

297
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:29,460
We would like to suggest disbanding the TF team.

298
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:43,137
As far as I know, the TF team was formed during the Wuwon Group advertising project.

299
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:44,661
Is it true?

300
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:47,417
Of.

301
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:51,817
But why did you maintain it until now?

302
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:53,537
Anyway, I doubt...

303
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:56,300
efficiency of three creative directors in one team.

304
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:59,657
We work well together.

305
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:02,417
Uniting disorganized employees into one team...

306
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:04,177
just makes things less efficient.

307
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:07,220
Nope. That's a short-sighted opinion.

308
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:10,977
While new creative directors adapt to their team,

309
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:12,937
conflict is bound to occur.

310
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:16,577
Advertising really depends on personal taste.

311
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,857
But in the end,

312
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:21,617
period will help improve the ability of employees.

313
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,140
That's the time of growth, right?

314
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:29,540
Can you explain?

315
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:31,657
Making advertisements is the same as persuading people,

316
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:34,337
and the process of learning to persuade people...

317
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:36,580
starting in the meeting room.

318
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:38,177
internally,

319
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:40,177
We must know how to persuade teammates...

320
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:42,137
different opinion...

321
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,257
using logic, strategy, and creativity...

322
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:50,477
and finally able to persuade advertisers and consumers.

323
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,260
you agree?

324
00:22:55,681 --> 00:23:00,337
Keeping employees comfortable with you...

325
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:03,940
will only slow down the growth of the company.

326
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:08,217
What do you think, Director Go?

327
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:11,260
I'm sure he feels the same way.

328
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,617
That's how I learned...

329
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:16,940
and taught him in the past.

330
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:19,660
Is not that true?

331
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:32,057
Then, we will disband the TF team...

332
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:34,500
According to Director Yu.

333
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:37,537
There's one more thing.

334
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:39,017
Please.

335
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,097
I'd like to ask all the director's secretaries...

336
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:45,420
to terminate their contract.

337
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:50,537
This industry is not doing well.

338
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:55,260
No need to keep a secretary who can not work in the office.

339
00:23:58,081 --> 00:23:59,577
What is it?

340
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:00,977
Are you...

341
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:03,620
want to still have a private secretary?

342
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:11,180
Director Han-na is an exception.

343
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:14,457
He comes to the office comfortably,

344
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:17,100
unlike us.

345
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,296
Director Han-na is an exception

346
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,536
He comes to the office comfortably,

347
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,699
unlike us.

348
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,379
Without your weakness, you must be stronger.

349
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,876
Why are you even weaker?

350
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,959
I've listened to it.

351
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,799
Mr. Park, what are you doing?

352
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,676
Go home to eat.

353
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,076
Enjoy your meal and get back to work.

354
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,119
Your resignation has not been processed.

355
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,856
In my heart,

356
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,199
I'm back at work.

357
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,836
Just meet me for a second.

358
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,416
Good.

359
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,839
You will receive a call from HR soon.

360
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,800
What?

361
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,196
About what?

362
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,196
The decision was just made during the board of directors meeting.

363
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,616
Apart from the secretary to the CEO,

364
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,096
they decided to fire all the secretaries.

365
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,519
I think Director Choi knows.

366
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,599
Forgive me.

367
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,479
I will pack now.

368
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,719
That's all you have to say?

369
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,676
"Take responsibility for this."

370
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,236
"Find me another job somewhere else."

371
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,416
Why don't you talk like that?

372
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,959
If you left because you were told to, how would you survive?

373
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,279
If there was a way, you would already do it.

374
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,516
I will work part time...

375
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,416
while looking for another place to work.

376
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,279
Just give me a minute more. I will find another way.

377
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,039
Thank you for all this time.

378
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,316
We're just moving next door, but I don't want to.

379
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,359
Me too.

380
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:10,159
Why do companies like to make employees reluctant to come to work?

381
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,279
What are they thinking?

382
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,959
Eun-jeong.

383
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,239
Sujeong, what is that?

384
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,996
Shouldn't there be notifications...

385
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,236
months before?

386
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,316
I'm just a contract employee.

387
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,236
After all, I also receive an extra month's salary.

388
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,519
Due to early notice of dismissal.

389
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,156
I'll call a taxi, OK?

390
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,676
No need. Give me my things.

391
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,956
I'll just take the train.

392
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,159
No, I'll call a taxi.

393
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,639
Su-jeong, see you later.

394
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,595
We will help you check for vacancies elsewhere.

395
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:04,155
Yes, we will help you.

396
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:05,555
Me too.

397
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,235
Thanks for being nice to me.

398
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:10,015
I go.

399
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:12,719
Until found.

400
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:21,635
Why?

401
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,355
He's carrying stuff, why take the car?

402
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:24,995
He has to take a taxi.

403
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:28,958
He did that because the taxi fare was too expensive.

404
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,075
So, that's how they are?

405
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:34,235
They think I'll just shut up?

406
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:36,395
Why? Do you have a way?

407
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,158
- I have to get back at them. - No.

408
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:43,638
I don't know what your plan is, but no.

409
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,038
Check your phone.

410
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:57,595
His name is Yu Jeong-seok, right?

411
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:00,678
Not Yu Jeon-seok or Ryu Jeong-seok?

412
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:04,158
Yu Jeong-seok, but why?

413
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:08,135
Because there can be no spelling mistakes.

414
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:38,758
"Yu Jeong-seok"

415
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,795
I have to write it exactly 99 times.

416
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:45,495
If I write 100 times, he will die.

417
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:49,478
"Yu Jeong-seok"

418
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:04,335
All this is in vain.

419
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:27,815
There is no such thing as betrayal.

420
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:31,318
It's my fault for trusting him...

421
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:37,035
Eventually...

422
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,718
people only care about their own gain.

423
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:29,698
Eventually,

424
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:35,595
I'm back in the same place.

425
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:59,578
You didn't have breakfast?

426
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,095
Yes. I can't be a second late.

427
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,215
Why?

428
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,295
Starting today,

429
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,735
colleagues in the office should not see my shortcomings.

430
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:10,818
If that's your wish, you shouldn't be working, right?

431
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,619
That's right, my phone!

432
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,778
Seriously...

433
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,798
What's up, A-ji?

434
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:31,918
- Want a kiss? - No.

435
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:35,478
Mother, wake up.

436
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:41,758
I leave.

437
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:46,635
What did you put in your mother's bag?

438
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,598
Manuscript.

439
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,675
Good grief.

440
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:00,995
I really don't want to move.

441
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,718
There is no choice.

442
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:26,958
Eun-jeong.

443
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:30,075
What?

444
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:31,638
What's this?

445
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,758
What? Why is it here?

446
00:34:56,419 --> 00:34:58,435
So here's why.

447
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:01,918
No wonder I had a bad dream yesterday.

448
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:04,835
You didn't write it 100 times?

449
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,359
What?

450
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:09,275
A hundred times will make me die. You know, right?

451
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:12,959
Yes. That's why I only wrote it 99 times.

452
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,119
Forgive me.

453
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,356
I guess I should talk to Director Go.

454
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,039
No, but...

455
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,680
But...

456
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,519
No, no!

457
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,600
Unlucky!

458
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,520
Enter.

459
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,199
Director Go, I haven't greeted you formally yet.

460
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,739
You are right.

461
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,819
Sit down.

462
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,116
I guess you're a lucky man.

463
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,599
It's hard to meet loyal employees these days.

464
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,279
I don't know the handwriting, but I know the writer.

465
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,796
You don't want to ask me?

466
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,236
What time should I think about it?

467
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,196
I don't even have time...

468
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,519
to figure out how to deal with this.

469
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,519
I guess you are busy with various things.

470
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,439
So, you understand my decision?

471
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,476
I understand.

472
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,396
I can clearly see the benefits.

473
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,039
It is just...

474
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,199
I can't take it.

475
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,036
It seems your secretary has resigned.

476
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,096
You must be happy...

477
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,596
cut off the source of income for people who have nothing to do with it.

478
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,516
When we fish

479
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,836
sometimes we get unexpected fish.

480
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,556
Not that we have to stop fishing.

481
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,476
What are you trying to say?

482
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,196
Do I have to congratulate you on returning to the company?

483
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,576
Or do you want to hear me say I'm fine?

484
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,876
I asked if you came looking for me...

485
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,119
to reduce the guilt you feel?

486
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,759
Director Go...

487
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,996
Don't believe everything you see from the outside.

488
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,076
Sometimes, to find out...

489
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,516
we have to look at the bait, not the rod.

490
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,056
Okay.

491
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,336
I'll take a good look at it.

492
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,516
We should have met yesterday,

493
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,356
But unfortunately, I already have an event.

494
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,876
It doesn't matter.

495
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,116
After all, I contacted you so suddenly.

496
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,476
What is this?

497
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,356
Plans to let the couple get married...

498
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,876
and appointed Han-su as deputy chairman,

499
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,959
let's change it.

500
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,116
By change, you mean...

501
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,716
Appoint Han-su as deputy leader,

502
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,719
then let them get married.

503
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,156
Is it because of me?

504
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,836
You're afraid I'll be jailed again after the second interrogation?

505
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,919
No. This is my family's problem.

506
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,316
We're family now.

507
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,599
Shouldn't I know too?

508
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,076
Pages...

509
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,079
you should know about this.

510
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,956
Is the conversation smooth?

511
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,956
Why not? It's good for the son-in-law.

512
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,076
- Shall I take you to the head office? - Of course.

513
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,196
Actually, let's stop by the agency.

514
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,636
You want to tell Director Han-na?

515
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,359
No.

516
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,396
Before telling Han-su,

517
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,879
I only want to meet Han-na once.

518
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,776
Okay.

519
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,356
Why come here without telling me?

520
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,960
Why did I have to tell you to come to my company?

521
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,476
This sofa is comfortable.

522
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,416
Yes, it's very convenient.

523
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,516
are you busy?

524
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,759
I try to look busy.

525
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,076
- You enjoy your job? - I'm trying to enjoy it.

526
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,279
- What about Mr. Park? - I'm trying to forget...

527
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,676
Unlucky.

528
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,356
I told you to take it easy, but you're trying really hard.

529
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,676
What's this?

530
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,356
You're here to piss me off?

531
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,599
We haven't processed Mr. Park's resignation yet.

532
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,716
Stop looking at books that don't suit you...

533
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,839
and live as it is.

534
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,236
I've finished everything.

535
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,279
What did you finish?

536
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,879
Such a thing...

537
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:29,835
Father, thank you.

538
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:31,435
I will do the best.

539
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:34,238
Yes, I'm sure you will do well.

540
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:42,755
But Hansu.

541
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:44,279
Yes, Father.

542
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:48,198
What do you think of having two vice chairmen?

543
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:50,795
What?

544
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:52,915
We can make one more position...

545
00:40:52,939 --> 00:40:54,595
and have Han-na join you.

546
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,119
What...

547
00:40:56,939 --> 00:40:58,718
what did he do?

548
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:02,715
You've been saying this since I was little.

549
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:04,678
"Give up...

550
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:08,195
because you will be the chairman of the VC Group in the future."

551
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:10,795
My dream when I was little,

552
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:13,635
the course I want to take,

553
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:16,315
even the person I want to marry.

554
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,955
I held it and gave up everything...

555
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,915
because I'm going to be the chairman of the VC Group!

556
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:25,615
- He never sacrificed... - What I just said...

557
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:27,315
I pulled back.

558
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:30,155
I will continue as I said from the beginning.

559
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:34,895
Don't let other people know, especially your grandfather.

560
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,598
You know what I mean, right?

561
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:41,118
Okay.

562
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,518
Sorry for raising my voice.

563
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:49,575
I've scheduled a shareholders meeting for next week.

564
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:52,735
Thank You.

565
00:41:56,419 --> 00:41:58,639
I go.

566
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:20,038
Now I only need to finish one thing.

567
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:27,478
Please help book a table at the restaurant.

568
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:39,678
Let's meet at 19.00.

569
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:43,798
We have some things to work out.

570
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:55,318
Start eating first.

571
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:58,398
I'm not starving.

572
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:00,995
Correct.

573
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:04,595
The one who will help me will not starve.

574
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:05,715
help you?

575
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:08,675
Please take over Director Choi's job.

576
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:10,678
Manage my social media accounts.

577
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:15,278
You think I want to do something like that?

578
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:20,998
You're not even looking at me, are you?

579
00:43:21,419 --> 00:43:24,718
Of course. Your clothes are nice today.

580
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:32,955
You added a production team person without consulting me.

581
00:43:32,979 --> 00:43:33,875
Who?

582
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:35,355
Director Yu Jeong-seok.

583
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:38,155
Do you think I can be consulted?

584
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:40,135
Of course.

585
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:44,478
The Chief Creative Officer has the right to the personnel of the production team.

586
00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:55,975
This is why I can't eat with you too often.

587
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:00,635
You can do my bidding, take the money,

588
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:03,475
and entitled to be more arrogant than others.

589
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:05,635
Why are you trying to climb up?

590
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:08,675
Why does someone this great need me?

591
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:10,515
I needed you earlier

592
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:12,878
but now they don't.

593
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:17,515
Before becoming a king, one needs a reliable partner.

594
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:19,555
But after becoming king,

595
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:23,398
they just need a servant to obey them.

596
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:31,998
I understand why Director Han-na doesn't like you.

597
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:35,755
Just do as you please.

598
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:39,435
I will also obey my heart from now on.

599
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:41,198
You will regret it.

600
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:48,278
Who?

601
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:49,999
Me?

602
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:54,598
Regret is only done by people who have lost a lot.

603
00:44:56,139 --> 00:44:58,798
Who has more to lose here?

604
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:15,118
Hey.

605
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:16,435
Congratulations, Han-su.

606
00:45:16,459 --> 00:45:18,478
I heard it from my father.

607
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:20,918
I was just about to call you.

608
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:23,035
Why?

609
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:25,575
Help me get something done.

610
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:32,675
Why did you suddenly stop the ad?

611
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:35,358
I will call you again.

612
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:38,839
"VC Fire Chief, Park Eun-ju"

613
00:45:43,419 --> 00:45:45,359
Did something happen at headquarters?

614
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:47,975
They stopped the ad?

615
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:49,335
Of.

616
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,858
Only until Go Ah-in left.

617
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,538
How will you handle it?

618
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:55,695
What do you mean?

619
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:59,258
The Head of Planning hinders the company's business.

620
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:06,255
It seems that Go Ah-in angered Vice President Kang yesterday.

621
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:07,815
Vice President Kang is angry...

622
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,458
and utilize its connection to stop all ads.

623
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,058
Director Yu, thank you.

624
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:19,575
What for?

625
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,778
It's because you broke Go Ah-in's peace of mind.

626
00:46:44,439 --> 00:46:46,395
Pack You.

627
00:46:47,279 --> 00:46:49,795
what needs to be done so far?

628
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:51,855
I'll be quiet when you come back...

629
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:53,855
because I understand your situation.

630
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:56,578
- But this... - Aren't you busy?

631
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,935
Instead of finding fault with me,

632
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:02,458
You better focus on cleaning up all of this.

633
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,735
This is the work of the Vice President of the head office.

634
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:09,579
He took advantage of his rich connections.

635
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:13,035
You know, right?

636
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,175
At the moment,

637
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,695
there is only one person in VC Planning...

638
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:19,818
who can solve this.

639
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:28,875
What are you waiting for?

640
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,658
You're not working?

641
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:39,858
Director, Vice President Kang stopped all agency advertising.

642
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:40,895
Why?

643
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:44,235
He did after meeting Director Go yesterday.

644
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,755
We haven't had good news in a long time.

645
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:51,815
Director Hwang,

646
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,578
if you suddenly stop advertising like that...

647
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,455
Since this is Vice President Kim Seo-jeong's order,

648
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,495
I guess you have no other choice either.

649
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:05,858
Okay. Ok, it is finished.

650
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,218
You are right.

651
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:13,135
But you said Jeong-seok told you?

652
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:16,395
Yes. He says there is only one way to solve it.

653
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,098
The trick is here.

654
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,058
I'm here for reciprocity.

655
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:38,135
Are you feeling better now?

656
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:42,138
Right after hearing that you and Kang Han-su's relationship had soured.

657
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:01,498
Take advantage of me.

658
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:04,695
You used me to finish...

659
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,195
problem with email to advertiser the other day.

660
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:12,618
I know too.

661
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:16,215
There's nothing I can do at this company now...

662
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:23,098
and in fact, I'm just Chairman Kang Yong-ho's daughter.

663
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:26,495
But that fact is the only way...

664
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:30,738
which can solve your problem now.

665
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:39,138
You don't need to ask anything more.

666
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:41,499
Just start?

667
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:46,458
Someone will be very disappointed.

668
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:48,655
- Who? - There is someone.

669
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:51,378
Someone who likes old-fashioned cream bread.

670
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:54,455
That is, too...

671
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:57,858
looks like i can work it out.

672
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:35,898
Since we started this, let's do it neatly.

673
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:39,978
Of course.

674
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,698
Where do we start?

675
00:50:54,959 --> 00:50:57,938
We must grant the request first.

676
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,855
I heard you stopped advertising my company.

677
00:51:10,879 --> 00:51:12,055
Advertisement...

678
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,495
we maintain it when we need it and stop it when we don't need it.

679
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:16,778
- That's it. - Who needs it?

680
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:18,499
Kang Han-su?

681
00:51:18,919 --> 00:51:20,015
What?

682
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:21,975
You did it because Han-su told you to?

683
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:25,335
He would be overjoyed if Kang Han-su looked at him.

684
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,935
Hei, Kang Han-na!

685
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:27,815
See, right?

686
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,018
He was angry because it was true.

687
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,615
Will such a person keep his promise?

688
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:35,178
Promise?

689
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,375
What?

690
00:51:36,399 --> 00:51:38,018
You do not remember?

691
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:39,895
Want to bet?

692
00:51:39,919 --> 00:51:41,655
Of course. I want to.

693
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:42,695
What are the stakes?

694
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,775
Grant the winner's wish, whatever it may be.

695
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:46,855
You can stop if you're not sure.

696
00:51:46,879 --> 00:51:49,699
Desire, whatever it is.

697
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:57,855
my request...

698
00:51:57,879 --> 00:52:01,935
you resumed all ads stopped now.

699
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:04,235
That...

700
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,338
It's a bit difficult now.

701
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:07,695
Just forget it.

702
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:09,778
what can you do?

703
00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:11,335
But...

704
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,935
if he can't make up his mind the company will do a commercial,

705
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:18,458
- What kind of vice president is that? - I will do it!

706
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,615
Hey.

707
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,455
Don't risk being scolded by Kang Han-su.

708
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:29,975
- Pretend I didn't talk. - What do you take me for?

709
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:32,218
If so, prove it.

710
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:42,578
"Marketing Director of Wuwon, Hwang Seok-wu"

711
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:47,178
Pak Hwang?

712
00:52:47,439 --> 00:52:51,378
Continue the VC Planning ad that we canceled.

713
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:54,738
Right now.

714
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:01,255
I got a call from Wuwon Group.

715
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:02,735
You've worked hard.

716
00:53:02,759 --> 00:53:05,218
However, it is not easy to make others understand.

717
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,975
I already guessed.

718
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:09,538
I'll keep trying.

719
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:12,835
Yes. I'll trouble you with that.

720
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,495
How much more do you need?

721
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:18,178
We only need 30 billion won.

722
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:20,975
Apart from large conglomerates,

723
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:22,455
are other companies...

724
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:25,755
who spent the 30 billion won marketing budget?

725
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:30,695
We just process the offer for the presentation.

726
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,855
We can collect smaller advertisers.

727
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:35,055
Even if you win,

728
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:37,455
The ad just aired a month ago.

729
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:39,098
What is the point?

730
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:43,578
Persuade existing advertisers. There is no other way.

731
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:46,855
Should I see the one from overseas?

732
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,135
We won't be able to persuade the people in Korea.

733
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,715
Are any of our former advertisers?

734
00:53:57,959 --> 00:54:00,378
Hello, this is Go Ah-in.

735
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,058
We can meet as soon as possible.

736
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:07,698
We're going there now.

737
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,179
Who's that?

738
00:54:11,399 --> 00:54:14,235
Looks like I'm not fated to die.

739
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,215
Flower?

740
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:27,018
High course.

741
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:29,415
How else?

742
00:54:29,439 --> 00:54:32,458
I can only borrow money here.

743
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,098
They may be willing to pay expensive advertising.

744
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:47,275
What was that three years ago?

745
00:54:47,299 --> 00:54:48,835
I guess we also want...

746
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:51,558
VC Planning took care of our advertising back then.

747
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:54,555
Is that so?

748
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:56,115
I don't remember that.

749
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:58,275
I forbid them.

750
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:01,155
After all, we will be rejected.

751
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:03,515
No other advertiser is treated like that...

752
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:04,995
with the money they spend.

753
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:07,115
Even the big models don't make commercials...

754
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:09,638
for the secondary financial sector.

755
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:13,915
Please tell me why you want to see me.

756
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:15,558
Director Go...

757
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:18,918
does money know nationality?

758
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:20,915
Of.

759
00:55:20,939 --> 00:55:23,155
How about color?

760
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:24,835
There are various colors too.

761
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:27,295
What about grades?

762
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:34,198
Money is just money.

763
00:55:34,659 --> 00:55:36,915
We were told to raise funds for Japan,

764
00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:39,035
we are said to suck the blood of the people.

765
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:41,395
This news has spread,

766
00:55:41,419 --> 00:55:46,198
but they came to us when they were pressed.

767
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:50,235
So, the thing is...

768
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:52,158
is your image?

769
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:55,155
You want us to make Human and Money...

770
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:57,195
have a positive image

771
00:55:57,219 --> 00:56:02,198
so that more people take loans here?

772
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:05,835
As expected, you really understand me.

773
00:56:05,859 --> 00:56:08,555
I heard rumours...

774
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:11,318
you are called money mad.

775
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:15,195
I'm still the same.

776
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:17,315
I love money.

777
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:19,918
Thirty billion, no need for presentation.

778
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:23,558
As long as you agree, I'll send the money right away.

779
00:56:27,939 --> 00:56:29,655
This...

780
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:34,398
very hard to refuse.

781
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,078
"Resignation letter"

782
00:56:59,778 --> 00:57:01,797
It's sudden.

783
00:57:03,178 --> 00:57:05,434
I can't increase sales by 50 percent...

784
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:07,314
in six months,

785
00:57:07,338 --> 00:57:10,114
So, I resigned as promised.

786
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:13,074
Isn't there still a way?

787
00:57:13,098 --> 00:57:15,554
All the major corporate ads that were discontinued,

788
00:57:15,578 --> 00:57:20,974
it's impossible to do that in three weeks.

789
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:27,317
Say how unfair you feel.

790
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:30,154
You lost what you almost achieved...

791
00:57:30,178 --> 00:57:32,274
because of the Vice President.

792
00:57:32,298 --> 00:57:34,634
Wouldn't internal employees admit it

793
00:57:34,658 --> 00:57:36,797
if you say so?

794
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,974
Whatever anyone says,

795
00:57:42,498 --> 00:57:45,197
I can't admit it.

796
00:57:45,698 --> 00:57:46,794
as an adult,

797
00:57:46,818 --> 00:57:49,277
I have to be responsible for my words.

798
00:57:56,258 --> 00:57:59,514
It's comfortable not having a voice in the company.

799
00:57:59,538 --> 00:58:03,334
There is nothing to worry about or there is no conflict.

800
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:05,037
However...

801
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:08,994
for the first time in ten years,

802
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:12,757
I'm sad I don't have the strength to do anything.

803
00:58:14,938 --> 00:58:18,757
I know you're worried about this.

804
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:24,357
Thanks for your help so far.

805
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:41,037
"Resignation letter"

806
00:58:41,178 --> 00:58:44,957
So, I still have work to do.

807
00:58:46,138 --> 00:58:47,957
"Resignation letter"

808
00:58:59,218 --> 00:59:02,158
It was a nice break.

809
00:59:19,137 --> 00:59:21,916
It's been a long time.

810
00:59:23,817 --> 00:59:25,876
He rejected it?

811
00:59:28,737 --> 00:59:31,916
Wait, I'll ask him and let you know.

812
00:59:34,177 --> 00:59:35,273
What does it mean?

813
00:59:35,297 --> 00:59:38,316
Director Go rejects Human and Money?

814
00:59:38,857 --> 00:59:42,996
Him rejecting it, means he will leave the company.

815
00:59:45,857 --> 00:59:47,956
Mr. Han, bring me a box.

816
00:59:52,457 --> 00:59:53,957
Kotak?

817
01:00:14,017 --> 01:00:15,073
Where's the box?

818
01:00:15,097 --> 01:00:17,636
Director Go, what are you doing?

819
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,353
What do you mean? I'm packing.

820
01:00:19,377 --> 01:00:21,476
Why are you packing?

821
01:00:22,417 --> 01:00:24,476
Because I have to keep my promise.

822
01:00:24,657 --> 01:00:28,716
Yes, but why reject advertisers and choose to leave?

823
01:00:29,697 --> 01:00:32,533
Because I'm the best at this.

824
01:00:36,097 --> 01:00:37,833
In life,

825
01:00:37,857 --> 01:00:40,593
Sometimes we have to hold back from acting...

826
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:43,636
because we are the best.

827
01:01:34,137 --> 01:01:36,593
I do not want. This is my pride as an advertising person.

828
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:38,753
You have to survive first.

829
01:01:38,777 --> 01:01:40,193
I want to meet him.

830
01:01:40,217 --> 01:01:41,713
How far will Go Ah-in go?

831
01:01:41,737 --> 01:01:43,673
Director Go, why did you say you want to quit?

832
01:01:43,697 --> 01:01:45,273
This old man...

833
01:01:45,297 --> 01:01:47,553
Who are you to dare to order me?

834
01:01:47,577 --> 01:01:48,753
I'll let you know...

835
01:01:48,777 --> 01:01:52,193
The way a VC Group has grown into a huge conglomerate.

836
01:01:52,217 --> 01:01:55,033
Why do I meet people who left me?

837
01:01:55,057 --> 01:01:57,633
Because our enemies are the same.

838
01:01:57,657 --> 01:02:00,916
This is what we prepared.

839
01:02:01,657 --> 01:02:03,633
People will make mistakes...

840
01:02:03,657 --> 01:02:05,393
when you thought it was over.

841
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:07,196
Just wait.

842
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,956
They will definitely make mistakes.
