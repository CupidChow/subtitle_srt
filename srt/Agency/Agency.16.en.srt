00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,595
The foreign exchange crisis, which occurred two years ago,

2
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,315
lead to IMF loans.

3
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:22,478
The impact continues...

"Loket"

00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:29,475
Excuse me. How much is a ticket to Seoul?

6
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,518
The price is 14,400 won.

7
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,575
"Loket"

8
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,318
Fourteen thousand won.

9
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:19,535
It's 14,100 won.

10
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:31,718
Only 14,120 won.

11
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:45,995
"Surat Renimaman"

12
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:47,475
"Hanuk University, Department of Economics"

00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:49,079
"Go Ah-in"

14
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,958
The last bus to Seoul is leaving.

15
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:05,495
I want to go.

16
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,995
"Surat Renimaman"

17
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,078
Although unable to attend,

18
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,735
I want to visit it just once.

19
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,719
"The name above is the new student of 1999."

"Surat Renimaman"

21
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:44,735
Let's see later.

22
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:48,958
I will...

23
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,958
more successful than all of you.

"If the wind doesn't blow, go ahead by rowing."

25
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,518
Why aren't you home yet?

26
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,318
There is something strange.

27
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:25,555
What?

28
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,955
I called and said...

29
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,318
VC Constructions has already chosen the model.

30
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,895
He reflects on his drunk driving mistakes last year.

31
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,199
But using it as a model...

32
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,915
Was VC Constructions calling?

33
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:46,195
I thought this was weird, so I investigated it.

34
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,275
Headquarters signed model...

35
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,095
then they told VC Constructions.

36
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,998
"Jo Yu-na"

37
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,598
Look at this.

38
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,038
You made a mistake at the right time.

39
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,958
I have to start making...

40
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:21,535
the Prince fell from his horse.

41
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:26,279
"Jo Yu-na"

42
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:34,035
What happened?

43
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:35,918
Let's act now.

44
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,195
did i make a mistake?

45
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,795
I have to check.

46
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:41,875
More correctly,

47
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,635
photos of Vice President Kang with Jo Yu-na.

48
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,595
Jo Yu Na? What's wrong with him?

49
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,555
He was in hiding after drunk driving.

50
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,758
Then he was chosen as a model for VC Constructions.

51
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:55,478
There was something between him and Kang Han-su.

52
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,315
Are you going to tease Kim Seo-jeong...

53
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,315
and lure Chairman Kim from Wuwon?

54
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,115
That is, too.

55
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,995
But what's more important is the evasion...

56
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:08,398
and defamation of the company's reputation.

57
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:12,875
It's too much to ask for a secretary...

58
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,038
to follow and photograph Vice President Kang.

59
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:20,198
Have them take Jo Yu-na's picture, not Vice President Kang.

60
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,515
What is the reason?

61
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:28,075
We have to check the skewed gossip on our brand models.

62
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:32,735
Coincidentally, we find Kang Han-su with him.

63
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,038
Yes. I'll prepare the rest.

64
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:42,438
I have a hunch.

65
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,358
Alarm goes off.

66
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,795
"Pukul 20.30"

67
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,758
God, no wonder my back started to hurt.

68
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,478
It's time to wake up.

69
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:18,595
Yes, Director Go.

70
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:22,718
"Lead, follow, or go."

71
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,875
To install Pak Khan.

72
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:29,715
Let's work on a VC Constructions commercial with Jo Yu-na as the model.

73
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:32,435
You want to continue, instead of replacing it?

74
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,435
Of.

75
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,635
There will be huge losses due to negative reactions.

76
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,315
That's why I did it.

77
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,918
Smeared the person who chose Jo Yu-na as a model.

78
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:43,638
I'll send you the script.

That brat.

83
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,078
I shouldn't pity him.

84
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,798
You think...

85
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:26,198
I don't have help like you?

86
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,195
Have you called Mr. Han?

87
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:31,295
- Not yet. - Fast.

Halo?

91
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,039
How is the result?

92
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,235
I'm in a meeting.

93
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,715
Hey. Make it look like...

94
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:52,555
Director Yu's personal deviation...

95
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:55,375
Chang-su. Wait a minute.

96
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:56,995
Can you clean up?

97
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,555
We don't always deal with things that can be fixed.

98

We force it to be in order whenever there is a problem.

99
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:08,638
Trust me. Don't act alone.

100
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:10,515
Okay.

101
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,478
Don't work today. Take time off and rest at home.

102
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,478
Okay.

103
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,736
Mr Kim. Are you planning on covering it up?

104
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,556
Are you crazy?

105
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,056
How can I cover the live evening news?

106
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,839
Contact the internal audit team...

107
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,959

Good, sir.

Forgive me. I shouldn't have said that.

110
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,559
Forgive me.

111
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,359
Will you forgive me just this once?

112
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,116
Of course.

113
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,156
I will forgive you just this once.

114
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,839

How can you laugh?

127
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,996
You know there will be an uproar...

128
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,876
if using Jo Yu-na as a model.

129

Correct.

But you still do it?

131
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,476
So, there must be an apology.

132
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,816
- Of whom? - You.

133
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,196
Why should I apologize for Kang Han-su's troubles?

134
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,839
If the other person apologizes for the trouble,

135
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,156
The person who apologized and handled it...

136
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,616
looks like a potential leader.

137
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,116
Are you ready to release the article?

138
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,916
I'm getting ready for release soon.

139
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,436
Director Han-na, upload your apology video...

140
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,716
on social media as soon as possible.

141
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,516
Release the article at 06.00 tomorrow so people can read it...

142
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,156
on the way to the boring office.

143
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,916
Do I have to upload the article on my social media too?

144
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,836
No, that might change the message...

145
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,036
from the deviation of Vice President Kang...

146
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,236
became a conflict between the successors of the VC Group.

147
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,596
I see what you mean.

148
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,436
Create an article title...

"Jo Yu-na in a love triangle,"

150
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,156
and what should be in it is...

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,156
"She's dating Kang Han-su, Vice President of VC Group,

Submit the article as soon as it comes out...

- You wanna check it out? - No.

155
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,479
Someone has to know first.

156
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,519
But he's your friend. You think that's okay?

157
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,640
I have to show it because we are friends.

158
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,279
Just leave it there.

159
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,296
I told you not to clean!

160

"She's dating Vice President Kang Han-su from VC Group."

161

The article will be released soon.

162
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,000
I think you should know.

163
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,676
"I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Kang Han-su."

164
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,436
You're crazy, huh?

165
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,959
If Chief Wuwon opposes it, it's all over!

166
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,656

00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,715
Even though it could end up as a raging storm?

333
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:28,998
Are you afraid of failure?

334
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:32,998
I must have misunderstood your character.

335
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:37,478
Just do it?

336
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:41,438
Succeed or fail, do it your own way.

337
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:43,998
Who knows?

338
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:46,718
Things you never thought might happen.

339
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,319
Like what?

340
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,878
"Lead, follow, or go."

341
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,798
"Lead, follow, or go."

342
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,759
"Direktur VC Group Go Ah-in"

343
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:36,275
Halo?

344
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,598
Come into the meeting room. Alone.

345
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,638
Can we do it in a day?

346
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:45,158
We have to find out.

347
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,798
Tonight will be quite long.

348
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:09,195
- Keep your shoulders straight. - What?

349
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:11,435
Straighten your shoulders and relax your face.

350
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,959
Stand there.

351
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,475
Correct. From now on,

352
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,198
let's start the presentation to win hearts...

353
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:32,678
shareholders.

354
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:53,715
Han-na isn't home yet?

355
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,275
Or did he leave early?

356
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:57,995
She must be partying with her friends.

357
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:59,838
Is it true?

358
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:02,598
Does he have time for that now?

359
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,318
Yong-ho.

360
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:07,239
Of.

361
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,958
Are you busy today?

362
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,075
No, my schedule is not tight.

363
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:14,355
Then why eat in a hurry?

364
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,278
I didn't eat well last night.

365
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:18,959
I'll go first.

366
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:30,435
How was your meeting with Seo-jeong?

367
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,095
It's done.

368
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:33,795
Is it true?

369
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:36,775
I promised him it would not happen again.

370
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:38,519
Very.

371
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:41,115
Do you think Grandpa didn't notice?

372
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,915
He hasn't said anything yet.

373
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:44,755
Even if he knew, it didn't matter.

374
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:48,055
We just need Chief Wuwon on our side.

375
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,315
I heard you're having lunch with him today.

376
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:54,115
I will go with him to the shareholder meeting.

377
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:56,155
You should also come with Seo-jeong.

378
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:57,679
Good.

379
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,775
That's all my presentation.

380
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:06,598
"Thank You."

381
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:14,198
You are now at the level of a competent senior manager.

382
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,558
Good work.

383
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:22,795
Not everyone can develop overnight.

384
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,555
Stop praising me.

385
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:26,558
Irritating.

386
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:30,915
Your appearance is part of the presentation.

387
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,035
Take care of your appearance.

388
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,078
See you at 13.00.

389
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:46,719
Irritating.

390
00:31:58,139 --> 00:31:59,315
A-ji!

391
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:03,198
You don't want to say goodbye? Mother is going to work.

392
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:06,855
Eun-jeong, can we talk for a moment?

393
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:16,515
Yesterday, A-ji had a big fight in kindergarten.

394
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:17,795
Why?

395
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:18,755
While singing...

396
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,155
"Calf, calf, spotted calf,"

397
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:23,995
the other kids make fun of A-ji...

398
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:25,995
because of the name

399
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:28,918
and said calling his name instead of mocking.

400
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,075
I like the name.

401
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,995
I think that's sweet.

402
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:41,995
Eun-jeong.

403
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:44,595
- Yes? - That's not your name.

404
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:47,278
That's his name all his life.

405
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,535
Okay.

406
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,718
I'll think about it.

407
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:12,555
How are Seo-jeong and Kang Han-su?

408
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:15,198
They met yesterday and made up.

409
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:21,078
Chief Wuwon is definitely on Kang Han-su's side.

410
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,835
- What is it? - What do you mean?

411
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:34,955
You said performance was part of the presentation.

412
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,435
Why haven't you changed your appearance yet?

413
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:38,875
I won't be attending the shareholder meeting.

414
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:40,915
Why don't you come?

415
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:44,775
I work for an agency. and act as a representative.

416
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:48,995
Since I have completed the task, you acted alone.

417
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:52,398
But you can guide me.

418
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,115
Are you nervous?

419
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:56,038
Of course.

420
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:58,718
I believe you will do well.

421
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,318
Because I worked so hard to prepare it last night?

422
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,838
No, because you're nuts.

423
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:09,275
Keep on what you're doing.

424
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,635
Win or not, it doesn't matter.

425
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:14,198
Go out there and do it with confidence.

426
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:18,718
I've prepared it strategically,

427
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,478
So, it's time to act the crazy woman?

428
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,819
"The 56th VC Group Shareholders' Meeting"

429
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,579
Thanks to you, everything will end well.

430
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,556
Thanks to me?

431
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,896
It's a win-win.

432
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,339
We own stock in each other's companies.

433
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,939
The kids will be arriving soon. Come in.

434
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,419
When should I enter?

435
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,856
Since you weren't invited, get in on time...

436
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,579
so they don't have time to kick you out.

437
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,500
Okay.

438
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,416
"We're going in..."

439
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,236
We'll be in on time.

440
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,299
I will keep you posted.

441
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,459
"The 56th VC Group Shareholders' Meeting"

442
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,416
Shareholders, thank you for coming...

443
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,979
even if your schedule is tight.

444
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,699
We will start the VC Group shareholder meeting.

445
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,976
Make way!

446
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,899
Step aside.

447
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,576
What are you doing?

448
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,496
Director Han-na is one of the shareholders.

449
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,376
Why couldn't he attend the meeting?

450
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,779
We're just following orders.

451
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,380
This is my order.

452
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,779
Step aside.

453
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,140
Hey.

454
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,419
Who are you people who dare to block me?

455
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,939
Director Kang Han-na.

456
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,576
You must go.

457
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,736
No.

458
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,536
I understand how you feel, but what can you do now?

459
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,299
That is none of your business.

460
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,856
Don't block me.

461
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,380
Director Mr.

462
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,576
Go away.

463
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,459
Go away.

464
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,256
What are you doing?

465
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,356
What are you doing, Yeong-wu? Take the Director away now.

466
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,656
You want a drink?

467
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,699
No, I'm waiting to hear back.

468
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,536
You should have gone to the shareholder meeting.

469
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,616
Why are you here?

470
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,556
We are not leaders.

471
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,056
Oh it's like that.

472
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,616
The situation is smooth thanks to the quality of the leader.

473
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,139
Things don't go smoothly because it's our fault as servants?

474
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,376
I also have to do marketing research.

475
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,656
About what?

476
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,876
Depends on the news.

477
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,496
I don't know if I will continue to work...

478
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,836
or open a restaurant like you.

479
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,676
Open a restaurant?

480
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,936
You're not cut out for the service industry.

481
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,216
Good grief.

482
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,616
I think you better get drunk.

483
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,259
Why did you go?

484
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,036
If you stay with the agency, you will be better off.

485
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,940
Hey.

486
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,076
I'm sick and tired of ads.

487
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,259
Ji-wu's wedding goes smoothly because of that.

488
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,436
You haven't changed.

489
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,576
What do you mean?

490
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,756
You're a bad liar.

491
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:18,499
He hasn't contacted me, meaning they weren't at the meeting.

492
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,139
- Unlucky. - Make way.

493
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,476
We'll start...

494
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:38,156
Vice President Kang Han-su...

495
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,159
as vice chairman.

496
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,239
You can't give up yet, can you?

498
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,576
If the door doesn't open,

499
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,616
we have to break it.

500
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,640
All of you.

501
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,636
How dare you stand in my granddaughter's way?

502
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,479
Grandpa.

503
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,656
Hello, Main Chief.

504
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,936
Are you also secretly behind this?

505
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,576
This is Chief Kang's order.

506

It's true you're helpless.

Things went smoothly because of the owner.

508
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,679
Things got worse because of the servant's fault.

509

What?

510
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,119
Someone has to take responsibility.

511
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,679
- Hey. - Yes, Main Chief.

512
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,839
Why is there a tie on your wrist?

513
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,519
Well...

514
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,079

How can he walk...

517
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,959
You don't know? My grandpa can walk.

518
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,680
So why is he in a wheelchair?

519
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,876
Why do you think I hate walking?

520
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,136
I inherited his nature.

521

Halo.

526
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,080
I'm Director Kang Han-na from VC Planning.

Do not laugh.

531
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,856
How many times do I have to tell you to stop?

532
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,956
You want me to pout?

533
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,039
You just need to keep smiling gently.

534
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,439
The bright expression on your face makes the presentation seem unbelievable.

535
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,999
Start from scratch.

536
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,876
You may remember the problem that existed at VC Constructions...

537
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,476
for using models who drive while drunk.

538
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,239
As a result, there were around 57,800 negative posts on social media.

539
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,040
Then there are 121 negative articles published.

540
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,636
Why do you think this happened?

541
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,679
I heard because of the scandal of a director at VC Planning.

542
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,839
Of course, but only outside.

Hands.

544
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,439
Stay ahead.

545
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,856
It's out of habit.

546
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,036
After all, America's CEO had his hands in his pockets.

547
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,836
- It's no big deal. - Are you in America?

548
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,556
Arrogant attitude...

cause negative feelings in others.

550
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,436
So? You want me to stand like a sinner?

551
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,616
Humble attitude, but confident.

552
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,876
Remember that.

553
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,759
Humble, but confident?

554
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,676
You think that makes sense?

555
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,800
Why don't you tell me to make a hot iced Americano?

556
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,676
What's important is the content.

557
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,356
What's the point of wasting time on this?

558
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,196
Besides the content, what matters is the form.

559
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,876
As important as the shape is your attitude.

560
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,636
Your appearance, actions, and attitude during the presentation.

561
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,476
Those elements are the first to be seen by the viewer.

562
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,716
You have to stop whining, and try.

563
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,359
Start from scratch.

564

You mean there is an internal reason?

00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,519
Of course.

567
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,316

she modeled for a billion won.

571

The reason?

572
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,319
- What's that? - Who's that?

573
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,399
I already guessed.

Good grief.

575
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,519
I leave it to your imagination.

576
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,959
However, if my speculation is correct,

577
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,776
this is dereliction of duty...

578
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,156
by embezzling company funds.

579
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,680
plus,

580
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,156
when I counted the time and cost...

581
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,999
to recover the loss,

582
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,999
the amount of losses borne by the VC Group...

583
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,240
about 1.2 trillion won.

584
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,876
Look at that.

585

How could it be?

What will he do now?

587
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,656
Hard to believe.

I can not raise the position of people who harm the company.

If so, you mean...

Hey, listen.

Does your daughter have to marry my granddaughter to maintain our relationship?

no regrets, but what's in it for you?

Hey, jerk.

Han-su, I can forgive you once,

Drink, pay, and go.

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,716
By the way, where's Director Go?

663
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,100
I want to pay.

664
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,796
The price is 5,000 won.

665
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,060
You work hard.

666
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,156
Thank You.

667
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,836
Director Go.

668
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,036
How are you?

669
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,620
Why are you here?

670
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,416
I got promoted.

671
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,516
Happy

672
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,716
I said I got promoted.

673
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,676
Again, safe.

674
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,339
I'm here to keep my promise to you.

675
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,139
Wait a moment. I will find another way.

676
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,020
Drink it.

677
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,116
- What? - You have to drink a lot today.

678
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,976
Director Go.

679
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,356
- Hey, Su-jeong! - Good grief.

680
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,336
Halo.

681
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,979
Thank You.

682
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,976
- You are okay? - Yes.

683
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,740
No, but I'll be fine from now on.

684
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,459
What? You hear him?

685
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,176
See how straightforward he is.

686
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,976
Director Han-na, how about you lead the toast?

687
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,136
Thank you to all of you.

688
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,256
All of this is thanks to you.

689
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,436
Drink it. Today, I'm going to MBP!

690
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,540
MBP?

691
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,376
How can you call yourself

692
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,056
great VC Planning exec...

693
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,419
if you do not know this new term?

694
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,299
- All right, cheers! - Cheers.

695
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,096
I will go.

696
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,456
Follow the second chapter.

697
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,496
The staff also seemed calmer.

698
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,096
I'll be in the second round

699
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,836
but to cheer, not to congratulate.

700
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,736
You are right.

701
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,779
One person's victory is another person's loss.

702
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,980
I go.

703
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,556
- Congratulations on cutting him off. - What is this?

704
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,936
Hey. Making fun of someone has a time and a place.

705
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,979
I'm not mocking you. I'm serious.

706
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,899
People think we do as we please,

707
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,579
but you know the reality is not so.

708
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,659
You may be annoyed right now, but this is for the best.

709
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,716
Why do you have an arranged marriage?

710
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,900
Then, who will you be with?

711
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,616
Someone who only likes me.

712
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,816
Hey, there's no one like that these days.

713
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,539
There is. He just so happened to be nearby.

714
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,116
You bad girl.

715
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,156
You think you're smart, huh?

716
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,316
I will drink with you all night.

717
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,259
What's everyone doing?

718
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,716
A-from

719
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,716
This is the last time Mother can call you that.

720
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,236
You will change my name?

721
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,116
- You made the right decision. - Nice thought.

722
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,700
"Song Su-han"

723
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,416
I like this name.

724
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,916
I'm no longer Song A-ji!

725
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,616
This is good.

726
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,939
By the way, what does it mean?

727
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,376
What?

728
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,656
- So... - This must have some meaning.

729
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,056
I guess we can't say...

730
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:56,979
this has no meaning...

731
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,136
so.

732
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,916
Mom, I don't care what it means.

733
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,616
I named him so that he would live a long life.

734
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,776
Long live? Like soldiers?

735
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,216
No.

736
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,336
You don't remember?

737
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,336
There's a comedy show where people name their kids...

738
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,299
to live long.

739
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,976
Kim Su-han-mu...

740
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,616
Bangau School-school...

741
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,936
Sam-cheon-gap-ja Dong-bang-sak...

742
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,216
I shortened it to Su-han, so, your full name...

743
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,256
Song Su-han-mu...

744
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,176
Bangau School-school...

745
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,216
- Honey! - Eun-jeong!

746
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,816
Mom!

747
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,256
What?

748
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,416
Song Su-han-mu...

749
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,976
Bangau School-school...

750
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,860
Sam-cheon-gap-ja Dong-bang-sak.

751
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,376
Correct!

752
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,276
Sam-cheon-gap-ja Dong-bang-sak.

753
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,699
God, the soup is delicious.

754
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,496
Auntie, can you give me some more soup?

755
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,419
Excuse me.

756
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,436
Hey, Eldest Grandson.

757
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,076
- Yes. - Sit down.

758
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,739
No, thank you. I have business.

759
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,419
Sit down!

760
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,179
spend. Until there is not a single grain of rice left.

761
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,139
Correct. Good work.

762
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,539
This is just the beginning. You can't get tired easily.

763
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,740
Yes, Grandpa.

764
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,776
Ya, Pak.

765
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,156
Don't avoid it because it's uncomfortable.

766
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,896
If you're used to running from the hard stuff,

767
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,256
your whole life, you will live as a loser.

768
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,780
Han-su.

769
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,696
That's it.

770
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,616
- Ya. - Ya.

771
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,776
Keep fighting.

772
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,780
I will be on the winning side.

773
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,259
Hanna, daddy...

774
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,899
I know you did it for me.

775
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,896
If so, will you forgive me?

776
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,616
Forgive you for what?

777
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,636
Father who must forgive me.

778
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,816
What for?

779
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,536
Instead of according to your wishes, I live according to mine.

780
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,936
You don't need my apologies for that.

781
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,339
I should have supported you.

782
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,056
Wait a moment.

783
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,659
Being on top of the world might be hard,

784
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,796
but I'll get us on top of Asia.

785
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,259
I must live long.

786
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,299
- We're off. - Wait.

787
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,016
- Hold out your hand. - My hand?

788
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,540
Of.

789
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,956
It feels good.

790
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,796
"One Notification"

791
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,376
Dating someone, Mr. Park Yeong-wu,

792
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,396
there is no matchmaking in my life.

793
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,716
Madam Director, delete it quickly.

794
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,499
should?

795
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,179
- I'm not kidding now. - So?

796
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,059
In that case, I have to go back in.

797
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,099
Why? What?

798
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,236
It's Han's.

799
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,496
You really want to date me?

800
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,276
Yes, I want to.

801
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,116
But Mr. Park. Why use casual language?

802
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,796
09.00 to 18.00. Work hours have not started.

803
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,316
I also do not know.

804
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,476
Let's just do it.

805
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,496
You're going to use formal language again at 09.00?

806
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,419
I'm just kidding about casual language.

807
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,736
Why? Continue. That's sexy.

808
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,076
Director Kang, is that what you like?

809
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,496
If so, I'll take it back. I don't want to date you.

810
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,579
What? Mr. Park!

811
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,176
"Selamat, CEO Go Ah-in. Dari Staf VC Planning."

812
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,376
"Congratulations on your promotion, CEO Go Ah-in."

813
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,939
can i see

814
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,096
Yes, that's great.

815
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,620
Flowers please.

816
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,580
This.

817
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,076
He's coming.

818
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,020
"Selamat, CEO Go Ah-in. Dari Staf VC Planning."

819
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,020
What?

820
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,940
The director!

821
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,380
"Selamat, CEO Go Ah-in. Dari Staf VC Planning."

822
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,699
CEO Go datang.

823
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,419
Congratulations on your promotion.

824
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,336
Mr Han. You know I hate this.

825
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,476
You can't always do the things you love in life.

826
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,419

Don't make trouble...

837
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,016
doing unsolicited things...

838
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,859

We don't make ads for money.

Good grief.

856
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,096
Wouldn't your baby be surprised if you got angry like that?

Right?

You named your baby Sa-ri?

No.

865
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,299
We don't just sell creative content.

866
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,779
Don't look at the size of the company. See the size of the creative content.

Why? You don't want a kimchi stew?

874
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,780
Have you eaten too often?

875
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,496
are you happy?

876
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,216

Not.

People must think...

891
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,576
if Go Ah-in becomes the president of VC Planning,

892
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,036
he will be satisfied.

893
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,436
People's opinions, huh?

894
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,956
Why should someone else define my limits?
