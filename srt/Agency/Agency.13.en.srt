1
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,516
Uncle.

2
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,119
Uncle Mun.

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,896
Come on!

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,040
What is it?

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,239
Did you buy banana milk?

6
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,396
Banana milk?

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,236
No.

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,596
Why not?

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,436
Uncle never said he wanted to buy it.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,556
Uncle said if I hold back tears,

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,396
Uncle will buy me banana milk.

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,516
Why do you want to cry?

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,476
dad came home late,

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,196
scary grandpa,

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,756
and Han-su...

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,799
don't want to play with me

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,800
So?

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,599
I miss you too.

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,999
I hold it...

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,239
to be able to drink banana milk.

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,760
In that case, Uncle should buy it for you.

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,520
Finally!

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,560
This.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,676
Uncle.

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,516
My life is hard.

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,516
You live in a nice house. Why is it difficult?

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,956
I don't think anyone is on my side in this world.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,236
That is not true.

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,676
Someone is in your favor.

30
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,796
Who?

31
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,356
Uncle.

32
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,676
Uncle is on your side.

33
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,716
Is it true?

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,836
Of course!

35
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,996
If you call me Uncle Mun-ho...

36
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,036
instead of Uncle Mun,

37
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,276
Uncle will always be on your side.

38
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,476
So promise...

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,196
Uncle will always be by my side.

40
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,720
Okay.

41
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,120
Segel.

42
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,436
Uncle promised

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,276
so, I will trust Uncle one hundred percent.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,316
Don't believe one hundred percent.

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,436
Why?

46
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,756
You can't trust anyone one hundred percent.

47
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,120
You can get hurt later.

48
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,996
I'll trust Uncle 50 percent.

49
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,520
Okay.

50
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,859
"Faith is the mother of deceit."

51
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,436
What are you waiting for?

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,456
Why don't you come down?

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,636
I'll stay in the car today.

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,376
Come down.

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,336
I don't want to go anywhere without you.

56
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,040
Again.

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,200
Again!

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,276
Hey.

59
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,800
Why are you stopping?

60
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,196
I stopped because the wine was about to overflow.

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,336
You decide?

62
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,716
Enough.

63
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,079
Why did you stop without my order?

64
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,316
You stopped pouring for fear the wine would overflow,

65
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,759
but I hear you are very confident.

66
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,239
You think getting an MBA puts you on par with us?

67
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,559
Forgive me.

68
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,639
You impertinent. Look who you're up against.

69
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,959
You impertinent. Look who you're up against.

70
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,316
He called me an hour after they met,

71
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,359
I mean, everything is going as I expected.

72
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,756
Is everything okay?

73
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,436
Hey.

74
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,359
Kang Han-na is really a psychopath!

75
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,876
What happened?

76
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,956
I stepped on his secretary like you told me to,

77
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,636
but suddenly he doused me with wine.

78
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,396
What's that?

79
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,236
He was raving about the Waitress Rule.

80
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,236
What?

81
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,996
Waitress Rules?

82
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,236
Are you out of your mind?

83
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,196
What are you doing?

84
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,916
I should be the one asking.

85
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,596
It's a business meeting, what are you doing?

86
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,756
Don't you know the Waiter's Rule?

87
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,676
Waiter?

88
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,556
People who treat servants and subordinates rudely...

89
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,516
definitely not a good business partner.

90
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,236
It's a business rule that CEOs around the world know.

91
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,876
We're here for a blind date. Why discuss business rules?

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,076
Listen,

93
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,036
i know you are here...

94
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,836
because I want to get married to tie up my family.

95
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,476
Then, this is business, right?

96
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,639
do you like me?

97
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,156
No.

98
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,716
You ordered a Bourgogne that I didn't like...

99
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,636
and this plate of snails.

100
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,076
What do you know about me?

101
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,036
We can get to know each other.

102
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,836
What do you mean know each other?

103
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,876
I only know one thing.

104
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,796
Your family's status in the economic world.

105
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,516
You are way below us, how dare to be impolite.

106
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,759
You dare to pour wine on my employees in front of me?

107
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,316
Your face is ugly,

108
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,716
you have no fashion sense,

109
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,396
and you also have no business manners.

110
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,056
Three fouls and you're out.

111
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,879
Go away.

112
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,439
He humiliated me like that!

113
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,436
Hang up. Let me check.

114
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,556
Hey.

115
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,080
Hey, wait.

116
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,799
Okay.

117
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,119
Should we make it fruitful now?

118
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,239
Is it true?

119
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,116
Glad to hear that, Ah-in. This is very nice.

120
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,596
What do you mean good?

121
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,476
There is one more person I must provide for now.

122
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,156
You say that, but I know you're not serious.

123
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,156
Hey, she gave birth to you.

124
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,156
Providing for it will give you strength.

125
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,159
Why is it giving me strength?

126
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,316
Even though you are disgusted and hate your job so much that you want to quit,

127
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,716
you endure it repeatedly for the sake of the people you support.

128
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,956
That's company life.

129
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,799
You did not know?

130
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,079
That's motivation to continue to provide for people who rely on you.

131
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,676
Your motivation is mature now.

132
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,879
You mean Ji Wu?

133
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,799
Of course. He's about to get married.

134
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,319
Ji-wu is getting married?

135
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,639
He hasn't even graduated yet.

136
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,596
He will graduate soon...

137
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,519
and want to study abroad with her future husband.

138
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,156
They can get married after returning from school.

139
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,916
His father-in-law...

140
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,559
next year also retired.

141
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,195
Have they made a reservation?

142
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:26,758
Not yet, why?

143
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:29,115
I have a discount for Hotel VC as an executive,

144
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,115
- So... - Hey.

145
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,995
Even if you use a discount, it's still a hotel.

146
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:34,518
How can I pay for it?

147
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,838
You don't drink?

148
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:43,398
Yes. I exercise.

149
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,638
Sport? What sports?

150
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,035
Running.

151
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,638
You?

152
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,438
In that case, I can't stay silent.

153
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:05,958
Are you size 37 or 38? What's your shoe size 38?

154
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,235
Why?

155
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,518
Wait.

156
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:11,119
Here he is.

157
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,078
I sent you a present.

158
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,075
Where did you get the money to buy me this?

159
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:20,555
You quit drinking, taking your medication, and decided to work out.

160
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,918
Can't I do it?

161
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:28,398
I'll buy Ji-wu a wedding dress.

162
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,919
Why?

163
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,635
Your daughter is getting married,

164
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:34,158
can't i do it

165
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:39,438
You're funny.

166
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:09,102
It's bad for his health...

167
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:20,822
"Vice President Director of VC Group Kang Han-su"

168
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:27,179
Hello, sir.

169
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:30,142
I've heard about this incident.

170
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:32,059
Forgive me.

171
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,862
Why are you apologizing?

172
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,139
Well...

173
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,739
it's in the Gangnam bar that he frequents, right?

174
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:40,659
Of.

175
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,179
Get out for a while.

176
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,823
I'm outside.

177
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:46,739
Now?

178
00:11:46,763 --> 00:11:48,382
Of.

179
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:51,519
Go out quietly without telling Han-na.

180
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:32,781
I don't want to waste my time, so I'll be honest.

181
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:34,178
Okay.

182
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:36,758
Keep on dating Han-na...

183
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:38,781
until married.

184
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,341
I will help you.

185
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:43,741
What do you think?

186
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,981
I see the advantage for you.

187
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:50,341
What's in it for me?

188
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,301
As I expected...

189
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:57,820
You'd be perfect as my sister-in-law.

190
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:00,380
If you're married,

191
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:03,377
I will give you 300 billion won in cash...

192
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,657
and company shares...

193
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:07,660
that will put you in charge of the subsidiary.

194
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,660
But...

195
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:14,497
I didn't know I was worth this much.

196
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:16,577
What do you mean?

197
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:19,057
If you're considering getting Han-na,

198
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,740
this is not much.

199
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,657
What else can be measured more with money...

200
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:26,717
for you and me?

201
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,660
What do you think?

202
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,257
think about it.

203
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:34,477
I'll be waiting for your answer.

204
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,381
Okay.

205
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:40,657
I've been worrying about it long enough,

206
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:43,220
but hearing your advice,

207
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:46,980
My mind is clearer now.

208
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,379
I will give you an answer soon.

209
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,459
Wake up.

210
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,339
From now on,

211
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,956
you have to wake up alone.

212
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,336
Pak Park,

213
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,776
why are you poor

214
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,196
Why?

215
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,856
Poor what? I work in a big company.

216
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,338
Why didn't your grandfather and father make a lot of money?

217
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,135
I'm not that great either.

218
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,098
Why is that?

219
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,375
I have ever too...

220
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,095
made a big mistake.

221
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:56,018
- What's that? - Bitcoins.

222
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,895
There are people who get 100,000 bitcoins...

223
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,018
by buying two pizzas.

224
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,898
If the highest value is 80 million won each,

225
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,018
the amount is eight trillion won.

226
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,575
Why am I working so hard at the company?

227
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:17,815
I should have stayed home and mined bitcoins. you agree?

228
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,738
You are right.

229
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,255
if you do,

230
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,935
we can definitely control Kang Han-su.

231
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,298
You are right.

232
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,698
If I do,

233
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,218
the situation will not be so confusing.

234
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,895
Ms Director,

235
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,138
i think i will die.

236
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:55,415
I will choke to death. Please release your grip.

237
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:56,575
I'm down.

238
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,978
I don't want to be carried anymore.

239
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,735
Is that so? If so, get off.

240
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,338
No. I changed my mind.

241
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:06,975
Come down.

242
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,578
I don't want to. I already paid you.

243
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,778
Carrying is not included in my salary.

244
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:16,915
How many? How much does the sling cost?

245
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:18,975
Just forget it.

246
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:22,175
What do you mean? So how much does it cost? I'm rich!

247
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,615
Free service.

248
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,698
I do it for free.

249
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,699
Lifetime?

250
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,535
Pain!

251
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,018
If you want that, come down.

252
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,535
Let's take a walk.

253
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:44,255
Walks are carried out on foot. What is this called a walk?

254
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,298
I said I hate walking.

255
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,698
You don't eat much. Why are you so heavy?

256
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,775
Welcome.

257
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,738
Sit down.

258
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,138
I'd like to see a two bedroom apartment.

259
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,898
will you live there?

260
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,778
No, it's for...

261
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,215
my mom.

262
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,978
For someone of a certain age,

263
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,615
there is this place...

264
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:21,415
its near a subway station.

265
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,775
There is also a place right beside the hospital.

266
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,535
for this place,

267
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,135
I don't think this fits.

268
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:30,895
This place is near the police station,

269
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,375
So, maybe noisy.

270
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,295
How is it safe?

271
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,658
As safe as the Blue House.

272
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,018
If so, I'll take this one.

273
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:42,694
Call this number, show me the place,

274
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:45,377
and call me if she likes it.

275
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:49,534
Are you Director Go Ah-in's mother?

276
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:50,454
Of.

277
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:52,254
Pleased to meet you. I'm a real estate agent.

278
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:54,817
Come on. I'll show you the apartment.

279
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,657
Please come in.

280
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,458
Ilsin Police Station

281
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,658
Your daughter is very filial.

282
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:45,698
The rent here is quite high.

283
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,115
The apartment is so nice that I feel terrible

284
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,138
Being my mother there...

285
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,935
Your presence there will help me.

286
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:53,178
I'll sign the lease.

287
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,458
Director Go, you called me?

288
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,498
Why didn't you tell me?

289
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,898
What? Tell what?

290
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,418
I met him yesterday. You can tell me.

291
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:20,818
- Yes. -It is okay.

292
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:28,095
You once told me to prove myself.

293
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,935
Prove you are of use to me.

294
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:33,935
Not as sloppy as Director Choi's orders,

295
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,018
but within your means.

296
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:39,275
So?

297
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:43,535
I don't have any skills I can prove to you.

298
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,276
I'm not like other people who can think of ideas.

299
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,896
I have no ability to show,

300
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,096
but I have the ability to do nothing.

301
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,699
I feel like my best effort is not to say anything.

302
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,899
Forgive me.

303
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,996
I don't know what happened, but I'm talking to you that way.

304
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,976
I'm sorry for that and thank you.

305
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,656
It doesn't matter. It's only natural that you act like that.

306
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,416
I'd do the same if I were you.

307
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,576
Why didn't you tell Director Choi?

308
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,936
If you tell him,

309
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,696
you can become a permanent employee.

310
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,816
I really want to be a permanent employee.

311
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,939
but I don't want to do it at someone else's expense.

312
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,579
I also want to be part of the team.

313
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,696
Tim?

314
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,656
Of.

315
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,316
Impossible for me to be part of the team,

316
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,256
But it's been eight years since I worked...

317
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,096
and i never feel like i fit anywhere.

318
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,156
This is the first time someone says I'm part of the team and family.

319
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,656
Are you presenting?

320
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,376
We are one, so, of course...

321
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,956
We're on the same team.

322
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,539
Eun-jeong said so?

323
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,780
Of.

324
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,136
you are the same

325
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,036
But I don't want to disappoint people who are good to me.

326
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,616
Director Choi's promise to you,

327
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,836
I will fulfill...

328
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,499
when I can do it.

329
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,736
Thank You.

330
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,419
But...

331
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,396
Director Choi threatens me to tell me to resign,

332
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,016
So, I had no choice but to say something.

333
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,716
About what?

334
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,819
"Prosecutor's Office, Prosecutor Kim Wu-seok"

335
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,180
Head of Planning and Head of Creative...

336
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,616
You two must be aiming for the CEO position.

337
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,656
Of.

338
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,139
In that case, the two of you must be rivals.

339
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,496
Correct.

340
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,579
So, the enemy's enemy is a friend?

341
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,779
Of course.

342
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,936
I like this.

343
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,816
I have come to convey my greetings.

344
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,656
I guess there's nothing to lose...

345
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,496
to know each other well.

346
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,020
In that case...

347
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,456
I'll give you something soon.

348
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,459
What can you do for me in return?

349
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,459
I will be loud.

350
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,376
I will tell all the employees...

351
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,296
regarding the information you provide,

352
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,276
like loudspeaker.

353
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,416
you are the same

354
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,859
But I don't want to disappoint people who are good to me.

355
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,616
Why? Does your back hurt?

356
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,936
- Youre here. - Youre here.

357
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,216
Which office worker...

358
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,179
who does not suffer from back and neck pain?

359
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,179
Isn't that right, gentlemen?

360
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,936
Ayo.

361
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,896
What?

362
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,659
Let's get out.

363
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,700
You must come too.

364
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,099
Halo.

365
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,376
These tables are becoming common these days.

366
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,336
I saw this in the movies.

367
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,416
People work standing like that in a place like Silicon Valley.

368
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,296
I've always wanted to try using that table.

369
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,096
But it's like a childhood punishment.

370
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,140
We have to stand like that if caught chatting in class.

371
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,896
Can't you read the situation?

372
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,336
Why spoil the mood?

373
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,339
Jang-wu, this is why you're single now.

374
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,299
You've been single since birth?

375
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,059
Of.

376
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,716
Welcome.

377
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,216
We came to see the table.

378
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,419
Let me introduce the product.

379
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,616
This will be much better than sitting all day.

380
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,776
I also like the sophisticated design.

381
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,736
How?

382
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,819
- I like it. - Me too.

383
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,819
I want to buy this.

384
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,499
I don't like it.

385
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,456
Why? You don't like it?

386
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,976
No. The table is very nice, but...

387
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,500
But?

388
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,339
This is not a company card, but your personal card.

389
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,496
It might be a bit overkill to buy this for us...

390
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,716
with your own money.

391
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,216
It doesn't matter.

392
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,419
I also owe you guys.

393
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,859
Owe us?

394
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,139
I'm serious.

395
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,756
Besides that,

396
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,139
let's have a team dinner.

397
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,236
- Team dinner? - Team dinner?

398
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,859
Your hearing is getting better?

399
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,696
I thought I was going to die.

400
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,776
That's why I told you to drink less.

401
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,356
My head is spinning, so don't nag me.

402
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,016
"Deputy Head of Department Park Yeong-wu..."

403
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,700
"rise to the position of Director."

404
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,179
It's time for me to tell you the results.

405
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,739
Why? What is it?

406
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,939
I understand. I'll drink less next time.

407
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,416
Eat this.

408
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,539
You like this.

409
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,096
Cartilage!

410
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,619
Mine is so little.

411
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,339
It's not cartilage.

412
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,816
So what?

413
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,216
Ears.

414
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,179
- What? - That's his ear. Pig ears.

415
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,716
Pak Park!

416
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,816
I already feel nauseous. Why tell me now?

417
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,496
Besides, does that mean you've been lying to me all along?

418
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,459
- Whenever I'm eating... - Madam Director.

419
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,496
Look around you.

420
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,579
What's around me?

421
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,216
I'm too embarrassed to stay here.

422
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,979
I have something to see, so I'll be going now.

423
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,936
You left me alone here?

424
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,499
Of.

425
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,500
Because you're an adult

426
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,259
you have to solve everything yourself.

427
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,496
Such a building...

428
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,816
would be worth around 50 billion won.

429
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,296
That one should be around 70 billion won.

430
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,976
The house on Jeju Island that my mother wanted to live in...

431
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,336
also only about one billion won.

432
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,939
If you have 300 billion won,

433
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,896
I won't worry about running out of money.

434
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,979
"Director Kang Han-na"

435
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,459
Don't call me.

436
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,379
That would shake me off.

437
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,776
The number you have dialed is not active.

438
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,779
He is really...

439
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,496
"Deputy Head of Department Park Yeong-wu..."

440
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,496
"rise to the position of Director."

441
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,256
Who am I

442
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,539
why use predictable method?

443
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,820
"Paman Jo Mun-ho"

444
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,779
You're in the office, right? I'm going there now.

445
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,216
Welcome.

446
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,996
Sit down.

447
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,656
Have you had lunch?

448
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,696
Yes, I ate blood sausage soup.

449
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,136
You must eat good food. Why eat that?

450
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,416
I like it.

451
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,616
I love soup and rice.

452
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,036
Nice to see you so honest.

453
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,499
I think I've judged you well.

454
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,699
Looks like you've already decided.

455
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,420
Of.

456
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,259
How would you like to proceed?

457
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,436
I will...

458
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,259
continue like this.

459
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,656
This is my answer for you,

460
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,939
So, I put it in a classic white envelope.

461
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,859
"Resignation letter"

462
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,339
Why are you doing this?

463
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,496
Was the money I offered not enough?

464
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,096
No.

465
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,376
I did my calculations on the way here,

466
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,816
and i realized 300 billion money...

467
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,896
is an amount I can never spend.

468
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,916
But this is your answer?

469
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,459
Of.

470
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,819
Hey!

471
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,939
Are you crazy?

472
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,936
Following Han-na makes you crazy like her.

473
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,939
Isn't that why you're trying to unite us?

474
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,299
Domestic harmony.

475
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,856
If your prediction is correct,

476
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,019
it's not a resignation, but a dismissal.

477
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,059
More precisely, it will be a dismissal by you.

478
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,856
What do you mean?

479
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,216
Will this promotion be justified?

480
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,379
He's using Mr. Park to bring you down.

481
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,136
- Even so... - You already know.

482
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,619
things could be like this.

483
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,936
If you're in touch with a maid,

484
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,696
it will be the end of your future.

485
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,776
You know that, right?

486
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,216
I could try talking to Grandpa about that.

487
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,376
Then the maid who was close to the young lady...

488
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,576
will be expelled without mercy.

489
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,056
There will be no synergy if we are together.

490
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,299
This will only be bad for both of us.

491
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,416
Instead of knowing it...

492
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,416
These are all the results of your words and actions.

493
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,940
Accept it.

494
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,296
In that case,

495
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,376
Does corporate life really have to give up easily?

496
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,496
Take the path others take...

497
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,456
Of course not.

498
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,976
Except, if you choose a different path from everyone else,

499
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,016
you also have to be ready...

500
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,859
to go through things that no one else has.

501
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,660
Hey there,

502
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,616
you have to get used to...

503
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,059
with rejection, defeat, and despair.

504
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,016
There is one more.

505
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,676
Lonely.

506
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,256
You can help me.

507
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,936
I cant do that.

508
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,496
How can I help...

509
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,419
the one who did the opposite of my suggestion?

510
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,556
You really...

511
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,576
Will you continue to act as if you are favoring others?

512
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,576
You forgot what I said?

513
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,576
You have to get used to rejection...

514
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,819
and at the same time, lonely.

515
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,856
I understand.

516
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,899
I'll take care of this myself.

517
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,939
You said you would always be by my side.

518
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,896
Live well alone,

519
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,979
Uncle Mun.

520
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,216
We'll know when we step on it...

521
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,176
will it die...

522
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,539
or conquer the opportunity to become a big tree.

523
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,819
Let me ask you this.

524
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,316
I really don't understand.

525
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,139
Please.

526
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,219
You like Han-na, right?

527
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,616
Of.

528
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,936
The amount of money is also not small.

529
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,696
The amount is huge.

530
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,179
Then why did you turn down such an offer?

531
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,576
I want to live happily.

532
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,219
How can you be happy if you don't have money?

533
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,016
If I take this money,

534
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,376
it's like pouring acid on Director Han-na's future.

535
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,819
Will that make me happy?

536
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,536
From what I see,

537
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,296
you don't seem happy.

538
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,896
What?

539
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,256
You said so when you made the offer.

540
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,896
You said it could be measured in money.

541
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,539
So?

542
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,376
It means...

543
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,579
You think everything can be measured in money.

544
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,936
Is there anyone you trust?

545
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,579
Can you love anyone?

546
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,356
Either I have 300 billion, three trillion, or 30 trillion,

547
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,216
if you have to compare love with money,

548
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,939
I will refuse.

549
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,156
If you live like that, you can't have anything.

550
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,956
Wouldn't you be cold...

551
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,219
as a poor man?

552
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,419
you see,

553
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,819
I'm not afraid of cold.

554
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,339
Live a warm life worth the money.

555
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,696
Mr. Park, what are you doing in the head office?

556
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,916
You must have come to meet the Vice President.

557
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,576
Director Choi,

558
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,659
live a warm life that is also worth the money.

559
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,716
Where are you from?

560
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,539
I have something to see.

561
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,119
What is it, that you don't answer my calls so many times?

562
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,699
You met Kang Han-su?

563
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,096
Of.

564
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,699
Why did you meet him? What did he say?

565
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,776
You think fighting with me will make me go berserk...

566
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,696
and you can use that as an excuse to quit?

567
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,059
Is that what you want to do?

568
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,436
As expected,

569
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,876
you get the hang of things like this quickly.

570
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,036
Do not tell...

571
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,836
did you submit your resignation letter?

572
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,096
Of.

573
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,456
What? You didn't even discuss it with me!

574
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,739
Why did you hand it over to Kang Han-su?

575
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,976
Mr. Park, what are you doing now...

576
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,136
easy to guess.

577
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,476
Not creative at all.

578
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,460
Ms Director,

579
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,979
life is like a play.

580
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,856
Get creative...

581
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,656
not well received by others.

582
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,499
Because you already know,

583
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,699
I don't need to explain anymore.

584
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,859
Do not insert the straw.

585
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,339
Grow up.

586
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,339
I will stop...

587
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,316
for good now.

588
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,499
If you leave like this, I won't see you again.

589
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,019
That's why I'm doing this.

590
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,296
Without you,

591
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,056
I will have no one in this world.

592
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,576
The only person I can trust 100 percent...

593
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,416
is you, Park Yeong-wu.

594
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,139
You don't know that?

595
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,396
I know.

596
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,356
I also know...

597
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,219
You can lose everything if I stay here.

598
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,396
I hope...

599
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,816
you learn a lot from this.

600
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,116
Some relationship...

601
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,819
does not create synergy.

602
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,759
I won't cry.

603
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,080
I...

604
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,136
won't cry.

605
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,679
I won't cry.

606
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,416
I've been working for 19 years,

607
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,199
but this time it's hard for me to save a promotion.

608
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,799
Where are you going?

609
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,759
Go home of course.

610
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,236
Leave him alone?

611
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,956
What would you do if you were me?

612
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,956
If you...

613
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,916
be a weakness...

614
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,120
for the person you love the most?

615
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,519
if it was me,

616
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,079
I will only think of my own benefit.

617
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,316
I did the right thing, right?

618
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,816
You will find out later.

619
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,319
I go now.

620
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,719
Pak Park...

621
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,319
Don't change your contact number.

622
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,379
Visits to nursing homes, visits to children's prisons,

623
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,576
and the hamburger encounter at the orphanage?

624
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,819
You're asking me to appear?

625
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,096
If you look at the next page,

626
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,216
there is also content aimed at the MZ generation.

627
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,696
Everything is such a waste of time and the same as everywhere else.

628
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,256
It's only natural that things are trending among the MZ generation...

629
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,016
such a waste of time for us.

630
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,016
That's why I pay you.

631
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,739
Make this trash look sophisticated.

632
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:43,339
Now I understand why Han-na wanted you to move to the district office.

633
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,256
Vice President Kang, I'll repeat myself...

634
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,736
If you do it again, will it be any different?

635
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,896
I will do the best.

636
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,536
Which is useful resign,

637
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,336
all that's left with me is nothing but nothing.

638
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,099
I should have let Director Go take care of it from the start.

639
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,976
What are you doing?

640
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,136
What?

641
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,656
Are you cold? Why are you shaking like that?

642
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,876
Some people don't even care about 300 billion won!

643
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,299
You only receive salary.

644
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,016
I'll be ready...

645
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,899
and give you another report.

646
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,656
What is it?

647
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,176
I have something to report to you.

648
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,460
What?

649
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,936
Princess Yu Jeong-seok is getting married.

650
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,756
Should I care about Jeong-seok's daughter's wedding.

651
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,856
When?

652
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,576
Therefore,

653
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,496
I will find out and tell you again.

654
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,056
Pak Kwon.

655
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,136
Yes, Director.

656
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,376
Sorry for raising my voice.

657
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,979
Good.

658
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,139
Thank You.

659
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,740
I'll let you know when I know the exact date.

660
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,856
Hey,

661
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,299
VC Hotel wedding room available right?

662
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,496
I plan on completing the Plan B I told you about.

663
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,259
Okay.

664
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,259
Let's wait and see...

665
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,579
is Go Ah-in going to do what the vice president asked.

666
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,299
Because he asked me to show my skills,

667
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,516
i have to do it.

668
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,616
You like that the most?

669
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,656
Of.

670
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,236
This is the most beautiful,

671
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,456
but too expensive.

672
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,976
Don't mind the price. Just choose what you like.

673
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,056
Still too much for me.

674
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,336
I'm not doing this for you, but for your father.

675
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,419
Jeong-seok won't accept anything from me.

676
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,136
Don't hate your dad so much.

677
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,896
Am I the one who hates it?

678
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,936
My mother hates it.

679
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,856
He often forbade her to stop working,

680
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,096
But in the end he resigned...

681
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,739
and started a business that failed.

682
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,356
At least don't hate your father.

683
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,456
Of course.

684
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,499
I received a gift of a beautiful dress.

685
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,056
Director Go, the first cup must be finished immediately.

686
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,456
If you stop in the middle, go home.

687
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,936
Just work overtime.

688
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,420
Don't drink half a glass, I don't like to drink half...

689
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,976
- Is this how you have fun? - Nope.

690
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,576
Only Eun-jeong does this.

691
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,816
It's a fancy team dinner. We have to liven up the mood!

692
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,196
Also, Jang Wu...

693
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,536
Of?

694
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,636
Why are you silent, unlike usual?

695
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,659
What do you mean I'm not normal?

696
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,979
do you like it?

697
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,459
That's what your expression says.

698
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,776
No, not like that.

699
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,976
So you don't like it?

700
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,739
No, not really.

701
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,380
I mean...

702
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,536
He may be a bit silly, but he is pure hearted.

703
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,496
Sure, she's smart and pure.

704
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,496
Well, let's stop here.

705
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,859
Eat your meat that weighs 1.5 to 2 kg.

706
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,496
You...

707
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,819
eat 1.5 kg of meat?

708
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,779
Depending on my condition on that day...

709
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,379
Is this what's been on my team all along?

710
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,776
How about you, Director Go?

711
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,819
What about me?

712
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,619
Was this my boss all along?

713
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,139
Take that away and let me pour you a drink.

714
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,379
It's convenient for me.

715
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,379
I'm not comfortable!

716
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,096
Okay.

717
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,219
Let me pour you a drink, Director Go.

718
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,740
This...

719
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,176
You can't pour your drink today.

720
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,696
I'm gonna pour it till my shoulder is gouty.

721
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,456
I'll do it until it sprains.

722
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,296
All right, come on.

723
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,516
Let's fill our glasses.

724
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:31,658
Director Go, please say something.

725
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:36,898
That's what I hate. Let's just drink.

726
00:52:37,919 --> 00:52:39,415
Okay.

727
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:44,315
Let's just drink!

728
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:01,938
just go.

729
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:05,295
What event is it?

730
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:07,835
Go Ah-in is having a team dinner.

731
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:16,655
There is an event.

732
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:19,258
He even took his secretary with him.

733
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:36,138
So?

734
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:38,455
Go Ah-in won't be able to...

735
00:53:38,479 --> 00:53:41,535
increase sales by 50 percent in six months.

736
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,695
So,

737
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:45,535
come back to the company.

738
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,855
I could be CEO...

739
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,315
and you could be the next creative head.

740
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:56,574
I will return the 10 million won.

741
00:53:56,598 --> 00:53:58,657

I heard your daughter is getting married.

00:54:29,118 --> 00:54:31,014
The company has a hotel.

746
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:34,777
Why are you having a wedding in the suburbs?

747
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:41,754
This is your only daughter's wedding.

748
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:44,534
You're attending her wedding as a bar owner...

749
00:54:44,558 --> 00:54:46,934
or a conglomerate ad agency executive?

750

Hey Cow!

751
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:51,497
You want your daughter to be belittled like you?

752
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:54,814
You have to have the power so that the in-laws don't act arbitrarily.

753
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:56,857
You don't know that?

Is Go Ah-in more important to you than your daughter?

I will keep my first promise to Director Go.

Made him a university professor.

757
00:55:15,757 --> 00:55:17,733
Director Go will become a university professor...

758
00:55:17,757 --> 00:55:20,333
while you take his place.

759
00:55:20,357 --> 00:55:22,713
Both sides win.

Nice to chat on the way here.

Is anyone getting married?

Ji-wu had his wedding at the VC Hotel?

Why don't you tell me...

Why didn't you tell me?

Correct. I was about to call you.

But, Great Senior,

786
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:43,140
I didn't want to say this before

787
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,297
but what about a former commercial copywriter...

788
00:57:46,321 --> 00:57:48,741
made a spelling mistake?

789
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:51,580
What do you mean?

790
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:53,980
That word...

791
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:58,900
it shouldn't be spelled HOPE, but HOF.

792
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:03,340
Why misspelling?

793
00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:09,317
Many people expect this glass of beer.

794
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:13,078
Good grief.

795
00:58:13,682 --> 00:58:16,421
As expected of a former script writer!

796
00:58:22,842 --> 00:58:26,378
I just wrote the script like a former screenwriter.

797
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,578
I get inspiration from novels by my favorite authors.

You feel uncomfortable with me?

801
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:40,381
Am I too loud?

802
00:58:42,522 --> 00:58:44,338

805

This is the reason we have to get married.

806
00:58:59,641 --> 00:59:00,817
I mean,

807
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:03,297
must be very complicated...

no longer have hope.

01:03:34,336 --> 01:03:37,712
I must apologize for making her look peaceful.

835
01:03:37,736 --> 01:03:41,632
Keeping employees comfortable at your side...

836
01:03:41,656 --> 01:03:42,752
failed the company.

837
01:03:42,776 --> 01:03:44,112
Increase sales 50 percent.

838
01:03:44,136 --> 01:03:46,472
As long as I finish it, everything will go smoothly.

839
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:48,472
Why did you suddenly stop the ad?

840

I guess you're a lucky man.

841

It's hard to meet loyal employees these days.

843

You will soon receive a call from the HR team.

844
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:58,312
You have to get stronger.

845
01:03:58,336 --> 01:04:00,552
Why are you getting weaker?

846
01:04:00,576 --> 01:04:01,872
Take advantage of me.

847
01:04:01,896 --> 01:04:03,515
Correct.

848
01:04:04,776 --> 01:04:08,155
It's not over until it's really over.
