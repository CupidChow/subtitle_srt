00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,256
thirty billion,

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,736
no presentation needed.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,819
As long as you agree, I'll send the money right away.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,336
I hear you're having a hard time...

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,379
and that's what you need.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,196
You're fast.

7
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:33,496
without it,

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,380
hard to manage this business.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,499
The offer...

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,499
hard to resist...

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,876
But I...

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,739
refuse

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,716
If sales don't reach 30 billion won,

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,579
You have to stop, that's what I hear.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,576
That's right.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,419
But you refuse?

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,579
Yes. Forgive me.

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,056
If this is about...

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,016
afraid of being found out by people in the industry,

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,336
just do it...

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,436
without mentioning the VC Group and your name.

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,619
Are you also ignoring me?

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,696
We are registered with the Financial Services Authority...

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,216
and business loan agents...

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,740
Pak.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,899
That's not the reason.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,939
This is for personal reasons.

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,376
Where's the box?

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,336
Director Go. What are you doing?

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,056
Especially? I'm packing.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,819
Why are you packing?

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,259
To keep my promise.

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,499
Yes, but why reject advertisers and choose to leave?

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,579
Because I'm the best.

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,976
Sometimes...

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,499
i have to stop...

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,699
because I'm the best.

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,420
Director Go.

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,296
Your position is related to us.

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,619
We deserve to hear...

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,059
your reason for rejecting it.

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,139
You know...

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,756
What does it feel like when a moneylender visits your home?

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,939
When parents owe without being able to pay off,

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,980
You know the situation their children are in?

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,576
- Open the door! - Mother.

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,776
I know you're in

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,456
Open the door now!

49
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,016
Already opened.

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,816
- Where's your father? - Where is your mom?

51
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,656
You know where they are. Say it now.

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,180
Reply me.

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,099
I very much...

54
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,739
know it.

55
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,180
Of.

56
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,136
I'm the best at this.

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,976
I can create a positive Human and Money image...

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,616
and get people to borrow money...

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,099
even when they don't need it.

60
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,496
But what do you expect...

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,939
I cause people to suffer the same?

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,576
Because I'm the best

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,499
there is something i can't do.

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,779
Nonetheless,

65
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,540
you should worry about yourself first.

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,136
This conscience...

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,496
what I should uphold as a human being...

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,176
and my pride as an advertising agent.

69
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,739
I do not want.

70
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,140
Let me help.

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,136
"The things I want to do."

72
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,896
"Things I can't do."

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,256
"Things I have to do."

74
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,979
"Jaksa Kim Wu-seok"

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,776
Yes, Prosecutor Kim.

76
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,836
I sent something.

77
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,696
Yes, I just received it.

78
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,296
"Doctor's Note"

79
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,416
What do you think?

80
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,459
It's louder time for action, right?

81
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,119
That wasn't the reaction I was expecting.

82
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,559
Absolutely not. Thank You.

83
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,956
But...

84
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,639
It's too personal?

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,876
In a conservative Korean conglomerate company,

86
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,316
a person who takes psychiatric medication as often as he eats...

87
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,279
is the boss?

88
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,639
Doesn't he seem unstable?

89
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,119
You are right.

90
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,156
Thank you for the information.

91
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,279
I will look forward to the results.

92
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,576
"Direktur Choi Chang-su"

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,656
He's late.

94
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,416
What's the point if the game is over?

95
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,560
Good grief.

96
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,760
"Doctor's Note"

97
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,616
I haven't been to this house in a long time.

98
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,656
No problem.

99
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,676
Reciprocal relationship...

100
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,159
must be clear in this agreement.

101
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,799
So, say what you want.

102
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,959
Advertisement suspended Vice President Kang Han-su,

103
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,039
please continue again.

104
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,080
Just that?

105
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,559
You'll know what I'll ask in return, Mun-ho.

106
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,719
It's been 20 years since I worked for you.

107
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,596
You think I won't know?

108
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,796
That's an advantage for me.

109
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,036
I will appreciate it

110
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,599
but you lose.

111
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,636
What is your relationship with Go Ah-in?

112
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,199
Why are you doing this?

113
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,476
Are you just going to watch...

114
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,756
the fall of a fast-growing company?

115
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,196
No. I won't let it.

116
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,399
So do I.

117
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,799
I want to see...

118
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,759
how far will Go Ah-in act...

119
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,476
and what are the actions.

120
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,239
God, Mun-ho. You're getting old.

121
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,199
You're good at dumping someone, not supporting someone.

122
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,636
Of.

123
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,116
The ad.

124
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,799
Lanjutkan semuanya sekarang.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,199
Ini Go Ah-in.

126
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,960
Apa?

127
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,119
Ya, aku mengerti. Terima kasih.

128
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,239
Semua iklan yang ditangguhkan sudah dilanjutkan lagi.

129
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,200
Apa?

130
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,996
Itu berarti...

131
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,196
kenaikan penjualan 50 persen.

132
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,799
Apa yang terjadi?

133
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,676
Direktur Go. Kenapa kau berhenti?

134
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,336
Direktur Kang. Terima kasih.

135
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:13,958
Sudah kuduga kau akan melakukannya!

136
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,215
Aku?

137
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:20,215
Apa yang kulakukan?

138
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:28,558
Ini bukan ulahku.

139
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,875
Lantas siapa yang melanjutkan iklan yang ditangguhkan?

140
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,158
Hanya ada satu orang...

141
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,798
yang tahu semua urusan di perusahaan...

142
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,199
dan bisa membujuk Ayah atau Kakek.

143
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,958
"Kantor CEO"

144
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,998
Kau mau menemuiku?

145
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,415
Kita sering bertemu hari ini.

146
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,975
Kaukah orangnya?

147
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,935
Apa maksudmu?

148
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:23,015
Papan Baduk sudah tidak ada.

149
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,918
Sudah saatnya berhenti.

150
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,639
Apa kau...

151
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,615
menemui Ketua Utama?

152
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,315
Apa yang kau berikan padanya untuk menyelamatkanku?

153
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,718
Untuk mendapatkan keinginanku, aku memberikan keinginannya.

154
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,718
Kau tak perlu khawatir.

155
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:54,118
Aku hanya perlu melakukan yang biasa kulakukan sebelumnya.

156
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,599
Or do you have to do what you don't want to do?

157
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:59,615
One can't just...

158
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:04,918
do what he wants to do.

159
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:09,615
Thank you very much. I'm embarrassed.

160
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,215
You know what's really embarrassing?

161
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:15,758
Disappointed me.

162
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,758
Make sure my investment in you doesn't fail.

163
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,795
What should I do?

164
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,255
Do what you think is right.

165
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,558
As you have until now.

166
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,398
Help Han-na too.

167
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,278
Good, sir.

168
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,455
Once again, thank you.

169
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:59,398
It is time.

170
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,755
Who?

171
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,398
Who dares to cancel the Vice President's order?

172
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,755
What are you doing?

173
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,918
Is he crazy?

174
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,955
Who else?

175
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:15,195
One of them.

176
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:18,118
- Hey. You think... - CEO Jo...

177
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:20,755
meet the Principal Chief.

178
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,279
CEO Jo?

179
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:25,275
Why did the old man meet the Main Chief?

180
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:28,558
Are you pretending to be stupid or are you really stupid?

181
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:29,515
What?

182
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:33,159
CEO Jo is his former right-hand man. She's the secretary to the Main Chief.

183
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,756
Good grief. That's an old story...

184
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,136
Parents work the old way...

185
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,680
that's how to manage a big company.

186
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,479
However, your plan failed.

187
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,279
Cari cara lain.

188
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,840
Orang tua itu...

189
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,376
Kau pikir, apa yang kau lakukan?

190
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,076
Diam saja sampai kau pensiun.

191
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,439
Apa yang telah kau lakukan?

192
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,200
Duduklah.

193
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,476
CEO agensi khawatir dengan penjualan agensi.

194
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,996
Apa itu masalah?

195
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,076
Ini bukan hanya mengenai penjualan.

196
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,076
Ini mengenai orang yang akan menjadi CEO berikutnya...

197
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,516
antara Direktur Go dan aku!

198
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,436
Kenapa kau ikut campur dalam permainan ini?

199
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,656
Ini curang!

200
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,119
Kau menjadi lemah,

201
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,839
melihatmu bicara soal curang.

202
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,396
Maksudku, kau...

203
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,920
Dengar.

204
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,039
Omong-omong,

205
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,959
kalau ingin jadi CEO berikutnya, kau harus membuktikan dirimu.

206
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,196
Apa?

207
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,076
Penjualan Direktur Go meningkat 50 persen...

208
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,476
dalam enam bulan terakhir.

209
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,119
Kalau begitu, kau juga harus tunjukkan sesuatu.

210
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,276
Astaga.

211
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,999
Kenapa...

212
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,599
aku harus mengikuti perintahmu?

213
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,836
Kau pikir siapa dirimu sampai berani memerintahku...

214
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,159
Hei! Direktur Choi!

215
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,556
Atasanmu memerintahkanmu untuk meningkatkan penjualan,

216
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,119
tapi kau sebagai direktur menolak di hadapannya?

217
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,016
Waktumu sebulan.

218
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,799
Increase sales by 30 billion won.

219
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,976
You have to do it to sit here.

220
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,256
I mean...

221
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,476
- How do I... - Director Choi...

222
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,756
I will teach you...

223
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,336
how the VC Group became a big company.

224
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,896
Get out.

225
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,559
Come out and bring me the results!

226
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,320
You think that makes sense?

227
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,476
You broke your promise because of Kang Han-na?

228
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,000
Well...

229
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,400
I promised Han-na first.

230
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,279
I promised him in front of my friends.

231
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,676
I have to keep my pride.

232
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,236
You only care about who dresses better...

233
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,676
or thinner.

234
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,759
Isn't that so?

235
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,516
I know you're upset, but you have to watch your mouth.

236
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,040
What?

237
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,876
So you can criticize what I say?

238
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,636
If you have to fight Han-na, then do it.

239
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,916
Don't involve me.

240
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,439
Since we're getting married, you have to get involved!

241
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,896
Correct.

242
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,839
The idiots he hangs out with won't know that.

243
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,956
What did you say?

244
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,316
You hear me.

245
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,319
Don't fantasize.

246
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,556
You're not the only kid with VC Group.

247
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,396
It's up to me to decide my company's advertisement.

248
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,436
Up to you?

249
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,479
Isn't it because of Han-na?

250
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,759
When will you walk away from him?

251
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,496
That is true.

252
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,536
You're trying to do it by marrying me.

253
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,136
So you can beat him just once.

254
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,456
Damn it

255
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,496
You're so selfish.

256
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,919
You act like you know everything

257
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,680
but you never cared to keep your mouth shut.

258
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,496
How can you talk to your fiancé like that?

259
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,279
If you'd been nice from the start, I wouldn't have spoken like this.

260
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,599
Be like everyone else.

261
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,879
Like humans.

262
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,080
Of course.

263
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,159
I will take your advice.

264
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,639
"Seoksan Group, Kim Wu-bin"

265
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,876
Vice President Kang Han-su.

266
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,356
Are you drinking?

267
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,936
- Of course. - Where?

268
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,116
Same place?

269
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,676
Of course.

270
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,796
How can I have fun when I'm being watched too much?

271
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,716
Wait for me.

272
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,356
I will be there.

273
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,896
You? Here?

274
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,796
Why suddenly?

275
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,976
So I can live like a human.

276
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,596
Finally you're an adult.

277
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,996
Hurry up.

278
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,656
Welcome.

279
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,359
Yes. You have to come here now.

280
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,239
Take a chance while you have it.

281
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,399
- Create multiple designs then choose. - Yes.

282
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,319
What is it?

283
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,116
Create a presentation.

284
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,596
I have to increase my sales by 30 billion won this month.

285
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,336
All of a sudden? Why?

286
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,276
- You can take care of trifles. - Okay.

287
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,999
You can take care of Wuseong Milk, Jeong-seok.

288
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,836
"Nama Bisnis, Wuseong Milk"

289
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,116
"Production Cost, 20,000,000,000 Won"

290
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,516
The bill is high if 20 billion.

291
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,596
Consumption of milk has dropped dramatically recently,

292
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,396
So, they want to do aggressive marketing.

293
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,996
That's because the price of milk goes up...

294
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,996
and consumption of imported milk is increasing, right?

295
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,636
Solve this problem first...

296
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,016
There's no need for that. Just choose the direction of the sales promotion.

297
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,116
Director Yu, we have a secret weapon,

298
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,436
So, don't worry about losing the presentation.

299
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,279
Hey.

300
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,936
I'm just saying we have to be more positive.

301
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,599
Yes, all right?

302
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,559
Isn't it obvious...

303
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,919
VC Planning receiving assistance from VC Group?

304
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,036
Of course.

305
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,119
Yes. All right.

306
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,736
Of.

307
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,560
Oh it's like that.

308
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,519
Good grief. I am very tired.

309
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,639
It must be hard for you to work after all this time.

310
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,236
Why do they suddenly want a presentation?

311
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,636
Director Go really does increase sales, right?

312
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,799
That's because CEO Jo asked him to...

313
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,036
Good grief.

314
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,436
I guess we'll be working overtime for a while.

315
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,116
Good grief.

316
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,656
I'm so sick and tired of working overtime.

317
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,436
Since starting tomorrow we're working overtime, why don't we go have a drink?

318
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,200
But we have to take care of our health.

319
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,159
Very?

320
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,336
In that case, okay.

321
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,916
I have a corporate card because I'm an executive,

322
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,556
but what's the use?

323
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,359
I have no one to drink with.

324
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,879
Go home and sleep early, Mr. Kwon.

325
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,876
We have an opening meeting today.

326
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,839
It's a shame to go straight home.

327
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,919
- You know a good place? - Of course.

328
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,159
How? Do you want to go there?

329
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,880
Ayo.

330
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,159
Hey, isn't she Jo Yu-na?

331
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,479
What is he doing here?

332
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,400
He acts as if he is better than anyone.

333
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,799
He was caught driving while drunk, so he went into hiding.

334
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,199
He needed a footing if he wanted to come back.

335
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,276
Will the head of the VC Group help him?

336
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,559
I guess it depends on the ability.

337
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,720
Did something bad happen?

338
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,436
Yah...

339
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,956
You can tell me.

340
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,156
You?

341
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,839
It's easier to open up to people you don't know.

342
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,239
Sir, I'm...

343
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,320
good at drinking

344
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,960
Why do you think I'm driving drunk?

345
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,520
Besides that...

346
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,439
I can't remember what I heard when I was drunk.

347
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,039
Who pissed you off?

348
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,276
People who should...

349
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,016
obey...

350
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,559
I ordered.

351
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,879
In that case, we must have met by fate.

352
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,279
I do whatever I'm told.

353
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,079
I barely made it.

354
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,759
Now I just need to return what I got from Kang Han-su.

355
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,719
You can forget what the Chief Master said.

356
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,436
- What do you mean? - He told you to be...

357
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,736
the pressure between Han-su and Han-na.

358
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,956
Of.

359
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,236
You don't need to worry about that...

360
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,936
because I decided...

361
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,936
become stressful for them.

362
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,559
"Attachment, One Photo"

363
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,479
"Tanpa Judul"

364
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,316
"I've been sleeping well since moving in."

365
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,536
I've been sleeping well since moving here.

366
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,936
I feel shameless, but this is good.

367
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,156
"I've been sleeping well since moving in."

368
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,396
"I feel shameless, but this is good."

369
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,999
I'm glad at least one of us got a good night's sleep.

370
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,438
The person I have to look after...

371
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,815
give me motivation.

372
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,195
I want to change it.

373
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:38,315
How many times do you have to refuse?

374
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,235
Why did you change your nickname?

375
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:42,635
The kids kept making fun of my name.

376
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,635
Like what?

377
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,595
They kept calling me Calf (songaji).

378
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:49,535
Why is Song A-ji called Song A-ji considered mockery?

379
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:51,715
What was your nickname when you were little?

380
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:54,998
What? My name is Rice Fish (songsari).

381
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,115
Oh it's like that.

382
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,115
Hey, you know what your mom called you when you were?

383
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:02,295
Mother was called Rowing (jojeong) because of the name Jo Eun-jeong's mother.

384
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,359
This.

385
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:11,795
You should be teased by your name at your age.

386
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:13,875
But it's good for you.

387
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:16,035
They call you Song A-ji.

388
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:17,515
Why is it considered a nickname?

389
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:19,115
Why is it considered mocking?

390
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:21,799
- But still... - Look.

391
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:23,755
It's A which means "I".

392
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:26,275
Ji means "to know".

393
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:27,355
A-from

394
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,035
Get to know yourself.

395
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,235
You know how important that is?

396
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:34,555
Even Socrates said, "Know thyself."

397
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:35,835
Means...

398
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:37,875
Anyway, you can't change your name.

399
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:40,855
It's the best name for Mother, so why change it?

400
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:45,555
I still hate my name, so at least change my surname.

401
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:48,895
your surname? To change it...

402
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:50,995
Hey, Husband.

403
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:53,935
Our son forced me to divorce you.

404
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:57,718
Why do you say such ridiculous things to children?

405
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:00,515
See, right? You can't change your name or surname.

406
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,255
- Mom goes. - Good grief.

407
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:12,358
Good morning.

408
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:14,835
Any good news?

409
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:16,915
Sales are up 50 percent.

410
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:19,675
People might think you did it.

411
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:23,235
Of course, we achieve it together.

412
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:28,278
Eyebrows, nails, nose hair and heart. Together.

413
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:32,355
Since we've worked hard, let's have a nice lunch later.

414
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:33,879
You can too.

415
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:45,238
My back hurts.

416
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:49,038
Because I'm always working overtime, my back hurts.

417
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:57,278
I want to live long and healthy in this beautiful world.

418
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:06,695
- Good morning. - Hello.

419
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:08,515
Why are you standing?

420
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:11,595
Director Go bought this for me.

421
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:12,875
Because I stand while working,

422
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,975
My back hurts less and I can focus more.

423
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:19,035
Good grief. You're so smart.

424
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,115
Very good.

425
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:22,235
Director Go is in his office?

426
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:25,638
"Direktur Go Ah-in"

427
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:35,399
Happy

428
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:39,255
The problem is solved thanks to you.

429
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,115
Don't thank me. It's a win-win.

430
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:42,435
You are right.

431
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:45,678
Because it's a win-win, you also have to get reciprocity.

432
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:46,595
What?

433
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,975
You have to find someone to work for you.

434
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,195
You're going to meet him alone to persuade him?

435
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:54,315
No.

436
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:56,195
There's no point in me seeing him.

437
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:59,118
You have to meet him yourself.

438
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:02,319
He didn't want to work with me, so, what did I do it for?

439
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,035
Why are you saying things you don't want?

440
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:11,555
Saying things like that won't help you at work.

441
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:13,835
If you have nothing to say, just shut up.

442
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:15,715
If you have something to say,

443
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:17,715
You have to be clear about what you want...

444
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:19,815
on other people.

445
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,915
What tone is this...

446
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:24,079
that sounds like lecturing me?

447
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,835
- Sounds like it? - Yes.

448
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:29,558
You are right. I'm lecturing you.

449
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:31,795
Why are you lecturing me?

450
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,238
Because I promised.

451
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:36,955
Take your pick.

452
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:40,235
You want to listen to me and get what you want?

453
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:43,495
Or do you want to act prestige and lose your will?

454
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,075
Do you consider that as an option?

455
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:49,399
It seems you want me to do as you say.

456
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,155
I will also promise you something, Director Han-na.

457
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:55,115
What's that?

458
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:58,575
I will never lie to you or take advantage of you again...

459
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:03,695
and I will teach you all that I can teach you.

460
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:13,319
So...

461
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,358
What should I do?

462
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,376
Let him know it's not a weakness.

463
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,756
What weaknesses?

464
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,796
Mr. Park left because he thought...

465
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,356
he is your weakness

466
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,756
So, he's not coming back, whatever you say.

467
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,356
In that case, I must commend him...

468
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,516
then say he is the best and i need him?

469
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,456
You think that's persuasion? It's tempting to me.

470
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,599
Do not be angry.

471
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,239
Don't show your emotions.

472
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,456
Speak confidently.

473
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,399
Then say what?

474
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,439
"I need you."

475
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,439
"To get my wish,

476
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,599
I need you."

477
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,396
Not interested.

478
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,236
What? Are you kidding?

479
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,436
Why do you open the door, but close it again?

480
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,156
How can I let in...

481
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,600
people looking at me like they want to kill me?

482
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,320
Open.

483
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,416
Why make me angry when I want to have a nice talk?

484
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,896
What do you bring?

485
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,756
Gift.

486
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,319
It's ice cream.

487
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,759
Mint chocolate, right?

488
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,520
Of.

489
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,399
Who brings their own favorite when visiting?

490
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,759
I'm so pissed off I think I'm going to eat it as we speak.

491
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,040
Please.

492
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,640
Eat and calm yourself.

493
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,036
I'll be frank.

494
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,560
I...

495
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,356
need you.

496
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,496
I'll also be frank.

497
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,400
I...

498
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,496
I don't need Kang Han.

499
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,716
Don't get mad when you talk.

500
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,996
Speak quietly.

501
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,616
Understand?

502
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,876
You have to be stable.

503
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,216
That way, he could believe and come back.

504
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,599
You are not my weakness.

505
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,336
I will admit I made a mistake.

506
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,840
I'm being childish, I'm saying...

507
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,936
will change the world.

508
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,536
I learned a lot this time too.

509
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,439
Forget Kang Han Na...

510
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,360
in the past...

511
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,016
I won't scream anymore.

512
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,836
"Don't act up."

513
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,079
Do you decide?

514
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,456
You're so rude. Unlucky.

515
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,759
Mr Park! What's that?

516
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,236
You should just forget about it.

517
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,079
Why are you hanging and looking at it?

518
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,536
Don't smile. Does this situation look interesting?

519
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,400
By the way,

520
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,996
didn't you say you won't scream anymore?

521
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,816
Park Yeong-wu, you keep pissing me off!

522
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,436
Appropriate.

523
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,756
You should be able to work quietly,

524
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,760
So, how do you work with people who make you angry?

525
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,800
Come back.

526
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,216
Return...

527
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,496
and stay by my side.

528
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,799
Why?

529
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,280
I...

530
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,760
afraid

531
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,736
Someone might judge me,

532
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,399
someone might try to bring me down,

533
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,160
or maybe someone...

534
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,679
Because you're not around,

535
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,856
office so very scary.

536
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,476
Get back to work.

537
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,296
I have a plan.

538
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,640
What's that?

539
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,236
What?

540
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,176
What is your plan?

541
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:32,840
You see.

542
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,000
You don't have a plan, do you? You're just talking.

543
00:36:38,501 --> 00:36:40,477
All right, no plans.

544
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:44,177
The Kang family motto is say it and deal with it after.

545
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:54,240
Damn it

546
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:56,400
That jerk.

547
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:02,200
"Direktur Go Ah-in"

548
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:10,897
You didn't change your number.

549
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,117
No.

550
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:14,120
Have you met Han-na?

551
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:16,157
He just left.

552
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:18,640
Does he talk to you calmly?

553
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:20,841
Impossible.

554
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:22,797
Why don't you go back to work?

555
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:24,840
You have something to do with me.

556
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:27,037
Work?

557
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:29,677
me, you,

558
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:31,397
and Director Kang Han-na.

559
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:34,560
The three of us have a common enemy now.

560
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:36,497
Is it possible?

561
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:40,000
Do I look like someone trying the impossible?

562
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:42,320
You're not that kind of person.

563
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:44,577
I must return the favor.

564
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:46,077
Of course.

565
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:49,201
It's rude if you...

566
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,961
not return the favor.

567
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:54,682
Alright then.

568
00:37:54,862 --> 00:37:57,001
"Direktur Go Ah-in"

569
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:38,201
There's more synergy...

570
00:38:39,022 --> 00:38:41,041
than I expected.

571
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:55,358
"Don't act up."

572
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:58,801
Should I start acting up?

573
00:39:10,423 --> 00:39:13,659
We will be able to settle all arrears of monthly salary.

574
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:19,119
It's not that people don't drink milk, but they want imported milk.

575
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:20,679
Yes, one of the main reasons

576
00:39:20,703 --> 00:39:22,719
the decline in sales is that many prefer...

577
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:24,679
cheap imported sterilized milk.

578
00:39:24,703 --> 00:39:26,799
Like the strategy of the Korean beef association...

579
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,519
improve meat quality

580
00:39:28,543 --> 00:39:31,319
should we improve the quality of Korean milk?

581
00:39:31,343 --> 00:39:33,679
Freshness is most important in milk.

582
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:34,719
Okay.

583
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:37,679
- Develop character too. - Character?

584
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:38,639
Lately,

585
00:39:38,663 --> 00:39:40,719
people buy bread to collect Sticker Stamps.

586
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:43,719
They get cards for their character designs.

587
00:39:43,743 --> 00:39:46,039
If we can't differentiate our products,

588
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:49,359
we have to attract customers in other ways.

589
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:51,379
Okay.

590
00:39:52,983 --> 00:39:54,479
Who wants coffee?

591
00:39:54,503 --> 00:39:56,003
- I. - I.

592
00:39:56,503 --> 00:40:00,879
One venti blond caramel...

593
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:03,242
double macchiato.

594
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:06,639
mint chocolate...

595
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:08,279
cold brew with foam.

596
00:40:08,303 --> 00:40:10,339
Height.

597
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:13,562
Isn't coffee from a coffee shop enough?

598
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:15,479
They are embarrassing.

599
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:17,003
"Yu Jeong-seok"

600
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,562
I will order again. Excuse me.

601
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:21,723
Hey, Traitor.

602
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:24,762
What? Are you near the office?

603
00:40:27,263 --> 00:40:28,719
Director Yu.

604
00:40:28,743 --> 00:40:31,162
You look fine.

605
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,879
You look quite handsome...

606
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:35,483
to become one of Eulsa's Five Traitors.

607
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:40,619
Are you going to keep teasing me?

608
00:40:41,503 --> 00:40:44,802
No, I'll stop. I've teased you enough.

609
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:47,842
Anyway, be safe.

610
00:40:48,543 --> 00:40:51,402
Nothing is more important than making a living.

611
00:40:54,183 --> 00:40:57,162
Hey, I know best.

612
00:40:57,903 --> 00:41:01,082
I know what it's like to have a hard time after your company went bankrupt.

613
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:04,762
I dread my employee's payday.

614
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:19,002
Say. I am busy.

615
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:26,999
Didn't you make a proposal for Wuseong Milk?

616
00:41:27,023 --> 00:41:28,159
Of.

617
00:41:28,183 --> 00:41:31,419
Jeong-min, cancel the proposal.

618
00:41:31,703 --> 00:41:33,203
Why?

619
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:41,459
Tell the truth. Are you up to something?

620
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:45,802
Of course there is.

621
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:48,499
What's that?

622
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:53,879
Mr. Kwon, you disappointed me.

623
00:41:53,903 --> 00:41:56,239
Aren't you, Chang-su, and I a team?

624
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,319
Director Choi told me to keep it a secret.

625
00:41:59,343 --> 00:42:01,879
I'm in charge of Wuseong Milk's proposal,

626
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:04,179
but I have no information.

627
00:42:04,423 --> 00:42:05,923
Correct.

628
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:08,339
It's a secret huh...

629
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:14,699
The company will help us.

630
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:25,079
What is it? Say.

631
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:27,199
Just stop it. It's for your own good.

632
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:28,723
For my sake?

633
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:30,279
Good grief.

634
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:34,642
I don't know with other people, but you can't do this to me.

635
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,442
After setting up an independent agency,

636
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,399
you are ruled and broke.

637
00:42:41,423 --> 00:42:43,019
Of all people...

638
00:42:46,703 --> 00:42:49,682
Whatever you have planned, do as you please.

639
00:42:50,343 --> 00:42:52,979
I'm sure about this proposal.

640
00:42:53,663 --> 00:42:57,002
- Jeong-min, don't be stubborn. - Hey.

641
00:42:57,703 --> 00:43:00,403
You know how long I haven't paid my employees?

642
00:43:00,503 --> 00:43:04,202
Do you know how much I spent on this proposal?

643
00:43:06,143 --> 00:43:08,319
I will do it even if I don't win.

644
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:09,843
Up to you.

645
00:43:41,064 --> 00:43:43,683
Sir, are you all right?

646
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:48,320
Mr. Park, why are you here?

647
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:49,960
Do you have to ask?

648
00:43:49,984 --> 00:43:51,883
I'm back.

649
00:43:53,024 --> 00:43:55,200
You're like someone who just came back from vacation.

650
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:56,763
You are right.

651
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:00,163
I guess I spent my vacation this year.

652
00:44:11,104 --> 00:44:13,000
What's wrong with you?

653
00:44:13,024 --> 00:44:14,200
What?

654
00:44:14,224 --> 00:44:16,840
You know the reason I treated you as vice chairman...

655
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:19,260
while keeping it a secret from your grandfather?

656
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:23,683
To make your relationship with Han-na better.

657
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:26,080
Are you going to snap at him again...

658
00:44:26,104 --> 00:44:28,760
just because Mr. Park is back at work?

659
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:30,360
No.

660
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:31,920
I see what you mean.

661
00:44:31,944 --> 00:44:36,400
Winners must act like winners.

662
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,220
It is my fault.

663
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:44,300
You get along with Seo-jeong?

664
00:44:45,824 --> 00:44:47,600
Just keep being nice to him.

665
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:49,800
If the Chairman of the Wuwon Group feels offended,

666
00:44:49,824 --> 00:44:51,963
we will lose everything.

667
00:44:52,104 --> 00:44:53,843
Good.

668
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,660
Excuse me.

669
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,836
What? Why are you here?

670
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,476
You told me to get back to work.

671
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,476
You're acting like you're not coming back, you bastard!

672
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,639
I think it's impolite.

673
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,236
In front of whom? I?

674
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,679
No, someone else.

675
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,876
You said you had a plan.

676
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,400
Please tell me.

677
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,856
I don't have any.

678
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,439
Then who has a plan?

679
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,639
No, I don't have a plan.

680
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,839
I wish Director Go had a plan.

681
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,316
If so, do it now.

682
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,136
I'm not a vending machine making plans.

683
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,799
At this time, it's best to wait quietly.

684
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,516
When they think they won and it's over,

685
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,659
they must have made a mistake.

686
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,016
What if it's too late?

687
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,496
Instead of attacking recklessly and being completely defeated,

688
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,996
it is better to amuse your opponent by playing dead.

689
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,060
Wait.

690
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,379
They will definitely make mistakes.

691
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,956
Just three months.

692
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,616
It took that long to show...

693
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,376
great freshness...

694
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,256
and premium value Wuseong Milk.

695

"Wuseong Milk"

696
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,656
"Thank You."

697
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,516
Those are our campaign proposals.

698
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,020
Yes, that's it.

699
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,096
I want to ask one more thing.

700
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,656
"Kampanye Premium Wuseong Milk"

701

"Launching 2023 Sticker Stamp Trend"

702
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,096
It's called a Sticker Stamp.

703
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,936
Like when buying bread for a Sticker Stamp,

704
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,456
We want to create a trend...

705
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,459
people buy Wuseong milk to collect Sticker Stamps.

706
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,179
That's a great idea.

707
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,056
I'll explain the details after the presentation.

708
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,259
That's all our presentation. Thank You.

"Wuseong Milk"

710
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,336
Then, finally, would you like to see what VC Planning has prepared?

711
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,456
"Wuseong Custom Campaign Execution Schedule"

712
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,576
Based on an aggressive and active campaign,

713
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,536
we intend to rethink the image of Wuseong Milk...

714
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,339
and expanding the Korean dairy consumer base.

00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,059
Any question?

718
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,516
- Otherwise... - We'd like to make another offer.

"Tawaran VC Planning"

721
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,298
The aim of this ad is...

722
00:48:16,399 --> 00:48:19,515
increase in sales of Wuseong Milk.

723
00:48:19,759 --> 00:48:21,259
Is it true?

724
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:22,779
Of.

725
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,255
We, at VC Planning, won't tell you...

726
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:29,535
This ad might increase your sales.

727
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:32,535
We would like to promise certain improvements...

728
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,378
in sales figures.

729
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,578
How could it be?

730
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,298
It's a subsidiary of VC Group.

731
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,375
If VC Planning and Wuseong Milk work together,

732
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:54,175
in all VC subsidiary canteens,

733
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,258
we will provide...

00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,618

I'll explain the details,

737
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,855
like the number of canteens in the VC Group...

738

and the number of people consuming it...

after presentation.

740
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,415
Your proposal is much better.

741
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:42,738
So, please submit your proposal to VC Planning.

742
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:46,175
We will guarantee a deal next year.

743
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:48,455
I assume we will vote that way.

I'm sure it will make me look great.

I said I'd buy a drink, not a snack.

Large companies...

793
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:51,978
give their project to their own agency.

794
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,975
Companies that don't have an agency think...

795
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:56,495
large companies are already in power and stable,

796
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,935
so, they only work with big corporate agencies.

No parent tells their child to work in an agency.

00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:27,735
All parents will tell their children...

804
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,475
be a teacher, because it's stable,

805
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,075
or work in a bank after graduation.

806
00:56:34,879 --> 00:56:36,455
Why do you work at the agency?

807
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:38,498
I hear the salary is great...

808
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:40,055
and we can move up...

809
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,858
purely because of the talent in the industry.

810
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:47,778
What talent. Who's telling you?

811

There's no time for regrets.

Don't try to live a certain way.

Just live.

00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:44,075
"We are temporarily closed."

833
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,938
"Go Ah-in"

834
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:12,658
Hey. Are you in front of the shop?

835
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:14,695
What are you doing, Jeong-seok?

836
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:16,295
Why did you come back to the company?

837
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,298
You must have seen it.

838
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,415
I have something to do

839
00:59:20,439 --> 00:59:21,895
So, I closed shop for a bit and came here.

840
00:59:21,919 --> 00:59:23,575
What for?

841
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,098
What did you come for?

842
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:28,098
I received something...

843
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,738
and forgot to return it.

844
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:35,298
Where are you now? Let's meet and talk.

845
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:36,979
Ah-in.

846
00:59:37,759 --> 00:59:39,259
Of?

847
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:43,858
I will be on TV today.

848
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:45,175
What?

849
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:47,295
I'll be on the news tonight.

850
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:48,975
Listen to me, will you?

851
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:51,338
Jeong-seok, what do you mean?

852
00:59:52,399 --> 00:59:55,338
Where are you now? I will be there.

853
00:59:57,559 --> 00:59:59,978
"Slide to turn off."

854
01:00:15,799 --> 01:00:18,818
Thank You. Everything went smoothly thanks to you.

855
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:21,175
Hey, take it easy.

856
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:22,935
Good grief.

857
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:24,575
Hello, CEO Jo.

858
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:26,935
Why is he suddenly so confident?

859
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:28,698
I also do not know.

860
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:31,275
He must have a plan with the Main Chief.

861
01:00:33,399 --> 01:00:35,658
Very surprising to hear.

862
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,115
You mean this happens a lot?

863
01:00:39,279 --> 01:00:41,695
Yes. It also happened...

864
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:44,235
during the presentation for Wuseong Milk today.

865
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,655
We propose that if VC Planning wins,

866
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:49,575
all canteens in VC Group subsidiary companies...

867
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,538
will serve Wuseong Milk.

868
01:00:52,638 --> 01:00:53,814
With that suggestion,

869
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:55,538
we won the deal.

870
01:00:56,279 --> 01:00:59,835
Hard to turn down that deal as an advertiser.

871
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:01,475
That's right.

872
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:06,215
Sales provided by VC Group will meet their advertising targets.

873
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:07,335
You are right.

874
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,115
In this situation,

875
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,515
any idea what will be needed...

876
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:13,575
and what competition might there be?

877
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,815
In that case,

878
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:17,095
I know this will be difficult to answer,

879
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,535
but who in VC Planning...

880
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,235
who is in charge of this plan?

881
01:01:31,919 --> 01:01:33,475
Me.

882
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:37,535
As a production executive,

883
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:39,055
I, Yu Jeong-seok,

884
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:40,695
and head of production, Director Choi Chang-su.

885
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:41,855
"Eksekutif VC Planning, Yu Jeong-seok"

886
01:01:41,879 --> 01:01:44,698
We both work together on this.

887
01:01:45,479 --> 01:01:48,215
It will be more difficult for you to be here.

888
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,395
May I ask why you decided to do it?

889
01:01:51,439 --> 01:01:53,938
Like Director Choi Chang-su and I,

890
01:01:59,279 --> 01:02:01,419
useless in this industry...

891
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,915
must be removed immediately.

892
01:02:08,919 --> 01:02:11,015
Get rid of the useless.

893
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:13,915
Hey! Just wait!

894
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:27,695
Hey.

895
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:29,695
Not like that.

896
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:31,835
I don't know anything about this.

897
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,015
Is this the reason you're keeping secrets from me...

898
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,778
and rejoin the company?

899
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,895
"We cover."

900
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:13,138
"We are temporarily closed."

901
01:03:13,759 --> 01:03:14,735
Director Go.

902
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:17,059
Don't believe everything you see from the outside.

903
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:18,859
Sometimes, to find out...

904
01:03:18,919 --> 01:03:21,555
we have to look at the bait, not the rod.

905
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:25,115
If you use yourself as bait,

906
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:27,695
what is revenge

907
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:29,715
It hurts itself.

908
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:34,875
Why aren't you home yet?

909
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:41,098
There is something strange.

910
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,295
What?

911
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,615
I called and said...

912
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:46,475
VC Constructions has already chosen the model.

913
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:54,135
He reflects on his drunk driving mistakes last year.

914
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:56,578
But using it as a model...

915
01:03:57,399 --> 01:04:00,215
Was VC Constructions calling?

916
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:02,575
I thought this was weird, so I investigated it.

917
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:04,335
Headquarters signed model...

918
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:07,395
then they told VC Constructions.

919
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:17,778
Look at this.

920
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:22,098
You made a mistake at the right time.

921
01:04:28,879 --> 01:04:31,075
I have to start making...

922
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,915
the Prince fell from his horse.

923
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:10,639
Let's move now.

924
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,339
The love triangle?

925
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,335
If Chief Wuwon opposes it, it's all over!

926
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,815
I'll take care of it.

927
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:18,255
Temui boss Jo Yu-na.

928
01:05:18,279 --> 01:05:20,975
and have him say Go Ah-in gave him a gratuity.

929
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:23,095
The person who should leave the company...

930
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,255
to blame.

931
01:05:25,279 --> 01:05:27,098
We have to find out.

932
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:29,615
You've prepared it strategically,

933
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:31,775
So, now is the time to act the crazy woman?

934
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:33,415
Don't look for a way.

935
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,775
If you succeed,

936
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,535
others will call it the right way.

937
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,695
It will be a big blow because the public is against.

938
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:42,435
Public opinion...

939
01:05:44,439 --> 01:05:47,155
Why should someone else define my limits?
